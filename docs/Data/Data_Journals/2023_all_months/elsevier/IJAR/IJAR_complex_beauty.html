  abstract     = {Statisticians are largely focused on developing methods that perform well in a frequentist sense—even the Bayesians . But the widely-publicized replication crisis suggests that these performance guarantees alone are not enough to instill confidence in scientific discoveries. In addition to reliably detecting hypotheses that are (in)compatible with data, investigators require methods that can probe for hypotheses that are actually supported by the data. In this paper, we demonstrate that valid inferential models (IMs) achieve both performance and probativeness properties and we offer a powerful new result that ensures the IM&#39;s probing is reliable. We also compare and contrast the IM&#39;s dual performance and probativeness abilities with that of Deborah Mayo&#39;s severe testing framework.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning researchers and practitioners steadily enlarge the multitude of successful learning models. They achieve this through in-depth theoretical analyses and experiential heuristics. However, there is no known general-purpose procedure for rigorously evaluating whether newly proposed models indeed successfully learn from data. We show that such a procedure cannot exist. For PAC binary classification , uniform and universal online learning, and exact learning through teacher-learner interactions, learnability is in general undecidable, both in the sense of independence of the axioms in a formal system and in the sense of uncomputability. Our proofs proceed via computable constructions that encode the consistency problem for formal systems and the halting problem for Turing machines into whether certain function classes are trivial/finite or highly complex, which we then relate to whether these classes are learnable via established characterizations of learnability through complexity measures. Our work shows that undecidability appears in the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence : There is no one-size-fits-all algorithm for deciding whether a machine learning model can be successful. We cannot in general automatize the process of assessing new learning models.},

  abstract     = {The extended belief rule-based (EBRB) system is shown to have the potential to handle both quantitative and qualitative information under uncertainty, and it has been used as an effective tool for decision support and classification problems. However, despite these advances, several drawbacks have emerged recently, and the most significant one is caused by its similarity measure using Euclidean distance , which could lead to counterintuitive individual matching degrees, while other widely used similarity measures have not been studied for their application in the EBRB system. To this end, seventeen similarity measures are investigated and applied in the EBRB system in this paper, and based on the analysis, an ensemble method for EBRB system with different similarity measures is proposed. Firstly, the problem of the similarity measure of the conventional EBRB system is investigated. Then, a variety of similarity measures are analyzed and their application in the EBRB system is studied. Next, the ensemble method for EBRB systems with different similarity measures is proposed, which consists of two parts, the adaptive weight learning method for determining the weight of each EBRB system with different similarity measures, and the evidential reasoning (ER)-based combination method for combining the inferential results of different methods. Finally, 25 classification datasets are studied to test the performance of EBRB systems with different similarity measures as well as the proposed method, and the results are compared with existing works. The comparison results show that the proposed method could not only achieve better results than any other EBRB systems with different similarity measures, but also outperform other conventional classifiers on some classification datasets, especially small-scale datasets.},

An example of Type 1 statement is “30\% of the elements of a domain share the same property” while an example of Type 2 statement is “the element x has the property y with probability p”. Recently, Type 1 statements were given an interpretation in terms of probabilistic answer set programs under the credal semantics in the PASTA framework. The algorithm proposed for inference requires the enumeration of all the answer sets of a given program, and so it is impractical for domains of not trivial size. The field of lifted inference aims to identify programs where inference can be computed without grounding the program. In this paper, we identify some classes of PASTA programs for which we apply lifted inference and develop compact formulas to compute the probability bounds of a query without the need to generate all the possible answer sets.},

Rough set theory-based feature selection methods have gained popularity due to their ability to handle imprecise and inconsistent data, ease of implementation, and generation of highly interpretable results. However, these methods still suffer from high computational cost when dealing with large-scale datasets with high dimensions . To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a fast attribute reduction method based on inconsistent equivalence classes. The presented method can accelerate those attribute reduction algorithms whose importance measures used can be computed using only inconsistent equivalence classes. Our proposed method improves attribute reduction efficiency through three key aspects: 1) transforming the original dataset into an equivalently simplified version with fewer samples, 2) accelerating the computation of core attributes, and 3) expediting the forward selection process by removing redundant objects and attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the high computational efficiency of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The unfolding transformation has been widely used in many declarative frameworks for improving the efficiency of programs. Inspired by our previous experiences in fuzzy logic languages that do not deal with similarity relations, in this work we try to adapt such operation to the framework of the fuzzy logic programming language FASILL (acronym of “Fuzzy Aggregators and Similarity Into a Logic Language”) which has been developed in our research group for coping with implicit/explicit truth degree annotations, a great variety of connectives and unification by similarity. The traditional unfolding transformation is based on the application of unifiers on the heads and computational steps on the bodies of program rules. However, when considering similarity relations, the premature generation and application of weak (similarity-based) unifiers at unfolding time could destroy the correctness (i.e., the soundness and completeness) of the transformation. In this paper we study how to avoid the risk, by imposing some conditions on programs in order to be safely unfolded. We show that these conditions are sufficient to guarantee the correctness of the unfolding transformation, and we present some experiments performed with the implemented online tool for illustrating the improved efficiency of unfolded programs.},

The question what we precisely mean by information will depend on the particular context in which they are being used. Our analysis does not express any preferences here. However, if AFs are applied to fields like criminal justice, finance, and healthcare, where it is necessary to exercise caution, skeptical accepted arguments may be the most appropriate form of reasoning. The presented overview considers classical Dung semantics including the stable, admissible, complete, grounded and preferred one. The article is divided into two main axes: the distinction between extension-based and kernel-based orderings and the analysis of their static and dynamic versions. The results show that there are various relationships between these concepts, indicating that some orderings are stronger or weaker than others. The considered orderings are so-called preorders, i.e. they satisfy reflexivity and transitivity . We analyzed them w.r.t. bounds, meets and joins and also considered the induced equivalences. The latter often coincide with well-known equivalences, namely ordinary and strong equivalence.},

  abstract     = {In the context of multicriteria decision analysis , Pairwise Comparison Matrices (PCMs) represent a widely-used mathematical structure to capture comparisons about criteria or alternatives. When a confidence (or uncertainty) level is associated to the provided comparison measures, PCMs are naturally extended to the so-called Interval Pairwise Comparison Matrices (IPCM). Classical approaches, based on the eigenvector associated to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix (Analytic Hierarchy Process) or optimization problems (e.g. the Logarithmic Least Squares approach), are frequently adopted in order to estimate absolute utilities from relative judgements in absence of expert&#39;s uncertainty. Conversely, in the presence of uncertain measures, computationally intensive approaches based on Monte Carlo analysis have been adopted. In this paper, starting from a given PCM, we provide an approach able to find the smallest multiplicative perturbations of its elements able to perturb the obtained ranking from the ordinal perspective. On the basis of such approach, we provide theoretical results which can be adopted also in the case of uncertain measures (e.g., IPCMs) with the aim to characterize the stability of the obtained ranking on the basis of the given uncertainty. As testified by numerical examples that conclude the paper, the proposed framework can greatly simplify the classical approaches by providing the possibility to make direct assumptions on the final outcome of Monte Carlo analysis and reducing or avoiding its required computational effort.},

  abstract     = {The logical depiction of the concept of action forms a unique method of grasping its semantic content. It finds its reflection in different proposals of epistemic and deontic-logic systems describing actions as the operational behaviour of an agent as a game played over a given game tree. This perspective establishes some unique connection between actions and the agent&#39;s preferences. One of the logical-game-theoretic approaches to their modelling has been elaborated in van Benthem&#39;s school in the common area of game-theory, epistemic and fixed-point logic. In reference to some ideas of van Benthem&#39;s school – the article aims to propose a new (almost) fuzzy logic system AFLAP for actions and preferences describing a game-theoretic behaviour of an agent over a given game tree. Nevertheless, the backward induction strategy is idealised and exchanged for the Church-Rosser property, and a piece of fuzziness is introduced to the system by considering two unique ‘epsilon’ relations, M o v e Move and BI , with their approximation sequences. An abstract model in the form of the so-called quasi-model is proposed for such a system. It forms a multi-level (potentially infinite) construction built due to the pattern recently elaborated and enhanced by Wolter-Kurucz&#39;s school. This construction is exploited in the article as a convenient basis for proving the decidability of AFLAP by showing its ‘abstract’ finite model property . This task is performed by constructing an additional workable quasi-model of the size dependent on the size of the set of subformulae of a given formula of AFLAP. Finally, some R-programming-oriented applications of the earlier theoretic considerations are presented.},

  abstract     = {The aggregation of multiple rankings into a consensus ranking is a crucial task in various domains such as search engine results or user-based ratings. This task poses significant challenges due to its inherent complexity. The complexity of the problem stems not only from the need for exactness and efficiency, but also from the diversity of real-world scenarios, which often involve incomplete rankings and ties. Most existing methods propose a specific way to aggregate rankings. However, these methods often do not take into account different real use-case scenarios which can impact the relevance of their final result, as the congruence between the aggregated output and the expected outcome inherently depends on the context. To address the issue of context-dependency in ranking aggregation, we introduce a unifying framework that subsumes a variety of generalizations of the Kemeny score for incomplete rankings with ties and enables the design of new ones if a specific context requires it. Our framework is parameterized, allowing for different behaviors depending on the specific use case. We provide a broader scope of application to the methods encompassed by our approach, augmenting them with a larger theoretical and algorithmic structure. We establish an axiomatic study to better understand each method within our framework and present an algorithmic approach that includes exact methods, partitioning algorithms, and heuristics. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach through an empirical study on both real and synthetic datasets . Notably, the synthetic datasets are generated based on devised real-world scenarios, highlighting the context-dependent applicability of different Kemeny-based rank aggregation methods within our framework.},

  abstract     = {Three-way decision is about thinking, problem-solving, and computing in threes or through triads. Its philosophy and practice of triadic thinking appear everywhere. In particular, there are a number of three-world or triworld models in different fields and disciplines, where a complex system, a complicated issue, or an intricate concept is explained and understood in terms of three interrelated worlds, with each world enclosing a group of elements or representing a particular view. This paper examines various triadic metaphors and structures in general and three-world metaphors and conceptions in particular for building and explaining basic concepts of three-way decision. The three major objectives are (a) to formulate a TAO (Triading-Acting-Optimizing) framework of three-way decision, (b) to discuss the Dao, the Way of three-way decision, and (c) to articulate the Dao, the Way of three-world thinking. Three-world conceptions offer more insights into three-way decision with new viewpoints, methods, and modes. An emphasis of the paper is on the philosophy and the power of three-way decision for building high-level conceptual models. By using three-part structures, by focusing on only three things, or by considering three basic ingredients, we may build a theory, a model, or a method that is simple-to-understand, easy-to-remember, and practical-to-use.},

  abstract     = {The behaviour of statistical relational representations across differently sized domains has become a focal area of research from both a modelling and a complexity viewpoint. Recently, projectivity of a family of distributions emerged as a key property, ensuring that marginal probabilities are independent of the domain size. However, the formalisation used currently assumes that the domain is characterised only by its size. This contribution extends the notion of projectivity from families of distributions indexed by domain size to functors taking extensional data from a database. This makes projectivity available for the large range of applications taking structured input. We transfer key known results on projective families of distributions to the new setting. This includes a characterisation of projective fragments in different statistical relational formalisms as well as a general representation theorem for projective families of distributions. Furthermore, we prove a correspondence between projectivity and distributions on countably infinite domains, which we use to unify and generalise earlier work on statistical relational representations in infinite domains. Finally, we use the extended notion of projectivity to define a further strengthening, which we call σ -projectivity, and which allows the use of the same representation in different modes while retaining projectivity.},

  abstract     = {Calibration inductive logics are based on accepting estimates of relative frequencies, which are used to generate imprecise probabilities . In turn, these imprecise probabilities are intended to guide beliefs and decisions — a process called “calibration”. Two prominent examples are Henry E. Kyburg&#39;s system of Evidential Probability and Jon Williamson&#39;s version of Objective Bayesianism . There are many unexplored questions about these logics. How well do they perform in the short-run? Under what circumstances do they do better or worse? What is their performance relative to traditional Bayesianism? In this article, we develop an agent-based model of a classic binomial decision problem, including players based on variations of Evidential Probability and Objective Bayesianism. We compare the performances of these players, including against a benchmark player who uses standard Bayesian inductive logic. We find that the calibrated players can match the performance of the Bayesian player, but only with particular acceptance thresholds and decision rules. Among other points, our discussion raises some challenges for characterising “cautious” reasoning using imprecise probabilities. Thus, we demonstrate a new way of systematically comparing imprecise probability systems, and we conclude that calibration inductive logics are surprisingly promising for making decisions.},

In particular, when sojourn time in hidden states is not geometrical, hidden semi-Markov chains (HSMCs) may work better. Besides, hidden evidential Markov chains (HEMCs) showed its interest in non-stationary situations. In this paper, we propose a new model simultaneously extending HSMCs and HEMCs. Based on triplet Markov chains (TMCs), it is used in an unsupervised framework, parameters being estimated with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

This enables us to use the causal expectation-maximisation scheme to approximate the bounds for partially identifiable counterfactual queries, which are the focus of this paper. We then show how the same approach can address the general case of multiple datasets, no matter whether interventional or observational, biased or unbiased, by remapping it into the former one via graphical transformations. Systematic numerical experiments and a case study on palliative care show the effectiveness of our approach, while hinting at the benefits of fusing heterogeneous data sources to get informative outcomes in case of partial identifiability .},

In the continuous case where the probability rules are defined on Riemannian manifolds we obtain sufficient conditions for convexity of the corresponding variational problem . It can be shown that in the presence of symmetry the convexity can provide the preservation of mode. We then consider factorization into a mixed continuous-discrete case. By rescaling the Riemannian structure of the continuous component we have derived sufficient conditions under which the convexity of Kullback-Leibler functional is established. We apply the latter theorem to Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and we introduce a new class of these models which have the advantage of being convex. It is shown that the MAP for the corrected GMM remains a consistent estimator . Additionally thanks to convexity we are able to prove the mode of MFVI for the new model in asymptotic regimes converges to the right solution.

While some have argued that Bayesian conditionals are the correct way to think about such rules, there are challenges with standard inferences such as modus ponens and modus tollens that might make probabilistic material implication a better candidate at times for rule-based systems employing forward-chaining; and arguably material implication is still suitable when information about prior or conditional probabilities is not available at all. We investigate a generalization of probabilistic material implication and Bayesian conditionals that combines the advantages of both formalisms in a systematic way and prove basic properties of the generalized implication, in particular, various bounds as well as properties of inference chains in graphs.

  abstract     = {Neural networks and in general subsymbolic learning approaches perform well on usual learning tasks, but they are black boxes lacking desired properties such as explainability or trustworthiness. Fully integrated symbolic/subsymbolic systems account for these properties, e.g., through the injection of symbolic information into a subsymbolic learning framework. Systems relying on embeddings can be considered as specific examples of such systems where facts, expressed in some logic, are embedded into a continuous space. Instances mentioned in the facts are mapped to points and the relations/concepts mentioned in the facts are mapped to a region in that space. This allows to exploit geometric regularities in order to tackle typical learning tasks such as link prediction. Embeddings provide the first step towards filling the gap between qualitative, Tarskian style semantics, which is used for deductive reasoning over the facts, and quantitative structures , which are used for representing objects, relations, and concepts for learning purposes. However, to enable meaningful reasoning, embeddings of relations and concepts are not allowed to be shaped arbitrarily. Especially, convex sets turned out to be appropriate due to their computational advantages and due to their foundation in cognition. Convexity can be defined with a ternary betweenness relation and concepts can be defined as betweenness-closed (= convex) sets. Though many interesting phenomena of cognitive reasoning can be explained in such a framework, it is at least not obvious how to use betweenness for other, more logico-formal aspects of reasoning that, e.g., require defining logical operators. In particular, for the logical operator of negation other mathematical structures such as the orthoframes of Goldblatt (1974) [13] have proven more useful. In this paper, we provide results on the connection between convexity and orthoframes. In particular, we investigate the construction of convex concepts equipped with an orthogonality relation. We give a universal construction of a betweenness relation over an orthoframe and show that based on Euclidean betweenness (thus using the classical notion of convexity) and under some natural restrictions, convex cones are the only structures capable of modeling such a space.},

Our proposal is based on the interpretation of soft clustering as describing uncertain information, represented in the form of a mass function, about an unknown, target hard clustering . We present a general construction to this purpose, called distributional measures , whereby any evaluation measure can be naturally extended to soft clustering. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed approach, both in terms of computational complexity and metric properties. Furthermore, we study its relationship with other existing proposals providing, in particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence between distributional measures and the recently proposed framework of transport-theoretic measures . We also propose sampling-based approximation algorithms with convergence guarantees, making it possible to apply the proposed method to real-world datasets. Finally, we apply the distributional measures in a computational experiment in order to illustrate their usefulness.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with belief base revision, a form of belief change which consists in restoring consistency with the intention of incorporating a new piece of information from the environment, while minimally modifying the agent&#39;s belief state represented by a finite set of propositional formulas . In an effort to guarantee more reliability and rationality for real applications while performing revision, we come up with the idea of credible belief base revision. We define two new formula-based revision operators using tools offered by evidence theory . These operators, uniformly presented in the same spirit as [92] , [13] , stem from consistent sub-bases maximal with respect to credibility instead of set inclusion or cardinality. Logical properties and productivity of inference from these operators are established, along with complexity results.},

  abstract     = {Modal logics have proved useful for many reasoning tasks in symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), such as belief revision, spatial reasoning, among others. On the other hand, mathematical morphology (MM) is a theory for non-linear analysis of structures, that was widely developed and applied in image analysis. Its mathematical bases rely on algebra, complete lattices , topology. Strong links have been established between MM and mathematical logics , mostly modal logics. In this paper, we propose to further develop and generalize this link between mathematical morphology and modal logic from a topos perspective, i.e. categorial structures generalizing space, and connecting logics, sets and topology. Furthermore, we rely on the internal language and logic of a topos. We define structuring elements, dilations and erosions as morphisms . Then we introduce the notion of structuring neighborhoods, and show that the dilations and erosions based on them lead to a constructive modal logic, for which a sound and complete proof system is proposed. We then show that the modal logic thus defined (called morpho-logic here), is well adapted to define concrete and efficient operators for revision, merging, and abduction of new knowledge, or even spatial reasoning.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel representative of the existing family of ordered weighted aggregation (OWA) operators with constant orness (optimism/pessimism level). In other words, orness value of weight vectors generated using the proposed operator is independent of the total number of arguments. The proposed OWA operator is the operator that is based on the beta function . Two different types of operators have been proposed with respect to the level of optimism (“or-like”) and pessimism (“and-like”) each. In addition to that the proposed operators discussed here are bi-parametric and real-valued in nature in terms of their parameters. Hence, for a given orness value (optimism or pessimism), it provides an infinite number of weight vectors as the proposed operator&#39;s orness depends on the value of one of its parameters. These properties lead to lots of flexibility for the Decision-Maker (DM). Its comparison and advantages over other existing members of the OWA family with constant orness such as S-OWA operators have been elaborated. Also, the maximum Rényi entropy of the OWA (MRE-OWA) operator and the maximum Rényi entropy of the proposed OWA operator are compared and evaluated for a specified orness level. Several other important properties and applications of the family of the proposed operators have also been analyzed in detail.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach for the automatic treatment of linguistic vagueness. Our motivation is the feeling that most existing approaches dealing with linguistic information are based on converting vague meaning into crisp meaning using some conversions to precise measurements. As a result, existing approaches are adequate and easy to implement, but do not closely model the human thought process. To help alleviate this deficiency, we propose the use of linguistic relations to provide a natural language interface to an end user. We show a possible linguistic Prolog model based on an extension of the syntactic unification algorithm using synonymy and antonymy, as well as the extension of the resolution principle. Our approach does not aim to provide a well-founded formal semantics for such a linguistic Prolog, but a simple model supported by two experiments focused on the use of vague language, both of them executed in Spanish (an analysis of the data of the first experiment it is also available in that language at [1] ). Thus, the purpose of this paper is to contribute to the mechanization of approximate reasoning by being respectful of the semantics of the vague terms involved in it; i.e., by paying attention to how they are evaluated by linguistic users under experimentation.},

In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced Abstract Argumentation Frameworks with Domain Assignments (AAFDs), which extend Abstract Argumentation Frameworks (AAFs) by assigning to each argument a domain of application, i.e., a set of entities for which the argument is believed to apply. We provided formal definitions of AAFDs and their semantics, showed with examples how this model can support various features of commonsense and non-monotonic reasoning, and studied its relation to AAFs. In this paper, aiming to provide a deeper insight into this new model, we present more results on the relation between AAFDs and AAFs and the properties of the AAFD semantics, and we introduce an alternative, more expressive way to define the domains of arguments using logical predicates. We also offer an implementation of AAFDs based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) and evaluate it using a range of experiments with synthetic datasets .},

We prove that the log-likelihood function of a Noisy-OR model has a unique maximum and adapt the EM-learning method for the leaky Noisy-OR model. We propose a structure learning algorithm that learns optimal Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks. We evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic data, where it performs substantially better than standard Bayesian networks. We perform experiments with Bipartite Noisy-OR Bayesian networks of different complexity to find out when the results of Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks are significantly better than the results of standard Bayesian networks and when they perform similarly. We also study how different penalties based on the number of model parameters affect the quality of the results. Finally, we apply the suggested approach to a problem from the domain of linguistics.

There have been already a huge number of literature on theory and applications on such topics. Most researches on formal concept analysis focus, independently, on specific scenarios such as Boolean formal contexts and fuzzy formal contexts. In this paper, a unified framework for three-way concept analysis is built in lattice-valued formal contexts. The notions of positive concept and negative concept are given in a lattice-valued formal context based on an overlapping function, one of significant operators for information fusion. Two pairs of object induced adjunctive three-way concept operators and attribute induced adjunctive three-way concept operators are introduced. Their properties have been fully investigated. With those operators, the algebraic structures of adjunctive three-way concepts, their extensions and intensions have been explored. Specifically, the local structure within pairs of sub-concept and sup-concept has been finely characterized. The derived results provide ones a way to construct the complete lattice of a lattice-valued formal context or its sublattice by determining all pairs of sub-concept and sup-concept provided that an object fuzzy set or an attribute fuzzy set is given. A case analysis on a real world dataset from UCI repository is presented to verify the rationality and significance of obtained results.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a methodology for developing deterioration models to estimate the remaining lifetime of a system using physics-informed learning. The approach consists of combining physical knowledge about the system with a set of data obtained from similar systems that have failed in the past to build a set of constraints on the evolution over time of the state of health of the system. The data consists of partial measurements of the system variables, taken from its commissioning to the present. The physical knowledge used comprises a set of differential equations that approximate the dynamics and aging of the system. In contrast to other studies, the physical model is not assumed to be accurate, but is considered to be an approximation of reality. Constraints on the temporal evolution of the state of health derived from this physical knowledge take into account its imprecision and consist of possibility distributions. In this study, the max-max, max-min and min-max regret principles are applied to extract the time evolution of the deterioration rate that best fits the constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by means of a comparative empirical analysis in different use cases, and the situations in which informed learning improves on purely data-driven algorithms are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {We investigate a general optimization problem with a linear objective in which the coefficients are uncertain and the uncertainty is represented by a belief function. We consider five common criteria to compare solutions in this setting: generalized Hurwicz, strong dominance, weak dominance, maximality and E-admissibility. We provide characterizations for the non-dominated solutions with respect to these criteria when the focal sets of the belief function are Cartesian products of compact sets. These characterizations correspond to established concepts in optimization. They make it possible to find non-dominated solutions by solving known variants of the deterministic version of the optimization problem or even, in some cases, simply by solving the deterministic version.},

  abstract     = {The aim of the paper is to model ambiguity in a randomized reinsurance stop-loss treaty. For this, we consider the lower envelope of the set of bivariate joint probability distributions having a precise discrete marginal and an ambiguous Bernoulli marginal. Under an independence assumption, since the lower envelope fails 2-monotonicity, inner/outer Dempster-Shafer approximations are considered, so as to select the optimal retention level by maximizing the lower expected insurer&#39;s annual profit under reinsurance. We show that the inner approximation is not suitable in the reinsurance problem, while the outer approximation preserves the given marginal information, weakens the independence assumption, and does not introduce spurious information in the retention level selection problem. Finally, we provide a characterization of the optimal retention level.},

For probabilistic independence a set of well known qualitative rules exists, the so-called semi-graphoid rules, which can be summarized into a single semi-graphoid rule. This rule system was conjectured to be complete, it is however incomplete and an additional five rules were formulated. The generalization of one of those rules subsequently showed that no finite rule system exists and in recent work even all five additional rules were (further) generalized. In this paper, two new generalized rules are stated, both involving n , n ≥ 1 n≥1 variable sets C i Ci . These rules generalize the semi-graphoid rule for n is odd and generalize one of the additional rules for n is even. Furthermore two new rules of probabilistic independence are given. The paper thereby contributes to the insights into the structural properties of probabilistic independence and provides an enhanced description of probabilistic independence by means of rules.},

This paper provides an algorithm for computing the d-entropy of directed graphical D-S belief function models. We illustrate the algorithm using Almond&#39;s Captain&#39;s Problem example. For belief function undirected graphical models , assuming that the set of belief functions in the model is non-informative, the belief functions are distinct. We illustrate this using Haenni-Lehmann&#39;s Communication Network problem. As the joint belief function for this model is quasi-consonant, it follows from a property of d-entropy that the d-entropy of this model is zero, and no algorithm is required. For a class of undirected graphical models, we provide an algorithm for computing the d-entropy of such models. Finally, the d-entropy coincides with Shannon&#39;s entropy for the probability mass function of a single random variable and for a large multi-dimensional probability distribution expressed as a directed acyclic graph model called a Bayesian network .

The optimal scale combines coarser condition attributes with the finer decision attribute, so as to achieve a balance between efficiency and accuracy. With the aim of selecting the optimal scale combination, we firstly explore some related properties and theorems of generalized multi-scale decision tables. Then we define the optimal scale in generalized multi-scale decision tables and propose two algorithms for optimal scale selection. In addition, a knowledge acquisition algorithm and a multi-scale rough set classifier framework are proposed.

Data interlinking is the task of discovering identity links between individuals across datasets. Link keys are constructions based on pairs of properties and classes that can be considered as rules allowing to infer identity links between subjects in two RDF datasets. Here we investigate how FCA –Formal Concept Analysis– and its extensions are well adapted to investigate and to support the discovery of link keys. Indeed plain FCA allows to discover the so-called link key candidates, while a specific pattern structure allows to associate a pair of classes with every candidate. Different link key candidates can generate sets of identity links between individuals that can be considered as equal when they are regarded as partitions of the identity relation and thus involving a kind of redundancy. In this paper, such a redundancy is deeply studied thanks to partition pattern structures. In particular, experiments are proposed where it is shown that redundancy of link key candidates while not significant when based on identity of partitions appears to be much more significant when based on similarity.},

Indeed with data that cannot be trusted to the same extent, users should at least be aware on the trust they can have in the obtained reasoning.

L-grades are a special case of Zadeh&#39;s Z-numbers, consisting of a pair ( s , c ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] 2 (s,c)∈[0,1]2 in which s is a suitability grade (or satisfaction grade) and c is a confidence grade denoting how confident we can be on s . Both grades are further processed using fuzzy logic. A novel negation operator and novel conjunction and disjunction operators satisfying commutativity , associativity, but not distributivity properties are proposed. Furthermore, so-called sibling aggregators for L-grades are introduced and studied. With this framework we aim to contribute to explainable computational intelligence. The practical applicability of L-grades is discussed based on the demand for more informative, explainable results in the TILES decision support system for sand extraction from the North Sea seabed.},

  abstract     = {Learning the graphical structure of Bayesian networks is key to describing data-generating mechanisms in many complex applications but poses considerable computational challenges. Observational data can only identify the equivalence class of the directed acyclic graph underlying a Bayesian network model, and a variety of methods exist to tackle the problem. Under certain assumptions, the popular PC algorithm can consistently recover the correct equivalence class by reverse-engineering the conditional independence (CI) relationships holding in the variable distribution. The dual PC algorithm is a novel scheme to carry out the CI tests within the PC algorithm by leveraging the inverse relationship between covariance and precision matrices. By exploiting block matrix inversions we can also perform tests on partial correlations of complementary (or dual) conditioning sets. The multiple CI tests of the dual PC algorithm proceed by first considering marginal and full-order CI relationships and progressively moving to central-order ones. Simulation studies show that the dual PC algorithm outperforms the classic PC algorithm both in terms of run time and in recovering the underlying network structure, even in the presence of deviations from Gaussianity . Additionally, we show that the dual PC algorithm applies for Gaussian copula models, and demonstrate its performance in that setting.},

  abstract     = {In the framework of rough sets, incremental algorithms can effectively reduce repetitive computations for dynamic datasets by discovering the update principles of relevant knowledge. Considering the variations in attribute sets, incremental methods based on neighborhood granulation provide fast updates to attribute reduction in continuous-valued information systems. However, most of these methods assume that the sample distribution and neighborhood radius remain fixed with changes in the attribute set, which may mislead the granulation process and affect the model&#39;s classification ability. In this paper, a new incremental reduction method based on granular balls and attribute grouping is proposed for dynamic information systems with multiple attribute additions. Different neighborhood radii are adaptively determined when the attribute set changes, and the number of neighborhood granules can also be effectively reduced. Furthermore, the attributes are grouped based on the k-means algorithm, and only attributes from different groups or with small relevance to those in the current reduction set are considered to be incorporated as a reduction attribute, thus reducing the computation time and simultaneously preserving informative attributes. Linear and nonlinear correlation coefficients are used to measure attribute relevance based on which three corresponding incremental reduction algorithms are developed. Finally, extensive experimental results on 12 benchmark datasets are shown to compare the proposed method with non-incremental and typical incremental methods in terms of time cost, classification accuracy , the size of attribute reduction, and coverage of the reduction.},

  abstract     = {In crowdsourcing learning, a certain degree of label noise still exists in the integrated labels, which are obtained by label integration algorithms . In order to decrease the impact of label noise, many scholars focus on noise correction algorithms . Existing noise correction algorithms usually divide a data set with integrated labels into a clean set and a noise set, directly. However, there are certain noise instances in the clean set and clean instances in the noise set. To reduce the interference from noise instances and improve the utilization of clean instances, inspired by the three-way decision theory, we propose a three-way decision-based noise correction (TDNC) algorithm. Firstly, we calculate the compactness of each instance&#39;s multiple noisy label set and estimate the label certainty of each instance&#39;s integrated label. Secondly, we divide a data set with integrated labels into three disjoint sets , called positive set, boundary set and negative set , respectively. Thirdly, we further divide and add the instances in the boundary set into the positive set and the negative set according to the nearest neighbor classification . Finally, we train two heterogeneous classifiers on the new positive set to correct the noise instances in the new negative set using a consensus voting strategy . The experimental results on 34 simulated and two real-world data sets consistently show that TDNC significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms in terms of the noise ratio.},

Such a sub-class differentiates from the larger class of T -conditional possibilities in terms of non-closure with respect to pointwise limits , non-connectedness of extension sets, and Kolmogorov-like representation. We then switch to coherence for a partial assessment in both frameworks, highlighting that, under T -DP-conditioning, coherence of the global assessment cannot be characterized in terms of coherence on every finite sub-family.

However, existing unsupervised outlier detection methods suffer from irrelevant and redundant attributes in high-dimensional data, and their performance is also limited by their outlier detection models that rely on only one view. In this study, we propose a three-way decision-based co-detection model for unsupervised outlier detection. Specifically, we first improve the local outlier factor (LOF) method by introducing the Gaussian kernel function to make the measure of local reachability density more accurate. Then, we introduce fuzzy rough sets to perform attribute reduction , which further reduces the negative effect of irrelevant and redundant attributes on the measure of sample similarity. Finally, we develop a co-detection model that is trained on the original view and the transformed view generated by principal component analysis and uses the strategy of the three-way decision to collaboratively detect outliers . The results of comparative experiments on the selected UCI datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC-ROC index.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian networks (BNs) can be used for probabilistic reasoning over discrete variables. Their extension to the continuous domain, however, remains an open research issue. In this work, we address the Bayesian inference problem for continuous variables when negative evidence is available. This situation is faced when, because of unreliable or imperfect sensors, some variables are observed to be at specific intervals. We propose two solutions to this issue. The first one, dubbed dynamic discrete BN (DD-BN), is simply an adaptation of the dynamic discretization method; the second, referred to as SICA, is based on spline functions and the independent component analysis (ICA) method. SICA can represent a wide range of general multivariate distributions and possesses some integration characteristics that facilitate the inference process. Empirical trials on public datasets and simulated data yielded promising results regarding inference time and accuracy. Indeed, SICA achieved the highest accuracy at the expense of increased inference time with increasing dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Interval Type-2 Fuzzy K-means (IT2FKM) is an efficient clustering algorithm , which mainly focuses on further describes the uncertainty of the data sets by introducing interval type-2 fuzzy membership function . Since the estimation center obtained by two membership functions is an interval type-1 fuzzy set, it is necessary to use the defuzzification method to obtain a crisp cluster center. The existing IT2FKM algorithms adopt the generalized centroid method (GC) in the process of type-reduction and defuzzification for iterative clustering center. But unfortunately, this method simply uses a single numerical value 0.5 as the type-reduction coefficient to balance and synthesize for the left value and the right value of an interval cluster center, while ignoring the distribution of the clusters. This defect makes IT2FKM fail to update the optimal cluster center when facing with imbalanced clusters, which affect the accuracy in some cases. To address this failing, in this paper, some adverse effects caused by generalized centroid method when facing with imbalanced clusters are analyzed in detail. Thereafter, an improved type-reduction method of iterative cluster centers for IT2FKM clustering is proposed considering the imbalanced clustering distributions. On the basis of which, an enhanced IT2FKM algorithm is further developed. The enhanced IT2FKM algorithm has an average classification accuracy of 97.5\% when faced with four datasets with different degrees imbalance, which is about 3.25\% higher than other clustering algorithms. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are further demonstrated by some experimental analysis of UCI standard datasets.},

  abstract     = {How do you make inferences from a Bayesian network (BN) model with missing information? For example, we may not have priors for some variables or may not have conditionals for some states of the parent variables. It is well-known that the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief function theory is a generalization of probability theory . So, a solution is to embed an incomplete BN model in a D-S belief function model, omit the missing data, and then make inferences from the belief function model. We will demonstrate this using an implementation of a local computation algorithm for D-S belief function models called the “Belief function machine.” One advantage of this approach is that we get interval estimates of the probabilities of interest. Using Laplacian (equally likely) or maximum entropy priors or conditionals for missing data in a BN may lead to point estimates for the probabilities of interest, masking the uncertainty in these estimates. Bayesian reasoning cannot reason from an incomplete model. A Bayesian sensitivity analysis of the missing parameters is not a substitute for a belief-function analysis.},

  abstract     = {In fields such as pattern recognition and computational intelligence, attribute subset selection has gradually attracted the attention of researchers as a challenging issue, particularly in big data. In rough sets community, many of the selection methods until now have been proposed based on one-directional and non-adaptive rough approximation sets, which increase the uncertainty of granular computing . Based on a series of bi-directional adaptive neighborhood rough sets models, a novel attribute subset selection method is proposed in this paper. In contrast to classical one-directional k -nearest neighborhood relations , the proposed model not only allocates different numbers of neighbors to each sample, but also takes the support information of the neighbors into account in the construction of information granularity . On the basis of set operators, two specific bi-directional neighborhood relations as well as optimistic and pessimistic rough set models are discussed in detail. Several propositions and uncertainty measures not only show the relationship between the traditional and the proposed models, but also present the intrinsic connection of three discussed models. In addition, we propose an optimal neighbor selection scheme, in which justifiable granularity is fused with evidence theory to obtain an optimal k value for each sample. Finally, in the attribute selection process, we prove non-monotonic property of the neighborhood entropy and describe an upgraded forward greedy algorithm . The proposed algorithm is compared with existing algorithms using a ten-fold cross-validation method on several UCI datasets. The experimental results show the advantages of our models in terms of computational performance and classification accuracy , respectively.},

  abstract     = {The belief rule-based (BRB) system has been one of the most significant rule-based systems for its ability to deal with various kinds of information under uncertainty, and it has shown great potential for classification problems. However, the combinatorial explosion problem hugely limits the application of the BRB system as excessive rules could not only increase the computation cost, but also impact the performance of the BRB system. Therefore, motivated by this problem, this paper proposed a fast and accurate belief rule base generation and reduction method. Firstly, a fast belief rule base generation method is introduced, where similar rules are grouped and combined to ensure all the possible situations are covered without generating excessive rules. Then, a redundancy-based belief rule base reduction method is proposed, where the redundancy degree of the belief rule that represents the degree to which a belief rule is affected by other rules is introduced, and it is calculated to identify redundant rules. Furthermore, the conventional evidential reasoning (ER)-based inference process is retained from conventional BRB systems. Thirty classification benchmarks from the well-known UCI machine learning repository are tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results are compared with other rule-based systems, improved BRB systems, and other machine learning methods. Comparison results show that the proposed method could effectively reduce the size of the BRB without costing its accuracy. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and robustness analysis are conducted, which further show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The label ranking problem consists in learning preference models from training datasets labeled with ( possibly incomplete ) rankings of the class labels . The goal is then to predict a ranking for a given unlabeled instance. This work focuses on a more general interpretation where both the training dataset and the prediction given as output allow tied class labels, i.e., there is no particular preference between them. This problem is known as the partial label ranking problem . This paper tackles the partial label ranking problem by transforming the ranking with ties into a set of discrete variables representing the preference relations ( ranked ahead , tied with , and ranked behind ) between each pair of class labels. The posterior probabilities for each pair are then used to fill the values of a preference matrix . This preference matrix is the basis for solving the rank aggregation problem required to obtain the output ranking with ties. This paper aims to exploit the resemblance of this problem with multi-label and multi-dimensional classification by studying the use of Bayesian network classifiers to compute the posterior probabilities for the new class structure, i.e., pairs of class labels. In particular, binary relevance with naive Bayes and averaged one-dependence estimators between the new class structure are used to solve the partial label ranking problem. Furthermore, bivariate relationships between all the pairs of class labels are considered. However, the complexity of the model grows significantly, which makes it necessary to reduce the number of allowed bivariate relationships between pairs. Thus, a feature selection method is included to select the more relevant subset of bivariate relationships. The experimental evaluation shows that our proposals are competitive in accuracy with the current instance-based and decision tree induction algorithms. Moreover, they outperform the existing mixture-based probabilistic graphical models , while the algorithms proposed are much faster.},

However, many existing attribute reduction algorithms do not consider the information provided by the upper approximation . In fact, the upper approximation contains some certain decision information and decision risks brought by uncertain information. Therefore, we propose an attribute reduction algorithm based on fusion information entropy (FIE) to make proper use of the upper approximation. Firstly, we define the concepts of kernel decision degree and general decision degree, and flexibly combine them using the precision decision index. This method overcomes the limitations of existing attribute reduction methods in considering the upper approximation information. Then, we introduce the concept of fusion information entropy and measure the importance of attribute subsets by analyzing the changes in fusion information entropy. Finally, we design the corresponding attribute reduction algorithm. Extensive comparative experiments on public datasets show that the FIE algorithm based on fusion information entropy achieves higher classification accuracy while retaining fewer attributes compared with other state-of-the-art reduction algorithms. These results confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the FIE method proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Graph databases are becoming widely successful as data models that allow to effectively represent and process complex relationships among various types of data. Data-graphs are particular types of graph databases whose representation allows both data values in the paths and in the nodes to be treated as first class citizens by the query language . As with any other type of data repository, data-graphs may suffer from errors and discrepancies with respect to the real-world data they intend to represent. In this work, we explore the notion of probabilistic unclean data-graphs , in order to capture the idea that the observed (unclean) data-graph is actually the noisy version of a clean one that correctly models the world but that we know only partially. As the factors that lead to such a state of affairs may be many, e.g., all different types of clerical errors or unintended transformations of the data, and depend heavily on the application domain, we assume an epistemic probabilistic model that describes the distribution over all possible ways in which the clean (uncertain) data-graph could have been polluted. Based on this model we define two computational problems: data cleaning and probabilistic query answering and study for both of them their corresponding complexity when considering that the polluting transformation of the data-graph can be caused by either removing (subset), adding (superset), or modifying (update) nodes and edges. For data cleaning, we explore restricted versions when the transformation only involves updating data-values on the nodes. Finally, we look at some implications of incorporating hard and soft constraints to our framework.},

  abstract     = {The field of XAI aims at providing explanations about the behavior of AI methods to a user. In particular, local post-hoc interpretability approaches aim at generating explanations for a particular prediction of a trained machine learning model. It is generally recognized that such explanations should be adapted to each user: integrating user knowledge and taking into account the user specificity allows to provide personalized explanations and to improve the explanation understandability . Yet these elements appear to be rarely taken into account, and only in specific configurations. In this paper, we propose a general framework to allow this integration of user knowledge in post-hoc interpretability methods, relying on the addition of a compatibility term in the cost function. We instantiate the proposed formalization in two scenarios, varying in the explanation form they propose, in the case where the available user knowledge provides information about the data features . As a result, two new explainability methods are proposed, respectively named Knowledge Integration in Counterfactual Explanation (KICE) and Knowledge Integration in Surrogate Model (KISM). These methods are experimentally studied on several benchmark data sets to characterize the explanations they generate as compared to reference methods.},

As it gradually gained popularity, this theory is subject to further developments for practically challenging problems. This paper considers the many-normal-means problem with the means constrained to be in the neighborhood of each other, formally represented by a Hölder space. A new method, called partial conditioning, is proposed to generate valid and efficient marginal inference about the individual means. It is shown that the method outperforms both a fiducial-counterpart in terms of validity and a conservative-counterpart in terms of efficiency.

  abstract     = {Learning the structure of continuous-time Bayesian networks directly from data has traditionally been performed using score-based structure learning algorithms. Only recently has a constraint-based method been proposed, proving to be more suitable under specific settings, as in modelling systems with variables having more than two states. As a result, studying diverse structure learning algorithms is essential to learn the most appropriate models according to data characteristics and task-related priorities, such as learning speed or accuracy. This article proposes alternative algorithms for learning multidimensional continuous-time Bayesian network classifiers, introducing, for the first time, constraint-based and hybrid algorithms for these models. Nevertheless, these contributions also apply to the simpler one-dimensional classification problem for which only score-based solutions exist in the literature. More specifically, the aforementioned constraint-based structure learning algorithm is first adapted to the supervised classification setting. Then, a novel algorithm of this kind, specifically tailored for the multidimensional classification problem, is presented to improve the learning times for the induction of multidimensional classifiers. Finally, a hybrid algorithm is introduced, attempting to combine the strengths of the score- and constraint-based approaches. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data are performed not only to validate the capabilities of the proposed algorithms but also to conduct a comparative study of the available competitors.},

As a consequence, we prove that a canonical extension and its original conditional probability agree on basic conditionals. Moreover, we verify that the probability of conjunctions and disjunctions of conditionals in a recently introduced framework of Boolean algebras of conditionals are in full agreement with the corresponding operations of conditionals as defined in the approach developed by two of the authors to conditionals as three-valued objects, with betting-based semantics, and specified as suitable random quantities.

This method uses Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) procedure to minimize the L 1 distance between probability assessments and exploits the presence of the so-called “zero layers”. Through a simple prototypical example, we illustrate the feasibility and the peculiarities of the proposed procedure.

We generated four concept lattices for various subsets of attributes regarding timestamps, types of files, or event logs. The association rules and their connections with Formal Concept Analysis are explored, and several algorithms, including GUHA methods, are applied to our data. We compare, evaluate and interpret the various methods for association rules mining. Moreover, we describe the state-of-the-art of fuzzy attribute implications in Formal Concept Analysis and provide the interpretation of implications in our epoch-time attributes.

  abstract     = {The most widely studied explainable AI (XAI) approaches are unsound. This is the case with well-known model-agnostic explanation approaches, and it is also the case with approaches based on saliency maps . One solution is to consider intrinsic interpretability , which does not exhibit the drawback of unsoundness. Unfortunately, intrinsic interpretability can display unwieldy explanation redundancy. Formal explainability represents the alternative to these non-rigorous approaches, with one example being PI-explanations. Unfortunately, PI-explanations also exhibit important drawbacks, the most visible of which is arguably their size. Recently, it has been observed that the (absolute) rigor of PI-explanations can be traded off for a smaller explanation size, by computing the so-called relevant sets. Given some positive δ , a set S S of features is δ -relevant if, when the features in S S are fixed, the probability of getting the target class exceeds δ . However, even for very simple classifiers, the complexity of computing relevant sets of features is prohibitive, with the decision problem being NP PP NPPP -complete for circuit-based classifiers. In contrast with earlier negative results, this paper investigates practical approaches for computing relevant sets for a number of widely used classifiers that include Decision Trees (DTs), Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBCs), and several families of classifiers obtained from propositional languages. Moreover, the paper shows that, in practice, and for these families of classifiers, relevant sets are easy to compute. Furthermore, the experiments confirm that succinct sets of relevant features can be obtained for the families of classifiers considered.},

  abstract     = {Consumer preference studies in economics rest heavily on the behavioural interpretation of preference especially in the form of Revealed Preference Theory (RPT). Viewing purchasing decisions as a kind of human reasoning, in this paper we are interested in generalising behaviourism to preference-based argumentation where existing frameworks are arguably governed by the opposing mentalistic interpretation of preference. Concretely our contributions are three-fold. First we re-construct and unify two main approaches to RPT in argumentation terms by developing a Revealed Preference Argumentation (RPA) framework. We show that key RPT-based consumer analyses such as different rationality checks of a consumer behaviour and various kinds of such behaviour&#39;s extrapolations can be translated to computational tasks in RPA. RPA is in turn subsumed by the second contribution - an Integrated Preference Argumentation (IPA) framework which fully integrates mentalism and behaviourism. In particular we show that RPA is just a special case of IPA with only revealed preference , while existing preference-based argumentation frameworks can be viewed as IPA frameworks with only stated preference . As the third contribution, we develop a complete set of IPA algorithms and establish their correctness and termination for a general class of IPA frameworks. For demonstration we implement the algorithms in Prolog to obtain an IPA reasoning engine and test the engine with various RPT-based consumer behaviour analyses. In sum, it is argued that the current paper provides not only a theory of Integrated Preference Argumentation, but also a related development tool for future applications of argumentation to behavioural economics - a largely unexplored area so far though Dung used the stable marriage problem in microeconomic game theory to partly motivate the argumentation theory.},

  abstract     = {Sensitivity analysis measures the influence of a Bayesian network&#39;s parameters on a quantity of interest defined by the network, such as the probability of a variable taking a specific value. In the literature, this influence is often measured by computing the partial derivative with respect to the network parameters. However, this can become computationally expensive in large networks with thousands of parameters. We propose an algorithm combining automatic differentiation and exact inference to calculate the sensitivity measures in a single pass efficiently. It first marginalizes the whole network once, using e.g. variable elimination, and then backpropagates this operation to obtain the gradient with respect to all input parameters. Our method can be used for one-way and multi-way sensitivity analysis and the derivation of admissible regions. Simulation studies highlight the efficiency of our algorithm by scaling it to massive networks with up to 100,000 parameters and investigate the feasibility of generic multi-way analyses. Our routines are also showcased over two medium-sized Bayesian networks: the first modeling the country risks of a humanitarian crisis, the second studying the relationship between the use of technology and the psychological effects of forced social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. An implementation of the methods using the popular machine learning library PyTorch is freely available.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new approach to compute the projection of a set defined by polynomial equations . It assumes that the polynomial equations have some nice symmetries and that a solution of the projection problem is already available in the case where the variables along which we project are all positive. A new interval-based algorithm which combines symmetry operators and set quotient is proposed. Symmetries are used to move from one part of the space to another. The set quotient is needed to avoid redundant symmetries. The projection procedure yields an inner and an outer approximations of the projected set. Two applications are considered. The first one corresponds to the characterization of the space occupied by a rotating polygon, and the second one deals with the estimation of the speed of a moving object observed by several robots with uncertain orientations.},

It is proven that both the parameterized Tanino&#39;s normality and the usual k -normality are crucial to characterize additively consistent FPRs, based on which some existing results to derive priority vectors for additively consistent FPRs are improved by adding a suitable normality. Then, visible methods to check and modify the acceptably additive consistency and the consensus of FPRs in GDM are proposed without a preset threshold.

What is remarkable is that the R U 2 -implication is a generalization of residual implications generated by some popular fuzzy logic operations such as t-norms, uninorms and uni-nullnorms. Then, we obtain the block structures for R U 2 -implications, especially for ones generated by two special classes of conjunctive 2-uninorms. Moreover, the main properties of R U 2 -implications and their natural negations are discussed. Finally, we give a characterization of residual implications derived from left-continuous 2-uninorms, which preserve the residuation property.},

Accordingly, the theoretical study of various fuzzy implications generated by common aggregation operators has become an attractive topic, especially on finite scales. In this paper, we analyse residual implications induced from discrete overlap functions latest proposed by the author, which belong to the category of discrete implications. Explicitly, in the beginning, we present the definition of residual implications generated by discrete overlap functions and call them -implications. In the next place, we analyse a number of elementary properties of -implications. Most of all, it proves that -implications satisfy most of algebraic properties of discrete implications spontaneously, such as the left neutrality property, identity principle, ordering property, etc., which are different from the circumstance on other truth values sets. At last, via -implications, we reveal correlations of discrete implications and discrete quasi-overlap functions extended from discrete overlap functions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study new classes of value operators for coalitional games with players organized into a boolean algebra . Coalitional games are cooperative models in which players can form coalitions to maximize profit. The basic solution concepts in such game scenarios are value operators, which assign a unique real value to every player, reflecting thus selected principles of economic rationality. Some value concepts were extended beyond the classic coalitional model where every coalition of players can form. In particular, the extension of Shapley value exists for coalitional games in which players are partially ordered, and the feasible coalitions are the corresponding down-sets. Interestingly, this game-theoretic framework was employed in the method called Information Attribution. This method aims to solve the information decomposition problem, which asks for a particular additive decomposition of the mutual information between the input and target random variables . In such information-theoretic games, the players are predictors, and their set has the natural structure of a boolean algebra. Motivated by the original problem, we consider coalitional games where the players form a boolean algebra, and the coalitions are the corresponding down-sets. This more general approach enables us to study various value solution concepts in detail. Namely, we focus on the classes of values that can represent alternatives to the solution of the information decomposition problem, such as random-order values or sharing values. We extend the axiomatic characterization of some classes of values that were known only for the standard coalitional games.},

To deal with this issue, this paper proposes an expert-weight-updating-based approach to achieve a threshold consistency under three-way group decision with various opinions of linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. First, we use a linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy number (LIFN) to evaluate loss functions among experts due to its advantages in uncertain evaluations, and establish a fundamental model of decision-theoretic rough sets with different opinions of multiple experts. Then, we put forward a single optimization model that is an extension of our previous model, and utilize a mapping technique with such optimization methodology to generate numerical thresholds of individual experts. Second, we employ the normalized Hamming distance to define concepts of similarity measure and group consensus index based on individual thresholds. Then, we design a method to derive initial weights, a strategy to update weights of experts, and an expert-weight-updating-based algorithm to achieve a consensus of group thresholds. Third, via this algorithm, we develop a three-way group decision consensus achieving approach based on linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy opinions with multiple experts. Finally, some experiments and comparative analysis are performed to verify a convergence of our algorithm and the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper clarifies the relation between case-based prediction and analogical transfer. Case-based prediction consists in predicting the outcome associated with a new case directly from its comparison with a set of cases retrieved from a case base, by relying solely on a structured memory and some similarity measures. Analogical transfer is a cognitive process that allows to derive some new information about a target situation by applying a plausible inference principle, according to which if two situations are similar with respect to some criteria, then it is plausible that they are also similar with respect to other criteria. Case-based prediction algorithms are known to apply analogical transfer to make predictions, but the existing approaches are diverse, and developing a unified theory of case-based prediction remains a challenge. In this paper, we show that a common principle underlying case-based prediction methods is that they interpret the plausible inference as a transfer of similarity knowledge from a situation space to an outcome space. Among all potential outcomes, the predicted outcome is the one that optimizes this transfer, i.e. , that makes the similarities in the outcome space most compatible with the observed similarities in the situation space. Based on this observation, a systematic analysis of the different theories of case-based prediction is presented, where the approaches are distinguished according to the type of knowledge used to measure the compatibility between the two sets of similarity relations.},

  abstract     = {A numerical approach to computing solutions of a generalized Kolmogorov backward equation is proposed, in which the stochastic matrix is replaced by a nonlinear operator obtained as the lower bound of a set of stochastic matrices. The equation is central to the theory of imprecise Markov chains in continuous time, which has made rapid progress in recent years. One of the obstacles to its implementation remains the high computational complexity , with the prevailing existing approaches relying on a discretization of the time interval . In order to achieve sufficient accuracy of the approximations , the grid must typically contain a large number of points on which optimization steps are performed, usually using linear programming. The main goal of this work is to develop a new, more efficient approach by significantly reducing the number of optimization steps required to achieve the prescribed accuracy of the solutions. Our approach is based on the Lipschitz continuity of the solutions of the equation with respect to time, which results in the optimization problems occurring at nearby points of the time interval having similar optimal solutions. This property is exploited using the theory of normal cones of convex polytopes . If the solution vectors remain within the same normal cone of a polytope corresponding to the nonlinear operator in a given interval, the optimization problem to be solved becomes linear, which allows much faster computations. This paper is primarily concerned with providing the theoretical basis for the new technique. However, initial tests show that it significantly outperforms existing methods in most cases.},

To overcome the limitations of the factorization based on those relations, we introduce a new lattice factorization that enables the imploding of selected disjoint intervals of a finite lattice. To this end, we propose an interval relation that generates this factorization. To obtain lattices rather than arbitrary ordered sets, we restrict this approach to so-called pure intervals . For our study, we will make use of methods from Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). We will also provide a new FCA construction by introducing the enrichment of an incidence relation by a set of intervals in a formal context, to investigate the approach for lattice-generating interval relations on the context side.},

To this aim, text mining tools are combined with Bayesian and frequentist statistical methods innovatively. First, topic modeling based on state-of-the-art techniques is suggested to be employed to identify relevant topics. The derived models are used to quantify the relative importance of a subject defined through a given set of terms, or keywords, by employing Bayesian techniques.

To demonstrate that our algorithms cannot be unified by the general reduction algorithm, we discuss the relationship between the consistent topological reducts and the reducts identified by the general reduction algorithm. We conduct numerical experiments on 11 UCI datasets to verify our theoretical results. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed reduction algorithms are effective and practicable.},

  abstract     = {The interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM) algorithm is a popular data clustering and image segmentation method. However, the algorithm fails to consider the spatial information of the image and has limited accuracy for noisy images . The other problem of the IT2PFCM algorithm assumes that all features are equally important in the segmentation process and perform less well as it segments color images . In addition, the IT2PFCM algorithm produces overlapping clusters and even misses some clusters if the groups contained in the data are relatively close to each other. We propose an improved IT2PFCM algorithm for noisy image segmentation to solve the problems. Firstly, an adaptive spatial constraint method is proposed to decrease the algorithm&#39;s sensitivity to noise. Secondly, we utilize an automatic local feature weighting and clustering weighting scheme to better segment color images and eliminate overlapping clusters. Finally, an objective function with adaptive spatial constraint, local feature weighting, and clustering weighting is constructed for image segmentation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and natural images show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. The convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is also provided.},

Once people are concentrated on doing a specific action, they do not notice unexpected events (having 0 probability) occurring in the meantime. When applying the model, selective attention is no longer a bias since it is able to explain this function of the human brain mathematically. Moreover different reactions of people to unexpected events can be represented in different metric spaces with metrics which are not bi-Lipschitz. In these metric spaces coherent upper conditional probabilities defined by Hausdorff outer measures are not mutually absolutely continuous and so they do not share the same null events.},

  abstract     = {Data quality is an important consideration in many engineering applications and projects. Data collection procedures do not always involve careful utilization of the most precise instruments and strictest protocols. As a consequence, data are invariably affected by imprecision and sometimes sharply varying levels of quality of the data. Different mathematical representations of imprecision have been suggested, including a classical approach to censored data which is considered optimal when the proposed error model is correct, and a weaker approach called interval statistics based on partial identification that makes fewer assumptions. Maximizing the quality of statistical results is often crucial to the success of many engineering projects, and a natural question that arises is whether data of differing qualities should be pooled together or we should include only precise measurements and disregard imprecise data. Some worry that combining precise and imprecise measurements can depreciate the overall quality of the pooled data. Some fear that excluding data of lesser precision can increase their overall uncertainty about results because lower sample size implies more sampling uncertainty. This paper explores these concerns and describes simulation results that show when it is advisable to combine fairly precise data with rather imprecise data by comparing analyses using different mathematical representations of imprecision. Pooling data sets is preferred when the low-quality data set does not exceed a certain level of uncertainty. However, so long as the data are random, it may be legitimate to reject the low-quality data if its reduction of sampling uncertainty does not counterbalance the effect of its imprecision on the overall uncertainty.},

Drawing on the idea of granular computing and starting from the perspective of relation, this study proposes a method to describe the spatial near-far relations among different concepts. First, the eigenvalue representation methods of the matrix are given, and on this basis, the salient feature space of the symmetric matrix is proposed. Then, we propose a salient representation method for category, and through qualitative analysis from the perspective of consistency and near-far relations, we find that the salient representation can represent categories from the perspective of attribute and object respectively. Finally, we verify the validity of salient relation representation through second-order isomorphism between intent and extent of concept quantitatively.},

Different CCL models constructed by different cognitive minds will produce different concept learning results. The existing CCL model based on sufficient and necessary granule approximations regards the human&#39;s approximation idea in the face of inconsistent information as a logical criterion, and aims at finding the closest concept pair of the clue as concept learning results with a certain learning accuracy. However, the existing CCL method based on sufficient and necessary granule approximations cannot guarantee that the clue must be between its lower approximation and upper approximation, which causes the fact that the learning accuracy may not effectively measure the consistency of concept learning results. What is more, although the computational process obeys logical cognitive condition, the concept learning results may not conform to the actual situation, such as the case of merely generating full concepts and empty concepts. For the first problem, we improve the learning accuracy of the existing CCL method, propose a new CCL method with learning accuracy under hybrid lattice structure, and develop CCL algorithms for the cases of objects and attributes as clues. Moreover, experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed CCL method with learning accuracy under hybrid lattice structure. For the second problem, we put forward a CCL method based on non-logical associative mechanism to handle the unreasonable situation where the concept learning results are full concepts and empty concepts. Finally, two associative CCL algorithms are explored, and experiments are conducted to show their effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {AI systems often need to deal with inconsistencies. One way of getting information about inconsistencies is by measuring the amount of information in the knowledgebase. In the past 20 years numerous inconsistency measures have been proposed. Many of these measures are syntactic measures, that is, they are based in some way on the minimal inconsistent subsets of the knowledgebase. Very little attention has been given to semantic inconsistency measures, that is, ones that are based on the models of the knowledgebase where the notion of a model is generalized to allow an atom to be assigned a truth value that denotes contradiction. In fact, only one nontrivial semantic inconsistency measure, the contension measure, has been in wide use. The purpose of this paper is to define a class of semantic inconsistency measures based on 3-valued logics. First, we show which 3-valued logics are useful for this purpose. Then we show that the class of semantic inconsistency measures can be developed using a graphical framework similar to the way that syntactic inconsistency measures have been studied. We give several examples of semantic inconsistency measures and show how they apply to three useful 3-valued logics. We also investigate the properties of these inconsistency measures and show their computation for several knowledgebases.},

All these factors have created the need for a robust model. This paper proposes a novel intutitionistic fuzzy β covering model which is robust, combining intuitionistic fuzzy set, β covering and multigranulation rough sets. A new intuitionistic fuzzy β covering based multigranulation model is proposed which satisfies inclusion relationship between two approximations. This robust model is used to formulate dependency degree, which is evaluated at various granularity levels and is thereby employed for feature subset selection . Series of experiments are conducted on real valued datasets to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the underlying model.

  abstract     = {Imbalanced classification refers to problems in which there are significantly more instances available for some classes than for others. Such scenarios require special attention because traditional classifiers tend to be biased towards the majority class which has a large number of examples. Different strategies, such as re-sampling, have been suggested to improve imbalanced learning. Ensemble methods have also been proven to yield promising results in the presence of class-imbalance. However, most of them only deal with binary imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we propose a re-sampling approach based on belief function theory and ensemble learning for dealing with class imbalance in the multi-class setting. This technique assigns soft evidential labels to each instance. This evidential modeling provides more information about each object&#39;s region, which improves the selection of objects in both undersampling and oversampling. Our approach firstly selects ambiguous majority instances for undersampling, then oversamples minority objects through the generation of synthetic examples in borderline regions to better improve minority class borders. Finally, to improve the induced results, the proposed re-sampling approach is incorporated into an evidential classifier-independent fusion-based ensemble. The comparative study against well-known ensemble methods reveals that our method is efficient according to the G-Mean and F1-score measures, independently from the chosen classifier.},

Furthermore, the test cost is defined according to the relative distance preference degree, and the risk cost of Bayesian theory introduced by decision-theoretic rough set is used as the decision cost of accepting, delaying and rejecting decisions. Therefore, we establish a multi-scale dominant single-valued neutrosophic decision-theoretic rough set based on test and decision cost. In addition, we also propose a scale updating algorithm to find out all consistent scales. Afterwards, we further raise an optimal scale selection algorithm based on the minimum total cost criterion.

(2012) [7] , [8] as fuzzy relations between the sets of states of the automata. However, they act as a crisp relationship between the automata. In particular, if there exists a (forward) bisimulation between two fuzzy automata, then the fuzzy languages recognized by them are crisply equal. Approximate simulations and bisimulations introduced by Stanimirović et al. (2022) [36] aim at fuzzifying this phenomenon. However, they are defined only for fuzzy automata over a complete Heyting algebra and do not give the exact relationship between states of the automata. In this article, we introduce and study fuzzy simulations and bisimulations between fuzzy automata over a complete residuated lattice. These notions are novel and have good properties. They are defined for fuzzy automata over any complete residuated lattice. We prove that the fuzzy language recognized by a fuzzy automaton is fuzzily preserved by fuzzy simulations and fuzzily invariant under fuzzy bisimulations. We also prove that the notions of fuzzy simulation and bisimulation have the Hennessy-Milner properties, which are a logical characterization of the greatest fuzzy simulation or bisimulation between two fuzzy automata. In addition, we provide results showing that our notions of fuzzy simulation and bisimulation are more general and refined than the notions of simulation and bisimulation introduced by Ćirić et al. and the notions of approximate simulation and bisimulation introduced by Stanimirović et al.},

We prove that, given some rational properties, a merging operator is either manipulable, with respect to any well-behaved belief lifting, or it admits a powerful agent (a dictator or a nominator) who, in some way, imposes his will. We also study the behaviour of some concrete epistemic state merging operators, showing that most of them are manipulable. By means of this study, we prove that strategy-proofness cannot be characterised in terms of dictators or nominators in this qualitative framework of manipulability.},

  abstract     = {Explaining black-box classification models is a hot topic in AI , with the overall goal of improving trust in decisions made by such models. Several works have been done and diverse functions have been proposed. However, their formal properties and links have not been sufficiently studied. This paper presents four contributions: The first consists of investigating global explanations of black-box classifiers. We provide a formal and unifying framework in which such explanations are defined from the whole feature space. The framework is based on two concepts, which are seen as two types of global explanations: arguments in favour of (or pro) predictions and arguments against (or con) predictions. The second contribution consists of defining various types of local explanations (abductive explanations, counterfactuals, contrastive explanations) from the whole feature space, investigating their properties, links and differences, and showing how they relate to global explanations. The third contribution consists of analysing and defining explanation functions that generate (global, local) abductive explanations from incomplete information (i.e., from a subset of the feature space). We start by proposing two desirable properties that an explainer would satisfy, namely success and coherence . The former ensures the existence of explanations while the latter ensures their correctness. We show that in the incomplete case, the two properties cannot be satisfied together. The fourth contribution consists of proposing two functions that generate abductive explanations and which satisfy coherence at the expense of success.},

The novelty of the approach is in presenting a new concept of approximation space which is based on advanced reasoning tools. Many generalisations of the rough set approaches developed over the years are mainly concentrated around reasoning concerning (partial) inclusion of sets. However, such approximation spaces are not satisfactory to deal with important aspects of approximate reasoning by IS&#39;s aiming to construct of the high quality approximations of compound decision granules. We demonstrate a number of examples supporting this claim. In particular, in solving the considered in the paper problems are involved complex algorithmic optimization processes directed by reasoning tools supporting searching for (semi-)optimal approximations of decision granules in huge spaces. This paper is a step toward developing tools for derivation of granules supporting IS&#39;s in perceiving situations to a degree satisfactory for making the right decisions.},

  abstract     = {Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) associate nodes in networks with specific samples in datasets, and thus ignore the conceptual information hidden in object-attribute clusters in datasets. Besides, processing data without structural information is a problem for GNNs since structural information is the input of networks. In this paper, we aim to integrate conceptual information into the message passing of GNNs. To this end, concept lattice theory is fused into existing GNNs. A concept lattice is a powerful tool for describing generalization and specialization relations between formal concepts. And formal concepts, basic elements of concept lattices, effectively explain dependencies between features and samples. On this basis, we propose a new GNN framework induced by a concept lattice to overcome the intrinsic limitations of GNNs. And the novel GNN framework not only joins conceptual information into the message passing but also enables a GNN to process data with or without structural information. Furthermore, the proposed framework is validated under transductive and inductive learning conditions, respectively. The experimental results show that GNNs induced by concept lattices can handle the information hidden in datasets effectively and improve classification accuracies on most benchmark datasets over previous methods.},

The semi-supervised learning algorithm is needed to deal with such data. This paper studies the label prediction of partially labeled categorical data and considers semi-supervised attribute reduction in a partially labeled categorical decision information system (p-CDIS) with predicted labels. The labels of unlabeled data are first predicted by means of the conditional probability . Then, uncertainty measurement for a p-CDIS with predicted labels is studied, and the dependence and conditional information entropy (CIE) are defined. Next, based on the dependence and CIE, two attribute reduction algorithms are designed. In addition, the effect of label deletion rate (LDR) on the dependence, CIE and reduction results are also studied. Finally, the results of experiments and statistical tests on 16 categorical UCI datasets show that the designed algorithms are statistically better than some state-of-the-art algorithms in classification accuracy .},

  abstract     = {With the increasing diversification and complexity of information and data, it is crucial to monitor and process data and information from multiple perspectives. There is a general consensus that dominance-based rough set approaches are the most effective methods for ordered information system research. Regardless, limitations and irrationality still exist in dominance relations because they cannot reflect the different emphases of data under different feature sets, nor can they meet the requirements for describing data information in the real world. To enable the dominance relation rough set model to be more effectively applied to practical problems in line with human cognition, our work focuses on developing adjustable-perspective dominance relations by fusing three different dominance relations in an intuitionistic fuzzy ordered decision table. On this basis, we construct a single-perspective rough set (SPRS) model to realize knowledge mining and rule extraction from various perspectives. Additionally, we present two types of different-perspective rough sets (DPRS) that reduce the restriction of single-perspective evaluation data in realistic problems and discuss rule extraction. Additionally, we compare SPRS and DPRS to other dominance-based rough set models from the perspectives of the ordinal classification, roughness, and dependence degree. Finally, we analyze eight UCI datasets and present a series of comparative experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed model.},

Existing solutions typically adopt linear correlations between features. In this paper, three different monotonic uncertainty measures are defined on equivalence classes and neighborhood classes to study the partially labeled heterogeneous feature selection by exploring the nonlinear correlations. First, consistent entropy and monotonic neighborhood entropy, based on classical rough set theory and neighborhood rough set theory, are proposed to construct a uniform measure for feature selection in heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, a maximal neighborhood entropy strategy is developed by considering the inconsistency of neighborhood classes described by the features and partial labels. Finally, two feature selection algorithms are presented by three novel monotonic uncertainty measures. The comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the newly proposed feature selection measures.},

At the core of desirability lies an assumption of linearity of the scale in which rewards are measured. It is a traditional assumption used to derive the expected utility model, which clashes with a general representation of rational decision making, though. Allais has, in particular, pointed this out in 1953 with his famous paradox. We note that the utility scale plays the role of a closure operator when we regard desirability as a logical theory. This observation enables us to extend desirability to the nonlinear case by letting the utility scale be represented via a general closure operator. The new theory directly expresses rewards in actual nonlinear currency (money), much in Savage&#39;s spirit, while arguably weakening the founding assumptions to a minimum. We characterise the main properties of the new theory both from the perspective of sets of gambles and of their lower and upper prices (previsions). We show how Allais paradox finds a solution in the new theory, and discuss the role of sets of probabilities in the theory.},

  abstract     = {Numerous linguistically valued facts from the actual world have been modeled using the fuzzy linguistic approach. Concept lattice theory has the potential to be used in information processing in imprecise language environments as a methodology for data analysis and knowledge representation. The concept lattice with linguistic values can manage fuzzy linguistic data which are either comparable or incomparable. However, the acquired conceptual knowledge is difficult to understand due to the substantial amount of linguistic concept knowledge in the concept lattice with imprecise linguistic information . This work proposes a linguistic-valued layered concept lattice simplification method based on three-way clustering to reduce the scale of the linguistic-valued layered concept lattice. In order to create the linguistically valued layered concept lattice, a reconstruction function is first used to produce an attribute selection model in fuzzy linguistic formal contexts. Second, the intent similarity and extent similarity are employed to achieve the concept similarity measure in linguistic-valued layered concept lattices, taking into account the relationship among various layers of fuzzy linguistic values. To get the initial concept hard clustering results , the linguistic-valued layered concepts are then clustered using k -modes clustering. In addition, we explore the classification of boundary linguistic-valued layered concepts and achieve the three-way clustering findings of linguistic-valued layered concepts to deal with the ambiguity of linguistic expressions . Finally, experimental findings on real-world datasets show how effective the proposed method is for simplifying linguistic-valued layered concept lattices.},

This topic has had scarce treatment in the literature, which emphasises exogenous uncertainties caused by other players or nature and not by players themselves. That is primarily because a player&#39;s endogenous uncertainty over an outcome poses significant challenges and complex sequences of reciprocal expectations. Therefore, it is often ignored, and preferences are either assumed from a continuous domain or set using introspection, resulting in non-optimal models. We here explore a solution concept based on recent research in imprecise probabilities and de Finetti&#39;s approach to defining subjective probabilities, which utilises bets to assess beliefs. The resulting model allows players to be ignorant about their initial preferences and learn about them in repeated games. Furthermore, it permits improving the value of information in these situations. This model is proposed as a possible solution to the problem of utility inference in game-theoretic settings that include uncertainty over outcomes. We demonstrate it through motivating repeated-game problems modified to have uncertainty and through a simulation over a case of extreme ignorance.},

According to Bayesian minimum risk theory, we derive trisection of agents, in which the state set is calculated objectively. Then, we analyze three issue sets through the conflicting characters of issues, which provides a new way to consider the trisection of issues. In addition, we put forward the definition of maximal coalitions in DHFSTs and give an effective calculation method.

Such a system is a multi-scale decision table in which each condition or decision attribute at each object can take different values under different scales. The notion of scale selections for a GMDIT, which is mainly used to determine individual decision tables, is then defined. Information granules and their properties with different scale selections in GMDITs are also described. Optimal scale selections which are used to determine proper decision tables for final decision in inconsistent GMDITs are further formulated. Local optimal scale selections to obtain more concise decision rules for different objects are presented.

  abstract     = {Trackers based on Siamese network have achieved positive performance in recent days. However, most of the existing siamese single object trackers only consider the spatial information in the template which was given in the first frame of the video but do not extract the affluent temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking framework based on a spatial-temporal network. Specifically, we introduce three-way decision theory into object tracking to avoid interference from complex situations such as occlusions, fast motions, and non-rigid deformation. Furthermore, our proposed method can generate more precise tracking results due to the discriminative correlation filters (DCF). Extensive tests and comparisons with numerous competitive trackers on demanding large-scale benchmarks, including OTB-2015, GOT-10k, LaSOT and VOT2018, TrackingNet, demonstrate that our tracker outperforms many state-of-the-art real-time techniques while operating at 22 frames per second.},

The control of that conditional error rate corrects p-values by transforming them into c-values. A further generalization from point null hypotheses to composite hypotheses generates possibility measures called C-values. The framework has implications for the following areas of application in addition to that of bounded parameter spaces. First, C-values of unspecified catch-all hypotheses provide conditions under which the entire statistical model would be rejected. Second, the C-value of a point estimate or confidence interval from a previous study determines whether the conclusion of the study is replicated, discredited, or neither replicated nor discredited by a new study. Third, c-values of a finite number of hypotheses, theories, or other models facilitate both incorporating previous information into frequentist hypothesis testing and the comparison of scientific models such as those of molecular evolution.

The preservation includes the residuated lattice axioms, the identities narrowing the classes of the residuated lattices, and some well-known additional properties. In this paper, we consider nine algebras for partial fuzzy logics which incorporate handling undefined values in a bit different way. In particular, we consider the Bochvar, the Bochvar external, the Sobociński, the Kleene, the McCarthy, the Nelson, and the Łukasiewicz algebras, and two recently developed ones, namely the Lower estimation and the Dragonfly algebras. We summarize the obtained results in a comprehensible form which allows readers to easily check the information for the preserved and non-preserved properties in a certain partial algebraic structure . The resulting shape of the contribution is a sort of “atlas book” that aims at providing researchers with a comfortable and comprehensible form of an overview of the (non)preservation of fundamental properties of residuated structures.},

Such data are referred to as partially labeled mixed-type data. There is currently few work on feature selection approaches for these data. Motivated by this issue, this paper aims at selecting the informative feature subset from partially labeled mixed-type data. At first, to improve the classification performance, an improved label propagation algorithm based on K-nearest neighbor is proposed, which marks the decision labels of unlabeled objects by making use of the information between unlabeled objects and labeled objects. On this basis, a feature multi-criteria measure based on the dependency, information entropy and information granulation is proposed for selecting candidate features. Finally, the corresponding semi-supervised feature selection algorithm is developed to select the feature subset for the partially labeled mixed-type data. Experimental results on UCI data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection algorithm and the superiority in terms of the classification accuracy compared with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Density Peaks Clustering (DPC) is a classic density-based clustering algorithm that has been successfully applied in various areas. However, it assigns samples based on their nearest neighbors with higher density which may lead to an error propagation problem. Besides, it can not detect fringe and overlapping samples. To handle these defects, we improve the density measurement of DPC to make it more adaptive to different shapes and varying densities. Furthermore, we extend DPC to three-way clustering which means a sample in the positive region certainly belongs to the cluster, a sample in the boundary region belongs to the cluster partially and a sample in the negative region certainly does not belong to the cluster. In this paper, we propose a three-way clustering method called TW-RDPC. It mainly consists of three steps: (1) Identify cluster centers and assign other samples based on relative Cauchy kernel density to get initial clusters. (2) Detect potential boundary samples through boundary detection graph. (3) Determine whether potential boundary samples belong to multiple clusters based on the subordinate relationship to their k nearest neighbors. In order to validate TW-RDPC, we compare it to 7 algorithms on 10 synthetic datasets and 8 real-world datasets. Experimental results indicate that TW-RDPC is competitive with the compared 7 algorithms.},

An essential issue in inducing shadowed sets is determining the thresholds ( α , β ) (α,β) and maintaining the consistency in fuzziness . However, it is found that the existing interval shadowed sets (ISS) have a significant fuzziness loss. In addition, the algorithm used to obtain the threshold pairs in ISS need to be further optimized. To this end, a novel method to induce interval shadowed sets based on a new objective function is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the shortcomings of the objective function and fuzziness loss of ISS are analyzed. Then, a new objective function is given, and interval shadowed sets with less fuzziness loss are induced based on this objective function. Afterwards, a fast algorithm is developed to obtain interval shadowed sets quickly. Finally, the rationality and validity of the proposed method are verified by experimental results.},

We characterize free algebras in a radical-determined variety V V of rotations in terms of weak Boolean products of rotations of free algebras in the variety of radicals, the latter being the intersections of maximal filters of the algebras in V V . Then we use such description to study projectivity in these varieties of rotations, characterizing finitely generated projective algebras. Moreover, we show that the strong unitary unification type of a variety of radicals implies the strong unitary type for the generated variety of rotations, which can be used to deduce the decidability of the admissibility of rules. As relevant applications of our general results, we obtain that product logic and nilpotent minimum logic have (strong) unitary unification type.},

A relational semantics for PDBL is next proposed, where any formula is interpreted as a semiconcept of a context. For MPDBL , the relational semantics is based on Kripke contexts, and a formula is interpreted as a semiconcept of the underlying context. The systems are shown to be sound and complete with respect to the relational semantics. Adding appropriate sequents to MPDBL results in logics with semantics based on reflexive, symmetric or transitive Kripke contexts. In particular, one gets the logics MPDBL4 and MPDBL5 with semantics respectively based on reflexive, transitive Kripke contexts and reflexive, symmetric and transitive Kripke contexts. MPDBL4 also happens to be the logic for topological pure double Boolean algebra. It is demonstrated that, using PDBL , the basic notions and relations of conceptual knowledge can be expressed and inferences involving negations can be obtained. Further, drawing a connection with rough set theory , lower and upper approximations of semiconcepts of a context are defined. It is then shown that, using the formulae and sequents involving modal operators in MPDBL5 , these approximation operators and their properties can be captured.},

Following this, the path planning problem on the original grid map is transformed into a path searching problem in the graph of rectangular regions. The graph derived from the sublattice of region concepts is used to avoid the high time complexity of applying the complete concept lattice. Finally, a novel path planning algorithm that can generate a path consisting of rectangular regions is constructed. This path can also be converted into the path consisting of inflection points . The results of simulations verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The orientations of some edges in the causal DAG can be discovered from observational/interventional data. Further edges can be oriented by iteratively applying so-called Meek rules. Inferring edges&#39; orientations from some previously oriented edges, which we call Causal Orientation Learning (COL), is a common problem in various causal discovery tasks. In these tasks, it is often required to solve multiple COL problems and therefore applying Meek rules could be time consuming. Motivated by Meek rules, we introduce Meek functions that can be utilized in solving COL problems. In particular, we show that these functions have some desirable properties , enabling us to speed up the process of applying Meek rules. In particular, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) based method to apply Meek functions. Moreover, based on the proposed DP method, we present a lower bound on the number of edges that can be oriented as a result of intervention. We also propose a method to check whether some oriented edges belong to a causal DAG. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can outperform previous work in several causal discovery tasks in terms of running-time.},

  abstract     = {The notion of context awareness and the challenge of reasoning with partially reliable sources are two important aspects within Information Fusion. Context is the information relevant to, but not directly affecting, the problem at hand and can be broadly categorised into either context-for or context-of , referring either to the information related to some situation or to the environment induced by some situation, respectively. In evidence theory , the Behaviour-Based Correction (BBC) model generalises reasoning with partially reliable sources as well as contextual belief correction. In this paper, we propose a model for contextual reasoning framed into evidence theory, which captures both the notions of context-for and context-of . We rephrase the BBC model to explicitly account for variation of metaknowledge regarding source behaviour, and subsequently include within it the variables defining the context-for the problem and the context-for the source. The benefit is two-fold: on the one hand, the explicit inclusion of context in the reasoning provides a better insight into the problem and on the other hand, it can improve the expressiveness of the model. This is illustrated on a case of maritime surveillance involving a missing vessel, where it is shown that this model is not only more expressive than the simple fusion of sources model but also more interpretable.},

  abstract     = {In decision support systems the motivation and justification of the system&#39;s diagnosis or classification is crucial for the acceptance of the system by the human user. In Bayesian networks a diagnosis or classification is typically formalized as the computation of the most probable joint value assignment to the hypothesis variables, given the observed values of the evidence variables (generally known as the MAP problem). While solving the MAP problem gives the most probable explanation of the evidence, the computation is a black box as far as the human user is concerned and it does not give additional insights that allow the user to appreciate and accept the decision. For example, a user might want to know to whether an unobserved variable could potentially (upon observation) impact the explanation, or whether it is irrelevant in this aspect. In this paper we introduce a new concept, MAP-independence, which tries to capture this notion of relevance, and explore its role towards a potential justification of an inference to the best explanation. We formalize several computational problems based on this concept and assess their computational complexity .},

  abstract     = {In the trisecting-acting-outcome (TAO) model of three-way decision (3WD), the typical outcome measures approach is to estimate the difference before and after some strategies acted on the tripartition, regardless of whether it is good or bad. That is, it has not yet had the feature of strategy selection based on the prediction of outcomes. We employ fuzzy Markov to model the effectiveness prediction and analysis for the movement-based three-way decision (M-3WD) to solve this problem. In particular, this work first constructs a correspondence between the tripartition generated by each movement and the states in the Markov model. And then, we propose a fuzzy set represented by a trisection to deliver the satisfaction level of the decision-maker, whose three elements are U + ( k ) ˜ U+(k)˜ , U ∼ ( k ) ˜ U∼(k)˜ , U − ( k ) ˜ U−(k)˜ , corresponding to satisfied, uncertain, and unsatisfied. Further, the affiliation relationship between the state-changing produced by each movement and the satisfaction set is defined as the strategy effectiveness index. With the help of the characteristics of the fuzzy Markov model, it predicts effectiveness, thus avoiding the execution of ineffective and low-efficiency strategies. Finally, we offer an example to illustrate the validity and foresight of the proposed approach.},

To address the above-mentioned problem, we introduce the idea of granular computing and sequential three-way decisions into RS, and then propose a naive recommendation method with cost-sensitive sequential three-way recommendation (CS3WR) based on collaborative deep learning (CDL). Firstly, inspired by the structure thinking of granular computing, we design a CDL-based joint granulation model to produce the multilevel RI. Subsequently, we propose a CS3WR strategy and an optimal granularity selection mechanism to get the optimal recommendation and optimal granularity, respectively.

We obtain the many-to-one independent natural extension in this framework. Given the generality of choice functions, our expression for the independent natural extension is the most general one we are aware of, and we show how it implies the independent natural extension for sets of desirable gambles, and therefore also for less expressive imprecise-probabilistic models. Once this is in place, we compare this concept of epistemic independence to another independence concept for choice functions proposed by Seidenfeld [28] , which De Bock and De Cooman [2] have called S-independence.

  abstract     = {Non-clausal deduction in classical logic is one of the oldest areas in artificial intelligence . It first appeared in the sixties and consequently a large body of research has been devoted to it. Within the last decades, computing with non-clausal formulas has been considered in several fields, and in particular, in answer set programming , wherein non-clausal or nested logic programs were conceived in 1999. Possibilistic logic is the most extended approach to handle uncertain and partially inconsistent information. Here, we generalize some well-known clausal outcomes in possibilistic reasoning to the non-clausal setting, concretely the objective of our proposal is: (i) to extend available insights from clausal to non-clausal form; (ii) to show that possibilistic reasoning admits feasible classes also at the non-clausal level; (iii) to combine the high expressiveness of non-clausal possibilistic logic with the highest efficient (polynomial) reasoning mechanisms; and (iii) to suggest that some meaningful subclasses of possibilistic nested programs can be efficiently processed. Firstly , we define the class of Possibilistic Horn Non-Clausal formulas, or H ‾ Σ H‾Σ , which covers the classes: possibilistic Horn and propositional Horn-NC. H ‾ Σ H‾Σ is shown to be non-clausal, analogous to the standard Horn class. Secondly , we define Possibilistic Non-Clausal Unit-Resolution, or UR Σ URΣ , and prove that UR Σ URΣ correctly computes the inconsistency degree of Horn-NC bases. UR Σ URΣ is formulated in a clausal-like manner, which eases its understanding, formal proofs and future extension towards full non-clausal resolution. Thirdly , we prove that computing the inconsistency degree of Horn-NC bases takes polynomial time . Although there already exist tractable classes in possibilistic logic, all of them are clausal, and thus, H ‾ Σ H‾Σ turns out to be the first characterized polynomial non-clausal class within possibilistic reasoning. We discuss that our approach serves as a starting point to developing uncertain non-clausal reasoning on the basis of both methodologies: DPLL and resolution.},

Determining the changes of the optimal scale for dynamic data is a goal that has drawn increasing attention from scholars in related fields. For the case of object updating, solving this problem requires finding which characteristic conditions should be satisfied by newly added objects when different cases of the optimal scale occur. However, existing studies only include the sufficient and necessary condition of the optimal scale becoming smaller for dynamically updating objects. Therefore, to complete the theory regarding how the optimal scale will be changed when objects are dynamically updated, it is still necessary to explore the sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimal scale being unchanged or becoming larger. In this paper, we use three-way decision theory to study this problem. Concretely speaking, the uncertain region of three-way decision is used to reveal the change of knowledge at different scales. That is, the obtained results, combined with existing work, provide a nice solution to the problem of finding the changing laws of the optimal scale for object updating in multi-scale decision information systems.},

  abstract     = {Hypothesis testing is a key component in Statistics . In practice, it is common for a practitioner to test several hypotheses, the so-called simultaneous hypothesis testing problem . Unfortunately, simultaneous hypothesis tests can be logically incoherent: for instance, if hypothesis H 1 H1 implies hypothesis H 2 H2 , a procedure that rejects H 2 H2 should also reject H 1 H1 , a property not always met by multiple test procedures. Indeed, previous results show that standard two-way hypothesis tests cannot be logically coherent. Three-way tests allow more nuanced data-based decisions. This paper studies whether Bayesian simultaneous three-way hypothesis tests can be logically coherent. Two types of results are obtained. First, under the standard error-wise constant loss, only for a limited set of models a Bayes simultaneous test can be logically coherent. Second, if more general loss functions are used, then it is possible to obtain Bayes simultaneous tests that are always logically coherent. An explicit example of such a loss function is provided. These results provide guidelines on how to build a logically coherent posterior probability three-way hypothesis test or more general Bayesian three-way hypothesis tests.},

It was named the “Belief-Plausibility” ( BP ) approach as only the basic mathematical tools of the DST were used for its foundation. In this paper, a new approach to compare the real, interval and fuzzy-valued intuitionistic fuzzy and BP numbers is proposed. Among known approaches to compare intuitionistic fuzzy objects , most justified and used in applications are those based on the so-called score and accuracy functions. The observed multiplicity of these functions treatments and modifications indicates that the source of such a divergence is the impossibility to solve this problem exclusively in the framework of the A − I F S A−IFS . Therefore, to develop the reliable methods for the considered types of comparison, a redefinition of this problem based on the BP approach is proposed. This redefinition allows us to develop new two and three criteria methods for comparison of real, interval and fuzzy-valued intuitionistic fuzzy and BP numbers, based on the local criteria with transparent interpretation in the framework of the BP approach.},

While in general consequence relations represent a foundational structure that supports the mathematical study of reasoning, their graded / many-valued upgrade provides mathematical foundations specifically for approximate reasoning. Our study is developed at the abstract level of institution theory of Goguen and Burstall which is an axiomatic and categorical approach to model theory. It consists of a development of new concepts – that are many-valued – of interpolation, but also of Robinson joint-consistency and Beth definability , and of results that recover at the many-valued truth level the causality relations between these and interpolation, as known from the classical binary context.},

  abstract     = {The multi-scale decision information system (MDIS) is a typical granular computing model. In the research of MDIS, uncertainty is an important factor in making decision analysis , and the selection of optimal scale is a core problem. Therefore, the uncertainty of decision is an important factor in the scale selection. With the rapid increase of data size, the amount of feature information will increase greatly, and the uncertainty of the system will become more and more complex, which makes the optimal scale selection more difficult. The purpose of this study is to investigate the updating law of the local optimal scale under the condition of the dynamic increase of objects. The criterion of scale selection is to keep the uncertainty of the system unchanged. Firstly, the updating law of uncertainty for the decision class in a decision information system under the case of object increment is explored. Secondly, the definition of local optimal scale which keeps the uncertainty of decision classes is given by the sequential three-way decision theory, and the updating law of optimal scale is given by using the updating mechanism of the uncertainty of decision classes. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method in the calculation of local optimal scale by comparing the algorithms for adding multiple objects directly and adding objects one by one.},

  abstract     = {Due to the successful applications in abundant practical application problems involving fuzzy sets and systems, overlap functions on unit closed interval have attracted continuous attentions of many scholars since they were proposed. In particular, recently, the author extended the concept of overlap functions on unit closed interval to the so-called quasi-overlap functions on bounded partially ordered sets . In this paper, we pay attention to the extension constructions of quasi-overlap functions and their derivative concepts on function spaces with bounded partially ordered sets as underlying sets. Specifically, first, based on quasi-overlap functions and their derivative concepts on any bounded partially ordered set, we give the way to construct quasi-overlap functions and their derivative concepts on function space composed of all fuzzy sets with that bounded partially ordered set as the truth values set along with the function space composed of all order-preserving functions from arbitrary sup semilattice to that bounded partially ordered set, respectively. Second, we introduce the concepts of representable quasi-overlap functions and representable derivative concepts of quasi-overlap functions on function spaces and obtain their equivalent characterizations. Third, we discuss some vital properties of representable quasi-overlap functions and representable derivative concepts of quasi-overlap functions on function spaces. Fourth, it should be mentioned that the obtained results cover the cases of quasi-overlap functions and their derivative concepts on function spaces composed of all interval-valued fuzzy sets and type-2 fuzzy sets when the underlying bounded partially ordered set is taken as the corresponding truth values set, respectively.},

According to their shared ratings, we can form different types of agent coalitions and, similarly, different types of issue bundles (i.e., families of issues to be considered together). The main objective of this paper is to introduce and investigate connections of agent coalitions and issue bundles from Wille formal concept analysis perspectives. By interpreting a three-valued rating table as four different formal contexts, we introduce four types of agent coalitions, namely, support, non-opposition, opposition, and non-support coalitions, the corresponding four types of issue bundles, and four lattices of coalition-bundle couplings. The lattices reveal structural information of agents and issues in a conflict situation. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model, we analyze the problem of development planning of the Gansu Province of China.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the fuzzy clustering of interval time series using wavelet variances and covariances; in particular, we use a fuzzy c-medoids clustering algorithm . Traditional hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering methods lead to the identification of mutually exclusive clusters whereas fuzzy clustering methods enable the identification of overlapping clusters, implying that one or more series could belong to more than one cluster simultaneously. An interval time series (ITS) which arises when interval-valued observations are recorded over time is able to capture the variability of values within each interval at each time point . This is in contrast to single-point information available in a classical time series. Our main contribution is that by combining wavelet analysis , interval data analysis and fuzzy clustering, we are able to capture information which would otherwise have not been contemplated by the use of traditional crisp clustering methods on classical time series for which just a single value is recorded at each time point. Through simulation studies, we show that under some circumstances fuzzy c-medoids clustering performs better when applied to ITS than when it is applied to the corresponding traditional time series. Applications to exchange rates ITS and sea-level ITS show that the fuzzy clustering method reveals different and more meaningful results than when applied to associated single-point time series.},

  abstract     = {The theory of three-way decision has contributed to data science in many topics, such as three-way classification, three-way clustering, and three-way feature selection. Most three-way decision models are formulated based on evaluation functions that commonly consider two opposite aspects of positive and negative, alliance and conflict, etc. This idea coincides with the concept of bipolarity, which studies the two opposite poles of positive and negative. However, the connections between bipolarity and three-way decision models have not been well investigated, despite the fact that they share many common features. Therefore, this work explores their relationships and proposes a new bipolar three-way decision model. Firstly, we examine the connections between the polarity theory, including the concepts of unipolarity and bipolarity, and decision models, including the two-way and three-way decision models. The examination suggests a lack of a three-way decision model corresponding to certain types of bipolarity. Thus, secondly, we propose a new bipolar three-way decision model 3WD- ( e p , e n ) 2 , which considers a pair of a positive evaluation function e p and a negative evaluation function e n and applies a pair of thresholds on each function. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of 3WD- ( e p , e n ) 2 in data science through its application in analyzing incomplete data. In particular, we present a computational formulation based on similarity classes and a conceptual formulation based on a conjunctive description language. The two formulations together provide a multi-view understanding of the approach.},

Based on these criteria, a family of graded labelling-based semantics are defined. Moreover, by introducing the transition functions between graded labellings and extensions, the relationships between them are explored and a number of representation theorems are given, which provides the theoretical foundations for solving computational problems (e.g., the acceptance decision and extension enumeration problems) related to graded extensions based on labellings.},

The beta-Bézier OWA operator provides an infinite number of weight vectors for a fixed degree of orness. The orness value of this class of OWA operators is its most essential characteristic, which always depends on one of its parameters, and can be prefixed according to the decision-maker choice and also irrespective of the number of arguments aggregated. The optimum OWA weight vector can be calculated without solving a complicated optimization problem . It becomes the same as several other OWA operators at particular values of parameters. The maximum Bayesian entropy OWA operator weight vector is measured with use of the proposed OWA operator for a given level of optimism/pessimism (orness).

Moreover, by borrowing ideas from machine learning , we show the possibility of defining a feature mapping , which allows us to reformulate the above nonlinear classification problems as linear ones in higher-dimensional spaces.
