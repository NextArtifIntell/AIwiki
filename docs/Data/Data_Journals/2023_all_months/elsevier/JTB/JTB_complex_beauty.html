  abstract     = {Lymph nodes (LNs) serve as a sanctuary site for HIV viruses due to the heterogeneous distribution of the antiretrovirals (ARVs) inside the LNs. There is an ongoing debate whether this represents ongoing cycles of viral replication in the LNs or merely residual virus production by latently infected cells. Previous work has claimed that the measured levels of genetic variation in proviruses sampled from the blood were inconsistent with ongoing replication. However, it is not clear what rate of variation is consistent with ongoing replication in small sanctuary sites. In this study, we used a spherically symmetric compartmental ODE model to track the HIV viral dynamics in the LN and predict the contribution of ongoing replication within the LN to the whole-body proviral pool in an ARV-suppressed person living with HIV. This model tracks the reaction–diffusion dynamics of uninfected, actively infected, and latently infected T-cells as well as free virus within the LN parenchyma and the blood, and distinguishes between latently infected cells created before ARV therapy and during ARV therapy. We simulated suppressive therapy beginning in year 5 post-infection. Each LN sanctuary site had a volume of 1 ml, and we considered cases of 1 ml, 30 ml, and 250 ml total volume, which represent a single active sanctuary site, moderate systemic involvement, and involvement of the total lymphoid tissue. Viral load in the blood rapidly dropped and remained below the limit of detection in all cases but remained high in the LN sanctuary sites. Novel latent cells increased systemically over time but very slowly, taking between 25 and 50 years to reach 5\% of the total latent pool, depending on the volume of lymphoid tissue involvement. Putative sanctuary sites in LNs are limited in volume and produce novel latent cells slowly. Assays to detect genetic drift due to such sites would require very deep sequencing if sampling only from the blood. Previous studies showing a lack of genetic drift are consistent with the expected contribution of ongoing replication in lymph node sanctuary sites.},

  abstract     = {The three-dimensional (3D) morphologies of many organs in organisms, such as the curved shapes of leaves and flowers, the branching structure of lungs, and the exoskeletal shape of insects, are formed through surface growth. Although differential growth, a mode of surface growth, has been qualitatively identified as 3D morphogenesis, a quantitative understanding of the mechanical contribution of differential growth is lacking. To address this, we developed a quantitative inference method to analyze the distribution of the area expansion rate, which governs the growth of surfaces into 3D morphology. To validate the accuracy of our method, we tested it on a basic 3D morphology that allowed for the theoretical derivation of the area expansion rate distribution, and then assessed the difference between the predicted outcome and the theoretical solution. We also applied this method to complex 3D shapes and evaluated its accuracy through numerical experiments. The findings of the study revealed a linear decrease in error on a log–log scale with an increase in the number of meshes in both evaluations. This affirmed the reliability of the predictions for meshes that are sufficiently refined. Moreover, we employed our methodology to analyze the developmental process of the Japanese rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus , which is characterized by differential growth regulating 3D morphogenesis. The results indicated a notably high rate of area expansion on the left and right edges of the horn primordium, which is consistent with the experimental evidence of a higher rate of cell division in these regions. Hence, these findings confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in analyzing biological systems.},

Furthermore, the usefulness of mathematical modeling in deciphering underlying dynamics of the brain to investigate lactate roles and mechanisms of action has been well established. Here, we analyze a novel mathematical model of brain lactate exchanges between four compartments: neurons, astrocytes, capillaries, and extracellular space. A system of four ordinary differential equations is proposed to explain interactions between these compartments. We first optimize and analyze the model’s parameters under normal, resting state conditions, and then use it to simulate changes linked to elevated arterial lactate. Our results show that even though increased arterial lactate results in increased uptake by astrocytes and release to the extracellular space, it cannot strongly recover the initial drop in neuronal lactate concentration. Also, we show that the direction of lactate transport between the compartments is influenced by the maximum astrocyte production rate and the transport rate between astrocytes and extracellular space.},

The use of optimal control strategies involving information campaigns about insect repellents and condoms alongside an available safe and effective vaccine can prevent the number of infected humans with ZIKV. A system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is formulated for the transmission dynamics of ZIKV in the presence of three control strategies to evaluate the impact of various scenarios during a ZIKV epidemic. In addition, we estimate parameters using weekly incidence data from previous ZIKV outbreaks in Colombia and Puerto Rico to capture the dynamics of an epidemic in each country when control measures are available. The basic reproduction number , R 0 R0 , of each country is calculated using estimated parameters (without the controls). The vector-borne transmission threshold ( R v Rv ) is dominant in both countries, but the sexual transmission threshold ( R d Rd ) in Colombia is considerably higher than in Puerto Rico. Numerical simulations for Colombia show that the most effective strategies are to use three controls since the start of the outbreak. However, for Puerto Rico only information campaigns about mosquito repellents and vaccination are the most effective ways to mitigate the epidemic.},

The nodes located on a cell’s membrane are subject to a force which is proportional to the gradient of the concentration of the chemical signal which mimics the behaviour of the chemical receptors in the cell’s membrane. In particular, the model developed here will consider what happens when two (or more) cells collide and how their membranes connect to each other to form clusters of cells.

The heterogeneity affects cell growth behaviors, which can result in departure from the idealized uniform exponential growth of the cell population. Here we measured the stochastic time courses of growth of an ensemble of populations of HL60 leukemia cells in cultures, starting with distinct initial cell numbers to capture a departure from the uniform exponential growth model for the initial growth (“take-off”). Despite being derived from the same cell clone, we observed significant variations in the early growth patterns of individual cultures with statistically significant differences in growth dynamics, which could be explained by the presence of inter-converting subpopulations with different growth rates, and which could last for many generations. Based on the hypothesis of existence of multiple subpopulations, we developed a branching process model that was consistent with the experimental observations.},

First, the risks of HIV infection among men who have contacts with infected men or infected women decrease annually. Second, the number of contacts between susceptible FSWC and infected FSW per unit time is greater than that between susceptible MSM and infected MSM, and also greater than that between susceptible FSW and infected FSWC, which suggests that the intervention for commercial sex of heterosexual men should be strengthened. Third, the effective reproduction numbers of the MSM group and non-commercial sex group decrease annually, while the effective reproduction number of the commercial sex group decreases first, then increases, because the risk of women being infected by men decreases first, then increases. Additionally, the effective reproduction number of the commercial sex group exceeds that of the MSM group after 2015, which indicates that commercial sex contributes more and more to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.},

To know how this process is affected by random fluctuations and events within a cell is of utmost importance to better understand the underlying dynamics and predict possible phenotype transitions. For this purpose, we develop a stochastic modeling approach for the macrophage polarization process. We classify phenotype states using the Robust Perron Cluster Analysis and quantify transition pathways and probabilities by applying Transition Path Theory. Depending on the model parameters, we identify four bistable and one tristable phenotype configuration. We find that bistable transitions are fast but their states less robust. In contrast, phenotype transitions in the tristable situation have a comparatively long time duration, which reflects the robustness of the states. The results indicate parallels in the overall transition behavior of macrophage cells with other heterogeneous and plastic cell types, such as cancer cells. Our approach allows for a probabilistic interpretation of macrophage phenotype transitions and biological inference on phenotype robustness. In general, the methodology can easily be adapted to other systems where random state switches are known to occur.},

  abstract     = {One of the most commonly used approaches for treating solid tumors is the systemic delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, our understanding of the factors influencing treatment efficacy through this method is still limited. This study presents a comprehensive and realistic mathematical model that incorporates the dynamics of tumor growth, capillary network extension, and drug delivery in a coupled and simultaneous manner. The model covers two stages of tumor growth: avascular and vascular. For tumor growth, a continuum model is employed using the phase field interface-capturing method. The neo-vascularization process is modeled using a hybrid discrete-continuum approach. Additionally, a multi-scale model is used to describe the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, considering various agents. The study investigates the effect of haptotaxis and reveals that a higher haptotaxis coefficient leads to faster tumor growth (up to 2.6 times) and a quicker progression to angiogenesis . The impact of tumor-related and drug-related parameters is also examined, including tumor size, tumor sensitivity to the drug, chemotherapy initialization, treatment cycle duration, drug affinity to cells, and drug dose. The findings indicate that chemotherapy is more effective during the angiogenesis stage when active loops have formed. Other clinical methods such as radiotherapy and surgery may be more appropriate during the avascular stage or the transition period between angiogenesis initialization and loop formation. The penetration depth of the drug decreases by approximately 50\% with an increase in the drug binding rate to surface-cell receptors. As a result, high-associate-rate drugs are preferred for chemotherapy after active loops have formed, while low-associate-rate drugs are suitable for earlier stages.},

  abstract     = {Elementary flux modes (EFMs) are minimal, steady state pathways characterizing a flux network. Fundamentally, all steady state fluxes in a network are decomposable into a linear combination of EFMs. While there is typically no unique set of EFM weights that reconstructs these fluxes, several optimization-based methods have been proposed to constrain the solution space by enforcing some notion of parsimony. However, it has long been recognized that optimization-based approaches may fail to uniquely identify EFM weights and return different feasible solutions across objective functions and solvers. Here we show that, for flux networks only involving single molecule transformations, these problems can be avoided by imposing a Markovian constraint on EFM weights. Our Markovian constraint guarantees a unique solution to the flux decomposition problem, and that solution is arguably more biophysically plausible than other solutions. We describe an algorithm for computing Markovian EFM weights via steady state analysis of a certain discrete-time Markov chain , based on the flux network, which we call the cycle-history Markov chain. We demonstrate our method with a differential analysis of EFM activity in a lipid metabolic network comparing healthy and Alzheimer’s disease patients. Our method is the first to uniquely decompose steady state fluxes into EFM weights for any unimolecular metabolic network.},

  abstract     = {We consider the uniaxial growth of a tissue or colony of cells, where a nutrient (or some other chemical) required for cell proliferation is supplied at one end, and is consumed by the cells. An example would be the growth of a cylindrical yeast colony in the experiments described by Vulin et al. (2014). We develop a reaction–diffusion model of this scenario which couples nutrient concentration and cell density on a growing domain. A novel element of our model is that the tissue is assumed to be compressible. We define replicative regions, where cells have sufficient nutrient to proliferate, and quiescent regions, where the nutrient level is insufficient for this to occur. We also define pathlines, which allow us to track individual cell paths within the tissue. We begin our investigation of the model by considering an incompressible tissue where cell density is constant before exploring the solution space of the full compressible model. In a large part of the parameter space, the incompressible and compressible models give qualitatively similar results for both the nutrient concentration and cell pathlines, with the key distinction being the variation in density in the compressible case. In particular, the replicative region is located at the base of the tissue, where nutrient is supplied, and nutrient concentration decreases monotonically with distance from the nutrient source. However, for a highly-compressible tissue with small nutrient consumption rate, we observe a counter-intuitive scenario where the nutrient concentration is not necessarily monotonically decreasing, and there can be two replicative regions. For parameter values given in the paper by Vulin et al. (2014), the incompressible model slightly overestimates the colony length compared to experimental observations; this suggests the colony may be somewhat compressible. Both incompressible and compressible models predict that, for these parameter values, cell proliferation is ultimately confined to a small region close to the colony base.},

While many predictive methods may use deep learning or stochastic processes , we highlight a long standing mathematical concept that may be useful for modeling metastatic breast cancer systems. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can model cell state transitions by considering the pertinent environmental variables as well as the paths systems take over time. Bifurcation theory is a branch of dynamical systems which studies changes in the behavior of an ODE system while one or more parameters are varied. Many studies have applied concepts in one-parameter bifurcation theory to model biological network dynamics, and cell division. However, studies of two-parameter bifurcations are much more rare. Two-parameter bifurcations have not been studied in metastatic systems. Here we show how a specific two-parameter bifurcation phenomenon called a cusp bifurcation separates two qualitatively different metastatic cell state transitions modalities and propose a new perspective on defining such transitions based on mathematical theory. We hope the observations and verification methods detailed here may help in the understanding of metastatic potential from a basic biological perspective and in clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {We study evolutionary game dynamics in a growing habitat with vacancies. Fitness is determined by the global effect of the environment and a local prisoner’s dilemma among neighbors. We study population growth on a one-dimensional lattice and analyze how the environment affects evolutionary competition. As the environment becomes harsh, an absorbing phase transition from growing populations to extinction occurs. The transition point depends on which strategies are present in the population. In particular, we find a ‘cooperative window’ in parameter space, where only cooperators can survive. A mutant defector in a cooperative community might briefly proliferate, but over time naturally occurring vacancies separate cooperators from defectors, thereby driving defectors to extinction. Our model reveals that vacancies provide a strong boost for cooperation by spatial selection.},

Group-living (GL) species are known to exploit inadvertent social information (ISI) that facilitates population persistence under predation risk. Still, the extent to which non-grouping (NG) prey can benefit from similar processes is unknown. Here we built an individual-based model to explore and compare the population-level consequences of ISI use in GL and NG prey. We differentiated between GL and NG prey only by the presence or absence of social attraction toward conspecifics that drives individual movement patterns. We found that the extent of the benefits of socially acquired predator information in NG highly depends on the prey’s ability to detect nearby predators, prey density and the occurrence of false alarms. Conversely, even moderate probabilities of ISI use and predator detection can lead to maximal population-level benefits in GL prey. This theoretical work provides additional insights into the conditions under which ISI use can facilitate population persistence irrespective of prey social organisation.},

  abstract     = {The concept of exergy in living organisms has been widely used to explore correlations between exergy and different physiological conditions. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal physiological condition that takes place inside the heart and is recognised as a common supraventricular arrhythmia. AF can significantly undermine heart function and subsequently circulatory system. Thus, exergy analysis of cardiac flow during AF is a procedure to quantify the long-term impact of persistent AF. The present study adopts the lumped modelling approach for considering cardiovascular circulation and thermoregulation of the body to evaluate the exergy consumption and destruction of the heart in AF. In order to assess the impact of AF, four common AF-associated characteristics including lack of atrial kick, left atrial remodelling, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and high-frequency fibrillation are examined. The results show that among AF deficiencies, high-frequency fibrillation is the main cause of exergy destruction of the heart during AF. Moreover, a novel ‘ exergy age index ’ is proposed which has shown that high fibrillatory conditions in AF can significantly accelerate the heart ageing process, which in turn substantiates AF’s adverse impact on the heart.},

In this work, we investigate the microscale mechanisms that produce different branched actin network structures using an iterative classification approach. First, we employ a simple yet comprehensive agent-based model that produces synthetic actin networks with precise control over the microscale dynamics. Then we apply machine learning techniques to classify actin networks based on measurable network density and geometry, identifying key mechanistic processes that lead to particular branched actin network architectures. Extensive computational experiments reveal that the most accurate method uses a combination of supervised learning based on network density and unsupervised learning based on network symmetry. This framework can potentially serve as a powerful tool to discover the molecular interactions that produce the wide variety of actin network configurations associated with normal development as well as pathological conditions such as cancer.},

Particularly, it is unclear what drives a plant towards Batesian mimicry or towards generalized food deception. We analysed the evolutionary game between a Model species with nectar-secreting flowers and a Deceiver species that provides no nectar who share pollinators for reproduction. We focused our analysis on the effect of similarity of floral signals between participating plants and on costs of nectar production. We defined payoffs in the game between Models and Deceivers as the stationary visitation frequencies to participating species with different signal similarities and nectar costs. Therefore, fitness payoff of each strategy was a product of complex interactions between plant species composing the community and the pollinators visiting them. Our model provides a unified framework in which consequences of Model species interaction with different deception modes can be compared. Our findings suggest that plant-pollinator systems, like other mutualistic systems, are prone to exploitation, and that exploitation may persist at a large range of conditions. We showed that floral similarity, and thus, pollinators’ ability to discriminate between Model and deceptive species, governs the stability of Batesian mimicry, while pollinator switching and sampling behaviour enables the persistence of general food deception.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical studies over the past decades have revealed various factors that favor or disfavor the evolution of dispersal. Among these, environmental heterogeneity is one driving force that can impact dispersal traits, because dispersing individuals can obtain a fitness benefit through finding better environments. Despite this potential benefit, some previous works have shown that the existence of spatial heterogeneity hinders evolution of dispersal. On the other hand, temporal heterogeneity has been shown to promote dispersal through a bet-hedging mechanism. When they are combined in a patch-structured population in which the quality of each patch varies over time independently of the others, it has been shown that spatiotemporal heterogeneity can favor evolution of dispersal. When individuals can use patch quality information so that dispersal decision is conditional, the evolutionary outcome can be different since individuals have options to disperse more/less offspring from bad/good patches. In this paper, we generalize the model and results of previous studies. We find richer dynamics including bistable evolutionary dynamics when there is arrival bias towards high-productivity patches. Then we study the evolution of conditional dispersal strategy in this generalized model. We find a surprising result that no offspring will disperse from a patch whose productivity was low when these offspring were born. In addition to mathematical proofs, we also provide intuition behind this initially counter-intuitive result based on reproductive-value arguments. Dispersal from high-productivity patches can evolve, and its parameter dependence behaves similarly, but not identically, to the case of unconditional dispersal. Our results unveil an importance of whether or not individuals can use patch quality information in dispersal evolution.},

  abstract     = {Double strand break (DSB) repair is critical to maintaining the integrity of the genome. DSB repair deficiency underlies multiple pathologies, including cancer, chromosome instability syndromes, and, potentially, neurodevelopmental defects. DSB repair is mainly handled by two pathways: highly accurate homologous recombination (HR), which requires a sister chromatid for template-based repair, limited to S/G2 phases of the cell cycle, and canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ), available throughout the cell cycle in which minimum homology is sufficient for highly efficient yet error-prone repair. Some circumstances, such as cancer, require alternative highly mutagenic DSB repair pathways like microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) and single-strand annealing (SSA), which are triggered to attend to DNA damage. These non-canonical repair alternatives are emerging as prominent drivers of resistance in drug-based tumor therapies. Multiple DSB repair options require tight inter-pathway regulation to prevent unscheduled activities. In addition to this complexity, epigenetic modifications of the histones surrounding the DSB region are emerging as critical regulators of the DSB repair pathway choice. Modeling approaches to understanding DSBs repair pathway choice are advantageous to perform simulations and generate predictions on previously uncharacterized aspects of DSBs response. In this work, we present a Boolean network model of the DSB repair pathway choice that incorporates the knowledge, into a dynamic system, of the inter-pathways regulation involved in DSB repair, i.e., HR, c-NHEJ, SSA, and MMEJ. Our model recapitulates the well-characterized HR activity observed in wild-type cells in response to DSBs. It also recovers clinically relevant behaviors of BRCA1/FANCS mutants, and their corresponding drug resistance mechanisms ascribed to DNA repair gain-of-function pathogenic variants. Since epigenetic modifiers are dynamic and possible druggable targets, we incorporated them into our model to better characterize their involvement in DSB repair. Our model predicted that loss of the TIP60 complex and its corresponding histone acetylation activity leads to activation of SSA in response to DSBs. Our experimental validation showed that TIP60 effectively prevents activation of RAD52, a key SSA executor, and confirms the suitable use of Boolean network modeling for understanding DNA DSB repair.},

Hamilton predicted that natural selection acting in male-haploid populations favours a ratio of males to females that is in accordance with the golden ratio. This prediction has found its way into the pages of one of the best-selling books of all time, Dan Brown’s 2003 novel The da Vinci Code , and is therefore in the running for the most widely known quantitative result in the history of evolutionary biology. Unfortunately, this golden-ratio result is wrong, and was later corrected by Hamilton, who showed that natural selection actually favours an unbiased sex ratio in this setting. But it has been unclear exactly how Hamilton arrived at the golden-ratio result in the first place. Here I show that the solution to this puzzle is found in unpublished work held in the British Library’s W. D. Hamilton Archive. Specifically, in addition to employing a faulty method for calculating relatedness, Hamilton had also employed a faulty method for calculating reproductive value, considering only genetic contributions to the next generation rather than to the distant future. Repeating both mistakes recovers his erroneous golden-ratio result.},

Therefore, life history and the mutation rate coevolve, but this coevolution is not well understood. We develop a mathematical model to analyse the evolution of resource allocation traits, which simultaneously affect life history and the deleterious mutation rate. First, we show that the invasion fitness of such resource allocation traits can be approximated by the basic reproductive number of the least-loaded class; the expected lifetime production of offspring without deleterious mutations born to individuals without deleterious mutations. Second, we apply the model to investigate (i) the coevolution of reproductive effort and germline maintenance and (ii) the coevolution of age-at-maturity and germline maintenance. This analysis provides two resource allocation predictions when exposure to environmental mutagens is higher. First, selection favours higher allocation to germline maintenance, even if it comes at the expense of life history functions, and leads to a shift in allocation towards reproduction rather than survival. Second, life histories tend to be faster, characterised by individuals with shorter lifespans and smaller body sizes at maturity. Our results suggest that mutation accumulation via the cost of germline maintenance can be a major force shaping life-history traits.},

Previous studies considered the direct degradation of products to the limiting substrate. In this study, we considered microbial growth during the stationary phase, which enables us to describe the dynamics precisely. The microbes were divided into two populations: one grew by consuming the limiting substrate and the other degraded the products by metabolism. According to the numerical analysis of our model, microbes may choose one of two strategies: one consumes substrates and expands quickly, and the other grows slowly while cleaning up the environment in which they thrive. Furthermore, we found three types of microbial growth depending on their ability to detect metabolite accumulation. Using experimentally measured data, this model can estimate the dynamics of cell density, the substrates, and the metabolites used. The model’s disentangling of growth curves offers novel interpretive possibilities for culture system dynamics.},

Three age groups are considered: young (0–19 years), adult (20–64 years), and elderly (65+ years). The transmission rate and reporting rate are determined for each group by utilizing the number of COVID-19 cases in the National Capital Region in the Philippines. Optimal control theory is employed to identify the best vaccine allocation to different age groups. Further, three different vaccination periods are considered to reflect phases of vaccination priority groups: the first, second, and third account for the inoculation of the elderly, adult and elderly, and all three age groups, respectively.

  abstract     = {A common side effect of pharmaceutical drugs is an increased propensity for cardiac arrhythmias. Many drugs bind to cardiac ion-channels in a state-specific manner, which alters the ionic conductances in complicated ways, making it difficult to identify the mechanisms underlying pro-arrhythmic drug effects. To better understand the fundamental mechanisms underlying the diverse effects of state-dependent sodium (Na + ) channel blockers on cellular excitability, we consider two canonical motifs of drug-ion-channel interactions and compare the effects of Na + channel blockers on the rate-dependence of peak upstroke velocity, conduction velocity, and vulnerable window size. In the literature, both motifs are referred to as “guarded receptor,” but here we distinguish between state-specific binding that does not alter channel gating (referred to here as “guarded receptor”) and state-specific binding that blocks certain gating transitions (“gate immobilization”). For each drug binding motif, we consider drugs that bind to the inactivated state and drugs that bind to the non-inactivated state of the Na + channel. Exploiting the idealized nature of the canonical binding motifs, we identify the fundamental mechanisms underlying the effects on excitability of the various binding interactions. Specifically, we derive the voltage-dependence of the drug binding time constants and the equilibrium fractions of channels bound to drug, and we then derive a formula that incorporates these time constants and equilibrium fractions to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms. In the case of charged drug, we find that drugs that bind to inactivated channels exhibit greater rate-dependence than drugs that bind to non-inactivated channels. For neutral drugs, the effects of guarded receptor interactions are rate-independent, and we describe a novel mechanism for reverse rate-dependence resulting from neutral drug binding to non-inactivated channels via the gate immobilization motif.},

  abstract     = {A key characteristic of acute communicable diseases is the infectiousness that varies over time as the infection dynamics evolve within a host, which influences the risk of transmission in different stages of the disease. Despite the evidence of time-varying transmission risk, most dynamic models of epidemics assume a constant transmission rate during the infectious period. Recent work has shown the difference in epidemic dynamics when this assumption is relaxed and different transmission rates are used by discretizing the infectious period into multiple sub-periods. Here, we develop an age-structured model to integrate a continuous time-varying transmission risk, based on an established correlation between the viral dynamics and infectiousness profile. Taking into account the natural history and parameter estimates of COVID-19 caused by the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate the difference in temporal epidemic dynamics when a continuous time-varying transmission probability is used as compared to multiple constant transmission probabilities. Our results show a significant difference between the incidence curves in terms of the magnitude and peak time, even when the reproduction number and total number of infections are the same for continuous and discrete transmission probabilities. Finally, we demonstrate the spurious outcome of preventing an epidemic through the isolation of infectious individuals when constant transmission probabilities are used, highlighting the importance of integrating a continuous time-dependent transmission parameter in dynamic models. These findings suggest a more cautious interpretation of model outcomes, especially those that are intended to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and inform policy decisions for disease mitigation strategies.},

Many clinical assessments incorporating immunotherapy with targeted mRNA of β − c a t e n i n β−catenin are costly endeavor. This paper develops novel mathematical models for different treatments by invoking available clinical data to calibrate models, along with the selection and evaluation of therapy strategies in a faster manner with lower cost. Firstly, in order to explore the interactions between cancer cells and the immune system within the tumor microenvironment, we construct different types of breast cancer treatment models based on RNA interference technique and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have been proved to be an effective combined therapy in pre-clinical trials associated with the inhibition of β − c a t e n i n β−catenin proteins to enhance intrinsic anti-tumor immune response. Secondly, various techniques including MCMC are adopted to estimate multiple parameters and thus simulations in agreement with experimental results sustain the validity of our models. Furthermore, the gradient descent method and particle swarm algorithm are designed to optimize therapy schemes to inhibit the growth of tumor and lower the treatment cost. Considering the mechanisms of drug resistance in vivo, simulations exhibit that therapies are ineffective resulting in cancer relapse in the prolonged time. For this reason, parametric sensitivity analysis sheds light on the choice of new treatments which indicate that, in addition to inhibiting β − c a t e n i n β−catenin proteins and improving self-immunity, the injection of dendritic cells promoting immunity may provide a novel vision for the future of cancer treatment. Overall, our study provides witness of principle from a mathematical perspective to guide clinical trials and the selection of treatment regimens.},

  abstract     = {There has been an increasing recognition of the utility of models of the spatial dynamics of viral spread within tissues. Multicellular models, where cells are represented as discrete regions of space coupled to a virus density surface, are a popular approach to capture these dynamics. Conventionally, such models are simulated by discretising the viral surface and depending on the rate of viral diffusion and other considerations, a finer or coarser discretisation may be used. The impact that this choice may have on the behaviour of the system has not been studied. Here we demonstrate that under realistic parameter regimes – where viral diffusion is small enough to support the formation of familiar ring-shaped infection plaques – the choice of spatial discretisation of the viral surface can qualitatively change key model outcomes including the time scale of infection. Importantly, we show that the choice between implementing viral spread as a cell-scale process, or as a high-resolution converged PDE can generate distinct model outcomes, which raises important conceptual questions about the strength of assumptions underpinning the spatial structure of the model. We investigate the mechanisms driving these discretisation artefacts, the impacts they may have on model predictions, and provide guidance on the design and implementation of spatial and especially multicellular models of viral dynamics. We obtain our results using the simplest TIV construct for the viral dynamics, and therefore anticipate that the important effects we describe will also influence model predictions in more complex models of virus-cell-immune system interactions. This analysis will aid in the construction of models for robust and biologically realistic modelling and inference.},

This coupled ventilation-gas diffusion model is driven by the sole action of the respiratory muscles . We analyse its sensitivity with respect to characteristic parameters: the resistance of the bronchial tree, the elastance of the lung tissue and the oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion coefficients of the alveolo-capillary membrane.

In addition, this emerging phenomenon is responsible for many biological processes, and thus, the synchronization of interacting neurons is an important field of study in neuroscience. Employing the memristive Chialvo (mChialvo) neuron map, this paper investigates the effect of electrical, inner-linking, chemical, and hybrid coupling functions on the synchronization state of a neuronal network with regular structure. Master stability function (MSF) analysis is performed to obtain the necessary conditions for synchronizing the built networks. Afterward, the MSF-based results are confirmed by calculating the synchronization error. Besides, the dynamics of the synchronous neurons are discussed based on the bifurcation analysis. Our results suggest that, compared to the electrical and inner-linking functions, chemical synapses facilitate mChialvo neurons’ synchronization since the neurons can achieve synchrony with a negligible chemical coupling strength. Further studies reveal that based on the active synapses, coupled mChialvo neurons can reach cluster synchronization, chimera state, sine-like synchronization, phase synchronization, and cluster phase synchronization.},

  abstract     = {The renin-angiotensin systems play pivotal role in cardiovascular physiology through its effects on regulating blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Components of circulating RAS (cRAS) that include precursor angiotensinogen, two critical enzymes (renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE), their bioactive products, angiotensin- I, II together with its receptors (AT1R and AT2R) essentially determine this homeostasis. Most classical studies, however, showed the deleterious role of cRAS in elevating the blood pressure. Contemporary discovery of non-canonical components of the RAS has challenged this classic hypothesis that it can only exert deleterious effects on the cardiovascular systems. Using the classic cRAS model, we have designed in-silico experiments to test the hypothesis that AT2R-mediated feedback effects play pivotal role for maintaining the normal variation of the mean-arterial pressure (MAP).Beside the AT2R-mediation of downstream singling pathways consisting of several non-canonical RAS components, this study first time illustrated AT2R mediated feedback controls over the blood pressure regulation: one that impedes AT1R activity, and the other that downregulates renin. It has been shown that relatively stronger suppression of renin activity significantly contributes in maintaining the normal MAP and that tight AT2R-mediated regulation is relaxed in hyper-and hypotension. This control mechanism is noted to be robustly maintained with the MAP variations through an established linear steady-state relationship among renin, angiotensin I and angiotensin II. This examination suggests that AT2R-mediated downregulation of renin activities potentially counteracts the AT1R-mediated deleterious actions of Ang II. This study, therefore, provides a solid ground for considering different AT2 receptor adaptor protein and direct agonism at AT2R that can cause greater effects along with contemporary approaches of blocking AT1R mediation to attenuate hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders.},

For simplicity, we focus on layers 4C and 2/3 with both layers receiving direct thalamic inputs and layer 4C sending vertical projections to layer 2/3. Both the thalamic and the vertical connections are taken to be modifiable by activity. Using a correlation-based Hebbian learning rule with subtractive normalization, we show how the formation of an OD map in layer 4C is inherited by layer 2/3 via the vertical projections. Competition between these feedforward projections and the direct thalamic input to layer 2/3 then results in the formation of CO blobs superimposed upon the ocular dominance map. The spacing of the OD columns is determined by the spatial profile of the intralaminar connections within layer 4, while the spacing of CO blobs depends both on the width of the OD columns inherited from layer 4 and the spatial distribution of intralaminar connections within the superficial layer. The resulting CO blob distribution is shown to be consistent with experimental data. In addition, we numerically simulate monocular deprivation and find that while the CO blob distribution is unaltered, the OD pattern undergoes modification. The OD stripes of the deprived eye narrow, whereas the OD stripes for the remaining open eye widen.},

Here we consider eco-evolutionary dynamics where population size and distribution can change through birth, death and migration, all of which are separate processes. This allows complex interaction and migration behaviours that are dependent on competition. For migration, we assume that the response of individuals to competition is governed by tolerance to their group members, such that less tolerant individuals are more likely to move away due to competition. We look at the success of a mutant in the rare mutation limit for the complete, cycle and star networks. Unlike models with fixed population size and distribution, the distribution of the individuals per site is explicitly modelled by considering the dynamics of the population. This in turn determines the mutant appearance distribution for each network. Where a mutant appears impacts its success as it determines the competition it faces. For low and high migration rates the complete and cycle networks have similar mutant appearance distributions resulting in similar success levels for an invading mutant. A higher migration rate in the star network is detrimental for mutant success because migration results in a crowded central site where a mutant is more likely to appear.},

To explain this phenomenon, we design a simple model, which we call the signal runaway game. In this game, senders can express outrage at non-senders. Outrage functions as a second-order signal . By expressing outrage at non-senders, senders draw attention to their own signal, and benefit from its increased visibility. Using our model and a simulation, we show that outrage can stabilize uniform signals, and can lead signal costs to run away. Second-order signaling may explain why groups sometimes demand displays of commitment from all their members, and why these displays can entail extreme costs.},

Mathematical modeling is a well-suited approach to investigate the complex physiological processes involved in calcium regulation. While mathematical models have been developed to study calcium homeostasis in male rats, none have been used to investigate known sex differences in hormone levels nor the unique physiological states of pregnancy and lactation. Calcitriol , the active form of vitamin D , plays a key role in intestinal calcium absorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and bone remodeling. It has been shown that, when compared to age-matched male rats, females have significantly lower calcitriol levels. In this study we first seek to investigate the impact of this difference as well as other known sex differences on calcium homeostasis using mathematical modeling. Female bodies differ from male bodies in that during their lifetime they may undergo massive adaptations during pregnancy and lactation. Indeed, maternal adaptations impact calcium regulation in all mammals. In pregnant rodents, intestinal absorption of calcium is massively increased in the mother’s body to meet the needs of the developing fetus. In a lactating rodent, much of the calcium needs of milk are met by bone resorption , intestinal absorption, and renal calcium reabsorption. Given these observations, the goal of this project is to develop multi-scale whole-body models of calcium homeostasis that represents (1) how sex differences impact calcium homeostasis in female vs. male rats and (2) how a female body adapts to support the excess demands brought on by pregnancy and lactation. We used these models to quantify the impact of individual sex differences as well as maternal adaptations during pregnancy and lactation. Additionally, we conducted “what if” simulations to test whether sex differences in calcium regulation may enable females to better undergo maternal adaptations required in pregnancy and lactation than males.},

  abstract     = {Metastatic cascade is a multi-stage process that starts with separation of a cancer cell from the primary tumor and ends with the emergence of a detectable metastasis. In the process the initiator cancer cell enters the circulatory system (intravasates), flows with the blood, and exits the circulation (extravasates) into an organ or tissue. The time period between intravasation and extravasation constitutes the circulation stage of the metastatic cascade. This stage is unique in that it lends itself naturally to various non-invasive observations and measurements in an individual cancer patient. This creates an opportunity for gaining insight into metastasis, its mathematical modeling, and designing diagnostic/prognostic tools and new cancer therapies. Although mechanisms of intravasation, survival and extravasation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are very complex and largely unknown, mathematical modeling of the circulation stage of the metastatic cascade is facilitated by two inter-related factors: a relative simplicity of the circulatory network and the cyclic nature of blood flow. The article presents a single-subject stochastic model of CTC dynamics that leads to simple formulas, applicable to any homogeneous CTC population, for organ-specific extravasation probabilities, the distribution and expected value of the number, X , X, of circulation cycles completed by a CTC prior to extravasation, and the average circulation time. In particular, we found that the distribution of random variable X X is geometric G ( x ) , G(x), where parameter x x is measurable, at least in principle, in an individual subject. We also discuss implications of our results for cancer research and treatment.},

To explore the roles of the active cellular forces and the regulation of these forces, we developed an integrated vertex model that combines the regulation of morphogen expression with cell movements and tissue mechanics. Our results suggest that a successful furrow formation requires an apical tension gradient, decreased basal tension, and increased lateral tension, which corresponds to apical constriction , basal expansion, and apicobasal shortening respectively. Our model also considers the mechanical feedback which leads to an ectopic twist expression with external compression as observed in experiments. Our model predicts that ectopic invagination could happen if an external compressive gradient is applied.},

  abstract     = {Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a neuropathological condition involving propagating waves of neuronal silence, and is related to multiple diseases, such as migraine aura, traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, and cardiac arrest, as well as poor outcome of patients. While CSDs of different severity share similar roots on the ion exchange level, they can lead to different vascular responses (namely spreading hyperemia and spreading ischemia). In this paper, we propose a mathematical model relating neuronal activities to predict vascular changes as measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and fMRI recordings, and apply it to the extreme case of CSD, where sustained near-complete neuronal depolarization is seen. We utilize three serially connected models (namely, ion exchange, neurovascular coupling, and hemodynamic model) which are described by differential equations. Propagating waves of ion concentrations, as well as the associated vasodynamics and hemodynamics, are simulated by solving these equations. Our proposed model predicts vasodynamics and hemodynamics that agree both qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental literature. Mathematical modeling and simulation offer a powerful tool to help understand the underlying mechanisms of CSD and help interpret the data. In addition, it helps develop novel monitoring techniques prior to data collection. Our simulated results strongly suggest that fMRI is unable to reliably distinguish between spreading hyperemia and spreading ischemia, while NIRS signals are substantially distinct in the two cases.},

We carry out simulation analysis and derive an analytical model in terms of singlet, pair and triplet probabilities that describe the stochastic dynamics. Using a simple closure that approximates triplet probabilities by singlet and pair probabilities, we show that equilibrium singlet and pair probabilities can be analytically derived. The derived equilibrium properties successfully describe simulation results under a certain condition where the range of local colonization and the proportion of global colonization play key roles.

When cancer cells proliferate, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) reactive to the cancer-specific antigens are activated, suppressing the growth of cancer colonies. The immune reaction activated by a large cancer colony may suppress and eliminate smaller colonies. However, cancer cells mitigate immune reactions by slowing down the activation of CTLs in dendritic cells with regulatory T cells and by inactivating CTLs attacking cancer cells with immune checkpoints. If cancer cells strongly suppress the immune reaction, the system may become bistable, where both the cancer-dominated and immunity-dominated states are locally stable. We study several models differing in the distance between colonies and the migration speeds of CTLs and regulatory T cells. We examine how the domains of attraction for multiple equilibria change with parameters. Nonlinear cancer-immunity dynamics may produce a sharp transition from a state with a small number of colonies and strong immunity to one with many colonies and weak immunity, resulting in the rapid emergence of many cancer colonies in the same organ or metastatic sites.},

We apply the model to simulate epidemics, analyse the final distribution of the case fatality ratio, and define a basic reproductive number to determine the existence of a probabilistic phase transition for the dynamics.

  abstract     = {Cross-immunity, as an evolutionary driver, can contribute to pathogen evolution, particularly pathogen diversity. Healthcare interventions aimed at reducing disease severity or transmission are commonly used to control diseases and can also induce pathogen evolution. Understanding pathogen evolution in the context of cross-immunity and healthcare interventions is crucial for infection control. This study starts by modelling cross-immunity, the extent of which is determined by strain traits and host characteristics. Given that all hosts have the same characteristics, full cross-immunity between residents and mutants occurs when mutation step sizes are small enough. Cross-immunity can be partial when the step size is large. The presence of partial cross-immunity reduces pathogen load and shortens the infectious period inside hosts, reducing transmission between hosts and improving host population survival and recovery. This study focuses on how pathogens evolve through small and large mutational steps and how healthcare interventions affect pathogen evolution. Using the theory of adaptive dynamics, we found that when mutational steps are small (only full cross-immunity is present), pathogen diversity cannot occur because it maximises the basic reproduction number . This results in intermediate values for both pathogen growth and clearance rates. However, when large mutational steps are allowed (with full and partial cross-immunity present), pathogens can evolve into multiple strains and induce pathogen diversity. The study also shows that different healthcare interventions can have varying effects on pathogen evolution. Generally, low levels of intervention are more likely to induce strain diversity, while high levels are more likely to result in strain reduction.},

To elucidate these effects, we developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells and applied it to analyse recent in vitro data. SARS-CoV-2 can enter cells via two pathways, one using the host proteases Cathepsin B/L and the other using the host protease TMPRSS2. We found enhanced entry efficiency of the Omicron variant in cells where the original strain preferentially used Cathepsin B/L and reduced efficiency where it used TMPRSS2. The Omicron variant thus appears to have evolved to use the Cathepsin B/L pathway better but at the expense of its ability to use the TMPRSS2 pathway compared to the original strain. We estimated &gt;4-fold enhanced efficiency of the Omicron variant in entry via the Cathepsin B/L pathway and &gt;3-fold reduced efficiency via the TMPRSS2 pathway compared to the original or other strains in a cell type-dependent manner. Our model predicted that Cathepsin B/L inhibitors would be more efficacious and TMPRSS2 inhibitors less efficacious in blocking Omicron variant entry into cells than the original strain. Furthermore, model predictions suggested that drugs simultaneously targeting the two pathways would exhibit synergy. The maximum synergy and drug concentrations yielding it would differ for the Omicron variant compared to the original strain. Our findings provide insights into the cell entry mechanisms of the Omicron variant and have implications for intervention targeting these mechanisms.},

Metabolism, in turn, relies on the delivery of metabolites and removal of toxic byproducts through diffusion processes and the cerebral blood flow . A comprehensive mathematical model of brain metabolism should account not only for the biochemical processes and the interaction of neurons and astrocytes, but also the diffusion of metabolites. In the present article, we present a computational methodology based on a multidomain model of the brain tissue and a homogenization argument for the diffusion processes. In our spatially distributed compartment model, communication between compartments occur both through local transport fluxes, as is the case within local astrocyte-neuron complexes, and through diffusion of some substances in some of the compartments. The model assumes that diffusion takes place in the extracellular space (ECS) and in the astrocyte compartment. In the astrocyte compartment, the diffusion across the syncytium network is implemented as a function of gap junction strength. The diffusion process is implemented numerically by means of a finite element method (FEM) based spatial discretization, and robust stiff solvers are used to time integrate the resulting large system. Computed experiments show the effects of ECS tortuosity, gap junction strength and spatial anisotropy in the astrocyte network on the brain energy metabolism.},

This sensitivity manifests as markedly different community dynamics arising from saturating functional responses with nearly identical shapes but different mathematical expressions. Using a stochastic differential equation (SDE) version of the Rosenzweig–MacArthur model with the three functional responses considered by Fussmann &amp; Blasius (2005), I show that such sensitivity seems to be solely a property of ODEs or stochastic systems with weak noise. SDEs with strong environmental noise have by contrast very similar fluctuations patterns, irrespective of the mathematical formula used. Although eigenvalues of linearized predator–prey models have been used as an argument for structural sensitivity, they can also be an argument against structural sensitivity. While the sign of the eigenvalues’ real part is sensitive to model structure, its magnitude and the presence of imaginary parts are not, which suggests noise-driven oscillations for a broad range of carrying capacities. I then discuss multiple other ways to evaluate structural sensitivity in a stochastic setting, for predator–prey or other ecological systems.},

  abstract     = {The key role of electro-chemical signals in cellular processes had been known for many years, but more recently the interplay with mechanics has been put in evidence and attracted substantial research interests. Indeed, the sensitivity of cells to mechanical stimuli coming from the microenvironment turns out to be relevant in many biological and physiological circumstances. In particular, experimental evidence demonstrated that cells on elastic planar substrates undergoing periodic stretches, mimicking native cyclic strains in the tissue where they reside, actively reorient their cytoskeletal stress fibres. At the end of the realignment process, the cell axis forms a certain angle with the main stretching direction. Due to the importance of a deeper understanding of mechanotransduction , such a phenomenon was studied both from the experimental and the mathematical modelling point of view. The aim of this review is to collect and discuss both the experimental results on cell reorientation and the fundamental features of the mathematical models that have been proposed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The growth of many solid tumors has been found to be driven by chemo- and radiotherapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). A suitable therapeutic avenue in these cases may involve the use of a differentiating agent (DA) to force the differentiation of the CSCs and of conventional therapies to eliminate the remaining differentiated cancer cells (DCCs). To describe the effects of a DA that reprograms CSCs into DCCs, we adapt a differential equation model developed to investigate tumorspheres, which are assumed to consist of jointly evolving CSC and DCC populations. We analyze the mathematical properties of the model, finding the equilibria and their stability. We also present numerical solutions and phase diagrams to describe the system evolution and the therapy effects, denoting the DA strength by a parameter a d i f adif . To obtain realistic predictions, we choose the other model parameters to be those determined previously from fits to various experimental datasets. These datasets characterize the progression of the tumor under various culture conditions. Typically, for small values of a d i f adif the tumor evolves towards a final state that contains a CSC fraction, but a strong therapy leads to the suppression of this phenotype. Nonetheless, different external conditions lead to very diverse behaviors. For microchamber-grown tumorspheres, there is a threshold in therapy strength below which both subpopulations survive, while high values of a d i f adif lead to the complete elimination of the CSC phenotype. For tumorspheres grown on hard and soft agar and in the presence of growth factors, the model predicts a threshold not only in the therapy strength, but also in its starting time, an early beginning being potentially crucial. In summary, our model shows how the effects of a DA depend critically not only on the dosage and timing of the drug application, but also on the tumor nature and its environment.},

  abstract     = {Chemotherapeutic drugs are used to treat almost all types of cancer, but the intended response, i.e., elimination, is often incomplete, with a subset of cancer cells resisting treatment. Two critical factors play a role in chemoresistance: the p53 tumour suppressor gene and the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). These proteins have been shown to act synergistically to elicit cellular responses upon DNA damage induced by chemotherapy, yet, the mechanism is poorly understood. This study introduces a mathematical model characterising the apoptosis pathway activation by p53 before and after mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation upon treatment with the chemotherapy Doxorubicin (Dox). “In-silico” simulations show that the p53 dynamics change dose-dependently. Under medium to high doses of Dox, p53 concentration ultimately stabilises to a high level regardless of XIAP concentrations. However, caspase-3 activation may be triggered or not depending on the XIAP induction rate, ultimately determining whether the cell will perish or resist. Consequently, the model predicts that failure to activate apoptosis in some cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 might be due to heterogeneity between cells in upregulating the XIAP protein, rather than due to the p53 protein concentration. Our model suggests that the interplay of the p53 dynamics and the XIAP induction rate is critical to determine the cancer cells’ therapeutic response.},

  abstract     = {The continual distress of COVID-19 cannot be overemphasized. The pandemic economic and social costs are alarming, with recent attributed economic loss amounting to billions of dollars globally. This economic loss is partly driven by workplace absenteeism due to the disease. Influenza is believed to be a culprit in reinforcing this phenomenon as it may exist in the population concurrently with COVID-19 during the influenza season. Furthermore, their joint infection may increase workplace absenteeism leading to additional economic loss. The objective of this project will aim to quantify the collective impact of COVID-19 and influenza on workplace absenteeism via a mathematical compartmental disease model incorporating population screening and vaccination. Our results indicate that appropriate PCR testing and vaccination of both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza may significantly alleviate workplace absenteeism. However, with COVID-19 PCR testing, there may be a critical threshold where additional tests may result in diminishing returns. Regardless, we recommend on-going PCR testing as a public health intervention accompanying concurrent COVID-19 and influenza vaccination with the added caveat that sensitivity analyses will be necessary to determine the optimal thresholds for both testing and vaccine coverage. Overall, our results suggest that rates of COVID-19 vaccination and PCR testing capacity are important factors for reducing absenteeism, while the influenza vaccination rate and the transmission rates for both COVID-19 and influenza have lower and almost equal affect on absenteeism. We also use the model to estimate and quantify the (indirect) benefit that influenza immunization confers against COVID-19 transmission.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal polarization, a process wherein nascent neurons develop a single long axon and multiple short dendrites, can occur within in vitro cell cultures without environmental cues. This is an apparently random process in which one of several short processes, called neurites , grows to become long, while the others remain short. In this study, we propose a minimum model for neurite growth, which involves bistability and random excitations reflecting actin waves. Positive feedback is needed to produce the bistability, while negative feedback is required to ensure that no more than one neurite wins the winner-takes-all contest. By applying the negative feedback to different aspects of the neurite growth process, we demonstrate that targeting the negative feedback to the excitation amplitude results in the most persistent polarization. Also, we demonstrate that there are optimal ranges of values for the neurite count, and for the excitation rate and amplitude that best maintain the polarization. Finally, we show that a previously published model for neuronal polarization based on competition for limited resources shares key features with our best-performing minimal model: bistability and negative feedback targeted to the size of random excitations.},

The 3D morphogenesis of these tissues is governed by cell dynamics, and a variety of mathematical modeling and simulation studies have been conducted to investigate this process. One promising approach is the cell-center model, which can account for the discreteness of cells. The cell nucleus , which is considered to correspond to the cell center, can be observed experimentally. However, there has been a shortage of cell-center models specifically tailored for simulating 3D monolayer tissue deformation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model based on the cell-center model to simulate 3D monolayer tissue deformation.

Increasing effort is being dedicated to design experimental protocols for selecting community-level functions of interest. These experiments typically involve selection acting on populations of communities, each of which is composed of multiple species. If numerical simulations started to explore the evolutionary dynamics of this complex, multi-scale system, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the process of artificial selection of communities is still lacking. Here, we propose a general model for the evolutionary dynamics of communities composed of a large number of interacting species, described by disordered generalised Lotka–Volterra equations. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that selection for scalar community functions leads to the emergence, along an evolutionary trajectory, of a low-dimensional structure in an initially featureless interaction matrix. Such structure reflects the combination of the properties of the ancestral community and of the selective pressure. Our analysis determines how the speed of adaptation scales with the system parameters and the abundance distribution of the evolved communities. Artificial selection for larger total abundance is thus shown to drive increased levels of mutualism and interaction diversity. Inference of the interaction matrix is proposed as a method to assess the emergence of structured interactions from experimentally accessible measures.},

Some families such as kinesin-8 Kip3 and kinesin-5 Eg5 are responsible for the regulation of MT length by depolymerizing or polymerizing the MT from the plus end and thus the motors are required to reside at the MT end for a long time. Under the crowded condition of the motors, it was found experimentally that the residence times of the kinesin-8 Kip3 and kinesin-5 Eg5 at the MT end are reduced greatly compared to the single-motor case. However, the underlying mechanism of different families of kinesin motors having different MT-end residence times is unknown. The molecular mechanism by which the interaction between the two motors greatly reduces the residence time of the motor at the MT end is elusive. In addition, during the processive stepping on the MT lattice, when two kinesin motors meet it is unknown how the interaction between them affects their dissociation rates. To address the above unclear issues, here we make a consistent and theoretical study of the residence times of the kinesin-1, kinesin-8 Kip3 and kinesin-5 Eg5 motors on the MT lattice and at the end under both the single-motor condition and multiple-motors or crowded condition.},

We explore the practicality of this alternate mitigation strategy and show that it can be achieved by varying the testing rate.

The accurate diagnosis and etiological analysis of CRC are crucial issues. Numerous methods have utilized gut microbiota to address these challenges; however, few have considered the complex interactions and individual heterogeneity of the gut microbiota, which are important issues in genetics and intestinal microbiology, particularly in high-dimensional cases. This paper presents a novel method called Binary matrix based on Logistic Regression (LRBmat) to address these concerns. The binary matrix in LRBmat can directly mitigate or eliminate the influence of heterogeneity, while also capturing information on gut microbial interactions with any order. LRBmat is highly adaptable and can be combined with any machine learning method to enhance its capabilities. The proposed method was evaluated using real CRC data and demonstrated superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the association rules extracted from the binary matrix of the real data align well with biological properties and existing literature, thereby aiding in the etiological analysis of CRC.},

  abstract     = {Many animals are known to exhibit foraging patterns where the distances they travel in a given direction are drawn from a heavy-tailed Lévy distribution. Previous studies have shown that, under sparse and random resource conditions, solitary non-destructive (with regenerating resources) foragers perform a maximally efficient search with Lévy exponent μ μ equal to 2, while for destructive foragers, efficiency decreases with μ μ monotonically and there is no optimal μ μ . However, in nature, there also exist situations where multiple foragers, displaying avoidance behavior , interact with each other competitively. To understand the effects of such competition, we develop a stochastic agent-based simulation that models competitive foraging among mutually avoiding individuals by incorporating an avoidance zone, or territory, of a certain size around each forager which is not accessible for foraging by other competitors. For non-destructive foraging, our results show that with increasing size of the territory and number of agents the optimal Lévy exponent is still approximately 2 while the overall efficiency of the search decreases. At low values of the Lévy exponent, however, increasing territory size actually increases efficiency. For destructive foraging, we show that certain kinds of avoidance can lead to qualitatively different behavior from solitary foraging, such as the existence of an optimal search with 1 1&amp;lt;μ&amp;lt;2 . Finally, we show that the variance among the efficiencies of the agents increases with increasing Lévy exponent for both solitary and competing foragers, suggesting that reducing variance might be a selective pressure for foragers adopting lower values of μ μ . Taken together, our results suggest that, for multiple foragers, mutual avoidance and efficiency variance among individuals can lead to optimal Lévy searches with exponents different from those for solitary foragers.},

  abstract     = {In food web models that include more than one prey type for a single predator, it is common for the predator’s functional response to include some form of switching—preferential consumption of more abundant prey types. Predator switching promotes coexistence among competing prey types and increases diversity in the prey community. Here, we show how the dynamics of a diamond-shaped food web model of a marine plankton community are sensitive to a parameter that sets the strength of predator switching. Stronger switching destabilizes the model’s coexistence equilibrium and leads to the appearance of limit cycles. Stronger switching also increases the evenness of the asymptotic prey community and promotes synchrony in the dynamics of disparate prey types. Given the dependence of model behavior on the strength of predator switching, it is important that modelers carefully consider the parameterization of functional responses that include switching.},

  abstract     = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), is one of the most damaging pests to coconut palms causing severe economic harm. Its expansion from Asia to the Pacific in the early 20th century has been stopped by virus control. However, a new haplotype CRB-Guam has recently escaped this control and invaded Guam, other Pacific islands, and has even established itself in the Western Hemisphere. In this paper, we present a compartmental ODE model of CRB population and control. We carefully consider CRB life stages and its interplay with coconut palms as well as “the green waste”, the organic matters used by CRB for breeding sites . We calibrate and validate the model based on data count of CRBs trapped in Guam between 2008 and 2014. We derive the basic reproduction number determining the CRB population growth without any control measures. We also identify control levels required to eliminate CRBs. We show that, in the absence of viable virus control, the sanitation, i.e., the removal of the green waste is the most efficient way to control the population. Our model predicts that the sanitation efforts need to roughly double from the current levels to eliminate CRB from Guam. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rare event like Typhoon Dolphin that hit Guam in 2015 can lead to a quick rise of the CRB population.},

  abstract     = {The successive emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations has led to an unprecedented increase in COVID-19 incidence worldwide. Currently, vaccination is considered to be the best available solution to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, public opposition to vaccination persists in many countries, which can lead to increased COVID-19 caseloads and hence greater opportunities for vaccine-evasive mutant strains to arise. To determine the extent that public opinion regarding vaccination can induce or hamper the emergence of new variants, we develop a model that couples a compartmental disease transmission framework featuring two strains of SARS-CoV-2 with game theoretical dynamics on whether or not to vaccinate. We combine semi-stochastic and deterministic simulations to explore the effect of mutation probability, perceived cost of receiving vaccines, and perceived risks of infection on the emergence and spread of mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains. We find that decreasing the perceived costs of being vaccinated and increasing the perceived risks of infection (that is, decreasing vaccine hesitation) will decrease the possibility of vaccine-resistant mutant strains becoming established by about fourfold for intermediate mutation rates. Conversely, we find increasing vaccine hesitation to cause both higher probability of mutant strains emerging and more wild-type cases after the mutant strain has appeared. We also find that once a new variant has emerged, perceived risk of being infected by the original variant plays a much larger role than perceptions of the new variant in determining future outbreak characteristics. Furthermore, we find that rapid vaccination under non-pharmaceutical interventions is a highly effective strategy for preventing new variant emergence, due to interaction effects between non-pharmaceutical interventions and public support for vaccination. Our findings indicate that policies that combine combating vaccine-related misinformation with non-pharmaceutical interventions (such as reducing social contact) will be the most effective for avoiding the establishment of harmful new variants.},

As a result, children progress faster towards AIDS in the absence of treatment. We used a classical ordinary differential equation model for viral infection dynamics to study why children have a lower viral contraction ratio than adults. We performed parameter sweeps to identify factors explaining the observed difference between children and adults. We grouped parameters associated with the host, the infection, or the immune response. Based on paediatric data available from datasets within the EPIICAL project ( https://www.epiical.org/ ), we refuted that viral replication rates differ between young children and adults, and therefore these cannot be responsible for the low VL contraction ratios seen in children. The major differences in lowering VL contraction ratio resulted from sweeping the parameters linked to the immune response. Thus, we postulate that an ”ineffective” (late and/or weak) immune response is the most parsimonious explanation for the higher setpoint VL in young children, and hence the reason for their fast disease progression.},

The variables and interactions included in the model are based on detailed consideration of available experimental data. A novel feature of the model is inclusion of cycle tasks such as origin licensing and initiation, nuclear envelope breakdown and kinetochore attachment, and their interactions with controllers (molecular complexes involved in cycle control). Other key features are that the model is autonomous, except for a dependence on external growth factors; the variables are continuous in time, without instantaneous resets at phase boundaries; mechanisms to prevent rereplication are included; and cycle progression is independent of cell size. Eight variables represent cell cycle controllers: the Cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 complex, APC Cdh1 , SCF βTrCP , Cdc25A, MPF, NuMA, the securin-separase complex, and separase. Five variables represent task completion, with four for the status of origins and one for kinetochore attachment. The model predicts distinct behaviors corresponding to the main phases of the cell cycle, showing that the principal features of the mammalian cell cycle, including restriction point behavior, can be accounted for in a quantitative mechanistic way based on known interactions among cycle controllers and their coupling to tasks. The model is robust to parameter changes, in that cycling is maintained over at least a five-fold range of each parameter when varied individually. The model is suitable for exploring how extracellular factors affect cell cycle progression, including responses to metabolic conditions and to anti-cancer therapies.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical forces applied over a period of time tend to cause fatigue failure in natural organisms and in engineering structures. Here, the theoretical approach known as Continuum Damage Mechanics is applied to study fatigue damage development in trees. It is found that growth in the form of an annual ring of new material is a very effective strategy to limit fatigue damage, due to the fact that, over time, each ring moves inside the trunk, reducing stress. If (as is generally assumed) the tree grows so as to keep the bending stress on its trunk constant, then fatigue failure will be effectively impossible until the tree is very old. One interpretation of this finding is that high cycle fatigue simply never occurs in trees: they don’t accumulate fatigue damage but rather fail by instantaneous overload or low cycle fatigue during a single storm. Another interpretation is that the bending stress is maybe not kept constant but changes as the tree grows, which would be a more efficient strategy making the best use of material. These findings are considered using data from the literature and their implications for the creation of biomimetic products are discussed. Possible experiments to test these theoretical predictions are suggested.},

While the IIT method experimentally ensured its effectiveness in several field works, the failure of female mosquito population control by replacement owing to the accidental contamination of Wolbachia -infected female mosquitoes has been a concern and an obstacle in implementing the IIT method in nature. In this study, we develop a population-based IIT mathematical model using cytoplasmic incompatibility and evaluate the effectiveness of the IIT method in scenarios where contamination is present or absent. In addition, by extending the model to assess the disease infection status of the human population with malaria, we evaluate the optimal release strategy and cost for successful disease control. Our study proves that IIT could be a promising method to control mosquito-borne diseases without perfect suppression of vector mosquito population regardless of contamination.},

  abstract     = {Recent theoretical work on phylogenetic birth–death models offers differing viewpoints on whether they can be estimated using lineage-through-time data. Louca and Pennell (2020) showed that the class of models with continuously differentiable rate functions is nonidentifiable: any such model is consistent with an infinite collection of alternative models, which are statistically indistinguishable regardless of how much data are collected. Legried and Terhorst (2022) qualified this grave result by showing that identifiability is restored if only piecewise constant rate functions are considered. Here, we contribute new theoretical results to this discussion, in both the positive and negative directions. Our main result is to prove that models based on piecewise polynomial rate functions of any order and with any (finite) number of pieces are statistically identifiable. In particular, this implies that spline-based models with an arbitrary number of knots are identifiable. The proof is simple and self-contained, relying mainly on basic algebra. We complement this positive result with a negative one, which shows that even when identifiability holds, rate function estimation is still a difficult problem. To illustrate this, we prove some rates-of-convergence results for hypothesis testing using birth–death models. These results are information-theoretic lower bounds which apply to all potential estimators.},

In this work, we use mathematical modeling to explore a possible functional role for the high degree of heterogeneity observed in cerebral capillary networks. Our results suggest that heterogeneity allows for a greater response of tissue oxygen levels to local changes in vessel diameters due to neuronal activation. This result is confirmed for a full 3-dimensional model of capillary networks that includes oxygen diffusion within the tissue region and a reduced model that accounts for changes in capillary blood flow.},

Moreover predictors of the expectations of the amounts of drugs being used can also be derived. This enables to design an efficient stochastic optimization framework that guarantees safe contraction of the tumor while minimizing a weighted sum of the quantities of the different drugs being used.

  abstract     = {Proper wound healing relies on invasion of fibroblasts via directed migration. While the related experimental and mathematical modeling literature has mainly focused on cell migration directed by soluble cues (chemotaxis), there is ample evidence that fibroblast migration is also directed by insoluble, matrix-bound cues (haptotaxis). Furthermore, numerous studies indicate that fibronectin (FN), a haptotactic ligand for fibroblasts, is present and dynamic in the provisional matrix throughout the proliferative phase of wound healing. In the present work, we show the plausibility of a hypothesis that fibroblasts themselves form and maintain haptotactic gradients in a semi-autonomous fashion. As a precursor to this, we examine the positive control scenario where FN is pre-deposited in the wound matrix, and fibroblasts maintain haptotaxis by removing FN at an appropriate rate. After developing conceptual and quantitative understanding of this scenario, we consider two cases in which fibroblasts activate the latent form of a matrix-loaded cytokine, TGFβ, which upregulates the fibroblasts’ own secretion of FN. In the first of these, the latent cytokine is pre-patterned and released by the fibroblasts. In the second, fibroblasts in the wound produce the latent TGFβ, with the presence of the wound providing the only instruction. In all cases, wound invasion is more effective than a negative control model with haptotaxis disabled; however, there is a trade-off between the degree of fibroblast autonomy and the rate of invasion.},

The innate immune system rapidly mounts a preliminary nonspecific defense, while the acquired immune system slowly develops microbe-killing specialists. These responses cause inflammation, and along with the pathogen cause direct and indirect tissue damage, which anti-inflammatory mediators seek to temper. This interplay of systems is credited for maintaining homeostasis but may produce unexpected results such as disease tolerance. Tolerance is characterized by the persistence of pathogen and damage mitigation, where the relevant mechanisms are poorly understood. In this work we develop an ordinary differential equations model of the immune response to infection in order to identify key components in tolerance. Bifurcation analysis uncovers health, immune- and pathogen-mediated death clinical outcomes dependent on pathogen growth rate. We demonstrate that decreasing the inflammatory response to damage and increasing the strength of the immune system gives rise to a region in which limit cycles, or periodic solutions, are the only biological trajectories. We then describe areas of parameter space corresponding to disease tolerance by varying immune cell decay, pathogen removal, and lymphocyte proliferation rates.},

  abstract     = {Recent evidence suggests that nongenetic (epigenetic) mechanisms play an important role at all stages of cancer evolution. In many cancers, these mechanisms have been observed to induce dynamic switching between two or more cell states, which commonly show differential responses to drug treatments. To understand how these cancers evolve over time, and how they respond to treatment, we need to understand the state-dependent rates of cell proliferation and phenotypic switching . In this work, we propose a rigorous statistical framework for estimating these parameters, using data from commonly performed cell line experiments, where phenotypes are sorted and expanded in culture. The framework explicitly models the stochastic dynamics of cell division, cell death and phenotypic switching, and it provides likelihood-based confidence intervals for the model parameters. The input data can be either the fraction of cells or the number of cells in each state at one or more time points. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that when cell fraction data is used, the rates of switching may be the only parameters that can be estimated accurately. On the other hand, using cell number data enables accurate estimation of the net division rate for each phenotype, and it can even enable estimation of the state-dependent rates of cell division and cell death. We conclude by applying our framework to a publicly available dataset.},

  abstract     = {In a series of experiments with yeast, classical dynamical models were fitted to populations that differed only in their initial population size (Pylvänäinen 2005). The results revealed a surprising dependence between estimated growth rate and initial population size. Perceived as an artefact, this undesired relationship was tentatively removed by an ad-hoc procedure. This strategy reflects the usual approach of population models in which parameters are not considered to depend on initial conditions. However, our analysis reveals that the observed relationship between estimated growth rate and initial population size is unavoidable when the dimension of a system is reduced. For the present case, the two-dimensional food-yeast system was reduced to a model for yeast only. The consequence of system reduction questions our conception of one-dimensional population models.},

  abstract     = {Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) play critical roles in shaping the immune responses of tumor cells (TCs) and are widely used in cancer immunotherapies . Quantitatively evaluating the effectiveness of these therapies are essential for the optimization of treatment strategies. Here, based on the combined therapy of melanoma with DC vaccines and ICIs, we formulated a mathematical model to investigate the dynamic interactions between TCs and the immune system and understand the underlying mechanisms of immunotherapy. First, we obtained a threshold parameter for the growth of TCs, which is given by the ratio of spontaneous proliferation to immune inhibition. Next, we proved the existence and locally asymptotic stability of steady states of tumor-free, tumor-dominant, and tumor-immune coexistent equilibria, and identified the existence of Hopf bifurcation of the proposed model. Furthermore, global sensitivity analysis showed that the growth of TCs strongly correlates with the injection rate of DC vaccines, the activation rate of CTLs , and the killing rate of TCs. Finally, we tested the efficacy of multiple monotherapies and combined therapies with model simulations. Our results indicate that DC vaccines can decelerate the growth of TCs, and ICIs can inhibit the growth of TCs. Besides, both therapies can prolong the lifetime of patients, and the combined therapy of DC vaccines and ICIs can effectively eradicate TCs.},

  abstract     = {Leprosy is a skin disease and it is characterized by a disorder of the peripheral nervous system which occurs due to the infection of Schwann cells. In this research article, we have formulated a four-dimensional ODE-based mathematical model which consists of the densities of healthy Schwann cells, infected Schwann cells, M. leprae bacteria, and the concentration of multidrug therapy (MDT). This work primarily aims on exploring the dynamical changes and interrelations of the system cell populations during the disease progression. Also, evaluating a critical value of the drug efficacy rate of MDT remains our key focus in this article so that a safe drug dose regimen for leprosy can be framed more effectively and realistically. We have examined the stability scenario of different equilibria and the occurrence of Hopf-bifurcation for the densities of our system cell populations with respect to the drug efficacy rate of MDT to gain insight on the precise impact of the efficiency rate on both the infected Schwann cell and the bacterial populations. Also, a necessary transversality condition for the occurrence of the bifurcation has been established. Our analytical and numerical investigations in this research work precisely explores that the process of demyelination, nerve regeneration, and infection of the healthy Schwann cells are the three most crucial factors in the leprosy pathogenesis and to control the M. leprae -induced infection of Schwann cells successfully, a more flexible version of MDT regime with efficacy rate varying in the range η ∈ ( 0 . 025 , 0 . 059 ) η∈(0.025,0.059) for 100 − 120 100−120 days in PB cases and 300 days in MB cases obtained in this research article should be applied.

  abstract     = {The mechanobiology of the human femoral neck is a focus of research for many reasons including studies that aim to curb age-related bone loss that contributes to a near-exponential rate of hip fractures. Many believe that the femoral neck is often loaded in rather simple bending, which causes net tension stress in the upper (superior) femoral neck and net compression stress in its inferior aspect (“T/C paradigm”). This T/C loading regime lacks in vivo proof. The “C/C paradigm” is a plausible alternative simplified load history that is characterized by a gradient of net compression across the entire femoral neck; action of the gluteus medius and external rotators of the hip are important in this context. It is unclear which paradigm is at play in natural loading due to lack of in vivo bone strain data and deficiencies in understanding mechanisms and manifestations of bone adaptation in tension vs. compression. For these reasons, studies of the femoral neck would benefit from being compared to a ‘control bone’ that has been proven, by strain data, to be habitually loaded in bending. The artiodactyl (sheep and deer) calcaneus model has been shown to be a very suitable control in this context. However, the application of this control in understanding the load history of the femoral neck has only been attempted in two prior studies, which did not examine the interplay between cortical and trabecular bone, or potential load-sharing influences of tendons and ligaments. Our first goal is to compare fracture risk factors of the femoral neck in both paradigms. Our second goal is to compare and contrast the deer calcaneus to the human femoral neck in terms of fracture risk factors in the T/C paradigm (the C/C paradigm is not applicable in the artiodactyl calcaneus due to its highly constrained loading). Our third goal explores interplay between dorsal/compression and plantar/tension regions of the deer calcaneus and the load-sharing roles of a nearby ligament and tendon, with insights for translation to the femoral neck. These goals were achieved by employing the analytical model of Fox and Keaveny (J. Theoretical Biology 2001, 2003) that estimates fracture risk factors of the femoral neck. This model focuses on biomechanical advantages of the asymmetric distribution of cortical bone in the direction of habitual loading. The cortical thickness asymmetry of the femoral neck (thin superior cortex, thick inferior cortex) reflects the superior-inferior placement of trabecular bone (i.e., “trabecular eccentricity,” TE). TE helps the femoral neck adapt to typical stresses and strains through load-sharing between superior and inferior cortices. Our goals were evaluated in the context of TE. Results showed the C/C paradigm has lower risk factors for the superior cortex and for the overall femoral neck, which is clinically relevant. TE analyses of the deer calcaneus revealed important synergism in load-sharing between the plantar/tension cortex and adjacent ligament/tendon, which challenges conventional understanding of how this control bone achieves functional adaptation. Comparisons with the control bone also exposed important deficiencies in current understanding of human femoral neck loading and its potential histocompositional adaptations.},

  abstract     = {The threat of large-scale pollinator decline is increasing globally under stress from multiple anthropogenic pressures. Traditional approaches have focused on managing endangered species at an individual level, in which the effect of complex interactions such as mutualism and competition are amiss. Here, we develop a coupled socio-mutualistic network model that captures the change in pollinator dynamics with human conservation opinion in a deteriorating environment. We show that the application of social norm (or conservation) at the pollinator nodes is fit to prevent sudden community collapse in representative networks of varied topology. Whilst primitive strategies have focused on regulating abundance as a mitigation strategy, the role of network structure has been largely overlooked. Here, we develop a novel network structure-mediated conservation strategy to find the optimal set of nodes on which norm implementation successfully prevents community collapse. We find that networks of intermediate nestedness require conservation at a minimum number of nodes to prevent a community collapse. We claim the robustness of the optimal conservation strategy (OCS) after validation on several simulated and empirical networks of varied complexity against a broad range of system parameters. Dynamical analysis of the reduced model shows that incorporating social norms allows the pollinator abundance to grow that would have otherwise crossed a tipping point and undergo extinction. Together, this novel means OCS provides a potential plan of action for conserving plant–pollinator networks bridging the gap between research in mutualistic networks and conservation ecology.},

  abstract     = {Virus evolution shapes the epidemiological patterns of infectious disease, particularly via evasion of population immunity. At the individual level, host immunity itself may drive viral evolution towards antigenic escape. Using compartmental SIR-style models with imperfect vaccination, we allow the probability of immune escape to differ in vaccinated and unvaccinated hosts. As the relative contribution to selection in these different hosts varies, the overall effect of vaccination on the antigenic escape pressure at the population level changes. We find that this relative contribution to escape is important for understanding the effects of vaccination on the escape pressure and we draw out some fairly general patterns. If vaccinated hosts do not contribute much more than unvaccinated hosts to the escape pressure, then increasing vaccination always reduces the overall escape pressure. In contrast, if vaccinated hosts contribute significantly more than unvaccinated hosts to the population level escape pressure, then the escape pressure is maximised for intermediate vaccination levels. Past studies find only that the escape pressure is maximal for intermediate levels with fixed extreme assumptions about this relative contribution. Here we show that this result does not hold across the range of plausible assumptions for the relative contribution to escape from vaccinated and unvaccinated hosts. We also find that these results depend on the vaccine efficacy against transmission, particularly through the partial protection against infection. This work highlights the potential value of understanding better how the contribution to antigenic escape pressure depends on individual host immunity.},

We show that when the IR model is fitted to pooled experimental murine data of the viral load, fraction of dead cells, and immune response levels, its parameters values can be determined. However, if, as is common, only viral load data are available, we can estimate parameters of the TEIV and TV models but not the IR model. These results are substantiated by a structural and practical identifiability analysis. We then use the IR model to generate synthetic data representing infections in hosts whose immune responses differ. We fit the TV model to these synthetic datasets and show that it can reproduce the characteristic exponential increase and decay of viral load generated by the IR model. Furthermore, the values of the fitted parameters of the TV model can be mapped from the immune response parameters in the IR model. We conclude that, if only viral load data are available, a simple target-cell limited model can reproduce influenza infection dynamics and distinguish between hosts with differing immune responses.},

  abstract     = {Despite years of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV persists in infected individuals. The virus also rebounds after the cessation of cART. The sources contributing to viral persistence and rebound are not fully understood. When viral rebound occurs, what affects the time to rebound and how to delay the rebound remain unclear. In this paper, we started with the data fitting of an HIV infection model to the viral load data in treated and untreated humanized myeloid-only mice (MoM) in which macrophages serve as the target of HIV infection. By fixing the parameter values for macrophages from the MoM fitting, we fit a mathematical model including the infection of two target cell populations to the viral load data from humanized bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) mice, in which both CD4+ T cells and macrophages are the target of HIV infection. Data fitting suggests that the viral load decay in BLT mice under treatment has three phases. The loss of infected CD4+ T cells and macrophages is a major contributor to the first two phases of viral decay, and the last phase may be due to the latent infection of CD4+ T cells. Numerical simulations using parameter estimates from the data fitting show that the pre-ART viral load and the latent reservoir size at treatment cessation can affect viral growth rate and predict the time to viral rebound. Model simulations further reveal that early and prolonged cART can delay the viral rebound after cessation of treatment, which may have implications in the search for functional control of HIV infection.},

To describe the opinion-transfer transient and collective behaviors in this scenario, this paper proposes an opinion-transfer susceptible-forwarding-immunized (OT-SFI) information cross-propagation model. Real multiple information in messages with opinions obtained from the Chinese Sina microblog is used for data fitting to illustrate how model parameters can be estimated and used to predict the accumulative numbers of users with a particular view. The study attempts to relate changes in group views in the network to initial opinion distribution and individuals&#39; opinion choices at the macro level. Furthermore, the model parameters at the micro level are used to measure the probability of “retention” and “reversal” of views in events, as well as the extent to which the masses are influenced by new information views. The result illustrates that the viewpoint distribution of the initial message and the opinion selection of the new message opinion leaders play crucial roles in promoting attention to the topic and driving for a desired collective opinion.},

This is not an easy task, as most fragmented ecosystems have trophic interactions involving many species and patches. Recent attempts to solve this challenge have introduced certain simplifying assumptions or focused on a limited set of examples. These simplifications make the models mathematically tractable but keep away from real-world problems. In this paper, we provide a novel methodology to describe the influence of the spatial topology on the total population size of the species when the dispersal rates are small. The main conclusion is that the influence of the spatial topology is the result of the influence of each path in isolation. Here, a path refers to a pairwise connection between two patches. Our framework can be readily used with any metacommunity, and therefore represents a unification of biological insights. We also discuss several applications regarding the construction of ecological corridors.},

Infection data from nasal swabs, nasal PCR assays, upper respiratory samples, ex vivo cell cultures and nasal epithelial organoids reveal extreme variabilities in SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers within and between the variants. Some variabilities are naturally prone to clinical testing protocols and experimental controls. Here we focus on nasal viral load sensitivity arising from the timing of sample collection relative to onset of infection and from heterogeneity in the kinetics of cellular infection, uptake, replication, and shedding of viral RNA copies. The sources of between-variant variability are likely due to SARS-CoV-2 structural protein mutations, whereas within-variant population variability is likely due to heterogeneity in cellular response to that particular variant. With the physiologically faithful, agent-based mechanistic model of inhaled exposure and infection from (Chen et al., 2022), we perform statistical sensitivity analyses of the progression of nasal viral titers in the first 0–48 h post infection, focusing on three kinetic mechanisms. Model simulations reveal shorter latency times of infected cells (including cellular uptake, viral RNA replication , until the onset of viral RNA shedding) exponentially accelerate nasal viral load. Further, the rate of infectious RNA copies shed per day has a proportional influence on nasal viral load. Finally, there is a very weak, negative correlation of viral load with the probability of infection per virus-cell encounter, the model proxy for spike-receptor binding affinity.},

  abstract     = {Humans and other primates exhibit pro-social preferences for fairness. These preferences are thought to be reinforced by strong reciprocity, a policy that rewards fair actors and punishes unfair ones. Theories of fairness based on strong reciprocity have been criticized for overlooking the importance of individual differences in socially heterogeneous populations. Here, we explore the evolution of fairness in a heterogeneous population. We analyse the Ultimatum Game in cases where players’ roles in the game are determined by their status. Importantly, our model allows for non-random pairing of players, and so we also explore the role played by kin selection in shaping fairness. Our kin-selection model shows that, when individuals condition their behaviour on their role in the game, fairness can be understood as either altruistic or spiteful. Altruistic fairness directs resources from less valuable members of a genetic lineage to more valuable members of the same lineage, whereas spiteful fairness keeps resources away from the competitors of the actor’s high-value relatives. When individuals express fairness unconditionally it can be understood as altruistic or selfish. When it is altruistic, unconditional fairness again serves to direct resources to high-value members of genetic lineages. When it is selfish, unconditional fairness simply improves an individual’s own standing. Overall, we expand kin-selection based explanations for fairness to include motivations other than spite. We show, therefore, that one need not invoke strong reciprocity to explain the advantage of fairness in heterogeneous populations.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19, induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, has caused an unprecedented pandemic in the world. New variants of the virus have emerged and dominated the virus population. In this paper, we develop a multi-strain model with asymptomatic transmission to study how the asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection influences the transmission between different strains and control strategies that aim to mitigate the pandemic. Both analytical and numerical results reveal that the competitive exclusion principle still holds for the model with the asymptomatic transmission. By fitting the model to the COVID-19 case and viral variant data in the US, we show that the omicron variants are more transmissible but less fatal than the previously circulating variants. The basic reproduction number for the omicron variants is estimated to be 11.15, larger than that for the previous variants. Using mask mandate as an example of non-pharmaceutical interventions, we show that implementing it before the prevalence peak can significantly lower and postpone the peak. The time of lifting the mask mandate can affect the emergence and frequency of subsequent waves. Lifting before the peak will result in an earlier and much higher subsequent wave. Caution should also be taken to lift the restriction when a large portion of the population remains susceptible. The methods and results obtained her e may be applied to the study of the dynamics of other infectious diseases with asymptomatic transmission using other control measures.},

  abstract     = {Estimating microbial mutation rates is an essential task in evolutionary biology, with wide range applications in related fields such as virology , epidemiology, clinic and public health, and antibiotic research. Significant progress has been made on this research since 1943 when Luria–Delbrück fluctuation analysis was first introduced. However, existing estimators of mutation rates are heavily reliant on model assumptions in fluctuation analysis, and become less applicable to real microbial experiments which deviate from the model assumptions. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to model fluctuation experimental data by a two-type Markov branching process (MBP) and use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate the mutation probability parameters. Such an ABC-based mutation rate estimator is based on intensive simulations from the mutation process, thereby taking advantage of modern computing power. Most importantly, its likelihood-free feature allows more complex and realistic setups of the mutation process, especially when the distribution of the number of mutants cannot be easily derived. To further improve computation efficiency, we use a Gaussian process surrogate to substitute the simulator in the ABC algorithm, and call the resulting estimator GPS-ABC. Simulation studies show that, when used to estimate constant mutation rate in MBP, ABC-based estimators generally outperform traditional moment or likelihood-based estimators. When mutations occur in two stages, i.e., in MBP with a piece-wise constant mutation rate function, traditional mutation rate estimators become not applicable, yet GPS-ABC still achieves reasonable estimates. Finally, the proposed GPS-ABC estimator is used to analyze real fluctuation experimental datasets for studying drug resistance.},

  abstract     = {Molecular motors are responsible for carrying cellular transport of various membranous vesicles or organelles along cytoskeletal tracks. Transport of cellular cargos require high forces that are generated by motors working in groups. Hence, the properties of cargo transport can be modulated by varying various parameters such as cargo size and shape, microtubule geometry, motor number and their arrangement on cargo surface. Only those motors which are present in the contact zone on cargo surface have potential to bind to microtubule. Although earlier studies revealed the importance of cargo size, total motors attached to microtubule and their arrangement on cargo transport, yet how the contact zone influences binding of motors to microtubule largely remains unexplored. Here, it has been shown that contact zone is elliptical in shape for a spherical cargo and increases with cargo size for Kinesin-1 motors. To further understand the combined effect of elliptical contact zone and microtubule geometry on cargo transport, 3D mean-field model with uniform and clustered arrangement of motors for different cargo sizes and motor number has been used. Our findings indicate that cylindrical microtubule geometry maximizes the microtubule-bound motors which enhances the runlength and velocity of cargo transport. Our results show that microtubule-bound motors decrease with cargo size for uniform arrangement of motors on cargo thus decreasing its runlength and velocity, whereas in clustered arrangement, the number of microtubule-bound motors increase with cargo size which leads to increase in runlength and velocity.},

In recent years, next-generation sequencing technology has provided a snapshot of such intra-organismal genetic variability. However, the dynamic processes underlying the accumulation and expansion of somatic mutations during the growth remain poorly understood. In this study, we constructed a model to describe these processes in a form that can be applied to a real tree. Given that the proliferation dynamics of meristematic cells vary across plant species, multiple possible processes for elongation and branching were comprehensively expressed in our model. Using published data from a poplar tree, we compared the prediction of the models with the observation and explained the cell lineage dynamics underlying somatic mutations accumulation that were not evident from the snapshot of the sequenced data. We showed that the somatic genetic drift during growth increases inter-meristem mosaicism, resulting in genetically distinct branches and less integrity within an individual tree. We also showed that the somatic genetic drift during branching leads to the mutation accumulation pattern that does not reflect the tree topology. Our modelling framework can help interpret and provide further insights into the empirical findings of genetic mosaicism in long-lived trees.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the role of natural selection in driving evolutionary change requires accurate estimates of the strength of selection acting at the genetic level in the wild. This is challenging to achieve but may be easier in the case of populations in migration-selection balance. When two populations are at equilibrium under migration-selection balance, there exist loci whose alleles are selected different ways in the two populations. Such loci can be identified from genome sequencing by their high values of F ST . This raises the question of what is the strength of selection on locally-adaptive alleles. To answer this question we analyse a 1-locus 2-allele model of a population distributed between two niches. We show by simulation of selected cases that the outputs from finite-population models are essentially the same as those from deterministic infinite-population models. We then derive theory for the infinite-population model showing the dependence of selection coefficients on equilibrium allele frequencies, migration rates, dominance and relative population sizes in the two niches. An Excel spreadsheet is provided for the calculation of selection coefficients and their approximate standard errors from observed values of population parameters. We illustrate our results with a worked example, with graphs showing the dependence of selection coefficients on equilibrium allele frequencies, and graphs showing how F ST depends on the selection coefficients acting on the alleles at a locus. Given the extent of recent progress in ecological genomics, we hope our methods may help those studying migration-selection balance to quantify the advantages conferred by adaptive genes.},

A well-described within-host model allows explicit simulation of how infectiousness changes over time at an individual level. This can then be coupled with dose–response models to investigate the impact of timing on transmission. We collected and compared a range of within-host models used in previous studies and identified a minimally-complex model that provides suitable within-host dynamics while keeping a reduced number of parameters to allow inference and limit unidentifiability issues. Furthermore, non-dimensionalised models were developed to further overcome the uncertainty in estimates of the size of the susceptible cell population, a common problem in many of these approaches. We will discuss these models, and their fit to data from the human challenge study (see Killingley et al. (2022)) for SARS-CoV-2 and the model selection results, which has been performed using ABC-SMC. The parameter posteriors have then used to simulate viral-load based infectiousness profiles via a range of dose–response models, which illustrate the large variability of the periods of infection window observed for COVID-19.},

Their focus on individual cell interactions makes them a particularly appropriate strategy to study cancer therapies’ effects, which are often designed to disrupt single-cell dynamics. In this work, we propose them as viable methods for studying the time evolution of cancer imaging biomarkers (IBM). We propose a cellular automata model for tumor growth and three different therapies: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, following well-established modeling procedures documented in the literature. The model generates a sequence of tumor images, from which a time series of two biomarkers: entropy and fractal dimension , is obtained. Our model shows that the fractal dimension increased faster at the onset of cancer cell dissemination. At the same time, entropy was more responsive to changes induced in the tumor by the different therapy modalities. These observations suggest that the prognostic value of the proposed biomarkers could vary considerably with time. Thus, it is essential to assess their use at different stages of cancer and for different imaging modalities. Another observation derived from the results was that both biomarkers varied slowly when the applied therapy attacked cancer cells scattered along the automatons’ area, leaving multiple independent clusters of cells at the end of the treatment. Thus, patterns of change of simulated biomarkers time series could reflect on essential qualities of the spatial action of a given cancer intervention.},

A stability analysis of the fixed points of the kinetic system is presented in details followed by the proof of existence of traveling wave solutions of the system of partial differential equations. The mathematical analysis leads to a biological interpretation. We distinguish three main cases of the disease state that correlate with the permeability of the endothelial layer. In fact, having a low permeability indicates the disease free state since no chronic inflammatory reaction occurs due to the non initiation of the inflammation. With intermediate permeability, a wave propagation corresponding to a chronic inflammatory reaction might occur whether the initial perturbation overcomes a threshold or not. With high permeability, even a small perturbation of the disease free state leads to a chronic inflammatory reaction represented by a wave propagation. We perform numerical simulations of the solutions to illustrate the biological results.},

  abstract     = {The intracranial pressure (ICP) curve with its different peaks has been comprehensively studied, but the exact physiological mechanisms behind its morphology has not been revealed. If the pathophysiology behind deviations from the normal ICP curve form could be identified, it could be vital information to diagnose and treat each single patient. A mathematical model of the hydrodynamics in the intracranial cavity over single heart cycles was developed. A Windkessel model approach was generalized but the unsteady Bernoulli equation was utilized for blood flow and CSF flow. This is a modification of earlier models using the extended and simplified classical Windkessel analogies to a model that is based on mechanisms rooted in the laws of physics. The improved model was calibrated with patient data for cerebral arterial inflow, venous outflow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and ICP over one heart cycle from 10 neuro-intensive care unit patients. A priori model parameter values were obtained by considering patient data and values taken from earlier studies. These values were used as an initial guess for an iterated constrained-ODE (ordinary differential equation) optimization problem with cerebral arterial inflow data as input into the system of ODEs. The optimization routine found patient-specific model parameter values that produced model ICP curves that showed excellent agreement with clinical measurements while model venous and CSF flow were within a physiologically acceptable range. The improved model and the automated optimization routine gave better model calibration results compared to previous studies. Moreover, patient-specific values of physiologically important parameters like intracranial compliance, arterial and venous elastance, and venous outflow resistance were determined. The model was used to simulate intracranial hydrodynamics and to explain the underlying mechanisms of the ICP curve morphology. Sensitivity analysis showed that the order of the three main peaks of the ICP curve was affected by a decrease in arterial elastance, a large increase in resistance to arteriovenous flow, an increase in venous elastance, or a decrease in resistance to CSF flow in the foramen magnum; and the frequency of oscillations were notably affected by intracranial elastance. In particular, certain pathological peak patterns were caused by these changes in physiological parameters. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other mechanism-based models associating the pathological peak patterns to variation of the physiological parameters.},

  abstract     = {Mesenchymal cell motility is mainly regulated by two members of the Rho-family of GTPases, called Rac and Rho. The mutual inhibition exerted by these two proteins on each other’s activation and the promotion of Rac activation by an adaptor protein called paxillin have been implicated in driving cellular polarization comprised of front (high active Rac) and back (high active Rho) during cell migration. Mathematical modeling of this regulatory network has previously shown that bistability is responsible for generating a spatiotemporal pattern underscoring cellular polarity called wave-pinning when diffusion is included. We previously developed a 6V reaction–diffusion model of this network to decipher the role of Rac, Rho and paxillin (along with other auxiliary proteins) in generating wave-pinning. In this study, we simplify this model through a series of steps into an excitable 3V ODE model comprised of one fast variable (the scaled concentration of active Rac), one slow variable (the maximum paxillin phosphorylation rate — turned into a variable) and a very slow variable (a recovery rate — also turned into a variable). We then explore, through slow–fast analysis, how excitability is manifested by showing that the model can exhibit relaxation oscillations (ROs) as well as mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) whose underlying dynamics are consistent with a delayed Hopf bifurcation with a canard explosion. By reintroducing diffusion and the scaled concentration of inactive Rac into the model, we obtain a 4V PDE model that generates several unique spatiotemporal patterns that are relevant to cell motility. These patterns are then characterized and their impact on cell motility are explored by employing the cellular potts model (CPM). Our results reveal that wave pinning produces purely very directed motion in CPM, while MMOs allow for meandering and non-motile behaviors to occur. This highlights the role of MMOs as a potential mechanism for mesenchymal cell motility.},

  abstract     = {Within-host SARS-CoV-2 modelling studies have been published throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. These studies contain highly variable numbers of individuals and capture varying timescales of pathogen dynamics; some studies capture the time of disease onset, the peak viral load and subsequent heterogeneity in clearance dynamics across individuals, while others capture late-time post-peak dynamics. In this study, we curate multiple previously published SARS-CoV-2 viral load data sets, fit these data with a consistent modelling approach, and estimate the variability of in-host parameters including the basic reproduction number , R 0 R0 , as well as the best-fit eclipse phase profile. We find that fitted dynamics can be highly variable across data sets, and highly variable within data sets, particularly when key components of the dynamic trajectories (e.g. peak viral load) are not represented in the data. Further, we investigated the role of the eclipse phase time distribution in fitting SARS-CoV-2 viral load data. By varying the shape parameter of an Erlang distribution, we demonstrate that models with either no eclipse phase, or with an exponentially-distributed eclipse phase, offer significantly worse fits to these data, whereas models with less dispersion around the mean eclipse time (shape parameter two or more) offered the best fits to the available data across all data sets used in this work.

  abstract     = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent lung disease characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling possibly induced by unusual interactions between fibrocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the peribronchial area. To investigate this phenomenon, we developed a probabilistic cellular automata type model where the two types of cells follow simple local interaction rules taking into account cell death, proliferation, migration and infiltration . We conducted a rigorous mathematical analysis using multiscale experimental data obtained in control and disease conditions to estimate the model’s parameters accurately. The simulation of the model is straightforward to implement, and two distinct patterns emerged that we can analyse quantitatively. In particular, we show that the change in fibrocyte density in the COPD condition is mainly the consequence of their infiltration into the lung during exacerbations, suggesting possible explanations for experimental observations in normal and COPD tissue. Our integrated approach that combines a probabilistic cellular automata model and experimental findings will provide further insights into COPD in future studies.},

  abstract     = {Predator–prey interactions are one of ecology’s central research themes, but with many interdisciplinary implications across the social and natural sciences. Here we consider an often-overlooked species in these interactions, namely parasites. We first show that a simple predator–prey–parasite model, inspired by the classical Lotka–Volterra equations, fails to produce a stable coexistence of all three species, thus failing to provide a biologically realistic outcome. To improve this, we introduce free space as a relevant eco-evolutionary component in a new mathematical model that uses a game-theoretical payoff matrix to describe a more realistic setup. We then show that the consideration of free space stabilizes the dynamics by means of cyclic dominance that emerges between the three species. We determine the parameter regions of coexistence as well as the types of bifurcations leading to it by means of analytical derivations as well as by means of numerical simulations. We conclude that the consideration of free space as a finite resource reveals the limits of biodiversity in predator–prey–parasite interactions, and it may also help us in the determination of factors that promote a healthy biota.},

  abstract     = {Local environmental interactions are a major factor in determining the success of a new mutant in structured populations. Spatial variations in the concentration of genotype-specific resources change the fitness of competing strategies locally and thus can drastically change the outcome of evolutionary processes in unintuitive ways. The question is how such local environmental variations in network population structures change the condition for selection and fixation probability of an advantageous (or deleterious) mutant. We consider linear graph structures and focus on the case where resources have a spatial periodic pattern. This is the simplest model with two parameters, length scale and fitness scales, representing heterogeneity. We calculate fixation probability and fixation times for a constant population birth–death process as fitness heterogeneity and period vary. Fixation probability is affected by not only the level of fitness heterogeneity but also spatial scale of resources variations set by period of distribution T T . We identify conditions for which a previously a deleterious mutant (in a uniform environment) becomes beneficial as fitness heterogeneity is increased. We observe cases where the fixation probability of both mutant and resident types are more than their neutral value, 1 / N 1/N , simultaneously. This coincides with exponential increase in time to fixation which points to potential coexistence of resident and mutant types. Finally, we discuss the effect of the ‘fitness shift’ where the fitness function of two types has a phase difference. We observe significant increases (or decreases) in the fixation probability of the mutant as a result of such phase shift.},

  abstract     = {Studying the mathematical dynamics of cancer has gained the attention of bioengineers in the past three decades. Different kinds of modelling considering various aspects of treatment have been proposed. In this paper, the key role of Regulatory T cells is discussed and a model in ordinary differential equation (ODE) form is proposed by adding this state to the system dynamics considering chemoimmunotherapy treatment. Regulatory T cells are considered as one of the main tumor cells’ tactics to deceive the body’s immune system. The improved model is verified mathematically and biologically and fits all criteria in both fields. The results show that entering Regulatory T cells state on cancer mathematical modelling for simulating body cells for chemoimmunotherapy provides a way to identify critical cases more carefully, which a simplified model is unable to accomplish. This point emphasizes the fact that this state must be present in cancer modelling to anticipate immune response more accurately. The advanced system fixed points are obtained by the Newton method and bifurcation diagrams are derived and discussed. New features and remarks are proposed during the journey of developing more accurate models that have the best fit with laboratory data. The sensitivity chart of the model is illustrated and novel aspects of discussions are made with the aim of personalizing a model for a patient and identifying critical conditions based on the chart before any treatment begins. This point enables physicians to determine whether critical conditions have occurred for a patient in a specific treatment or not.},

This study develops a mathematical model to explore the effects of morphine-altered mutation and cellular immune response on the within-host dynamics of two HIV species, a wild-type and a mutant. Our model predicts that the morphine-altered mutation rate and cellular immune response allow the wild-type virus to outcompete the mutant virus, resulting in a higher set point viral load and lower CD4 count. We also compute the basic reproduction numbers and show that the dominant species is determined by morphine concentration, with the mutant dominating below and the wild-type dominating above a threshold. Furthermore, we identified three biologically relevant equilibria, infection-free, mutant-only, and coexistence, which are completely characterized by the fitness cost of mutation, mutant escape rate, and morphine concentration.},

Although this process is intensely studied experimentally, there are very few theoretical models that address this issue. One of the main reasons is the extraordinary complexity of the metabolism that involves numerous interdependent regulatory networks which makes the computational recreation of this complexity illusory. In this study we propose a reduced model of the metabolism which focuses on the interrelation of the three main energy metabolites which are oxygen, glucose and lactate in order to better understand the dynamics of the core system of the glycolysis-OXPHOS relationship. So simple as it is, the model highlights the main rules allowing the cell to dynamically adapt its metabolism to its changing environment. It also makes it possible to address this impact at the tissue scale. The simulations carried out in a spheroid show non-trivial spatial heterogeneity of energy metabolism. It further suggests that the metabolic features that are commonly attributed to cancer cells are not necessarily due to an intrinsic abnormality of the cells. They can emerge spontaneously due to the deregulated over-acidic environment.},

Hamilton postulated that the formation of animal herds may simply result from the individual‘s selfish motivation to minimize their predation risk. The latter is quantified by the domain of danger (DOD) which is given by the Voronoi area around each individual. In fact, simulations show that individuals aiming to reduce their DODs form compact groups similar to what is observed in many living systems. However, despite the apparent simplicity of this problem, it is not clear what motional strategy is required to find an optimal solution. Here, we use the framework of Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) which gives the unbiased and optimal strategy of individuals to solve the selfish herd problem. We demonstrate that the motivation of individuals to reduce their predation risk naturally leads to pronounced collective behaviors including the formation of cohesive swirls. We reveal a previously unexplored rather complex intra-group motion which eventually leads to a evenly shared predation risk amongst selfish individuals.},

However, in a natural population, the selective environment varies with time. Here, we investigate the impact of selective sweeps and background selection on neutral genetic diversity when the selection coefficient changes periodically over time. The reduction in genetic variation due to selective sweeps is known to depend on the conditional fixation time. Here, we find that the effect of changing environment on conditional mean fixation time is most substantial for the randomly mating population than the inbreeding population with arbitrary inbreeding coefficient . We also study the effect of background selection on neutral sites when the selection coefficient of linked deleterious mutation change periodically in time. In the slowly changing environment, we find that neutral heterozygosity is significantly different, and the site frequency spectrum has a different shape than that in the static environment.},

Building upon standard, infinite-population models (IPMs) of conformity, we introduce finite-population models (FPMs) and study them via simulation and a diffusion approximation. In previous IPMs of conformity, offspring observe the variants of n n adult role models, where n n is often three. Numerical simulations show that while the short-term behavior of the FPM with n = 3 n=3 role models is well approximated by the IPM, stable polymorphic equilibria of the IPM become effective equilibria of the FPM at which the variation persists prior to fixation or loss, and which produce plateaus in curves for fixation probabilities and expected times to absorption. In the FPM with n = 5 n=5 role models, the population may switch between two effective equilibria, which is not possible in the IPM, or may cycle between frequencies that are not effective equilibria, which is possible in the IPM. In all observed cases of ‘equilibrium switching’ and ‘cycling’ in the FPM, model parameters exceed O ( 1 / N ) O(1/N) , required for the diffusion approximation, resulting in an over-estimation of the actual times to absorption. However, in those cases with n = 5 n=5 role models that have one effective equilibrium and stable fixation states, even if conformity coefficients exceed O ( 1 / N ) O(1/N) , the diffusion approximation matches closely the numerical simulations of the FPM. This suggests that the robustness of the diffusion approximation depends not only on the magnitudes of coefficients, but also on the qualitative behavior of the conformity model.},

Rugged fitness landscapes have often been used to explain diversity through the presence of local peaks, or adaptive zones, in the fitness landscape acting as available niches for different species. Alternatively, niche-packing and theories based on limiting similarity describe frequency-dependent selection leading to the organic differentiation of a continuous phenotype space into multiple coexisting types. By combining rugged carrying capacity landscapes with frequency-dependent selection, here we investigate the effects of ruggedness on adaptive diversification and stably maintained diversity. We show that while increased ruggedness often leads to a decreased opportunity for adaptive diversification, it is the shape of the global carrying capacity function, not the local ruggedness, that determines the diversity of the ESS and the total diversity a system can stably maintain.},

Originally conceived to work both in deterministic and stochastic frameworks, it is shown that, except for the case of very low number of tumour cells, the deterministic approach is appropriate to characterize the system behaviour, especially for control planning purposes. Two alternative control approaches are here investigated. One trivially assumes a constant infusion of external drug administration, the other is designed according to a state-feedback control scheme, with complete or partial knowledge of the state. Pros and cons of both control laws are investigated, showing that the tumour size at the beginning of the therapy plays a role of paramount importance for fixed infusion therapies, whilst only state-feedback laws can eradicate arbitrarily large tumours.},

  abstract     = {Phylogenetic trees visually represent evolution and diversification. While many studies have focused on the number and length of edges (branches), topological properties, such as edge connection patterns, are also important. In this study, the topological properties of phylogenetic trees were quantified, focusing on edge connection patterns. Horton’s first law was applied to quantify the overall, rather than local, topological properties of phylogenetic trees. The topological properties of vertebrate phylogenetic trees for spiny-rayed fishes, Amphibians, turtles, Squamata , Aves, and placental mammals were analyzed. The topological features discussed herein include the number of first-order edges, maximum order, and bifurcation ratio. The average bifurcation ratio of all trees was approximately 3, suggesting that phylogenetic trees for different taxa have a common mechanism of evolution. Vertebrate phylogenetic trees were compared with artificial branching objects created from neutral stochastic branching model simulations. The topological properties of the actual vertebrate phylogenetic trees agreed with those of the artificial branching objects. Our study suggests that evolutionary events do not change the overall topological properties of actual phylogenetic trees, even if the number and length of the edges change. Specifically, non-neutral events (e.g., environmental changes and mass extinction) are not main factors associated with topological properties. The results instead demonstrate a relationship between the bifurcation ratio and symmetricity in the context of temporal changes of topological properties. When the number of first-order edges increased and the maximum order remained constant, the bifurcation ratio increased and symmetricity decreased. When the number of first-order edges increased and the maximum order increased by one, the bifurcation ratio decreased and symmetricity increased.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical models are increasingly used throughout infectious disease outbreaks to guide control measures. In this review article, we focus on the initial stages of an outbreak, when a pathogen has just been observed in a new location (e.g., a town, region or country). We provide a beginner’s guide to two methods for estimating the risk that introduced cases lead to sustained local transmission (i.e., the probability of a major outbreak), as opposed to the outbreak fading out with only a small number of cases. We discuss how these simple methods can be extended for epidemiological models with any level of complexity, facilitating their wider use, and describe how estimates of the probability of a major outbreak can be used to guide pathogen surveillance and control strategies. We also give an overview of previous applications of these approaches. This guide is intended to help quantitative researchers develop their own epidemiological models and use them to estimate the risks associated with pathogens arriving in new host populations. The development of these models is crucial for future outbreak preparedness. This manuscript was submitted as part of a theme issue on “Modelling COVID-19 and Preparedness for Future Pandemics”.},

  abstract     = {Developing a functional description of the neural control circuits and visual feedback paths underlying insect flight behaviors is an active research area. Feedback controllers incorporating engineering models of the insect visual system outputs have described some flight behaviors, yet they do not explain how insects are able to stabilize their body position relative to nearby targets such as neighbors or forage sources, especially in challenging environments in which optic flow is poor. The insect experimental community is simultaneously recording a growing library of in-flight head and eye motions that may be linked to increased perception. This study develops a quantitative model of the optic flow experienced by a flying insect or robot during head yawing rotations (distinct from lateral peering motions in previous work) with a single other target in view. This study then applies a model of insect visuomotor feedback to show via analysis and simulation of five species that these head motions sufficiently enrich the optic flow and that the output feedback can provide relative position regulation relative to the single target (asymptotic stability). In the simplifying case of pure rotation relative to the body, theoretical analysis provides a stronger stability guarantee. The results are shown to be robust to anatomical neck angle limits and body vibrations, persist with more detailed Drosophila lateral-directional flight dynamics simulations, and generalize to recent retinal motion studies. Together, these results suggest that the optic flow enrichment provided by head or pseudopupil rotation could be used in an insect’s neural processing circuit to enable position regulation.},

In the root tip, these hormones regulate growth and developmental processes, and responses to environmental cues. However, we lack understanding of how environmental factors and biological parameters affect the delivery of hormones to the root tip. In this study, we build on existing models of phloem flow to develop a mathematical model of sugar transport alongside the transport of a generic hormone. We derive the equations for osmotically driven flow in a long, thin pipe with spatially varying membrane properties to capture the phloem loading and unloading zones. Motivated by experimental findings, we formulate solute membrane transport in terms of passive and active components, and incorporate solute unloading via bulk flow (i.e. advection with the water efflux) by including the Staverman reflection coefficient. We use the model to investigate the coupling between the sugar and hormone dynamics. The model predicts that environmental cues that lead to an increase in active sugar loading, an increase in bulk flow sugar unloading or a decrease in the relative root sugar concentration result in an increase in phloem transport velocity. Furthermore, the model reveals that such increases in phloem transport velocity result in an increase in hormone delivery to the root tip for passively loaded hormones.},

In this study, a theoretical model for segmental contractions of the small intestine is developed using lubrication method to explore the mechanisms involved. Here, the nonlinear partial differential equations governing the fluid flow were normalized in viscous regime and solved semi-analytically for a power law fluid under long wavelength approximation on a Matlab TM platform. Study indicates that shearing is highest at the 1st and 4th mid-occlusion in comparison to 2nd and 3rd mid-occlusion. Parametric study indicates that the flow is sensitive to – the span of segmentation or wavelength of the wave, occlusion of the wave and frequency of the contraction; with shearing being highest for dilatants. Shearing is more prominent at higher occlusion (&gt;50\%) and frequency (&gt;6Hz). Further, mixing is more prominent at the steep regions of the wave; having intensity of mixing highest for the outer waves in comparison to waves at mid-region of the segmentation. The power demand is found to be greater in segmentation and has the following precedence - frequency, wavelength, flow behavior index, and occlusion (up to 80\%). Further, multiplicity of the wave gives rise to multiple zones of mixing which increases the rate of mixing of the contents. Suggesting that, the segmentation primarily serves the purpose of mixing. The study will be useful to explore novel therapeutic strategies of managing patients suffering from various motility-associated disorders of the small intestine.},

When the timescale of dispersal is long compared with the time to consume resources, patch fitness increases but comes at a cost to cell growth rates. This creates conditions that initiate evolutionary transitions in individuality. A key feature of the scaffold is a bottleneck created during dispersal, causing patches to be founded by single cells. The bottleneck decreases competition within patches and, hence, creates a strong hereditary link at the level of patches. Here, we construct a fully stochastic model to investigate the effect of bottleneck size on the evolutionary dynamics of both cells and collectives. We show that larger bottlenecks simply slow the dynamics, but, at some point, which depends on the parameters of the within-patch model, the direction of evolution towards the equilibrium reverses. Introduction of random fluctuations in bottleneck sizes with some positive probability of smaller sizes counteracts this, even when the probability of smaller bottlenecks is minimal.},

  abstract     = {Organisms have evolved different mechanisms in response to periods of environmental stress, including dormancy – a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity. Transitions to and from dormancy can be random or induced by changes in environmental conditions. Prior theoretical work has shown that stochastic transitioning between active and dormant states at the individual level can maximize fitness at the population level. However, such theories of ‘bet-hedging’ strategies typically neglect certain physiological features of transitions to dormancy, including time lags to gain protective benefits. Here, we construct and analyze a dynamic model that couples stochastic changes in environmental state with the population dynamics of organisms that can initiate dormancy after an explicit time delay. Stochastic environments are simulated using a multi-state Markov chain through which the mean and variance of environmental residence time can be adjusted. In the absence of time lags (or in the limit of very short lags), we find that bet-hedging strategy transition probabilities scale inversely with the mean environmental residence times, consistent with prior theory. We also find that increasing delays in dormancy decreases optimal transitioning probabilities, an effect that can be influenced by the correlations of environmental noise. When environmental residence times – either good or bad – are uncorrelated, the maximum population level fitness is obtained given low levels of transitioning between active and dormant states. However when environmental residence times are correlated, optimal dormancy initiation and termination probabilities increase insofar as the mean environmental persistent time is longer than the delay to reach dormancy. We also find that bet hedging is no longer advantageous when delays to enter dormancy exceed the mean environmental residence times. Altogether, these results show how physiological limits to dormancy and environmental dynamics shape the evolutionary benefits and even viability of bet hedging strategies at population scales.},

We test different infections outcomes and propagation speed. In the hypotheses of our model, the inflammation can reduce notably and sometimes drastically the oxygen flow to blood. Our model predicts how the air flows and oxygen exchanges reorganize in the tree during an infection. Our results highlight the links between the localization of the infection and the amplitude of the loss of oxygen flow to blood. We show that a compensation phenomena due to the reorganization of the flow exists, but that it remains marginal unless the power produced the ventilation muscles is increased.

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has been ongoing since 2019 is still ongoing and how to control it is one of the international issues to be addressed. Antiviral drugs that reduce the viral load in terms of reducing the risk of secondary infection are important. For the general control of emerging infectious diseases, establishing an efficient method to evaluate candidate therapeutic agents will lead to a rapid response. We evaluated clinical trial designs for viral entry inhibitors that have the potential to be effective pre-exposure prophylactic drugs in addition to reducing viral load after infection. We used a previously developed simulation of clinical trials based on a mathematical model of within-host viral infection dynamics to evaluate sample sizes in clinical trials of viral entry inhibitors against COVID-19. We assumed four measures as outcomes, namely change in log10-transformed viral load from symptom onset, PCR positive ratio, log10-transformed viral load, and cumulative viral load, and then sample sizes were calculated for drugs with 99\% and 95\% antiviral efficacy. Consistent with previous results, we found that sample sizes could be dramatically reduced for all outcomes used in an analysis by adopting inclusion/exclusion criteria such that only patients in the early post-infection period would be included in a clinical trial. A comparison of sample sizes across outcomes demonstrated an optimal measurement schedule associated with the nature of the outcome measured for the evaluation of drug efficacy. In particular, the sample sizes calculated from the change in viral load and from viral load tended to be small when measurements were taken at earlier time points after treatment initiation. For the cumulative viral load, the sample size was lower than that from the other outcomes when the stricter inclusion/exclusion criteria to include patients whose time since onset is earlier than 2 days was used. We concluded that the design of efficient clinical trials should consider the inclusion/exclusion criteria and measurement schedules, as well as outcome selection based on sample size, personnel and budget needed to conduct the trial, and the importance of the outcome regarding the medical and societal requirements. This study provides insights into clinical trial design for a variety of situations, especially addressing infectious disease prevalence and feasible trial sizes.

All materials were modeled as poroelastic, and the cartilage had linear-elastic oriented collagen fibers. This model was able to explain the remodeling process that subchondral bone goes through, and how the scaffold allowed the conditions for cartilage regeneration. These results suggest that the use of scaffolds might lead the cartilaginous tissue growth in vivo by providing a better mechanical environment.

Identifying and quantifying the role of separate processes in vivo or in vitro is difficult or not possible. A computational model can facilitate this research by simulating the sub-processes independently. This study presents a spatio-temporal model of the calcification physiology, which is based on processes that are considered essential for calcification: respiration, photosynthesis, Ca 2＋ -ATPase, carbonic anhydrase. The model is used to test different hypotheses considering ion transport across the calicoblastic cells and Light Enhanced Calcification (LEC). It is also used to quantify the effect of ocean acidification (OA) on the Extracellular Calcifying Medium (ECM) and ATP-consumption of Ca 2＋ -ATPase. It was able to reproduce the experimental data of three separate studies and finds that paracellular transport plays a minor role compared to transcellular transport . In the model, LEC results from increased Ca 2＋ -ATPase activity in combination with increased metabolism. Implementing OA increases the concentration of CO 2 throughout the entire tissue, thereby increasing the availability of C O 3 − CO3− in the ECM. As a result, the model finds that calcification becomes more energy-demanding and the calcification rate increases.},

In Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Nova Scotia , and Prince Edward Island a median of 80\% or more of daily reported cases were travel-related from July 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021. With increasing vaccination coverage, it may be appropriate to exit an elimination strategy, but most existing epidemiological frameworks are applicable only to situations where most cases occur in the community, and are not appropriate for regions that have implemented an elimination strategy. To inform the pandemic response in regions that are implementing an elimination strategy, we extend importation modelling to consider post-arrival travel restrictions, and pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions in the local community. We find that shortly after the Omicron variant had begun spreading in Canada, the expected daily number of spillovers, infections spread to NL community members from travellers and their close contacts, was higher than any time previously in the pandemic. By December 24, 2021, the expected number of spillovers was 44\% higher than the previous high, which occurred in late July 2021 shortly after travel restrictions were first relaxed. We develop a method to assess the characteristics of potential future community outbreaks in regions that are implementing an elimination strategy. We apply this method to predict the effect of variant and vaccination coverage on the size of hypothetical community outbreaks in Mount Pearl, a suburb of the St. John’s metropolitan area in NL. Our methodology can be used to evaluate alternative plans to relax public health restrictions when vaccine coverage is high in regions that have implemented an elimination strategy.

  abstract     = {We describe a novel mathematical model for blood flow, delivery of nanoparticles , and heat transport in vascularised tumour tissue. The model, which is derived via the asymptotic homogenisation technique, provides a link between the macroscale behaviour of the system and its underlying, tortuous micro-structure, as parametrised in Penta and Ambrosi (2015). It consists of a double Darcy’s law, coupled with a double advection–diffusion–reaction system describing heat transport, and an advection–diffusion–reaction equation for transport and adhesion of particles. Particles are assumed sufficiently large and do not extravasate to the tumour interstitial space but blood and heat can be exchanged between the two compartments. Numerical simulations of the model are performed using a finite element method to investigate cancer hyperthermia induced by the application of magnetic field applied to injected iron oxide nanoparticles. Since tumour microvasculature is more tortuous than that of healthy tissue and thus suboptimal in terms of fluid and drug transport, we study the influence of the vessels’ geometry on tumour temperature. Effective and safe hyperthermia treatment requires tumour temperature within certain target range, generally estimated between 42 °C and 46 °C, for a certain target duration, typically 0.5h to 2h. As temperature is difficult to measure in situ, we use our model to determine the ranges of tortuosity of the microvessels, magnetic intensity, injection time, wall shear stress rate, and concentration of nanoparticles required to achieve given target conditions.},

  abstract     = {Oncolytic viruses are a promising new treatment for cancer, whereby viruses are engineered to selectively destroy cancer cells. Mathematical modelling of the dynamics of the virus-tumour system can be modelled to provide insight into the system outcomes under different treatment protocols. In this study key metrics of treatment efficacy were identified and the mathematical model used to develop a decision framework to assess different treatment protocols. The optimal treatment outcome is the interplay between the virus application protocol and the uncertainty about the tumour characteristics. The uncertainty in the model parameters decreases as more data is available for their inference — however to obtain more data more time is required and the tumour then grows in size. Thus, there is an inherent tension whether it is better to wait to know the characteristics of the tumour system better or immediately initiating treatment. It is shown that, for small tumours, parameter inference with limited data does not constrain the choice of treatment protocol and rather only influences longer term decisions.},

  abstract     = {Marine central-place foragers are increasingly faced with altered prey landscapes, necessitating predictions of the impact of such changes on behavior, reproductive success, and population dynamics. We used state-dependent behavioral life history theory implemented via Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) to explore the influence of changes in prey distribution and energy gain from foraging on the behavior and reproductive success of a central place forager during lactation. Our work is motivated by northern fur seals ( Callorhinus ursinus ) because of the ongoing population decline of the Eastern Pacific stock and projected declines in biomass of walleye pollock ( Gadus chalcogrammus ), a key fur seal prey species in the eastern Bering Sea. We also explored how changes in female and pup metabolic rates, body size, and lactation duration affected model output to provide insight into traits that might experience selective pressure in response to reductions in prey availability. Simulated females adopted a central-place foraging strategy after an initial extended period spent on land (4.7–8.3 days). Trip durations increased as the high energy prey patch moved farther from land or when the energy gain from foraging decreased. Increases in trip duration adversely affected pup growth rates and wean mass despite attempts to compensate by increasing land durations. Metabolic rate changes had the largest impacts on pup wean mass, with reductions in a pup’s metabolic rate allowing females to successfully forage at distances of 600+ km from land for up to 15+ days. Our results indicate that without physiological adaptations, a rookery is unlikely to be viable if the primary foraging grounds are 400 km or farther from the rookery. To achieve pup growth rates characteristic of a population experiencing rapid growth, model results indicate the primary foraging grounds need to be &lt;150 km from the rookery.},

  abstract     = {Early detection of invaders requires finding small numbers of individuals across large landscapes. It has been argued that the only feasible way to achieve the sampling effort needed for early detection of an invader is to involve volunteer groups (citizen scientists, passive surveyors, etc.). A key concern is that volunteers may have a considerable false-positive and false-negative rate. The question then becomes whether verification of a report from a volunteer is worth the effort. This question is the topic of this paper. Since we are interested in early detection we calculate the Z\% upper limit of the one sided confidence interval of the incidence (fraction infected) and use the term maximum expected plausible incidence for this. We compare the maximum plausible incidence when the expert samples on their own, q E ∼ qE∼ , and the maximum plausible incidence when the expert only verifies cases reported by the volunteer surveyor to be infected, q V ∼ qV∼ . The maximum plausible incidences q E ∼ qE∼ and q V ∼ qV∼ . are related as, q V ∼ = θ fp 1 - θ fn q E ∼ qV∼=θfp1-θfnqE∼ where θ fp and θ fn are the false positive and false negative rate of the volunteer surveyor, respectively. We also show that the optimal monitoring programme consists of verifying only the cases reported by the volunteer surveyor if, T X T N TXTN&amp;lt;θfp1-θfn , where T N is the time needed for a sample taken by the expert and T X is the time needed for an expert to verify a case reported by a volunteer surveyor. Our results can be used to calculate the maximum plausible incidence of a plant disease based on reports of passive surveyors that have been verified by experts and data from experts sampling on their own. The results can also be used in the development phase of a surveillance project to assess whether including passive surveyor reports is useful in the early detection of exotic invaders.},

  abstract     = {Measuring the phase synchronization between different brain regions in functional brain networks is a common approach to investigate many psychological disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The emotional processing deficit in ADHD children is one of the main obstacles in their social interactions. In this study, the nonlinear Correlation between Probability of Recurrences (CPR) method is used for the first time to construct functional brain networks of 22 boys with ADHD and 22 healthy ones during watching four visual-emotional stimuli types. Topological features of brain networks, including shortest path length, clustering coefficient, and nodes strengths, are investigated in groups of ADHD and healthy. The results indicate a significantly (P-Values &lt; 0.01) greater average clustering coefficient and lower shortest path length in the brain networks of ADHD individuals than the healthy ones. Accordingly, in the ADHD brain networks, the information exchange in both local and global scales is abnormally more than the healthy ones, leading to a hyper-synchronization in this group. The topological alterations of ADHD brain networks are mainly observed in the brain&#39;s frontal and occipital lobes, indicating impaired brain function of this group in emotional and visual processing. This survey demonstrates that the CPR method can be a good candidate for distinguishing the phase interactions of ADHD and healthy brain networks. Therefore, this study can contribute to further insights into the nonlinear dynamics analysis of brain networks in ADHD individuals.},

The emphasis is on the effect of symmetric/asymmetric division of stem cells on the population and propagating dynamics of cell lineage. It is found that stem cells’ asymmetric cell division (ACD) can move the phase boundary of the homogenous solution of the system. The population of the cell lineage will be promoted in presence of ACD. The concentration of stem cells increases with ACD but that of differentiated daughter cells decreases with ACD. In addition, it is found that the propagating speed of the stem cells can be evaluated with ACD. When the daughter cells move fast to a new space, stem cells can catch them up through increasing ACD. Our results may suggest a mechanism of collective migration of cell lineage through cooperation between ACD of stem cells and fast diffusion of the daughter cells.},

  abstract     = {A principal objective in agriculture is to maximise food production; this is particularly relevant with the added demands of an ever increasing population, coupled with the unpredictability that climate change brings. Further improvements in productivity can only be achieved with an increased understanding of plant and crop processes. In this respect, mathematical modelling of plants and crops plays an important role. In this paper we present a two-scale mathematical model of crop yield that accounts for plant growth and canopy interactions. A system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is formulated to describe the growth of each individual plant, where equations are coupled via a term that describes plant competition via canopy–canopy interactions. A crop of greenhouse plants is then modelled via an agent based modelling approach in which the growth of each plant is described via our system of ODEs. The model is formulated for the African drought tolerant legume bambara groundnut ( Vigna subterranea ), which is currently being investigated as a food source in light of climate change and food insecurity challenges. Our model allows us to account for plant diversity and also investigate the effect of individual plant traits (e.g. plant canopy size and planting distance) on the yield of the overall crop. Informed with greenhouse data, model results show that plant positioning relative to other plants has a large impact on individual plant yield. Variation in physiological plant traits from genetic diversity and the environmental effects lead to experimentally observed variations in crop yield. These traits include plant height, plant carrying capacity, leaf accumulation rate and canopy spread. Of these traits plant height and ground cover growth rates are found to have the greatest impact on crop yield. We also consider a range of different planting arrangements (uniform grid, staggered grid, circular rings and random allocation) and find that the staggered grid leads to the greatest crop yield (6\% more compared to uniform grid). Whilst formulated specifically for bambara groundnut, the generic formulation of our model means that with changes to certain parameter’s, it may be extended to other crop species that form a canopy.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) booster vaccination has been implemented globally in the midst of surges in infection due to the Delta and Omicron variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of the present study was to present a framework to estimate the proportion of the population that is immune to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Omicron variant (immune proportion) in Japan, considering the waning of immunity resulting from vaccination and naturally acquired infection. We quantified the decay rate of immunity against symptomatic infection with Omicron conferred by the second and third doses of COVID-19 vaccine. We estimated the current and future vaccination coverage for the second and third vaccine doses from February 17, 2021 to August 1, 2022 and used data on the confirmed COVID-19 incidence from February 17, 2021 to April 10, 2022. From this information, we estimated the age-specific immune proportion over the period from February 17, 2021 to August 1, 2022. Vaccine-induced immunity, conferred by the second vaccine dose in particular, was estimated to rapidly wane. There were substantial variations in the estimated immune proportion by age group because each age cohort experienced different vaccination rollout timing and speed as well as a different infection risk. Such variations collectively contributed to heterogeneous immune landscape trajectories over time and age. The resulting prediction of the proportion of the population that is immune to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection could aid decision-making on when and for whom another round of booster vaccination should be considered.

  abstract     = {Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are known to affect tumor growth, vascularization, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Marked interest in system-scale analysis of immune species interactions within the TME has encouraged progress in modeling tumor-immune interactions in silico . Due to the computational cost of simulating these intricate interactions, models have typically been constrained to representing a limited number of immune species. To expand the capability for system-scale analysis, this study develops a three-dimensional continuum mixture model of tumor-immune interactions to simulate multiple immune species in the TME. Building upon a recent distributed computing implementation that enables efficient solution of such mixture models, major immune species including monocytes , macrophages, natural killer cells , dendritic cells, neutrophils , myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), cytotoxic, helper, regulatory T-cells, and effector and regulatory B-cells and their interactions are represented in this novel implementation. Immune species extravasate from blood vasculature, undergo chemotaxis toward regions of high chemokine concentration, and influence the TME in proportion to locally defined levels of stimulation. The immune species contribute to the production of angiogenic and tumor growth factors, promotion of myofibroblast deposition of ECM, upregulation of angiogenesis , and elimination of living and dead tumor species. The results show that this modeling approach offers the capability for quantitative insight into the modulation of tumor growth by diverse immune-tumor interactions and immune-driven TME effects. In particular, MDSC-mediated effects on tumor-associated immune species’ activation levels, volume fraction, and influence on the TME are explored. Longer term, linking of the model parameters to particular patient tumor information could simulate cancer-specific immune responses and move toward a more comprehensive evaluation of immunotherapeutic strategies.},

To further clarify the impact mechanism of adaptive protection behavior and vaccination, we developed a new transmission model via a delay differential system, which parameterized the roles of adaptive behaviors and vaccination, and allowed to simulate the dynamic infection process among people. By validating the model with surveillance data during March 2020 and October 2021 in America, India, South Africa, Philippines, Brazil, UK, Spain and Germany, we quantified the protection effect of adaptive behaviors by different forms of activity function. The modeling results indicated that (1) the adaptive activity function can be used as a good indicator for fitting the intervention outcome, which exhibited short-term awareness in these countries, and it could reduce the total human infections by 3.68, 26.16, 15.23, 4.23, 7.26, 1.65, 5.51 and 7.07 times, compared with the reporting; (2) for complete prevention, the average proportions of people with immunity should be larger than 90\%, 92\%, 86\%, 71\%, 92\%, 84\%, 82\% and 76\% with adaptive protection behaviors, or 91\%, 97\%, 94\%, 77\%, 92\%, 88\%, 85\% and 90\% without protection behaviors; and (3) the required proportion of humans being vaccinated is a sub-linear decreasing function of vaccine efficiency, with small heterogeneity in different countries.

  abstract     = {The Lotka–Volterra model is widely used to model interactions between two species. Here, we generate synthetic data mimicking competitive, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between two tumor cell lines, and then use the Lotka–Volterra model to infer the interaction type. Structural identifiability of the Lotka–Volterra model is confirmed, and practical identifiability is assessed for three experimental designs: (a) use of a single data set, with a mixture of both cell lines observed over time, (b) a sequential design where growth rates and carrying capacities are estimated using data from experiments in which each cell line is grown in isolation, and then interaction parameters are estimated from an experiment involving a mixture of both cell lines, and (c) a parallel experimental design where all model parameters are fitted to data from two mixtures (containing both cell lines but with different initial ratios) simultaneously. Each design is tested on data generated from the Lotka–Volterra model with noise added, to determine efficacy in an ideal sense. In addition to assessing each design for practical identifiability, we investigate how the predictive power of the model – i.e., its ability to fit data for initial ratios other than those to which it was calibrated – is affected by the choice of experimental design. The parallel calibration procedure is found to be optimal and is further tested on in silico data generated from a spatially-resolved cellular automaton model, which accounts for oxygen consumption and allows for variation in the intensity level of the interaction between the two cell lines. We use this study to highlight the care that must be taken when interpreting parameter estimates for the spatially-averaged Lotka–Volterra model when it is calibrated against data produced by the spatially-resolved cellular automaton model, since baseline competition for space and resources in the CA model may contribute to a discrepancy between the type of interaction used to generate the CA data and the type of interaction inferred by the LV model.},

  abstract     = {Serology testing can identify past infection by quantifying the immune response of an infected individual providing important public health guidance. Individual immune responses are time-dependent, which is reflected in antibody measurements. Moreover, the probability of obtaining a particular measurement from a random sample changes due to changing prevalence (i.e., seroprevalence , or fraction of individuals exhibiting an immune response) of the disease in the population. Taking into account these personal and population-level effects, we develop a mathematical model that suggests a natural adaptive scheme for estimating prevalence as a function of time. We then combine the estimated prevalence with optimal decision theory to develop a time-dependent probabilistic classification scheme that minimizes the error associated with classifying a value as positive (history of infection) or negative (no such history) on a given day since the start of the pandemic. We validate this analysis by using a combination of real-world and synthetic SARS-CoV-2 data and discuss the type of longitudinal studies needed to execute this scheme in real-world settings.},

  abstract     = {We developed a mathematical model to describe healing processes in bovine corneal endothelial (BCE) cells in culture, triggered by mechanical wounds with parallel edges. Previous findings from our laboratory show that, in these cases, BCE monolayers exhibit an approximately constant healing velocity. Also, that caspase-dependent apoptosis occurs, with the fraction of apoptotic cells increasing with the distance traveled by the healing edge. In addition, in this study we report the novel findings that, for wound scratch assays performed preserving the basal extracellular matrix: i) the healing cells increase their en face surface area in a characteristic fashion, and ii) the average length of the segments of the cell columns actively participating in the healing process increases linearly with time. These latter observations preclude the utilization of standard traveling wave formalisms to model wound healing in BCE cells. Instead, we developed and studied a simple phenomenological model based on a plausible formula for the spreading dynamics of the individual healing cells, that incorporates original evidence about the process in BCE cells. The model can be simulated to: i) obtain an approximately constant healing velocity; ii) reproduce the profile of the healing cell areas, and iii) obtain approximately linear time dependences of the mean cell area and average length of the front active segments per column. In view of its accuracy to account for the experimental observations, the model can also be acceptably employed to quantify the appearance of apoptotic cells during BCE wound healing. The strategy utilized here could offer a novel formal framework to represent modifications undergone by some epithelial cell lines during wound healing.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 remains a major public health concern, with large resurgences even where there has been widespread uptake of vaccines. Waning immunity and the emergence of new variants will shape the long-term burden and dynamics of COVID-19. We explore the transition to the endemic state, and the endemic incidence in British Columbia (BC), Canada and South Africa (SA), to compare low and high vaccination coverage settings with differing public health policies, using a combination of modelling approaches. We compare reopening (relaxation of public health measures) gradually and rapidly as well as at different vaccination levels. We examine how the eventual endemic state depends on the duration of immunity, the rate of importations, the efficacy of vaccines and the transmissibility. These depend on the evolution of the virus, which continues to undergo selection. Slower reopening leads to a lower peak level of incidence and fewer overall infections in the wave following reopening: as much as a 60\% lower peak and a 10\% lower total in some illustrative simulations; under realistic parameters, reopening when 70\% of the population is vaccinated leads to a large resurgence in cases. The long-term endemic behaviour may stabilize as late as January 2023, with further waves of high incidence occurring depending on the transmissibility of the prevalent variant, duration of immunity, and antigenic drift. We find that long term endemic levels are not necessarily lower than current pandemic levels: in a population of 100,000 with representative parameter settings (Reproduction number 5, 1-year duration of immunity, vaccine efficacy at 80\% and importations at 3 cases per 100K per day) there are over 100 daily incident cases in the model. Predicted prevalence at endemicity has increased more than twofold after the emergence and spread of Omicron. The consequent burden on health care systems depends on the severity of infection in immunized or previously infected individuals.},

Here, network analysis was performed based on the COVID-19 genomic epidemiology network between December 2019-July 2021. Representative SARS2 VOC spike protein models were generated and quality checked, protein model superimposition was done, and common contact based on contact mapping was established. Throughout this study, we found that: (1) certain individual variant-specific amino acid mutations can affect the spike protein structural pattern; (2) certain individual variant-specific amino acid mutations had no affect on the spike protein structural pattern; and (3) certain combination of variant-specific amino acids are putatively epistatic mutations that can potentially influence the VOC spike protein structural pattern.

The model explicitly accounts for the factors, widely referred to as 4 R’s of radiobiology, which influence the efficacy of radiotherapy fractionation protocols: tumor cell repopulation, their redistribution in cell cycle, reoxygenation and repair of sublethal damage of both tumor and normal tissues. With the use of special algorithm the fractionation protocols that provide increased tumor control probability, compared to standard clinical protocol, are found for various physiologically-based values of model parameters under the constraints of fixed overall normal tissue damage and maximum admissible fractional dose. In particular, it is shown that significant gain in treatment efficacy can be achieved for tumors of low malignancy by the use of protracted hyperfractionated protocols. The optimized non-uniform protocols are characterized by gradual escalation of fractional doses in their last parts, which start after the levels of oxygen and nutrients significantly elevate throughout the tumor and accelerated tumor proliferation manifests itself, which is a well-known experimental phenomenon.},

Some viral infections can last for weeks; others, like influenza (the flu), can resolve quickly. During infections, uninfected cells can replicate in order to replenish the cells that have died due to the virus. Many viral models, especially those for short-lived infections like influenza, tend to ignore cellular regeneration since many think that uncomplicated influenza resolves much faster than cells regenerate. This research accounts for cellular regeneration, using an agent-based framework, and varies the regeneration rate in order to understand how cell regeneration affects viral infection dynamics under assumptions of different modes of transmission. We find that although the general trends in peak viral load, time of viral peak, and chronic viral load as regeneration rate changes are the same for cell-free or cell-to-cell transmission, the changes are more extreme for cell-to-cell transmission due to limited access of infected cells to newly generated cells.},

One possible process causing these waves of infection is people switching their activities in response to the prevalence of infection. In this paper, we present a simple model for the coupling of social and epidemiological dynamics. The assumptions are as follows. Each person switches between active and restrained states. Active people move more often to crowded areas, interact with each other, and suffer a higher rate of infection than people in the restrained state. The rate of transition from restrained to active states is enhanced by the fraction of currently active people (conformity), whereas the rate of backward transition is enhanced by the abundance of infected people (risk avoidance). The model may show transient or sustained oscillations, initial-condition dependence, and various bifurcations. The infection is maintained at a low level if the recovery rate is between the maximum and minimum levels of the force of infection. In addition, waves of infection may emerge instead of converging to the stationary abundance of infected people if both conformity and risk avoidance of people are strong.},

  abstract     = {Detection of extremely rare variant alleles, such as tumor DNA, within a complex mixture of DNA molecules is experimentally challenging due to sequencing errors. Barcoding of target DNA molecules in library construction for next-generation sequencing provides a way to identify and bioinformatically remove polymerase induced errors. During the barcoding procedure involving t t consecutive PCR cycles, the DNA molecules become barcoded by Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). Different library construction protocols utilize different values of t t . The effect of a larger t t and imperfect PCR amplifications in relation to UMI cluster sizes is poorly described. This paper proposes a branching process with growing immigration as a model describing the random outcome of t t cycles of PCR barcoding. Our model discriminates between five different amplification rates r 1 r1 , r 2 r2 , r 3 r3 , r 4 r4 , r r for different types of molecules associated with the PCR barcoding procedure. We study this model by focussing on C t Ct , the number of clusters of molecules sharing the same UMI, as well as C t ( m ) Ct(m) , the number of UMI clusters of size m m . Our main finding is a remarkable asymptotic pattern valid for moderately large t t . It turns out that E ( C t ( m ) ) / E ( C t ) ≈ 2 − m E(Ct(m))/E(Ct)≈2−m for m = 1 , 2 , … , m=1,2,…, regardless of the underlying parameters ( r 1 , r 2 , r 3 , r 4 , r ) (r1,r2,r3,r4,r) . The knowledge of the quantities C t Ct and C t ( m ) Ct(m) as functions of the experimental parameters t t and ( r 1 , r 2 , r 3 , r 4 , r ) (r1,r2,r3,r4,r) will help the users to draw more adequate conclusions from the outcomes of different sequencing protocols.},

We use finite element analysis to compare the mechanical properties of humeri of the closely related American otter and honey badger under external loads, and to analyze the significance of bone curvature. We simulate the effects generated by loads applied in directions that differ relative to the humeral longitudinal axes, and then compare the stress characteristics with a series of humerus-inspired abstracted curved structures with increasing ratio ( C / R ) of eccentricity C to radius of cross section R . The humeri of the two species differ in bone curvature, with C/R of 0.6201 and 0.8752, respectively. Our analysis shows that the peak and mean stress values found within the sampling line of bone models reach a minimum when the directions of loads are 105 ± 5°, and the humerus of the American otter always experienced lower stress values than those of the honey badger in the sampling line. An analysis of stress distribution in abstract curved structures showed the greatest reduction in stress when the direction of external load was equal or greater than 95°. This suggests that the variability of the direction of external loads is an important determinant of bone curvature, and should be accounted for when assessing load carrying capacity. This study provides a basis for biomechanics research and yields insight into the form-function relationship of nature’s structural elements within limbs. It potentially contributes to the design of biomimetic robots while also highlighting the functional significance of humeral bone curvature in mammals.},

  abstract     = {The recent discovery that some terrestrial arthropods can detect, use, and learn from weak electrical fields adds a new dimension to our understanding of how organisms explore and interact with their environments. For bees and spiders , the filiform mechanosensory systems enable this novel sensory modality by carrying electric charge and deflecting in response to electrical fields. This mode of information acquisition opens avenues for previously unrealised sensory dynamics and capabilities. In this paper, we study one such potential: the possibility for an arthropod to locate electrically charged objects. We begin by illustrating how electrostatic interactions between hairs and surrounding electrical fields enable the process of location detection. After which we examine three scenarios: (1) the determination of the location and magnitude of multiple point charges through a single observation, (2) the learning of electrical and mechanical sensor properties and the characteristics of an electrical field through several observations, (3) the possibility that an observer can infer their location and orientation in a fixed and known electrical field (akin to “stellar navigation”). To conclude, we discuss the potential of electroreception to endow an animal with thus far unappreciated sensory capabilities, such as the mapping of electrical environments. Electroreception by terrestrial arthropods offers a renewed understanding of the sensory processes carried out by filiform hairs, adding to aero-acoustic sensing and opening up the possibility of new emergent collective dynamics and information acquisition by distributed hair sensors.},

  abstract     = {Head-tail planaria morphologies are influenced by the electric potential differences across the animal’s primary axis, as evidenced e.g. by voltage-sensitive dyes and functional experiments that create permanent lines of 2-headed but genetically wild-type animals. However, bioelectrical and biochemical models that make predictions on what would happen in the case of spatial chimeras made by tissue transplantation from different planaria (different species and head shapes) are lacking. Here, we use a bioelectrical model to qualitatively describe the effects of tissue transplantation on the shape of the regenerated head. To this end, we assume that the cells may have distinct sets of ion channels and ascribe the system outcome to the axial distributions of average cell potentials over morphologically relevant regions. Our rationale is that the distributions of signaling ions and molecules are spatially coupled with multicellular electric potentials. Thus, long-time downstream transcriptional events should be triggered by short-time bioelectrical processes. We show that relatively small differences between the ion channel characteristics of the cells could eventually give noticeable changes in the electric potential profiles and the expected morphological deviations, which suggests that small but timely bioelectrical actions may have significant morphological effects. Our approach is based on the observed relationships between bioelectrical regionalization and biochemical gradients in body-plan studies. Such models are relevant to regenerative, developmental, and cancer biology in which cells with distinct properties and morphogenetic target states confront each other in the same tissue.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a mathematical model capable to reproduce a celebrated phenomenon in blood microcirculation known as Fåhræus effect, since its discovery by Robin Fåhræus (1929). This consists in a decaying of the relative hematocrit in small vessels as the vessel diameter decreases. The key point of the model is a formula, direct consequence of the basic principles of fluid dynamics, that links the relative hematocrit to the reservoir hematocrit and the vessel diameter , which confirms the observed behavior. To test the model we selected, among the few experiments carried on since then, those performed by Barbee and Cokelet (1971). The agreement is remarkable. An extended comparison is also carried out with a celebrated empirical formula proposed by Pries et al. (1992) to describe the same phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {Metabolism is essential for cell function and adaptation. Because of their central role in metabolism, kinetic parameters and enzyme concentrations are under constant selective pressure to adapt the fluxes of the metabolic networks to the needs of the organism. In line with various studies dealing with enzyme evolution, we recently developed a model of the evolution of enzyme concentrations under selection for increased flux, considered as a proxy for fitness (Coton et al., 2022). With this model, taking into account two realistic cellular constraints, competition for resources and co-regulation, we determined the evolutionary equilibria and range of neutral variations of enzyme concentrations. In this article, we expanded this model by considering that the enzymes in a pathway can belong to different co-regulation groups. We determined the equilibria and showed that the constraints modify the adaptive landscape by limiting the number of independent dimensions. We also showed that any trade-off between enzyme concentrations is sufficient to limit the flux and relax selection for increasing the concentration of other enzymes. Even though this model is based on simplifying assumptions, the complexity of the relationship between enzyme concentrations prevents the formal analysis of the range of neutral variation of enzyme concentrations. However, we could show that selection for maximizing the flux results in selective neutrality for all enzymes regardless the constraints applied, giving generality to the prediction of Hartl et al. (1985).},

  abstract     = {The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 and subsequently spread throughout the world, causing over 600 million cases and 6 million deaths as of September 7th, 2022. Superspreading events (SSEs), defined here as public or social events that result in multiple infections over a short time span, have contributed to SARS-CoV-2 spread. In this work, we compare the dynamics of SSE-dominated SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, defined here as outbreaks with relatively higher SSE rates, to the dynamics of non-SSE-dominated SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. To accomplish this, we derive a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) SARS-CoV-2 model from an ordinary differential equation (ODE) SARS-CoV-2 model and incorporate SSEs using an events-based framework. We simulate our model under multiple scenarios using Gillespie’s direct algorithm. The first scenario excludes hospitalization and quarantine; the second scenario includes hospitalization, quarantine, premature hospital discharge, and quarantine violation; and the third scenario includes hospitalization and quarantine but excludes premature hospital discharge and quarantine violation. We also vary quarantine violation rates. Results indicate that, with either no control or imperfect control, SSE-dominated outbreaks are more variable but less severe than non-SSE-dominated outbreaks, though the most severe SSE-dominated outbreaks are more severe than the most severe non-SSE-dominated outbreaks. We measure severity by the time it takes for 50 active infections to be achieved; more severe outbreaks do so more quickly. SSE-dominated outbreaks are also more sensitive to control measures, with premature hospital discharge and quarantine violation substantially reducing control measure effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {We numerically study the role of excitatory and inhibitory interactions in the aggregations of male frogs. In most frogs, males produce sounds to attract conspecific females, which activates the calling behavior of other males and results in collective choruses. While the calling behavior is effective for mate attraction, it requires high energy consumption. In contrast, satellite behavior is an alternative mating strategy in which males deliberately stay silent in the vicinity of a calling male and attempt to intercept the female attracted to the caller, allowing the satellite males to reduce their energy consumption while having a chance of mating. Here we propose a hybrid dynamical model in which male frogs autonomously switch among three behavioral states (i.e., calling state, resting state, and satellite state) due to the excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Numerical simulations of the proposed model demonstrated that (1) both collective choruses and satellite behavior can be reproduced and (2) the satellite males can prolong the energy depletion time of the whole aggregation while they split the maximum chorus activity into two levels over the whole chorusing period. This study highlights the importance of the multiple behavioral types and their transitions for the performance of the whole aggregation.},

  abstract     = {Whether an outbreak of infectious disease is likely to grow or dissipate is determined through the time-varying reproduction number, R t Rt . Real-time or retrospective identification of changes in R t Rt following the imposition or relaxation of interventions can thus contribute important evidence about disease transmission dynamics which can inform policymaking. Here, we present a method for estimating shifts in R t Rt within a renewal model framework. Our method, which we call EpiCluster, is a Bayesian nonparametric model based on the Pitman–Yor process. We assume that R t Rt is piecewise-constant, and the incidence data and priors determine when or whether R t Rt should change and how many times it should do so throughout the series. We also introduce a prior which induces sparsity over the number of changepoints. Being Bayesian, our approach yields a measure of uncertainty in R t Rt and its changepoints. EpiCluster is fast, straightforward to use, and we demonstrate that it provides automated detection of rapid changes in transmission, either in real-time or retrospectively, for synthetic data series where the R t Rt profile is known. We illustrate the practical utility of our method by fitting it to case data of outbreaks of COVID-19 in Australia and Hong Kong, where it finds changepoints coinciding with the imposition of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Bayesian nonparametric methods, such as ours, allow the volume and complexity of the data to dictate the number of parameters required to approximate the process and should find wide application in epidemiology.

  abstract     = {Bayesian inference produces a posterior distribution for the parameters of a mathematical model that can be used to guide the formation of hypotheses; specifically, the posterior may be searched for evidence of alternative model hypotheses, which serves as a starting point for hypothesis formation and model refinement. Previous approaches to search for this evidence are largely qualitative and unsystematic; further, demonstrations of these approaches typically stop at hypothesis formation, leaving the questions they raise unanswered. Here, we introduce a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based ranking to expedite Bayesian hypothesis formation and investigate the hypotheses it generates, ultimately generating novel, biologically significant insights. Our approach uses KL divergence to rank parameters by how much information they gain from experimental data. Subsequently, rather than searching all model parameters at random, we use this ranking to prioritize examining the posteriors of the parameters that gained the most information from the data for evidence of alternative model hypotheses. We test our approach with two examples, which showcase the ability of our approach to systematically uncover different types of alternative hypothesis evidence. First, we test our KL divergence ranking on an established example of Bayesian hypothesis formation. Our top-ranked parameter matches the one previously identified to produce alternative hypotheses. In the second example, we apply our ranking in a novel study of a computational model of prolactin-induced JAK2-STAT5 signaling, a pathway that mediates beta cell proliferation. Within the top 3 ranked parameters (out of 33), we find a bimodal posterior revealing two possible ranges for the prolactin receptor degradation rate. We go on to refine the model, incorporating new data and determining which degradation rate is most plausible. Overall, while the effectiveness of our approach depends on having a properly formulated prior and on the form of the posterior distribution, we demonstrate that our approach offers a novel and generalizable quantitative framework for Bayesian hypothesis formation and use it to produce a novel, biologically-significant insight into beta cell signaling.},

  abstract     = {During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, epidemic models have been central to policy-making. Public health responses have been shaped by model-based projections and inferences, especially related to the impact of various non-pharmaceutical interventions. Accompanying this has been increased scrutiny over model performance, model assumptions, and the way that uncertainty is incorporated and presented. Here we consider a population-level model, focusing on how distributions representing host infectiousness and the infection-to-death times are modelled, and particularly on the impact of inferred epidemic characteristics if these distributions are mis-specified. We introduce an S I R SIR -type model with the infected population structured by ‘infected age’, i.e. the number of days since first being infected, a formulation that enables distributions to be incorporated that are consistent with clinical data. We show that inference based on simpler models without infected age, which implicitly mis-specify these distributions, leads to substantial errors in inferred quantities relevant to policy-making, such as the reproduction number and the impact of interventions. We consider uncertainty quantification via a Bayesian approach, implementing this for both synthetic and real data focusing on UK data in the period 15 Feb–14 Jul 2020, and emphasising circumstances where it is misleading to neglect uncertainty.

We mathematically describe the relationship between the ascertainment rate, the daily number of reported cases, population prevalence, and the sensitivity of PCR and Lateral Flow tests as a function time since exposure. Applying this model to the data, we estimate that 20\%–40\% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK were ascertained with a positive test with results varying by time and region. Cases of the Alpha variant were ascertained at a higher rate than the wild type variants circulating in the early pandemic, and higher again for the Delta variant and Omicron BA.1 sub-lineage, but lower for the BA.2 sub-lineage. Case ascertainment was higher in adults than in children. We further estimate the daily number of infections and compare this to mortality data to estimate that the infection fatality rate increased by a factor of 3 during the period dominated by the Alpha variant, and declined in line with the distribution of vaccines.

Methods of characterizing these tumours are valuable for improving predictions of their progression and response to treatment. A mathematical model called the proliferation-invasion (PI) model has been used extensively in the literature to model the growth of these tumours, though it relies on known values of two key parameters: the tumour cell diffusivity and proliferation rate. Unfortunately, these parameters are difficult to estimate in a patient-specific manner, making personalized tumour forecasting challenging. In this paper, we develop and apply a deep learning model capable of making accurate estimates of these key GBM-characterizing parameters while simultaneously producing a full prediction of the tumour progression curve. Our method uses two sets of multi sequence MRI in order to produce estimations and relies on a preprocessing pipeline which includes brain tumour segmentation and conversion to tumour cellularity. We first apply our deep learning model to synthetic tumours to showcase the model’s capabilities and identify situations where prediction errors are likely to occur. We then apply our model to a clinical dataset consisting of five patients diagnosed with GBM. For all patients, we derive evidence-based estimates for each of the PI model parameters and predictions for the future progression of the tumour, along with estimates of the parameter uncertainties. Our work provides a new, easily generalizable method for the estimation of patient-specific tumour parameters, which can be built upon to aid physicians in designing personalized treatments.},

  abstract     = {The fact that people often have preference rankings for their partners is a distinctive aspect of human behavior. Little is known, however, about how this talent as a powerful force shapes human behavioral traits, including those which should not have been favored by selection, such as cooperation in social dilemma situations. Here we propose a dynamic model in which network-structured individuals can switch their interaction partners within neighborhoods based on their preferences. For the partner switching, we propose two interruption regimes: dictatorial regime and negotiating regime. In the dictatorial regime, focal individuals are able to suspend interactions out of preferences unilaterally. In the negotiating regime, either focal individuals or the associated partners agree to suspend, then these interactions can be successfully suspended. We investigate the evolution of cooperation under both preference-driven partner switching regimes in the context of both the weakened variant of the donation game and the standard one. Specifically, we theoretically approximate the critical conditions for cooperation to be favored by weak selection in the weakened donation game where cooperators bear a unit cost to provide a benefit for each active neighbor and simulate the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation in the standard donation game to test the robustness of the analytical results. Under dictatorial regime, selection of cooperation becomes harder when individuals have preferences for either cooperator or defector partners, implying that the expulsion of defectors by cooperators is overwhelmed by the chasing of defectors towards cooperators. Under negotiating regime, both preferences for cooperator and defector partners can significantly favor the evolution of cooperation, yet underlying mechanisms differ greatly. For preferences over cooperator partners, cooperator–cooperator interaction relationships are reinforced and the associated mutual reciprocity can resist and assimilate defectors. For preferences over defector partners, defector–defector interaction relationships are anchored, weakening defectors’ exploitation over cooperators. Cooperators are thus offered much time space to interact among cospecies and spread. Our work may help better understand the critical role of preference-based adaptive partner switching in promoting the evolution of cooperation.},

Brain atrophy is usually seen in the early stages of MS, and its progress is faster than healthy people. The present study was a numerical study that uses the Fluid–structure interaction (FSI) model to investigate the effect of brain atrophy on brain injury in MS. Firstly, a healthy model was constructed from MRI images and validated by experimental data. Then three models with different degrees of brain atrophy, which showed the rate of brain atrophy in different years in MS patients, were developed to model the brain atrophy in MS. The models were subjected to two different types of impact conditions. Type I, which only produced a translational motion and the HIC value of 744, was applied to each model. Type II produced both translational and rotational motion. In this type of impact, the experimental kinematics, with peaks of 450 g for the translational acceleration and 26.2 krad/s2 for the rotational acceleration, were applied to the nodes that located in the center of gravity of the head models and the results were extracted from each one. According to the results of impact type I, the pressure of the frontal lobe of the brain is 149,647 Pa in the health model and 137,690 Pa in the model with severe atrophy.},

  abstract     = {A reliable theory of biological tissues growth and organization, a fundamental tool for a comprehensive interpretation of experimental observations and a guide to progress in life sciences, is definitively missing. This would support the advancement of knowledge for both normal and pathological expansion and regulation of tissues and organisms. In this work is presented a computational model of cell culture that describes its growth and organization using cell proliferation as its default state, constrained by contact inhibition, closely connected to the cell bioelectric state. The model results describe in a correct way the reported experimental results, involving contact inhibition due to the presence of other cells, and gap junctions for signaling, molecules exchange and extracellular environment sensing. Starting from depolarized cells (in this model considered tantamount to proliferative), the cell culture grows until it fills the available domain and, due to the contact inhibition constraint, it turns into quiescence (a consequence of cell polarization), except on the periphery. Using drugs or via protein expression manipulation, it is possible to change the final tissue state, to fully polarized or depolarized. Other experimental tests are proposed and the expected results simulated. This model can be extended to pathological events, such as carcinogenesis, with cells homeostasis perturbed by a cell depolarizing (carcinogenic) event and express its default proliferative state without adequate control. This simplified model of tissue organization, regulated by the cell’s bioelectric state and their interaction with vicinity, is an alternative to the description of the experimental results by mechanical stress, and can be further tested and extended in dedicated experiments.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 epidemic has lasted for more than two years since the outbreak in late 2019. An urgent and challenging question is how to systematically evaluate epidemic developments in different countries, during different periods, and to determine which measures that could be implemented are key for successful epidemic prevention. In this study, SBD distance-based K-shape clustering and hierarchical clustering methods were used to analyse epidemics in Asian countries. For the hierarchical clustering, epidemic time series were divided into three periods (epidemics induced by the Original/Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants separately). Standard deviations, the Hurst index, mortality rates, peak value of confirmed cases per capita, average growth rates, and the control efficiency of each period were used to characterize the epidemics. In addition, the total numbers of cases in the different countries were analysed by correlation and regression in relation to 15 variables that could have impacts on COVID-19. Finally, some suggestions on prevention and control measures for each category of country are given. We found that the total numbers of cases per million of a population, total deaths per million and mortality rates were highly correlated with the proportion of people aged over 65 years, the prevalence of multiple diseases, and the national GDP. We also found significant associations between case numbers and vaccination rates, health expenditures, and stringency of control measures. Vaccinations have played a positive role in COVID-19, with a gradual decline in mortality rates in later periods, and are still playing protective roles against the Delta and Omicron strains. The stringency of control measures taken by a government is not an indicator of the appropriateness of a country&#39;s response to the outbreak, and a higher index does not necessarily mean more effective measures; a combination of factors such as national vaccination rates, the country&#39;s economic foundation and the availability of medical equipment is also needed.

  abstract     = {Repeat asymptomatic testing in order to identify and quarantine infectious individuals has become a widely-used intervention to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In some workplaces, and in particular health and social care settings with vulnerable patients, regular asymptomatic testing has been deployed to staff to reduce the likelihood of workplace outbreaks. We have developed a model based on data available in the literature to predict the potential impact of repeat asymptomatic testing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The results highlight features that are important to consider when modelling testing interventions, including population heterogeneity of infectiousness and correlation with test-positive probability, as well as adherence behaviours in response to policy. Furthermore, the model based on the reduction in transmission potential presented here can be used to parameterise existing epidemiological models without them having to explicitly simulate the testing process. Overall, we find that even with different model paramterisations, in theory, regular asymptomatic testing is likely to be a highly effective measure to reduce transmission in workplaces, subject to adherence.

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection and protection provided by the immune response. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by a particularly high viral load, and further by the small number of inhaled virions sufficient to generate a high viral titer in the nasal passage a few days after exposure. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (Ab), induced from vaccines, previous infection, or inhaled monoclonal Ab, have proven effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our goal in this work is to model the protective mechanisms that Ab can provide and to assess the degree of protection from individual and combined mechanisms at different locations in the respiratory tract. Neutralization, in which Ab bind to virion spikes and inhibit them from binding to and infecting target cells, is one widely reported protective mechanism. A second mechanism of Ab protection is muco-trapping, in which Ab crosslink virions to domains on mucin polymers, effectively immobilizing them in the mucus layer. When muco-trapped, the continuous clearance of the mucus barrier by coordinated ciliary propulsion entrains the trapped viral load toward the esophagus to be swallowed. We model and simulate the protection provided by either and both mechanisms at different locations in the respiratory tract, parametrized by the Ab titer and binding-unbinding rates of Ab to viral spikes and mucin domains. Our results illustrate limits in the degree of protection by neutralizing Ab alone, the powerful protection afforded by muco-trapping Ab, and the potential for dual protection by muco-trapping and neutralizing Ab to arrest a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  abstract     = {In March 2020 mathematics became a key part of the scientific advice to the UK government on the pandemic response to COVID-19. Mathematical and statistical modelling provided critical information on the spread of the virus and the potential impact of different interventions. The unprecedented scale of the challenge led the epidemiological modelling community in the UK to be pushed to its limits. At the same time, mathematical modellers across the country were keen to use their knowledge and skills to support the COVID-19 modelling effort. However, this sudden great interest in epidemiological modelling needed to be coordinated to provide much-needed support, and to limit the burden on epidemiological modellers already very stretched for time. In this paper we describe three initiatives set up in the UK in spring 2020 to coordinate the mathematical sciences research community in supporting mathematical modelling of COVID-19. Each initiative had different primary aims and worked to maximise synergies between the various projects. We reflect on the lessons learnt, highlighting the key roles of pre-existing research collaborations and focal centres of coordination in contributing to the success of these initiatives. We conclude with recommendations about important ways in which the scientific research community could be better prepared for future pandemics.

  abstract     = {The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 saw severe detriments to public health being inflicted by COVID-19 disease throughout 2020. In the lead up to Christmas 2020, the UK Government sought an easement of social restrictions that would permit spending time with others over the Christmas period, whilst limiting the risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2. In November 2020, plans were published to allow individuals to socialise within ‘Christmas bubbles’ with friends and family. This policy involved a planned easing of restrictions in England between 23–27 December 2020, with Christmas bubbles allowing people from up to three households to meet throughout the holiday period. We estimated the epidemiological impact of both this and alternative bubble strategies that allowed extending contacts beyond the immediate household. We used a stochastic individual-based model for a synthetic population of 100,000 households, with demographic and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological characteristics comparable to England as of November 2020. We evaluated five Christmas bubble scenarios for the period 23–27 December 2020, assuming our populations of households did not have symptomatic infection present and were not in isolation as the eased social restrictions began. Assessment comprised incidence and cumulative infection metrics. We tested the sensitivity of the results to a situation where it was possible for households to be in isolation at the beginning of the Christmas bubble period and also when there was lower adherence to testing, contact tracing and isolation interventions. We found that visiting family and friends over the holiday period for a shorter duration and in smaller groups was less risky than spending the entire five days together. The increases in infection from greater amounts of social mixing disproportionately impacted the eldest. We provide this account as an illustration of a real-time contribution of modelling insights to a scientific advisory group, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group (SPI-M-O) for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) in the UK, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  abstract     = {The moral rule “Risk your life to save your family members” is, at the same time, a biological phenomenon. The prominent population geneticist , J.B.S. Haldane told his friends that he would risk his life to save two drowning brothers, but not one – so the story goes. In biological terms, Haldane’s arithmetic claims that sib altruism is evolutionarily rational, whenever by “self-sacrifice” an altruistic gene “rescues”, on average, more than one copy of itself in its lineage. Here, we derive conditions for evolutionary stability of sib altruism, using population genetic models for three mating systems (monogamy, promiscuity and polygyny) with linear and non-linear group effect on the siblings’ survival rate. We show that for all considered selection situations, the condition of evolutionary stability is equivalent to Haldane’s arithmetic. The condition for evolutionary stability is formulated in terms of genetic relatedness and the group effect on the survival probability, similarly to the classical Hamilton’s rule. We can set up a “scale of mating systems”, since in pairwise interactions the chance of evolutionary stability of sib altruism decreases in this order: monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity. Practice of marrying and siblings’ solidarity are moral rules in a secular world and in various religious traditions. These moral rules are not evolutionarily independent, in the sense that the subsistence of sib altruism is more likely in a monogamous population.},

Recently, SEIR models have evolved to address the change of human mobility by some NPIs for predicting the new confirmed cases. However, the models have serious limitations when applied to Seoul. Seoul has two representative quarantine policies, i.e. social distancing and the ban on gatherings. Effects of the two policies need to be reflected in different functional forms in the model because changes in human mobility do not fully reflect the ban on gatherings. Thus we propose a modified SEIR model to assess the effectiveness of social distancing, ban on gatherings and vaccination strategies. The application of the modified SEIR model was illustrated by comparing the model output with real data.},

Thus, we here extend a mathematical model of cancer stem cell (CSC) driven tumour growth to also include dedifferentiation. We show that dedifferentiation increases the likelihood of tumorigenesis and the speed of tumoural growth, both modulated by the proliferative potential of the non-stem cancer cells (NSCCs). We demonstrate that dedifferentiation also may lead to treatment evasion, especially when a treatment solely targets CSCs. Conversely, targeting both CSCs and NSCCs in parallel is shown to be more robust to dedifferentiation. Despite dedifferentiation, perturbing CSC-related parameters continues to exert the largest relative effect on tumoural growth; however, we show the existence of synergies between specific CSC- and NSCC-directed treatments which cause superadditive reductions of tumoural growth. Overall, our study demonstrates various effects of dedifferentiation on growth and treatment of tumoural lesions, and we anticipate our results to be helpful in guiding future molecular and clinical research on limiting tumoural growth in vivo.},

  abstract     = {A primary driver of species extinctions and declining biodiversity is loss and fragmentation of habitats owing to human activities. Many studies spanning a wide diversity of taxa have described the relationship between population density and habitat patch area, i.e., the density–area relationship (DAR), as positive, neutral, negative or some combination of the three. However, the mechanisms responsible for these relationships remain elusive. We employ a theoretical spatially explicit population model built upon the reaction–diffusion framework with absorbing boundary conditions to model a habitat specialist dwelling in islands of habitat surrounded by a hostile matrix. We consider patches with a convex or non-convex geometry. Our results show that a single species following logistic-type population growth exhibits a strictly positive and continuous DAR. However, when multiple asymptotically stable steady states are preset in the system, a discontinuous DAR arises. In the case of two species governed by diffusive Lotka–Volterra growth and competitive interactions, we observe that overall DAR structure can be either (1) positive, (2) positive for small areas and neutral for large, or (3) hump-shaped, i.e., positive for area below a threshold and negative for area above. Patch complexity such as non-convex geometry can cause discontinuities in DAR slope for a single species and create qualitatively different patterns in a competitive system as compared to a convex patch. We also compared our theoretical results with two empirical studies (Anolis lizards on islands and crossbills and pine squirrels in forest fragments) where the pragmatic view of DAR fails to give a mechanistic understanding of what was observed. Close qualitative agreement between theoretical and observed DAR indicates that our model gives a reasonable explanation of the mechanisms underpinning DAR found in those studies. From a conservation perspective, the DAR is crucial to the identification of valuable habitat fragments that favor high abundance and the design of a reserve for a target species. When it comes to protecting a single species, these results suggest that there is unlikely to be a simple solution and that conservation decisions should always be made on a case-by-case basis.},

Disease spillovers are edge effects of land conversion and are sensitive to the size and shape of converted areas. We combine spatial metrics from landscape ecology with theoretical epidemiological models to understand how the size and shape of land conversion affect epizootic and zoonotic disease transmission of single and two species populations.

Therefore, the purpose of the study was to establish count data models to quantitatively characterize the disease progression of lung metastasis and assess the anti-metastatic effect of QAP14. Data of metastatic progression were collected in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Generalized Poisson distribution best described the variability of metastasis counts among the individuals. An empirical PK/PD model was developed to establish mathematical relationships between steady plasma concentrations of QAP14 and metastasis growth dynamics. The latency period of metastasis was estimated to be 12 days after tumor implantation. Our model structure also fitted well to other D1DR agonists (fenoldopam and l-stepholidine) which had inhibitory impact on breast cancer lung metastasis likewise. QAP14 40 mg/kg showed the best inhibitory efficacy, for it provided the longest prolongation of metastasis-free periods compared with fenoldopam or l-stepholidine.

  abstract     = {Several creatures can climb on smooth surfaces with the help of hairy adhesive pads on their legs. A rapid change from strong attachment to effortless detachment of the leg is enabled by the asymmetric geometry of the tarsal hairs. In this study, we propose mechanisms by which the hairy pad can be easily detached, even when the hairs possess no asymmetry. Here, we examine the possible function of the tibia-tarsus leg joint and the claws. Based on a spring-based model, we consider three modes of detachment: vertically pulling the pad while maintaining either a (1) fixed or a (2) free joint, or by (3) flexing the pad about the claw. We show that in all cases, the adhesion force can be significantly reduced due to elastic forces when the hairs deform non-uniformly across the array. Our proposed model illustrates the design advantage of such fibrillar adhesive systems, that not only provide strong adhesion, but also allow easy detachment, making them suitable as organs for fast locomotion and reliable hold. The presented approaches can be potentially used to switch the adhesion state in bio-inspired fibrillar adhesives, by incorporating artificial joints and claws into their design, without the need of asymmetric or stimuli-responsive fibrillar structures.},

  abstract     = {Multi-omics clustering plays an important role in cancer subtyping. However, the data of different kinds of omics are often related, these correlations may reduce the clustering algorithm performance. It is crucial to eliminate the unexpected redundant information caused by these correlations between different omics. We proposed RSC-based differential model with correlation removal for improving multi-omics clustering (RSC-MCR). This method first introduced RSC to calculate the pairwise correlations of all features, and decomposed it to obtain the pairwise correlations of different omics features, thus built the connection between different omics based on the pairwise correlations of different omics features. Then, to remove the redundant correlation, we designed a differential model to calculate the degree of difference between the original feature matrix and the correlation matrix which contained the most relevant information between different omics. We compared the performance of RSC-MCR with decorrelation methods on different clustering methods (CC, FCM, SNF, NMF, LRAcluster). The experimental results on five cancer datasets show the efficiency of the RSC-MCR as well as improvements over other decorrelation methods.},

  abstract     = {The synaptic tagging and capture (STC) hypothesis not only explain the integration and association of synaptic activities, but also the formation of learning and memory. The synaptic pathways involved in the synaptic tagging and capture phenomenon are called STC pathways. The STC hypothesis provides a potential explanation of the neuronal and synaptic processes underlying the synaptic consolidation of memories. Several mechanisms and molecules have been proposed to explain the process of memory allocation and synaptic tags, respectively. However, a clear link between the STC hypothesis and memory allocation is still missing because the encoding of memories in neural circuits is mainly associated with strongly recurrently connected groups of neurons. To explore the mechanisms of potential synaptic tagging candidates and their involvement in the process of memory allocation, we develop a mathematical model for a single dendritic spine based on five essential criteria of a synaptic tag. By developing a mathematical model, we attempt to understand the roles of the potentially critical molecular networks underlying the STC and the essential attributes of a synaptic tag. We include essential memory molecules in the STC model that have been identified in earlier studies as crucial for STC pathways. CaMKII activation is critical for the setting of the initial tag; however, coordinated activities with other kinases and the biochemical pathways are necessary for the tag to be stable. PKA modulates NMDAR-mediated Ca 2+ signalling. Similarly, PKA and ERK crosstalk is essential for Ca 2+ - mediated protein synthesis during l -LTP. Our theoretical model explains the quantitative contribution of Tags and protein synthesis during l -LTP in synaptic strength.},

  abstract     = {Models of populations in habitat networks are vital for understanding and linking processes and patterns across individuals, environments, ecological interactions, and population structures. River ecosystem models combine the physical structure of the networks with the biological processes of the organisms using structural and functional models, respectively. Previous studies on dendritic river networks have employed different functional (population) models and either directly claimed or implied that the results illustrate general properties of actual river systems. However, these studies have used different approaches and assumptions when modeling population characteristics and behavior, and it is possible that inferences regarding a system may vary based on the combination of functional model and the spatial structure of a network. This study aims to understand if different functional models in river systems produce substantially different model results and, therefore, whether conclusions are model-dependent. We compare variation in extinction time and occupancy proportion of river networks with linear, trellis, dendritic and ring-lattice topologies, using three population models (uniform, age-class and individual based) and one metapopulation-based (patch-occupancy) model. Dendritic, linear, and trellis structures did not show notable differences among extinction times for any of the four models. The difference between topologies was higher for the patch-occupancy model compared to the three population models. There were significant differences in the variations of patch-occupancy between the metapopulation and the population models, but the three population models of differing complexity produced broadly similar results. Therefore, if the occupancy data is obtained based on local subpopulations, spatial arrangement and connectivity does not appear to be the sole predictor of single-species metapopulation responses. We conclude that the outputs from functional models are robust to assumptions and varying levels of detail as long as they contain at least some detail at the level of individuals within habitat nodes. Also, if we are modeling network-scale populations, models that include at least some detailed information on individuals are a far better choice than considering populations implicitly.},

  abstract     = {Elucidating the hydrodynamics of fish swimming is critical to identifying the processes underlying fish orientation and schooling. Due to their mathematical tractability, models based on potential flow are preferred in the study of bidirectional interactions of fish with their surroundings. Dipole-based models that assimilate fish to pairs of vortices are particularly enticing, but yet to be thoroughly validated. Here, we embark on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) campaign informed by experimental data to validate the accuracy of dipole-based models. The locomotory patterns of a fish undergoing carangiform swimming are reconstructed from existing experimental data, which are used as inputs to CFD simulations of a fish swimming in a channel flow. We demonstrate that dipole-based models are accurate in capturing key features of the fluid flow, but cannot predict the elongated flow streamlines around the fish that are evident in CFD. To address this issue, we propose an alternative model that replaces each vortex in the pair with a sheet along the fish length. Using a pair of vortex sheets that span approximately 80\% of the fish body length with a separation distance of approximately 50\% of the body width, the model is successful in predicting the fluid flow around the swimming fish for a range of background flow speeds and channel widths. The proposed model shows improved accuracy at the cost of a mildly increased computational effort, thereby constituting an ideal basis for research on fish hydrodynamics.},

  abstract     = {Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among people worldwide. Cancer appears as solid tumors in many cases. Angiogenesis is the growth of blood vessels from the existing vasculature and is one of the imperative processes in tumor growth. Another vital phenomenon for formation and functionality of this vasculature network is lumen formation. The results of recent studies indicate the importance of blood pressure in this mechanism. Computational modeling can study these processes in different scales. Hence, wide varieties of these models have been proposed during recent years. In this research, a multi-scale model is developed for the angiogenesis process. In the extracellular scale, the growth factor concentration is calculated via the reaction diffusion equation. At the cellular scale, growth, migration, and the adhesion of endothelial cells are modeled by the Potts cellular model. At the intra-cellular scale by considering biochemical signals, a Boolean network model describes migration, division, or apoptosis of endothelial cells. A stochastic model developed for lumen formation via inverse membrane blebbing mechanism. A CFD simulation was also used to investigate the role of pulsated blood pressure in the inverse membrane blebbing mechanism. The lumen formation model shows stochastic behavior in blebs expansion and lumen expansion. Comparing the stochastic model&#39;s results with the CFD simulation also shows the vital role of pressure pulse and the topology of the blebs in bleb retraction.},

  abstract     = {Modeling of the biological neurons is a way to understand the architecture of neural networks of the brain . A complex brain network includes the synchronization between some groups of neurons. The dynamic behavior of interactions between groups of slave-master neurons in the neocortical network is unpredictable and challenging. The purpose of synchronizing a neural interaction is to reduce the synchronization error between the chaotic slave-master neurons. This paper uses a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller to synchronize master–slave neurons in the fractional-order of the neocortical network model based on dendritic spike frequency adaptation (DSFA) uncertainties and unknown disturbance effects. The purpose of this article is in two parts: First, we implemented the effect of previous states of the neuron conditions by fractional-order of the differential equations in the neocortical network model. Second, by synchronizing the FO neocortical master–slave model by PID controller, we investigated the connection strength of the complex network in chaotic point of view. The optimized PID coefficients and fractional-order were calculated using root mean square error (RMSE) criteria to control the membrane voltage synchronization. The chaotic behavior of the system was evaluated by numerical techniques such as attractor analysis and time series diagrams. The optimal RMSE value for master–slave neurons occurred at fractional-orders 0.89. It is shown that the synchronization of master–slave neurons improves over time, and eventually they are fully synchronized while the controller error is reduced.},

Based on the data on electrophysiological recordings, Yu et al. developed a 13-dimensional mathematical model to capture the detailed characteristics of the DA neuronal firing activities. We use the fitting method to simplify the original model into a 4-dimensional model. Then, the spiking-to-bursting transition is detected from a simple and robust mathematical condition. Physiologically, this condition is a balance of the restorative and the regenerative ion channels at resting potential. Geometrically, this condition imposes a transcritical bifurcation. Moreover, we combine singularity theory and singular perturbation methods to capture the geometry of three-timescale firing attractors in a universal unfolding of a cusp singularity. In particular, the planar description of the corresponding firing patterns can generate the corresponding firing attractors. This analysis provides a new idea for understanding the firing activities of the DA neuron and the specific mechanisms for the switching and dynamic regulation among different patterns.},

  abstract     = {The nervous system is today recognized to play an important role in the development of cancer. Indeed, neurons extend long processes (axons) that grow and infiltrate tumors in order to regulate the progression of the disease in a positive or negative way, depending on the type of neuron considered. Mathematical modeling of this biological process allows to formalize the nerve–tumor interactions and to test hypotheses in silico to better understand this phenomenon. In this work, we introduce a system of differential equations modeling the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) coupled with associated changes in axonal innervation . The study of the asymptotic behavior of the model confirms the experimental observations that PDAC development is correlated with the type and densities of axons in the tissue. We study then the identifiability and the sensitivity of the model parameters. The identifiability analysis informs on the adequacy between the parameters of the model and the experimental data and the sensitivity analysis on the most contributing factors on the development of cancer. It leads to significant insights on the main neural checkpoints and mechanisms controlling the progression of pancreatic cancer. Finally, we give an example of a simulation of the effects of partial or complete denervation that sheds lights on complex correlation between the healthy, pre-cancerous and cancerous cell densities and axons with opposite functions.},

  abstract     = {One of the key features of any infectious disease is whether infection generates long-lasting immunity or whether repeated reinfection is common. In the former, the long-term dynamics are driven by the birth of susceptible individuals while in the latter the dynamics are governed by the speed of waning immunity. Between these two extremes a range of scenarios is possible. During the early waves of SARS-CoV-2, the underlying paradigm was for long-lasting immunity, but more recent data and in particular the 2022 Omicron waves have shown that reinfection can be relatively common. Here we investigate reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in England, partitioning the data into four main waves, and consider the temporal distribution of first and second reports of infection. We show that a simple low-dimensional statistical model of random (but scaled) reinfection captures much of the observed dynamics, with the value of this scaling, k k , providing information of underlying epidemiological patterns. We conclude that there is considerable heterogeneity in risk of reporting reinfection by wave, age-group and location. The high levels of reinfection in the Omicron wave (we estimate that 18\% of all Omicron cases had been previously infected, although not necessarily previously reported infection) point to reinfection events dominating future COVID-19 dynamics.

Based on information from studies in the United States from mid-summer 2020 through the end of 2021, we describe proportions of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as functions of age and time. Slices through these surfaces at arbitrary times provide initial and target conditions for simulation modeling. They also provide the information needed to calculate age-specific forces of infection, attack rates, and – together with contact rates – age-specific probabilities of infection on contact between susceptible and infectious people. We modified the familiar Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to include features of the biology of COVID-19 that might affect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and stratified by age and location. We consulted the primary literature or subject matter experts for contact rates and other parameter values. Using time-varying Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker assessments of US state and DC efforts to mitigate the pandemic and compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) from a YouGov survey fielded in the US during 2020, we estimate that the efficacy of social-distancing when possible and mask-wearing otherwise at reducing susceptibility or infectiousness was 31\% during the fall of 2020. Initialized from seroprevalence among people having commercial laboratory tests for purposes other than SARS-CoV-2 infection assessments on 7 September 2020, our age- and location-stratified SEIR population model reproduces seroprevalence among members of the same population on 25 December 2020 quite well. Introducing vaccination mid-December 2020, first of healthcare and other essential workers, followed by older adults, people who were otherwise immunocompromised, and then progressively younger people, our metapopulation model reproduces seroprevalence among blood donors on 4 April 2021 less well, but we believe that the discrepancy is due to vaccinations being under-reported or blood donors being disproportionately vaccinated, if not both. As experimenting with reliable transmission models is the best way to assess the indirect effects of mitigation measures, we determined the impact of vaccination, conditional on NPIs. Results indicate that, during this period, vaccination substantially reduced infections, hospitalizations and deaths.

T-helper (Th) immune cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of AD which is marked by defects in the skin barrier function along with a significant increase in the population of either Th1 or Th2 sub-types of Th cells . The progression of AD from the acute to chronic phase is still poorly understood, and here we explore the mechanism of this transition through the study of a mathematical model for indirect cell–cell interactions among Th and skin cells via the secreted cytokines IFN γ γ and IL-4, both known to have therapeutic potential. An increase in the level of cytokine IFN γ γ can catalyse the transition of AD from an acute to a chronic stage, while an increase in the level of cytokine IL-4 has the reverse effect. In our model, the transition of AD from the acute to chronic stage and vice versa can be abrupt (switch-like) with hysteresis: this bistable behaviour can potentially be used to keep AD in the acute phase since therapy based on suppression of IFN γ γ can retard the transition to the chronic phase.},

  abstract     = {Compelling evidence continues to build to support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody (NAb) levels in an individual can serve as an important indicator of the strength of protective immunity against infection. It is not well understood why NAb levels in some individuals remain high over time, while in others levels decline rapidly. In this work, we present a two-state mathematical model of within-host NAb dynamics in response to vaccination. By fitting only four host-specific parameters, the model is able to capture individual-specific NAb levels over time as measured by the AditxtScore™ for NAbs. The model can serve as a foundation for predicting NAb levels in the long-term, understanding connections between NAb levels, protective immunity, and breakthrough infections, and potentially guiding decisions about whether and when a booster vaccination may be warranted.},

  abstract     = {We present a mathematical model that describes how tumour heterogeneity evolves in a tissue slice that is oxygenated by a single blood vessel. Phenotype is identified with the stemness level of a cell and determines its proliferative capacity, apoptosis propensity and response to treatment. Our study is based on numerical bifurcation analysis and dynamical simulations of a system of coupled, non-local (in phenotypic “space”) partial differential equations that link the phenotypic evolution of the tumour cells to local tissue oxygen levels. In our formulation, we consider a 1D geometry where oxygen is supplied by a blood vessel located on the domain boundary and consumed by the tumour cells as it diffuses through the tissue. For biologically relevant parameter values, the system exhibits multiple steady states; in particular, depending on the initial conditions, the tumour is either eliminated (“tumour-extinction”) or it persists (“tumour-invasion”). We conclude by using the model to investigate tumour responses to radiotherapy, and focus on identifying radiotherapy strategies which can eliminate the tumour. Numerical simulations reveal how phenotypic heterogeneity evolves during treatment and highlight the critical role of tissue oxygen levels on the efficacy of radiation protocols that are commonly used in the clinic.},
