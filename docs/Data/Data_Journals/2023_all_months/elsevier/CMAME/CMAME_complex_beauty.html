  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel higher stabilization-free virtual element method is proposed for compressible hyper-elastic materials in 2D. Different from the most traditional virtual element formulation, the method does not need any stabilization. The main idea is to modify the virtual element space to allow the computation of a higher-order polynomial L 2 L2 projection of the gradient. Based on that the stiffness matrix can be obtained directly which greatly simplifies the analysis process, especially for nonlinear problems . Hyper-elastic materials are considered and some benchmark nonlinear problems are solved to verify the capability and accuracy of the stabilization-free virtual element method.},

  abstract     = {Quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of the Galerkin method suffer from membrane locking when applied to Kirchhoff–Love shell formulations. Membrane locking causes not only smaller displacements than expected, but also large-amplitude spurious oscillations of the membrane forces. Continuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements have been recently introduced to remove membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear plane curved Kirchhoff rods (Casquero et al., CMAME, 2022). In this work, we generalize CAS elements to vanquish membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear Kirchhoff–Love shells. CAS elements bilinearly interpolate the membrane strains at the four corners of each element. Thus, the assumed strains have C 0 C0 continuity across element boundaries. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, CAS elements are the first assumed-strain treatment to effectively overcome membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of Kirchhoff–Love shells while satisfying the following important characteristics for computational efficiency: (1) No additional degrees of freedom are added, (2) No additional systems of algebraic equations need to be solved, (3) No matrix multiplications or matrix inversions are needed to obtain the stiffness matrix , and (4) The nonzero pattern of the stiffness matrix is preserved. The benchmark problems show that CAS elements, using either 2 × 2 or 3 × 3 Gauss–Legendre quadrature points per element, are an effective locking treatment since this element type results in more accurate displacements for coarse meshes and excises the spurious oscillations of the membrane forces. The benchmark problems also show that CAS elements outperform state-of-the-art element types based on Lagrange polynomials equipped with either assumed-strain or reduced-integration locking treatments.},

This invariance property can be preserved in the discrete problem if the incompressibility constraint is satisfied in a sufficiently strong sense. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee discretely divergence-free functions are exactly divergence-free and give examples of divergence-free finite elements on meshes with triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral, or hexahedral cells generated by a (possibly non-affine) map from their respective reference cells. In the case of quadrilateral cells, we prove an optimal error estimate for the velocity field that does not depend on the pressure approximation . Our analysis is supported by numerical results.},

In this work, we propose an immersed isogeometric analysis framework to solve the Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard equations on domains with geometrically complex external binary-fluid boundaries. The use of optimal-regularity B-splines results in a computationally efficient higher-order method. The key features of the proposed framework are a generalized Navier-slip boundary condition for the tangential velocity components, Nitsche’s method for the convective impermeability boundary condition, and skeleton- and ghost-penalties to guarantee stability. A binary-fluid Taylor–Couette flow is considered for benchmarking. Porous medium simulations demonstrate the ability of the immersed isogeometric analysis framework to model complex binary-fluid flow phenomena such as break-up and coalescence in complex geometries.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel stabilized isogeometric formulation for the Stokes problem , where the geometry of interest is obtained via overlapping NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline) patches, i.e., one patch on top of another in an arbitrary but predefined hierarchical order. All the visible regions constitute the computational domain, whereas independent patches are coupled through visible interfaces using Nitsche’s formulation. Such a geometric representation inevitably involves trimming, which may yield trimmed elements of extremely small measures (referred to as bad elements) and thus lead to the instability issue. Motivated by the minimal stabilization method that rigorously guarantees stability for trimmed geometries (Buffa et al., 2020), in this work we generalize it to the Stokes problem on overlapping patches. Central to our method is the distinct treatments for the pressure and velocity spaces: Stabilization for velocity is carried out for the flux terms on interfaces, whereas pressure is stabilized in all the bad elements. We provide a priori error estimates with a comprehensive theoretical study. Through a suite of numerical tests, we first show that optimal convergence rates are achieved, which consistently agrees with our theoretical findings. Second, we show that the accuracy of pressure is significantly improved by several orders using the proposed stabilization method, compared to the results without stabilization. Finally, we also demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed method in capturing local features in the solution field. This contribution is dedicated to Thomas J.R. Hughes, as a tribute to his remarkable lifetime achievements.},

The approach is directly based on the finite element model of the structure of interest, which can be arbitrarily complex and be composed of any kind of element formulation. This is especially advantageous in complicated real-world applications. As a consequence, the procedure can provide highly resolved parameter distributions within the structure and allows for the localization of e.g. damage regions or other zones with deviations from the planned configuration. Several examples with truss, plain strain and volume elements show the viability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology using both displacement and strain measurements. An important finding was that in order to obtain reliable, convergent results the gradient of the cost function has to be smoothed appropriately.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we present an all-solid-state lithium-ion battery (ASSB) model that considers electrochemistry and solid mechanics in a fully coupled manner. The model spatially resolves the three-dimensional microstructure of an ASSB cell and is based on non-linear continuum mechanics. The coupling of electrochemistry and solid mechanics is incorporated via lithiation-dependent volumetric changes of the active materials and the consistent formulation of the electrochemical governing equations on deformed geometries resulting in changed percolation paths. As the volumetric changes due to (de-)lithiation are reported to be large for several active materials, we introduce this effect using a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient. To also allow for large deformations in the mass conservation equation, an Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation is employed. Furthermore, we show the central steps to deduce the finite element formulation of our model as well as the adopted monolithic solution procedure to solve this strongly coupled non-linear problem. The linear solver used for large problem setups is adjusted from the advanced, physics-oriented preconditioning technique published in our previous work. In the numerical examples, we investigate three different geometries with up to about 1.3 million degrees of freedom and thereby prove that our approach is applicable to geometrically large and complex scenarios. Moreover, we show that our approach consistently introduces the mass and charge conservation on deformed meshes. Furthermore, the numerical examples demonstrate the high relevance to incorporate current collectors into the ASSB cell simulations. Finally, we show that solid mechanics and the coupling effects have indeed a large impact on the ASSB cell performance and their incorporation is therefore vital for precise results and predictions.},

A novel feature is that this allows us to solve the full three-dimensional model with a nearly two-dimensional computational effort . Additionally, we incorporate the distributed contact load predicted from dynamic vehicle–track simulations as extra coordinates in the PGD formulation, using a semi-Hertzian contact model. The problem is formulated in two ways; one general ansatz which considers the treatment of numerous parameters, some of which exhibit a linear influence, and a linear ansatz where multiple PGD solutions are solved for. In particular, situations where certain parameters become invariant are handled. We assess the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed strategy through a series of verification examples. It is shown that the PGD solution converges toward the FE solution with reduced computational cost. Furthermore, solving for the PGD approximation based on load parameterization in an offline stage allows expedient handling of the wheel–rail contact problem online.},

The key objective is to achieve decoupling between different regions of interest, enabling independent meshes for the zones where waves either propagate or interact with localised discontinuities in the elastic media. This decoupling allows us to exploit the benefits offered by various SBFEM formulations. Thus, we can select the most suitable solution for each specific region. An important concept we emphasise is the differentiation between the near field and far field regions. The near field encompasses zones where the precise representation of small features compared to the wavelength is crucial. At the same time, the far field comprises homogeneous regions where the waves propagate without interactions, eventually radiating towards infinity if the domain is unbounded. By separating these two zones, we can improve the computational performance by employing finer discretisation only where necessary. Furthermore, this decoupling enables the reuse of far field models in parametric analyses, making it highly valuable for scenarios focused particularly on local elastic wave interactions. This approach offers considerable potential in such cases. The modelling technique is validated, and its potential is demonstrated through practical applications.},

The framework itself extends a previously developed mechanics-informed methodology for the data-driven constitutive modeling of nonlinear elasticity to account for the dependence of the stress on the entire strain history. It is grounded in an additive decomposition of the strain energy density and an internal variable approach to viscoelasticity. Collectively, these are characterized by three potentials whose ANN representations are taught the second law of thermodynamics, various stability conditions, consistency (preservation of rigid body modes), and the recovery of elastic limits. The proposed mechanics-informed deep learning framework for data-driven nonlinear viscoelasticity is illustrated and its performance is assessed for one academic problem where synthetic data is generated by a nonlinear convolution; a coupon-level application associated with a multi-scale homogenization of a viscoelastic woven fabric material; and two representative finite element analyses performed using the material law generated during the previous application, to highlight different features of the framework.},

The present method remedies this issue by introducing a weighted average of the KGC matrix and the identity matrix , other than directly applying the KGC matrix, to achieve numerical stability meanwhile decrease numerical dissipation. To ensure momentum conservation, the correction is implemented in a particle-average pattern by rewriting the pressure term of the Riemann solution. Furthermore, the proposed weighted KGC scheme is incorporated into the dual-criteria time-stepping framework developed by Zhang et al. (2020) to achieve optimized computational efficiency.

The control design has potential applications in many industrial processes such as rotating wall driven mixing, mircomixers with acoustic waves, and artificial cilia mixing. The numerical algorithms have high complexity, high accuracy demand, and high computing expense, due to the multiscale nature of the mixing problem and the optimization requirements. A crucial problem is the computation of the Gâteaux derivative of the cost functional. To this end, a hybrid approach based on variational formula and finite difference is built with high accuracy and efficiency to treat various types of control input functions. We have experimented with various optimization algorithms including the steepest descent algorithm, the conjugate gradient method and two line search options (backtracking and exact line search). We are able to identify and implement the best combinations. The numerical simulations show that the mixing efficacy is limited when only one single type of control is applied, but can be enhanced when more diverse control types and more time segmentation are utilized. The mix-norm in the optimal mixings decays exponentially. The numerical study in this work demonstrates that boundary control alone could be an effective strategy for mixing in incompressible flows.},

  abstract     = {The method of moments is widely used for the reduction of kinetic equations into fluid models. It consists in extracting the moments of the kinetic equation with respect to a velocity variable , but the resulting system is a priori underdetermined and requires a closure relation. In this paper, we adapt the φ φ -divergence based closure, recently developed for rarefied gases i.e. with a velocity variable describing R d Rd , to the radiative transfer equation where velocity describes the unit sphere S 2 S2 . This closure is analyzed and a numerical method to compute it is provided. Eventually, it provides the main desirable properties to the resulting system of moments: Similarly to the entropy minimizing closure ( M N MN ), it dissipates an entropy and captures exactly the equilibrium distribution . However, contrarily to M N MN , it remains computationally tractable even at high order and it relies on an exact quadrature formula which preserves exactly symmetry properties , i.e. it does not trigger ray effects. The purely anisotropic regimes (beams) are not captured exactly but they can be approached as close as desired and the closures remains again tractable in this limit.},

Next, we use a Crank–Nicolson scheme to advance in time. For the numerical verification of our numerical model, we first consider a manufactured solution, and then we consider a case with wavefront propagation in two-dimensional polygonal grids. Next, we carry out a simulation of α α -synuclein spreading in a two-dimensional brain slice in the sagittal plane with a polygonal agglomerated grid that takes full advantage of the flexibility of PolyDG approximation.

A greater understanding of the mechanisms for glymphatic transport may provide insight into how amyloid beta (A β β ) and tau agglomerates, key biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, accumulate and drive disease progression. In this study, we develop an image-guided computational model to describe glymphatic transport and A β β deposition throughout the brain. A β β transport and deposition are modeled using an advection–diffusion equation coupled with an irreversible amyloid accumulation (damage) model. We use immersed isogeometric analysis, stabilized using the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) method, where the transport model is constructed using parameters inferred from brain imaging data resulting in a subject-specific model that accounts for anatomical geometry and heterogeneous material properties. Both short-term (30-min) and long-term (12-month) 3D simulations of soluble amyloid transport within a mouse brain model were constructed from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) data. In addition to matching short-term patterns of tracer deposition, we found that transport parameters such as CSF flow velocity play a large role in amyloid plaque deposition. The computational tools developed in this work will facilitate investigation of various hypotheses related to glymphatic transport and fundamentally advance our understanding of its role in neurodegeneration, which is crucial for the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions.},

In the first stage, unknown modal coordinates are identified with an improved iterative model reduction technique. Subsequently, a modified TMCMC algorithm is proposed where obtaining the statistical estimators in the usual TMCMC algorithm is not necessary. In detail, an affine-invariance sampling approach is proposed to estimate a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) factor in the affine-transformed space that accounts for the frequencies and mode shapes which are of different natures and dimensions at the levels of likelihood, prior and posterior distributions. The TMCMC sampling adaptively utilizes the plausibility value from the proposed MDS-based tuning algorithm to improve its transition levels. The proposed algorithm in the affine-invariance sampling space accounting for the observables of different dimensions is expected to facilitate the estimation of the posterior distribution of model parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by considering a simply-supported steel beam, a ten-storied reinforced concrete building model and an eight-degree-of-freedom spring–mass model for which experimental data is available. The second example demonstrates the applicability of the approach for updating large finite element models involving substructuring.},

To be specific, the hole number is controlled by means of the initial setting of internal hole features in the design domain. The hole shape is controlled by introducing specific hole features. The hole size is controlled directly by means of design variables describing hole features, and the hole spacing is controlled by limiting the relative positions of hole features. It is shown that different hole control can be simultaneously imposed globally over the whole design domain or in the local regions of the structure.

  abstract     = {An original math-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm, named quadratic interpolation optimization (QIO), is proposed to address numerical optimization and engineering issues. The main inspiration behind QIO is derived from mathematics, specifically the newly proposed generalized quadratic interpolation (GQI) method. This method overcomes the limitations of the traditional quadratic interpolation method to better find the minimizer of the quadratic function formed by any three points. The QIO utilizes the GQI method as a promising searching mechanism for tackling various types of optimization problems. This searching mechanism delivers exploration and exploitation strategies, in which the minimizer provided by the GQI method assists the QIO algorithm in exploring a promising region in unexplored areas and exploit the optimal solutions in promising regions. To evaluate QIO’s effectiveness, it is comprehensively compared with 12 other commonly used optimizers on 23 benchmark test functions and the CEC-2014 test suite. Ten engineering problems are also tested to assess QIO’s practicality. Eventually, a real-world application of QIO is presented in the operation management of a microgrid with an energy storage system. The results demonstrate that QIO is a promising alternative for addressing practical challenges.

In this work, a surface quadrilateral layout is alternatively characterized as a special immersion of a cut representation of the surface into the Euclidean plane . We call this a quad layout immersion. This characterization, while posed in smooth topology, naturally generalizes to piecewise-linear representations. As such, it mathematically describes and generalizes integer grid maps, which represent the current state-of-the-art. Due to its generality, the proposed representation supports a range of different computational methods to extract quadrilateral layouts. This is demonstrated by several computational examples, including the extraction of quadrilateral layouts on a 1996 Dodge Neon.},

It can accurately reflect the physical world in real-time, enabling online monitoring, control, and prediction operations. Their foundation is super-real-time computing and high data representation capabilities. However, current DTs do not achieve 3D super-real-time computing. This study proposes a novel 3D computational method for solving fluid–solid coupling problems in a super-real-time. The method is based on a mixed solution framework that combines traditional numerical methods with deep learning operators. Specifically, the method employs multi-core CPU parallel acceleration to solve the solid equations while leveraging the computing power of GPU to solve the fluid equations. The fluid–solid coupling is achieved through information exchange between the GPU and the multi-core CPU. In addition, the proposed method introduces a new deep learning operator framework based on the DeepONET. The framework is accompanied by a database structure that facilitates model training and validation and a loss function that guides the training. The space nuclear reactor, an improved TOPAZ-II system, was selected to demonstrate its feasibility. Four non-training transient conditions were simulated to test the generalization performance. The results show that the proposed method achieves an average error between the calculated results and reference values below 2.5%, with the average error of thermodynamic parameters below 1.5%. The average deviation between system parameter peak values during the transient process and the reference value was less than 5 s. The result meets the acceptable error level and satisfies the super-real-time requirements with a time acceleration ratio of approximately 1.17, which is 60 times faster than traditional numerical methods. The results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for DT.},

  abstract     = {Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) necessitates quadrilateral meshing owing to the utilization of NURBS or other locally tensor-product spline functions as the foundation for its analysis. It is a widely held misconception that the generation of cross fields over the surface domain – a common precursor to quad-mesh construction – establishes equivalence between cross fields and quad-meshes. In this study, we dispel this notion by presenting theorems that distinctly delineate the singularity configurations of both cross fields and quad-meshes. It is posited that these can be viewed as characteristic classes of different fiber bundles , where cross field singularity aligns with the cross fiber bundle and structured mesh singularity corresponds to holomorphic line bundles . As a result, the conditions necessitating quad-mesh singularities are decidedly more stringent than those for cross field singularities. This explains a notable query in the field: the absence of a 3-5 quad-mesh (a quad-mesh with two singularities with topological valence 3 and 5 respectively) on a torus. Additionally, the theoretical framework is broadened to incorporate other types of structured meshes. The formulated theorems give rise to practical algorithms for cross field construction and structured mesh generation . The efficacy and applicability of these algorithms are corroborated through numerical examples that not only validate the theoretical findings but also underscore their practical usability.},

The advantages of the MPM in handling free surface flows and the capability of the MDEM in modeling the mechanical behaviors of irregular shape particles are integrated. To calculate normal and tangential interaction forces, a DEM-based coupling strategy is employed. Furthermore, a novel collision scheme is introduced to accurately determine collision characteristics between MPM points and MDEM particles, particularly when their diameters differ significantly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coupling approach, three classical benchmarks are conducted. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data , demonstrating the coupling model’s capability to accurately capture complex fluid–particle interactions.

  abstract     = {For the first time the optimal local truncation error method (OLTEM) with 125-point stencils and unfitted Cartesian meshes has been developed in the general 3-D case for the Poisson equation for heterogeneous materials with smooth irregular interfaces. The 125-point stencils equations that are similar to those for quadratic finite elements are used for OLTEM. The interface conditions for OLTEM are imposed as constraints at a small number of interface points and do not require the introduction of additional unknowns, i.e., the sparse structure of global discrete equations of OLTEM is the same for homogeneous and heterogeneous materials. The stencils coefficients of OLTEM are calculated by the minimization of the local truncation error of the stencil equations. These derivations include the use of the Poisson equation for the relationship between the different spatial derivatives . Such a procedure provides the maximum possible accuracy of the discrete equations of OLTEM. In contrast to known numerical techniques with quadratic elements and third order of accuracy on conforming and unfitted meshes, OLTEM with the 125-point stencils provides 11-th order of accuracy, i.e., an extremely large increase in accuracy by 8 orders for similar stencils. The numerical results show that OLTEM yields much more accurate results than high-order finite elements with much wider stencils. The increased numerical accuracy of OLTEM leads to an extremely large increase in computational efficiency. Also, a new post-processing procedure with the 125-point stencil has been developed for the calculation of the spatial derivatives of the primary function . The post-processing procedure includes the minimization of the local truncation error and the use of the Poisson equation. It is demonstrated that the use of the partial differential equation (PDE) for the 125-point stencils improves the accuracy of the spatial derivatives by 6 orders compared to post-processing without the use of PDE as in existing numerical techniques . At an accuracy of 0.1% for the spatial derivatives, OLTEM reduces the number of degrees of freedom by 900 − 4 ⋅ 1 0 6 900−4⋅106 times compared to quadratic finite elements . The developed post-processing procedure can be easily extended to unstructured meshes and can be independently used with existing post-processing techniques (e.g., with finite elements).},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel framework for investigating fluid–membrane interactions involving fracture, and apply it to simulate initial stages during the bursting of a balloon. Fluid flow is computed using a stabilized space–time finite element method over a body-fitted mesh. The membrane is modelled as a hyperelastic material and the equations are solved using the standard Galerkin method. Structural failure is incorporated using the element deletion technique based on a simple strain based criterion. Change in topology of the fluid domain due to element deletion is handled without resorting to remeshing. The coincident fluid nodes on either side of the deleted membrane elements on the surface of the balloon are connected, thereby allowing the fluid to gush through the opening. First, fluid–membrane interaction, without failure, in a square sail with fixed edges is studied. The sail exhibits vibration owing to vortices shed from its edges. We then study the inflation and deflation of a spherical balloon equipped with an inlet pipe . A hydrostatic pressure gradient is applied to drive the flow into the balloon. Effect of different values of membrane density, stiffness and the hydrostatic pressure gradient on inflation rate and balloon shape is studied. The bursting of the inflated balloon is initiated by deleting one structural element on its surface. The proposed algorithm is then applied to simulate the subsequent dynamics of the fluid–membrane system.},

Despite considerable research on buckling-constrained topology optimization, maximizing the critical buckling load factor (BLF) still remains a challenging topic. In this study, an innovative algorithm that utilizes a linear material interpolation scheme is introduced to maximize the buckling resistance of structures. The linear material model offers several advantages, such as obviating the need to select the penalization schemes and penalty values, facilitating straightforward sensitivity analysis, and removing the ambiguous physical meaning of penalization for the stress stiffness matrix . The accuracy of the linear material model for buckling analysis is systematically examined, and the avoidance of stress singularities in low-density regions is investigated. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are supported by four buckling optimization design examples, which also demonstrate substantial improvements compared to the existing algorithms.},

To overcome this challenge, coarse-grained (CG) particles have been introduced in the DEM-PBM coupled framework. In this study, we proposed a new CG-enabled DEM-PBM coupled framework that builds upon the previous work of Das et al. (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 478 (2261) (2022) 20220076). By incorporating the CG technique, the particle number density is reduced, resulting in fewer collisions compared to the resolved system. To address this issue, a scaling law has been developed to derive the collision frequency of the resolved system from the CG system. The verification of the new scaling law has been demonstrated through various simulation studies. Furthermore, the entire DEM-PBM coupled framework has been modified using the proposed methodology. The efficiency of the CG–DEM–PBM coupled simulation method has been successfully demonstrated through simulations of rotating drum and continuous mixing technology (CMT). Compared to the resolved simulation approach, the newly proposed CG-enabled DEM-PBM coupled framework maintains accuracy in terms of particle size distribution and other essential findings while significantly reducing simulation time.},

The verified NP-MFM, along with the genetic algorithm, is implemented on a GPU platform to search optimal values of operational parameters that generate CGs closely matching user-prescribed profiles. Results show that the NP-MFM is a feasible multi-fidelity modeling approach for rapid and accurate prediction of CGs (with 0.019s/simulation) and can be used for GPU-enabled μ μ CGG design optimization and automation. Furthermore, design CGs generated by the proposed method match user-prescribed CGs very well with an averaged discrepancy less than 0.34.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a numerical formulation for modeling turbulent multi-phase, multi-fluid flows over real-life marine devices is presented. The flow field is governed by the Navier–Stokes equations with an Arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) description of the continuum for handling independent domain movements. The multi-phase phenomenon is modeled for an iso-thermal homogeneous mixture of water vapor and liquid phases using a transport equation for the vapor volume fraction . The multi-fluid phenomenon is modeled using the level-set method where a geometric function, namely, the signed distance function (SDF) describes the level-set field. Turbulence modeling is handled in the context of the variational multiscale (VMS) method resulting in an ALE-VMS formulation for multi-phase, multi-fluid flows over moving hydrodynamic objects. Several augmentations to the formulation are discussed in this paper including the sliding interface (SI) operator and its role in enforcing the compatibility of solution fields between in-contact computational subdomains during the different steps of the solution. This formulation is validated against experimental data for a real-life horizontal-axis marine turbine under different flow conditions including single-phase flows, multi-phase flows and multi-fluid flows. The performance of the turbine as well as the expected flow behaviors are compared to the experimental data with success. An additional case is simulated for a multi-phase, multi-fluid flow condition showing the capabilities and robustness of the presented numerical formulation.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven modeling in mechanics is evolving rapidly based on recent machine learning advances, especially on artificial neural networks. As the field matures, new data and models created by different groups become available, opening possibilities for cooperative modeling. However, artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, i.e. they forget how to perform an old task when trained on a new one. This hinders cooperation because adapting an existing model for a new task affects the performance on a previous task trained by someone else. The authors developed a continual learning method 1 that addresses this issue, applying it here for the first time to solid mechanics. In particular, the method is applied to recurrent neural networks to predict history-dependent plasticity behavior, although it can be used on any other architecture (feedforward, convolutional, etc.) and to predict other phenomena. This work intends to spawn future developments on continual learning that will foster cooperative strategies among the mechanics community to solve increasingly challenging problems. We show that the chosen continual learning strategy can sequentially learn several constitutive laws without forgetting them, using less data to achieve the same error as standard (non-cooperative) training of one law per model.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel explicit approach for designing complex thin-walled structures based on the Moving Morphable Component (MMC) method is proposed, which provides a unified framework to systematically address various design issues, including topology optimization , reinforced-rib layout optimization, and sandwich structure design problems. The complexity of thin-walled structures mainly comes from flexible geometries and the variation of thickness. On the one hand, the geometric complexity of thin-walled structures leads to the difficulty in automatically describing material distribution (e.g., reinforced ribs). On the other hand, thin-walled structures with different thicknesses require various hypotheses (e.g., Kirchhoff–Love shell theory and Reissner–Mindlin shell theory) to ensure the precision of structural responses. Whereas for cases that do not fit the shell hypothesis, the precision loss of response solutions is non-negligible in the optimization process since the accumulation of errors will cause entirely different designs. Hence, the current article proposes a novel embedded solid component to tackle these challenges. The geometric constraints that make the components fit to the curved thin-walled structure are whereby satisfied. Compared with traditional strategies, the proposed method is free from the limit of shell assumptions of structural analysis and can achieve optimized designs with clear load transmission paths at the cost of few design variables and degrees of freedom for finite element analysis (FEA). Finally, we apply the proposed method to several representative examples to demonstrate its effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and potential to handle complex industrial structures.},

However, it is equally necessary to solve discontinuous problems such as cracking behaviors in structures and materials, which are challenging to describe using partial differential equations in traditional solid mechanics frameworks. In this work, PINNs are established with the constraint of integral–differential equations in bond-based peridynamic to simulate crack initiation and propagation behaviors in quasi-brittle plates. To solve the cracking behaviors, the initial displacements of the plate are determined by minimizing the total potential energy through the optimization of global network parameters. The subsequent displacements during crack initiation or propagation are characterized by transfer learning to accelerate convergence. The simulated crack paths for four cases with or without precracks are consistent with those obtained in existing studies based on experiments or numerical simulations. Moreover, the effects of network regularization and neuron scales on the nonlinear displacement characterization performance are investigated.},

  abstract     = {In deterministic topology optimization (TO), due to not taking into account the uncertainties of the structural system, explicitly, resulting optimal layouts may conclude in low reliable levels or unreliable optimum design conditions. The objective of reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) is to integrate the reliability concept into topology optimization, finding the optimized structures priori by the designer through a mathematical framework guaranteeing that the least reliability level is achieved. In the present investigation under a constant volume fraction , the bisection algorithm is implemented for approximating the optimal feature of the structure in the TO framework by applying the moving iso-surface threshold (MIST) topology optimization approach. The results from the previous step are employed to consider uncertainties by a reliability analysis algorithm . A reliability analytical method based on dynamical accelerated formulation is combined with the TO-based bisection algorithm as a novel sequential topology optimization and reliability analysis (STORA) for RBTO. The descent condition is guaranteed in the dynamical accelerated mean value method to search the most probable point which is applied in TO for finding optimum layouts of continuous structure problems. A dynamical step factor in the reliability loop of the STORA and the MIST integration are applied to find the optimum layouts in the optimization loop. Illustrative examples are presented for validation and to maintain the capability of the proposed sequential topology optimization and dynamical accelerated mean value (STO-DAMV). Based on the results, it is demonstrated that the application of reliability analysis with the integration of bisection in topology optimization can produce a robust reliability analysis with stable results in RBTO which facilitates a more reliable design than that acquired by TO. It is also concluded that, under identical accuracy, STO-DAMV for STORA is improved in view of computational robustness.},

Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques are known to be effective in tackling global optimization problems using a relatively small number objective function evaluations, but their performance suffers when dealing with high-dimensional outputs. To overcome the major challenge of dimensionality, here we propose a deep learning framework for BO and sequential decision making based on bootstrapped ensembles of neural architectures with randomized priors. Using appropriate architecture choices, we show that the proposed framework can approximate functional relationships between design variables and quantities of interest, even in cases where the latter take values in high-dimensional vector spaces or even infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the context of BO, we augmented the proposed probabilistic surrogates with re-parameterized Monte Carlo approximations of multiple-point (parallel) acquisition functions, as well as methodological extensions for accommodating black-box constraints and multi-fidelity information sources. We test the proposed framework against state-of-the-art methods for BO and demonstrate superior performance across several challenging tasks with high-dimensional outputs, including a constrained multi-fidelity optimization task involving shape optimization of rotor blades in turbo-machinery.},

This work aims at developing numerical tools to handle mechanical analysis, and later on shape optimisation, of 3D aircraft engine compressor blades using IGA. More precisely, our final goal is to carry out shape optimisation of one precise patch belonging to a complex multipatch structure, while having other patches to follow automatically the geometric changes. To meet this goal, work on geometric and modeling aspects are needed, which is the objective of this paper. Using the proposed techniques to perform gradient-based shape optimisation constitutes a work in itself and is therefore not presented here, but will be detailed in a follow-up paper. In our case, the complete blade assembly is represented using several volumetric patches: the airfoil , the platform, the tenon and the fillet. In order to ensure the geometric compatibility between the different patches, we propose an embedded solid element formulation. A mortar method is implemented in order to guarantee the coupling between the various parts of the assembly. The results show a great potential for the proposed approach for blades design, while concurrently offering broad perspectives in terms of applications.},

Computational Fluid Dynamic technology at Dassault Aviation relies on numerical formulations developed by T.J.R. Hughes. Continued efforts over the past years have led to impressive capability and new tools that are applied to the design of both long-range business jets and military aircraft. Recent advances are related to multidisciplinary design technology and to complex flow physics associated to turbulence and transition phenomena. This paper will present a number of examples to illustrate these new capabilities. Methods developed for the flutter analysis of configurations with complex flow features will be discussed.

  abstract     = {Inverse homogenization in combination with contact modeling, topology optimization and shape optimization is used to design metamaterials with optimized macroscopic response. The homogenization assumes length scale separation which allows the non-linear macroscopic behavior to be obtained by analyzing a single unit cell in a lattice structure. Self contact in the unit cell, which is modeled using a third medium contact method, is leveraged to obtain a complex homogenized response. The inverse homogenization problem is initially formulated as a topology optimization problem , where the macroscopic stress–strain behavior is tuned to our liking. However, it is well known that boundary phenomena are difficult to model in topology optimization and that interface modeling is crucial to accurately analyze contact. For that reason, the boundary representation of the topology optimized design is extracted and used as initial design in a subsequent shape optimization. The behaviors of our designs are verified by performing rigorous post-processing analyzes using conforming meshes and conventional contact formulations.},

  abstract     = {The challenge of material surface damage and spalling, caused by high-frequency, high-pressure jets owing to cavitation, remains a substantial concern. To better understand the physical mechanisms of cavitation-induced cyclic impact, we developed a multi-field-coupling framework. This framework encapsulates polymer viscoelastic-viscoplastic deformation, thermal softening , strain softening, and damage evolution represented by phase fields, which are crucial processes in cyclic impact. Particularly, we achieved full coupling between these key physical processes by introducing appropriate functional forms. We emphasize the need to include both plasticity and viscosity in the energy-driving crack propagation , to accurately represent the accumulation of polymer fatigue damage. With this thermodynamically consistent, fully coupled model, we could simulate surface ring cracking, a phenomenon often observed experimentally under cyclical impact loading . In the context of this particular crack morphology, we also discerned distinct fatigue failure mechanisms when variables such as strength, the radial extent of the cavitation impact load, and others were altered. We propose that a key determinant of cavitation flow impact is the combined effect of thermal softening, strain softening, and phase-field degradation within the polymer. Understanding these mechanisms offers a deeper insight into cavitation damage and provides a theoretical basis for cavitation-resistant design.},

  abstract     = {The eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) is a versatile technique to model discontinuities by enriching the trial functions with a prior solution. In the X-FEM, a crack can be explicitly represented by a set of triangles or implicit signed distances, i.e., level set functions , of the points of interest from the crack surface and the crack front. In the explicit representations, it is crucial to accurately evaluate surface normal, conormal, and tangent vectors along crack fronts for computations of the gradients of the enriching functions. The solution is very sensitive to these directional vectors , especially for non-planar 3D cracks. We here propose a novel approach to compute these gradients without evaluating the directional vectors. Level set functions are first set up in a hexahedral grid independent of the background mesh in the X-FEM. We can thus implement the Weight Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme to compute the gradients of level sets. The gradients of the enriching functions at any integration point can therefore be computed by interpolations and chain rules. We compare the implementation procedures of the explicit representation and the proposed hybrid representation in detail. A three-dimensional lens crack problem is studied to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method, especially for coarse meshes.},

Subsequently, the hyper dual step derivative approximation, without truncation and subtractive cancellation errors , is employed to compute the Jacobian matrix and consistent tangent operator, ensuring quadratic convergence in both local and global computations. The size of the Newton search step is optimized by the line search technique, thereby enhancing the convergence in solving nonlinear stress integral equations. Finally, the proposed stress update algorithm is used to implement the non-associated Mohr–Coulomb plastic model in the ABAQUS software using the UMAT subroutine.

  abstract     = {Polycrystals illuminated by high-energy X-rays or neutrons produce diffraction patterns in which the measured diffraction peaks encode the individual single crystal strain states. While state of the art X-ray and neutron diffraction approaches can be used to routinely recover per grain mean strain tensors , less work has been produced on the recovery of higher order statistics of the strain distributions across the individual grains. In the setting of small deformations , we consider the problem of estimating the crystal elastic strain tensor probability distribution from diffraction data. For the special case of multivariate Gaussian strain tensor probability distributions, we show that while the mean of the distribution is well defined from measurements, the covariance of strain has a null-space. We show that there exist exactly 6 orthogonal perturbations to this covariance matrix under which the measured strain signal is invariant. In particular, we provide analytical parametrisations of these perturbations together with the set of possible maximum-likelihood estimates for a multivariate Gaussian fit to data. The parametric description of the null-space provides insights into the strain PDF modes that cannot be accurately estimated from the diffraction data. Understanding these modes prevents erroneous conclusions from being drawn based on the data. Beyond Gaussian strain tensor probability densities , we derive an iterative radial basis regression scheme in which the strain tensor probability density is estimated by a sparse finite basis expansion. This is made possible by showing that the operator mapping the strain tensor probability density onto the measured histograms of directional strain is linear, without approximation . The utility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical simulations in the setting of single crystal monochromatic X-ray scattering. The proposed regression methods were found to robustly reject outliers and accurately predict the strain tensor probability distributions in the presence of Gaussian measurement noise.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an innovative approach for developing an efficient reduced-order model to study the dispersion of urban air pollutants. The need for real-time air quality monitoring has become increasingly important, given the rise in pollutant emissions due to urbanization and its adverse effects on human health. The proposed methodology involves solving the linear advection–diffusion problem, where the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations gives the convective field. At the same time, the source term consists of an empirical time series. However, the computational requirements of this approach, including microscale spatial resolution, repeated evaluation, and low time scale, necessitate the use of high-performance computing facilities, which can be a bottleneck for real-time monitoring. To address this challenge, a problem-specific methodology was developed that leverages a data-driven approach based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with regression (POD-R) coupled with Galerkin projection (POD-G) endorsed with the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The proposed method employs a feedforward Neural Network (NN) to non-intrusively retrieve the reduced-order convective operator required for online evaluation. The numerical framework was validated on synthetic emissions and real wind measurements. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational burden of the traditional approach and is suitable for real-time air quality monitoring. Overall, the study advances the field of reduced order modeling and highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in environmental modeling and large-scale simulations.},

  abstract     = {The combination of topology optimization and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), a kind of metal additive manufacturing, has attracted attention because of its ability to manufacture complex optimal structures with metal materials. However, LPBF must satisfy geometric constraints, e.g., overhang constraint and closed cavity exclusion constraint. Several previous studies proposed the fictitious physics model (FPM) to describe and consider these constraints. However, there exists a problem where the objective of the mechanical model (MM) describing physical phenomena conflicts with that of the FPM, resulting in poor convergence. To solve the convergence problem, we propose a coupled fictitious physics model (CFPM) in this paper. In the CFPM, the material constant in the MM is varied in the regions that violate the geometric constraints defined by the FPM such that the objective function of the MM worsens. Then, the objective of the FPM is integrated into that of the MM, potentially improving convergence. This paper formulates the CFPM and performs sensitivity analysis on representative optimization problems considering geometric constraints for LPBF. In addition, we verify through numerical examples whether the CFPM can lead to an optimal structure that satisfies the geometric constraints and can improve convergence. The proposed method to couple the two models can also be applied to topology optimization considering various geometric constraints in other manufacturing requirements.},

This technology leverages modern AI-based image segmentation methods to extract the geometry of the coronary arteries from noninvasive computed tomography volumetric imaging, computational physiology methods to define boundary conditions and computational fluid dynamic techniques to compute coronary artery flow and pressure. The methods described herein have been used to compute the fractional flow reserve (FFR) in the coronary arteries, namely the ratio of pressure in a coronary artery to the reference aortic pressure under conditions of maximum hyperemia induced by the intravenous administration of a vasodilator to mimic increased coronary artery blood flow as occurs during physical activity. The fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) using patient-specific models of coronary artery blood flow is referred to as FFR CT CT and has been validated against invasive measurements using pressure wires in several hundred patients and subsequently evaluated in clinical trials in several thousand patients. Patient-specific models of coronary artery blood flow can be used to predict outcomes of coronary artery revascularization procedures, to identify patients at risk of having a heart attack, and to model tissue perfusion of the microcirculation by coupling with emerging models of cardiac function.

The generalized Maxwell model for one-dimensional solids is here efficiently extended to the case of arbitrarily curved beams undergoing finite displacement and rotations. High efficiency is achieved by combining a series of distinguishing features, that are: (i) the formulation is displacement-based, therefore no additional unknowns, other than incremental displacements and rotations, are needed for the internal variables associated with the rate-dependent material; (ii) the governing equations are discretized in space using the isogeometric collocation method, meaning that elements integration is totally bypassed; (iii) finite rotations are updated using the incremental rotation vector , leading to two main benefits: minimum number of rotation unknowns (the three components of the incremental rotation vector) and no singularity problems; (iv) the same SO(3)-consistent linearization of the governing equations and update procedures as for non-rate-dependent linear elastic material can be used; (v) a standard second-order accurate time integration scheme is made consistent with the underlying geometric structure of the kinematic problem. Moreover, taking full advantage of the isogeometric analysis features, the formulation permits accurately representing beams and beam structures with highly complex initial shape and topology, paving the way for a large number of potential applications in the field of architectured materials, meta-materials, morphing/programmable objects, topological optimizations , etc. Numerical applications are finally presented in order to demonstrate attributes and potentialities of the proposed formulation.},

New FVM-SPH coupling approaches are explored, including online SPH particle injection and deletion around time persistent SPH regions around shocks. The SPH simulation is coupled to the FVM simulation through boundary particles surrounding the active SPH regions, with FVM values interpolated to SPH boundary particles at each timestep. Values in active SPH regions are similarly interpolated to the overlying FVM mesh at each timestep. The performance of the hybrid FVM-SPH scheme in comparison to the individual FVM and SPH methods on two-dimensional test problems is assessed. Our results indicate that the hybrid approach offers higher computational efficiency than SPH while preserving its accuracy, although it remains slower than the FVM. This hybrid SPH algorithm may enable future compressible fluid simulations with more extensive capabilities than grid-based methods alone, offering potential applications in modeling fluid–structure interaction and solid deformation and fracturing in blast simulations. Further research will focus on applying the hybrid method to three-dimensional blast problems, where the relative computational cost reduction is expected to be more significant.},

This is done in two ways. Firstly, this paper extends the reasoning of Harten and Hyman required by the ARoe method to include the source term contributions and thus arrives to a more complete formulation of the entropy fix, which will be compared with the approximation presented in previous works through numerical experiments. Secondly, it is shown how a relaxation of the criteria used when choosing waves in the HLLS method yields better solutions to problems where the HLLS would previously fail.

The propagation of these three groups of models through expensive-to-evaluate simulators to quantify the uncertainties of outputs is then one of the core, yet highly challenging task in reliability engineering, as it involves a demanding double-loop numerical dilemma. For addressing this issue, the Collaborative and Adaptive Bayesian Optimization (CABO) has been developed in our previous work, but it only applies to imprecise probability models and is only capable of bounding the output expectation. We present a substantial improvement of CABO to incorporate all three categories of uncertainty models and to bound arbitrary probabilistic measures such as output variance and failure probability. The algorithm is based on a collaborative active learning mechanism, that is, jointly performing Bayesian optimization in the epistemic uncertainty subspace and Bayesian cubature in the aleatory uncertainty subspace, thus allowing to adaptively produce training samples in the joint uncertainty space. An efficient conditional Gaussian process simulation algorithm is embedded in CABO for acquiring training points and Bayesian inference in both uncertain subspaces. Benchmark studies show that CABO exhibits a remarkable performance in terms of numerical efficiency, accuracy, and global convergence.},

  abstract     = {The concurrent design of different lattice material microstructures and their corresponding macro-scale distributions has great potential in achieving both lightweight and desired multiphysical performances. In such design problems, the lattice microstructures are usually separately optimized on the basis of the homogenization method, and the possibly poor connectivity between them is a key factor that severely hinders the fabrication and application of optimized two-scale structures. To handle the microstructure connectivity issue, this paper proposes a novel microstructure connectable strategy to bridge the gap between the two-scale and the full-scale model using the material-field series expansion (MFSE) method. Assuming different lattice material types in several pre-defined macro-scale regions, describe all types of microstructural topology with different portions of one material field function and update them simultaneously during the optimization process. Benefits from the material field definition with spatial correlation , the microstructures are well-connected without requiring additional constraints in the topology optimization model. The energy-based homogenization method is utilized for bridging the two-scale with different microstructures, while a decoupled sensitivities analysis for the microscale is employed to enhance the computation efficiency. Additionally, the proposed method significantly reduces the dimension of design variables, resulting in lower optimizer spending. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by several benchmark two-scale problems. Compared to density-based connectable methods, the proposed framework is easy to implement and reduces computational time by an order of magnitude in the 2D case.},

An adaptive, nested, and non-intrusive Chebyshev interpolation process based on Leja sequences is formulated to approximate the response surface concerning random inputs, in which the discrete responses are parallelly obtained and incrementally augmented to save computational effort . The response surface is taken as a surrogate model to promote the efficiency of the stochastic analysis .

  abstract     = {In this research, a numerical framework for hydraulic fracturing has been formulated, incorporating thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupled effects. While previous studies have reported various hydraulic fracturing models based on the phase-field method, a THM coupling scheme grounded in the variational phase-field approach remains unexplored. The THM coupling is of paramount importance for understanding underground fracture propagation. This study’s principal innovation lies in its extension of the variational phase field model, introducing it to a thermoporoelastic medium, thereby integrating fluid flow and heat transfer elements in fractured materials. In our advanced model, the fluid flow and heat transfer in the matrix and fracture are modeled independently. Subsequently, employing a set of reasonable assumptions, we introduce unified flow and heat transfer equations derived from phase-field calculus. A pivotal contribution of our work is the development of an iterative solution algorithm based on the fixed stress method, pivotal for tackling the THM coupled system. The proposed equations are discretized employing the FEM. Additionally, to address the numerical oscillations in advection-dominant issues that manifest in the heat transfer model, we have applied a generalized Streamline Upwind Petrov Galerkin method for 8-node elements. The accuracy of fracture propagation was assessed by comparing the numerical results of the evolution of fracture length, fracture width at the injection point, and the injection pressure under the K K regime with the corresponding analytical solution. Furthermore, the process of heat transfer within a fractured domain, often referred to as the Barends problem, has been studied by proposed model. Additionally, some numerical experiments were conducted to gain insights into the intricate interplay between the thermal–hydraulic–mechanical system during hydraulic fracturing, thereby further emphasizing the significance of our advanced model.},

  abstract     = {Concrete, with its heterogeneous internal structure of cement mortar and grains, exhibits complex quasi-brittle cracking where a gradual decrease in the material integrity is observed. In practical engineering, concrete structures are commonly under loading conditions that cause complex mixed mode fracture patterns. Hence, the prediction of failure mechanisms and patterns in concrete is a demanding task. In the past decades , computational fracture modeling of concrete has proven to be a suitable substitute for costly experimental testing. Among many fracture models, the phase field approach, owing to its ability to capture various crack phenomena without a need for ad hoc criteria, has gained significant attention. Although there exist phase field models applied to various failure mechanisms ranging from brittle to ductile fractures , only a limited number of them deal with the quasi-brittle cracking observed in concrete. Hence, in this work, a thermodynamically consistent phase field approach for quasi-brittle fracture is presented, and its performance for capturing the mixed mode failure patterns of concrete is investigated. Starting from a purely geometric approach , the evolution of fracture is associated with a constitutive crack driving functional. The crack driving force is related to an equivalent effective stress measure leading to a simple, yet versatile, framework in which various failure criteria can be implicitly incorporated into the framework. In particular, equivalent effective stresses based on the Rankine , Drucker–Prager, modified von Mises, and three-parameter failure criteria are derived. A unified form of the equivalent effective stress encompassing all the models is also proposed, which offers flexibility in choosing an appropriate driving force , and allows a simple implementation into a finite element framework. Utilizing this unified form, the effectiveness of the aforementioned driving forces in capturing complex mixed mode cracking in concrete is investigated by comparing the results obtained from computational simulations to existing experimental data . In particular, the load–displacement curves and the crack propagation paths are compared with the corresponding experimental observations, and a systematic study of the performance of different driving forces is detailed in this study.},

The specific structures of these vesicles play fundamental roles in cytobiology and drug transportation. To model the multiple lipid vesicles in a fluid environment, we use the multi-phase conservative Allen–Cahn-type equations with approximately area-preserving penalty terms to capture the vesicle interfaces and the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations to describe the evolution of velocity and pressure. To efficiently simulate this complex coupled fluid system, we introduce several time-dependent variables to transform the total energy functional and the governing equations into equivalent forms . Based on these equivalent models, we develop a totally decoupled, energy-stable, and temporally second-order accurate time-marching scheme. A consistency-enhanced technique is utilized to correct the computed energy so that a more accurate solution is obtained. The time-discretized energy stability can be analytically estimated and the solution algorithm in each time step is easy to implement. Various numerical experiments, such as multi-component vesicles with different initial shapes, multiple vesicles in shear flow, and multiple vesicles in complex domains, are performed to verify the accuracy, stability, and capability of our proposed method.},

Classical symplectic model reduction approaches employ linear symplectic subspaces for representing the high-dimensional system states in a reduced-dimensional coordinate system. While these approximations respect the symplectic nature of Hamiltonian systems, linear basis approximations can suffer from slowly decaying Kolmogorov N N -width, especially in wave-type problems, which then requires a large basis size. We propose two different model reduction methods based on recently developed quadratic manifolds, each presenting its own advantages and limitations. The addition of quadratic terms to the state approximation, which sits at the heart of the proposed methodologies, enables us to better represent intrinsic low-dimensionality in the problem at hand. Both approaches are effective for issuing predictions in settings well outside the range of their training data while providing more accurate solutions than the linear symplectic reduced-order models.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently gained increasing attention in the field of topology optimization . The fusion of deep learning and topology optimization has emerged as a prominent area of insightful research, where minimization of the loss function in neural networks can be comparable to minimization of the objective function in topology optimization. Inspired by concepts of PINNs, this paper proposes a novel framework, ‘ Complete Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Topology Optimization (CPINNTO) ’, to address various challenges in topology optimization, particularly related to structural optimization. The key innovation of the proposed framework lies in introducing the first complete machine-learning-based topology optimization framework through integration of two distinct PINNs. Herein, the Deep Energy Method (DEM) PINN is implemented to determine the deformation state of corresponding structures numerically. In addition, derivation of the objective function with respect to design variables is replaced with automatic differentiation in sensitivity-analysis PINN (S-PINN). The feasibility and potential of the CPINNTO framework have been assessed through several case studies while highlighting strengths and limitations of utilizing PINNs in topology optimization. Subsequent findings indicate that CPINNTO can achieve optimal topologies without labeled data nor FEA . The numerical examples demonstrate that CPINNTO is capable of stably obtaining optimal structures for various topology optimization applications, including compliance minimization problems , multi-constrained problems, and three-dimensional problems. Resulting designs exhibit favorable compliance values comparable to the designs obtained via density-based topology optimization. In summary, the proposed CPINNTO framework opens up novel and interesting possibilities for structural topology optimization .},

The functionality of the filter becomes crucial at the boundaries of the optimized structure, where the fiber orientation is forced to conform to the morphology of the local boundaries. The developed filtering technique is incorporated into both the concurrent and sequential finite element-based topology and discrete fiber orientation optimization problem, and the respective optimization problems are formulated for the compliance minimization of the composite structure.

We show that, unlike the cooperative Data-Driven games proposed in the past, the new non-cooperative Data-Driven games identify an effective material law from the data and reduce to conventional displacement boundary-value problems, which facilitates their practical implementation. However, unlike supervised machine learning methods, the proposed non-cooperative Data-Driven games are unsupervised, ansatz –free and parameter–free. In particular, the effective material law is learned from the data directly, without recourse to regression to a parameterized class of functions such as neural networks. We present analysis that elucidates sufficient conditions for convergence of the Data-Driven solutions with respect to the data.

  abstract     = {This paper formulates, analyzes and demonstrates numerically a method for the explicit partitioned solution of coupled interface problems involving combinations of projection-based reduced order models (ROM) and/or full order models (FOMs). The method builds on the partitioned scheme developed in Peterson et al. (2019), which starts from a well-posed formulation of the coupled interface problem and uses its dual Schur complement to obtain an approximation of the interface flux. Explicit time integration of this problem decouples its subdomain equations and enables their independent solution on each subdomain. Extension of this partitioned scheme to coupled ROM–ROM or ROM–FOM problems requires formulations with non-singular Schur complements. To obtain these problems, we project a well-posed coupled FOM–FOM problem onto a composite reduced basis comprising separate sets of basis vectors for the interface and interior variables, and use the interface reduced basis as a Lagrange multiplier. Our analysis confirms that the resulting coupled ROM–ROM and ROM–FOM problems have provably non-singular Schur complements, independent of the mesh size and the reduced basis size. In the ROM–FOM case, analysis shows that one can also use the interface FOM space as a Lagrange multiplier. We illustrate the theoretical and computational properties of the partitioned scheme through reproductive and predictive tests for a model advection–diffusion transmission problem.},

We aim to transfer these concepts to immersed boundary methods , which perform simulations on a regular background mesh cut by a boundary representation that defines the domain of interest. Therefore, we present a novel concept to divide the support of cut basis functions to obtain regular parts suited for sum factorization. These regions require special discontinuous weighted quadrature rules, while Gauss-like quadrature rules integrate the remaining support. Two linear elasticity benchmark problems confirm the derived estimate for the computational costs of the different integration routines and their combination. Although the presence of cut elements reduces the speed-up, its contribution to the overall computation time declines with h h -refinement.},

The trial functions used in the 8-node hexahedral solid element in our previous work are adopted with minor revision. In addition, to eliminate the transverse shear and trapezoidal locking in the calculation of thin shell structures , the test functions are revised by the assumed natural strain method. The present solid-shell element inherits advantages from the original solid element and also alleviates the typical locking phenomena for shell elements. Numerical investigations show that the present element is insensitive to mesh distortion and has rapid convergence. In the tests of thin shell structures with bending, it can also provide locking-free predictions with high precision. Finally, the present element is extended to geometrically nonlinear analysis and its accuracy is demonstrated by a simple numerical example .},

Firstly, we freshly construct the dual order-reduced spaces that decouple and draw the features among the high-dimensional raw inputs (i.e., material/load uncertainties) and raw outputs (i.e., stress intensity factor and cracks) obtained by isogeometric boundary element simulator, respectively. Secondly, Gaussian Process emulators are built to map the features of the input to the features of the output in the constructed dual order-reduced spaces. Consequently, given new uncertain parameters, the proposed scheme can accurately predict the features with limited and noisy data, and project them back to the high-dimensional space quantifying the complex fatigue crack growth , including the mean value and confidence interval. Numerical examples are provided to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, including both material and load uncertainties having or without noise. The results demonstrate that the DORGP are highly efficient, with time consumption ranging from 1/4000 to 1/10000 of that required for numerical simulations, and accurate, with relative errors of less than 1%. Furthermore, the approach delivers probabilistic predictions using only a small dataset of samples (e.g., 25), significantly reducing the burden of collecting expensive fatigue data.},

The proposed framework is based on multiphysics topology optimization and a statistical mechanics-based LCE model to realize arbitrary curvature programming for LCE composites under large deformations. We propose a curvature-based optimization formulation that enables rotation-invariant and size-insensitive programmability of LCE, accounting for its highly nonlinear deformed shape. We demonstrate that the programmed LCE composites can accurately morph into a wide range of complex target shapes and curvatures, such as those of numbers, letters, flowers, and various objects. The resulting optimized designs exhibit highly irregular material distributions, which surpass intuition-based designs, and precisely produce desired deformed geometries upon temperature increase. The computational inverse design technique holds promise for a wide array of applications requiring function- and performance-driven design of active materials.},

Significant computational gains vs full-field simulations are obtained even for high contrast values. We also show that our strategy allows to investigate the influence of parameters of the microstructure on the macroscopic response.

MPET 2 2 offers a comprehensive framework for understanding complex porous media across multiple disciplines. Examples of its applications include studying rock formations, soil mechanics and subsurface reservoirs, investigating biological tissues, modeling groundwater flow and contaminant transport, and optimizing the design of porous materials. Despite the wide range of applications of the model, its numerical discretization has received little attention. Here we propose a stabilized formulation of the MPET 2 2 model. To address the unique challenges posed by the discretization of the MPET 2 2 model, we use multiple techniques including the Fluid Pressure Laplacian stabilization, Streamline Upwind Petrov–Galerkin stabilization, and discontinuity capturing. Our spatial discretization is based on Isogeometric Analysis with higher-order continuity basis functions. The fully discretized governing equations are solved simultaneously with a monolithic algorithm. We perform a convergence study of the proposed formulation. Then, we conduct a series of simulations of subcutaneous injection of monoclonal antibodies under different injection conditions. Our simulations show that the stabilized MPET 2 2 formulation can provide oscillation-free solutions for tissue deformation, fluid flow in the interstitial tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels, drug absorption in blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, as well as drug transport in each compartment. We also study the effects of different injection conditions on drug absorption, showing the potential of the proposed model and algorithm in the future optimization of injection strategy.},

We consider a smooth isogeometric discretization of the contact surface in order to avoid various artificial discontinuities of the normal contact gap function. Like any existing MIP-enhanced formulation in terms of implementation, the proposed MIP contact formulation only requires a minor modification from an existing implementation of the standard contact formulation. Nevertheless, the improvement in robustness is shown to be quite significant, which often enables the simulation of contact problems with a larger load step size for efficiency and/or a larger penalty parameter for accuracy in the contact constraint. The formalism of the proposed MIP contact method is based on the idea of relaxing the contact constitution at integration points. To this end, at first the contact pressure is considered as an additional unknown apart from the displacement field, and the perturbed Lagrange multiplier potential is used to enforce the contact constraint. The MIP method then eliminates the contact pressure unknown directly at integration points, instead of discretizing it as it is done in the standard mixed contact formulations. As a result, the residual vector is identical to the standard displacement-based contact formulation. However, the resulting tangent stiffness matrix is different, as the MIP tangent is now based on an extrapolation of the contact pressure iteratively over Newton iterations . Several challenging numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of the proposed formulation.},

The proposed solution schemes improve the computational efficiency of the isogeometric collocation simulations and exhibit numerical scalability for an increased number of subdomains .

The model describes the dynamics of a compressible conducting fluid in the low Mach number limit in the presence of electromagnetic fields and can be used to study aspects of astrophysical phenomena, important science and technology applications, and basic plasma physics phenomena. The specific applications that motivate this study are macroscopic simulations of the longer time-scale stability and disruptions of magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) devices, specifically the ITER tokamak. The discussion considers the development of the VMS FE representation, the structure of the stabilizing terms that deal with significant convective flows, the stabilization of the nearly incompressible response of the fluid flow, and the stabilization of the constraint that enforces the solenoidal involution on the magnetic field. The nonlinear discretized system is solved with scalable preconditioned Newton–Krylov iterative methods, which employs a multiphysics block preconditioning method based on approximate block factorizations and Schur complements. The study presents an evaluation of the VMS method on a 2D cartesian tearing mode instability, and illustrates the scalability of the solvers on MCF relevant problems. A set of results are also presented for longer time-scale stability and disruptions for the ITER tokamak. These include a vertical displacement event (VDE), and a (1,1) internal kink mode.

  abstract     = {The efficient representation of random fields on geometrically complex domains is crucial for Bayesian modelling in engineering and machine learning, including Gaussian process regression and statistical finite element analysis. Today’s prevalent random field representations are either intended for unbounded domains or are too restrictive in terms of possible field properties. Because of these limitations, new techniques leveraging the historically established link between stochastic PDEs (SPDEs) and random fields have been gaining interest in the statistics and engineering literature. The SPDE representation is especially appealing for engineering applications with complex geometries which already have a finite element discretisation for solving the physical conservation equations. In contrast to the dense covariance matrix of a random field, its inverse, the precision matrix, is usually sparse and equal to the stiffness matrix of an elliptic SPDE. In this paper, we use the SPDE representation to develop a scalable framework for large-scale statistical finite element analysis and Gaussian process (GP) regression on geometrically complex domains. The statistical finite element method (statFEM) introduced by Girolami et al. (2022) is a novel approach for synthesising measurement data and finite element models. In both statFEM and GP regression, we use the SPDE formulation to obtain the relevant prior probability densities with a sparse precision matrix. The properties of the priors are governed by the parameters and possibly fractional order of the SPDE so that we can model on bounded domains and manifolds anisotropic, non-stationary random fields with arbitrary smoothness. We use for assembling the sparse precision matrix the same finite element mesh used for solving the physical conservation equations. The observation models for statFEM and GP regression are such that the posterior probability densities are Gaussians with a closed-form mean and precision. The expressions for the mean vector and the precision matrix do not contain dense matrices and can be evaluated using only sparse matrix operations. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed framework and its convergence properties with one and two-dimensional Poisson and thin-shell examples.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian model updating based on Gaussian Process (GP) models has received attention in recent years, which incorporates kernel-based GPs to provide enhanced fidelity response predictions. Although most kernel functions provide high fitting accuracy in the training data set, their out-of-sample predictions can be highly inaccurate. This paper investigates this problem by reformulating the problem on a consistent probabilistic foundation, reviewing common choices of kernel covariance functions, and proposing a new Bayesian model selection for kernel function selection, aiming to create a balance between fitting accuracy, generalizability, and model parsimony. Computational aspects are addressed via Laplace approximation and sampling techniques, providing detailed algorithms and strategies. Numerical and experimental examples are included to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework. As a result, an exponential-trigonometric covariance function is characterized and justified based on the Bayesian model selection approach and observations of the sample autocorrelation function of the response discrepancies.},

  abstract     = {We are witnessing a rapid transition from Software 1.0 to 2.0. Software 1.0 focuses on manually designed algorithms, while Software 2.0 leverages data and machine learning algorithms (or artificial intelligence) for optimized, fast, and accurate solutions. For the past few years, we have been developing Convolution Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network Artificial Intelligence (C-HiDeNN-AI), which enables the realization of Engineering Software 2.0 by opening the next-generation neural network-based computational tools that can simultaneously train data and solve mechanistic equations. This paper focuses on solving partial differential equations with C-HiDeNN. Still, the same neural network can be used for training and calibration with experimental data , which will be discussed in a separate paper. This paper presents a computational framework combining the C-HiDeNN theory with isogeometric analysis (IGA), called Convolution IGA (C-IGA). C-IGA has five key features that advance IGA: (1) arbitrarily high-order smoothness and convergence rates without increasing degrees of freedom; (2) a Kronecker delta property that enables direct imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions ; (3) automatic and flexible global/local mesh-adaptivity with built-in length scale control and adjustable radial basis functions ; (4) ability to handle irregular meshes and triangular/tetrahedral elements; and (5) GPU implementation that speeds up the program as fast as finite element method (FEM). Mathematically, we prove that both IGA and C-IGA mappings are equivalent, and by taking a special design and modified anchors as nodes, C-IGA degenerates to IGA. We demonstrate the accuracy, convergence rates, mesh-adaptivity, and performance of C-IGA with several 1D, 2D, and 3D numerical examples . The future applications of C-IGA from topology optimization to product manufacturing with multi-GPU programming are discussed.},

For the streamline GSC method we can prove coercivity, convergence, and optimal-order error estimates in a strong norm that are robust in the advective and reactive limits. The directional GSC method is designed to accurately resolve boundary layers for flows that impinge upon the boundary at an angle, a long-standing problem. The directional GSC method performs better than the streamline GSC method in the numerical studies, but it is not coercive. We conjecture it is inf-sup stable but we are unable to prove it at this time. However, calculations of the inf-sup constant support the conjecture.

By analytically computing the discrete Fourier operators, we obtain an exact representation of the normalized error across the entire spectrum of eigenvalues. Our investigation addresses key questions related to membrane locking, including mode susceptibility, the influence of polynomial order , and the impact of shell/beam thickness and radius of curvature. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of mixed and primal Galerkin methods in mitigating locking.

The deployment of such models in clinical settings has been limited however, due to the excessive computational costs incurred when performing mechanical simulations using conventional numerical solvers. An alternative approach to obtaining results in clinically relevant time frames is to make use of a computationally efficient surrogate model, called an emulator, in place of the numerical simulator. In this work, we propose an emulation framework for soft-tissue mechanics which builds on traditional approaches in two ways. Firstly, we use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform emulation. GNNs can naturally handle the unique soft-tissue geometry of a given patient, without requiring any low-order approximations to be made. Secondly, the emulator is trained in a physics-informed manner to minimise a potential energy functional, meaning that no costly numerical simulations are required for training. We present results showing that our framework allows for highly accurate emulation for a range of soft-tissue mechanical models, while making predictions several orders of magnitude more quickly than the simulator.},

In this work, we propose a method for Bayesian calibration of models that predict morphological patterns of diblock copolymer (Di-BCP) thin film self-assembly while accounting for various sources of uncertainties in pattern formation and data acquisition. This method extracts the azimuthally-averaged power spectrum (AAPS) of the top-down microscopy characterization of Di-BCP thin film patterns as summary statistics for Bayesian inference of model parameters via the pseudo-marginal method. We derive the analytical and approximate form of a conditional likelihood for the AAPS of image data . We demonstrate that AAPS-based image data reduction retains the mutual information , particularly on important length scales , between image data and model parameters while being relatively agnostic to the aleatoric uncertainties associated with the random long-range disorder of Di-BCP patterns. Additionally, we propose a phase-informed prior distribution for Bayesian model calibration. Furthermore, reducing image data to AAPS enables us to efficiently build surrogate models to accelerate the proposed Bayesian model calibration procedure. We present the formulation and training of two multi-layer perceptrons for approximating the parameter-to-spectrum map, which enables fast integrated likelihood evaluations. We validate the proposed Bayesian model calibration method through numerical examples , for which the neural network surrogate delivers a fivefold reduction of the number of model simulations performed for a single calibration task .},

  abstract     = {The numerical simulation of additive manufacturing techniques promises the acceleration of costly experimental procedures to identify suitable process parameters. We recently proposed Floating Isogeometric Analysis (FLIGA), a new computational solid mechanics approach, which is mesh distortion-free in one characteristic spatial direction. FLIGA emanates from Isogeometric Analysis and its key novel aspect is the concept of deformation-dependent “floating” of individual B-spline basis functions along one parametric axis of the mesh. Our previous work showed that FLIGA not only overcomes the problem of mesh distortion associated to this direction, but is also ideally compatible with material point integration and enjoys a stability similar to that of conventional Lagrangian mesh-based methods. These features make the method applicable to the simulation of large deformation problems with history-dependent constitutive behavior, such as additive manufacturing based on polymer extrusion. In this work, we enhance the first version of FLIGA by (i) a novel quadrature scheme which further improves the robustness against mesh distortion, (ii) a procedure to automatically regulate floating of the basis functions (as opposed to the manual procedure of the first version), and (iii) an adaptive refinement strategy. We demonstrate the performance of enhanced FLIGA on relevant numerical examples including a selection of viscoelastic extrusion problems.},

  abstract     = {This article outlines the research on the application of the variational multiscale theory (VMS) to a posteriori error estimation. VMS theory was initially developed by Professor Hughes to evince the origins of stabilized methods. In this paper it is shown that the stabilization parameters and the stabilization terms contain true error information that can be used to obtain explicit and implicit a posteriori error estimates. The technology consists of splitting the exact solution into resolved or coarse scales (finite element solution) and unresolved or fine scales (numerical error). By feeding this splitting into the variational formulation, an exact weak form can be derived for the fine scales as a function of the resolved scales. The way of solving or approximating this equation yields different algorithms and models for error estimation. Furthermore, using the so-called fine-scale Green’s function, an analytical representation of the fine scales is possible. Again, different approximations of this function give rise to various algorithms and models. This theory naturally suggests that the error can be computed by the combination of element interior and inter-element faces residuals with the corresponding error time-scales. From this standpoint, error estimators are developed for the transport equation and the Navier–Stokes equations. This technology can be further used for example to generate adapted meshes, to derive reduced order models and in verification and validation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The solution of probabilistic inverse problems for which the corresponding forward problem is constrained by physical principles is challenging. This is especially true if the dimension of the inferred vector is large and the prior information about it is in the form of a collection of samples. In this work, a novel deep learning based approach is developed and applied to solving these types of problems. The approach utilizes samples of the inferred vector drawn from the prior distribution and a physics-based forward model to generate training data for a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (cWGAN). The cWGAN learns the probability distribution for the inferred vector conditioned on the measurement and produces samples from this distribution. The cWGAN developed in this work differs from earlier versions in that its critic is required to be 1-Lipschitz with respect to both the inferred and the measurement vectors and not just the former. This leads to a loss term with the full (and not partial) gradient penalty. It is shown that this rather simple change leads to a stronger notion of convergence for the conditional density learned by the cWGAN and a more robust and accurate sampling strategy. Through numerical examples it is shown that this change also translates to better accuracy when solving inverse problems. The numerical examples considered include illustrative problems where the true distribution and/or statistics are known, and a more complex inverse problem motivated by applications in biomechanics.},

We then perform a finer domain partition to obtain more accurate boundary representations. Both rectangular and triangular Bézier patches are employed to represent the geometry. Secondly, by imposing G 1 G1 continuity constraints on the adjacent patches, we construct an initial parameterization that is globally G 1 G1 continuous. Finally, we enhance the parameterization quality of each patch separately using the quasi-conformal mapping technique.

  abstract     = {We present outlier-free isogeometric Galerkin discretizations of eigenvalue problems related to the biharmonic and the polyharmonic operator in the univariate setting. These are Galerkin discretizations in certain spline subspaces that provide accurate approximations of all eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes, without the occurrence of spurious outliers. The theoretical cornerstone is the use of spline subspaces that are optimal in the sense of L 2 L2 Kolmogorov n n -widths for special function classes related to the eigenvalue problems under investigation. This work is a continuation and extension of a similar study, recently presented for the Laplace operator, towards higher-order problems. As for the Laplace operator, the considered optimal spline spaces are identified by additional homogeneous boundary conditions and by specific sequences of break points. For fourth- and higher-order problems, however, optimal spline spaces are not known for all degrees and the optimal break points are not explicitly given. A careful analysis of the properties of optimal spaces allows us to determine spline subspaces of practical interest that are outlier-free. In particular, in the biharmonic case, we are able to construct such outlier-free spline spaces, for any odd and even degree, by considering break points that are uniform, or just a minor modification of the uniform ones. This improves upon the (numerical) results available in the literature. The theoretical findings are validated by a selection of numerical tests.},

  abstract     = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the cornerstone of the design and analysis process in many engineering applications . Not only has it been applied in the design phase, but it has also been employed for analyzing the fluid flow phenomena during the operation phase for many in-use structures, such as vehicles, buildings, and landscapes. However, creating a 3D mesh-based model of in-use structures that can be used by conventional boundary-fitted CFD methods is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible. Due to the challenges introduced by geometry complexity and lack of design information, it is often difficult to perform an accurate and efficient CFD analysis of these objects. This paper aims to overcome such challenges by proposing a novel photogrammetry-based CFD framework for simulating in-use structures whose design models and analysis meshes are hard to obtain. The proposed framework integrates machine learning-based 3D point cloud reconstruction of structures from 2D images obtained from portable devices (e.g., cell phones and drones) and an immersogeometric approach that can carry out flow analysis directly on reconstructed point clouds. We first present the technical details of point cloud reconstruction techniques and the immersogeometric analysis method. We then simulate the flow past a standard 12 oz soda can reconstructed using photogrammetry and compare the results with reference solutions to assess the accuracy of the approach. Finally, the proposed photogrammetry-based CFD is applied to simulations of a bell tower and the Kavita and Lalit Bahl Smart Bridge on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) campus to demonstrate the robustness of the framework and its applicability to real-world in-use civil structures.},

For inelastic materials , the directionality condition, a property for the stress to be energy consistent, is extended with the dissipation effect taken into account. Moreover, the integration of the constitutive relations calls for an algorithm design of the internal state variables and their conjugate variables . A directionality condition for the conjugate variables is introduced as an indispensable ingredient for ensuring physically correct numerical dissipation. By leveraging the particular structure of the configurational free energy, a set of update formulas for the internal state variables is obtained. Detailed analysis reveals that the overall discrete schemes are energy–momentum consistent and achieve first- and second-order accuracy in time, respectively.

  abstract     = {A data-driven discrepancy modeling method is presented that variationally embeds measured data in the modeling and analysis framework. The proposed method exploits the variationally derived loss function that is comprised of the residual between the first-principles theory and sensor-based measurements to augment the physics-based model. The method was first developed in the context of linear elasticity (Masud and Goraya, J. Appl. Mech. 89 (11) 2022) wherein the relation between the discrepancy model and the loss terms was derived to show that the data embedding terms behave like residual-based least-squares regression functions . An interpretation of the stabilization tensor as a kernel function was formally established and its role in assimilating a-priori knowledge of the problem in the modeling method was highlighted. The present paper employs linear elastodynamics as a model problem where Data-Driven Variational (DDV) method incorporates high-fidelity data into forward calculations. This results in driving the problem with not only the boundary and initial conditions , but also with the sensor data that is available at only a small subset of the total domain. The effect of the loss function on the time-dependent response of the system is investigated under a variety of loading conditions and model discrepancies. The energy and Morlet wavelet analyses reveal that the problem with embedded data recovers the energy and the fundamental frequency band of the target system . Time histories of strain energy and kinetic energy of a cantilever beam undergoing damped oscillations are recovered by including known data in an undamped model. This highlights the discrepancy modeling attributes of the method under combined effects of parameter and model discrepancy.},

  abstract     = {The accurate, robust and efficient transfer of the deformation gradient tensor between meshes of different resolution is crucial in cardiac electromechanics simulations. This paper presents a novel method that combines rescaled localized Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to preserve the positivity of the determinant of the deformation gradient tensor. The method involves decomposing the evaluations of the tensor at the quadrature nodes of the source mesh into rotation matrices and diagonal matrices of singular values; computing the RBF interpolation of the quaternion representation of rotation matrices and the singular value logarithms; reassembling the deformation gradient tensors at quadrature nodes of the destination mesh, to be used in the assembly of the electrophysiology model equations. The proposed method overcomes limitations of existing interpolation methods, including nested intergrid interpolation and RBF interpolation of the displacement field, that may lead to the loss of physical meaningfulness of the mathematical formulation and then to solver failures at the algebraic level, due to negative determinant values. Furthermore, the proposed method enables the transfer of solution variables between finite element spaces of different degrees and shapes and without stringent conformity requirements between different meshes, thus enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of electromechanical simulations. We show numerical results confirming that the proposed method enables the transfer of the deformation gradient tensor, allowing to successfully run simulations in cases where existing methods fail. This work provides an efficient and robust method for the intergrid transfer of the deformation gradient tensor, thus enabling independent tailoring of mesh discretizations to the particular characteristics of the individual physical components concurring to the of the multiphysics model.},

An alternative form of the plate kinematics precludes the vulnerability of computation based on the standard Reissner–Mindlin formulation to shear locking, yet raises other challenges in the form of higher-order regularity and unconventional boundary conditions. The embedded boundary Nitsche approach provides a framework that easily accommodates these features.

  abstract     = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is an iterative identification process that serves to minimize the misfit of model-based simulated and experimentally measured wave field data . Its goal is to identify a field of parameters for a given physical object . For many years, FWI is very successful in seismic imaging to deduce velocity models of the earth or of local geophysical exploration areas. FWI has also been successfully applied in various other fields, including non-destructive testing (NDT) and biomedical imaging. The inverse optimization process of FWI relies on forward and backward solutions of the (elastic or acoustic) wave equation, as well as on efficient computations of adequate optimization directions. Many approaches employ (low order) finite element or finite difference methods , using parameterized material fields whose resolution is chosen in relation to the elements or nodes of the discretized wave field. In our previous paper (Bürchner et al., 2023), we investigated the potential of using the finite cell method (FCM) as the wave field solver. The FCM offers the advantage that highly complex geometric models can be incorporated easily. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the identification of the model’s density outperforms that of the velocity — particularly in cases where unknown voids characterized by homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions need to be detected. The paper at hand extends this previous study in the following aspects: The isogeometric finite cell analysis (IGA-FCM) – a combination of isogeometric analysis (IGA) and FCM – is applied as the wave field solver, with the advantage that the polynomial degree and subsequently also the sampling frequency of the wave field can be increased quite easily. Since the inversion efficiency strongly depends on the accuracy of the forward and backward wave field solutions and of the gradients of the functional, consistent, and lumped mass matrix discretization are compared. The resolution of the grid describing the unknown material density – thus allowing to identify voids in a physical object – is then decoupled from the knot span grid. Finally, we propose an adaptive multi-resolution algorithm that locally refines the material grid using an image processing-based refinement indicator. The developed inversion framework allows fast and memory-efficient wave simulations and object identification. While we study the general behavior of the proposed approach using 2D benchmark problems, a final 3D problem shows that it can also be used to identify void regions in geometrically complex spatial structures.},

We approximate the solution to the partial differential equations using two discrete spaces that we build on a triangulation of the domain; we denote these spaces as coarse and enriched spaces. Building on the adaptive stabilized finite element method via residual minimization, we find a coarse-scale approximation in a continuous space by minimizing the residual on a dual discontinuous Galerkin norm; this process allows us to compute a robust error estimate to construct an on-the-fly adaptive method. We reinterpret the residual projection using the variational multiscale framework to derive a fine-scale approximation. As a result, on each mesh of the adaptive process, we obtain stable coarse- and fine-scale solutions derived from a symmetric saddle-point formulation and an a-posteriori error indicator to guide automatic adaptivity. We test our framework in several challenging scenarios for linear and nonlinear convection-dominated diffusion problems to demonstrate the framework’s performance in providing stability in the solution with optimal convergence rates in the asymptotic regime and robust performance in the pre-asymptotic regime. Lastly, we introduce a heuristic dual-term contribution in the variational form to improve the full-scale approximation for symmetric formulations (e.g., diffusion problem).},

  abstract     = {Gradient-based meta-learning methods have primarily been applied to classical machine learning tasks such as image classification . Recently, partial differential equation (PDE)-solving deep learning methods, such as neural operators, are starting to make an important impact on learning and predicting the response of a complex physical system directly from observational data . Taking the material modeling problems for example, the neural operator approach learns a surrogate mapping from the loading field to the corresponding material response field, which can be seen as learning the solution operator of a hidden PDE . The microstructure and mechanical parameters of each material specimen correspond to the (possibly heterogeneous) parameter field in this hidden PDE. Due to the limitation on experimental measurement techniques, the data acquisition for each material specimen is commonly challenging and may also be costly. This fact calls for the utilization and transfer of existing knowledge to new and unseen material specimens, which corresponds to sampling efficient learning of the solution operator of a hidden PDE with a different parameter field. Herein, we propose a novel meta-learning approach for neural operators that can be seen as transferring the knowledge of solution operators between governing (unknown) PDEs with varying parameter fields. Our approach is a provably universal solution operator for multiple PDE solving tasks, with a key theoretical observation that underlying parameter fields can be captured in the first layer of neural operator models, in contrast to typical final-layer transfer in existing meta-learning methods. As applications, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach on PDE-based datasets and a real-world material modeling problem, illustrating that our method can handle complex and nonlinear physical response learning tasks while greatly improving the sampling efficiency in unseen tasks.},

  abstract     = {The virtual element method (VEM) provides new ways of deriving discretization for problems in structural and solid mechanics, starting with the contribution by Beirão da Veiga et al. (2013) for elastic solids. Interestingly, the virtual element method allows also to revisit the construction of different elements which have the same shape as finite elements . This is even true for one-dimensional structures like trusses and beams. Here we study a virtual element development of the Timoshenko beam which surprisingly leads to a straight forward formulation of locking free and in the linear range even exact Timoshenko beam elements. These elements can be easily incorporated into classical finite element codes since they have the same number of unknowns as finite elements for beams. The formulation allows to compute nonlinear structural problems undergoing large deflections and rotations using the formulation provided in Reissner (1972).},

  abstract     = {We present a mass lumping approach based on an isogeometric Petrov–Galerkin method that preserves higher-order spatial accuracy in explicit dynamics calculations irrespective of the polynomial degree of the spline approximation . To discretize the test function space, our method uses an approximate dual basis , whose functions are smooth, have local support and satisfy approximate bi-orthogonality with respect to a trial space of B-splines. The resulting mass matrix is “close” to the identity matrix . Specifically, a lumped version of this mass matrix preserves all relevant polynomials when utilized in a Galerkin projection. Consequently, the mass matrix can be lumped (via row-sum lumping) without compromising spatial accuracy in explicit dynamics calculations. We also address the imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions and the preservation of approximate bi-orthogonality under geometric mappings . In addition, we establish a link between the exact dual and approximate dual basis functions via an iterative algorithm that improves the approximate dual basis towards exact bi-orthogonality. We demonstrate the performance of our higher-order accurate mass lumping approach via convergence studies and spectral analyses of discretized beam, plate and shell models.},

The focus of this work is to develop a digital-twin (a digital replica) of the performance of a cryogenic probe, which can be used to pre-plan and optimize surgical procedures, in order to maximize successful outcomes. Specifically, we model the optimal cryoprobe-induced cooling protocol needed to eliminate cells/tissue in specific regions, while minimizing damage to nearby tissue. The modeling approach is to develop mathematical surface point-source heat extraction kernels and then to create optimal surface patterns that the cryoprobe induces, by arranging the point-sources accordingly. Spatial and temporal control of the heat extraction is modeled. The entire subdermal thermal field is then constructed by superposing the solutions, enabling precise cryogenic treatment. Finally, a Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) is then applied to optimize the set of parameters to deliver a precise response, making it an ideal real-time surgical tool.},

  abstract     = {Traditional numerical discretization-based solvers of partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamentally agnostic to domains, boundary conditions and coefficients. In contrast, machine learnt solvers have a limited generalizability across these elements of boundary value problems. This is strongly true in the case of surrogate models that are typically trained on direct numerical simulations of PDEs applied to one specific boundary value problem. In a departure from this direct approach, the label-free machine learning of solvers is centered on a loss function that does not use computed field solutions as labels. Instead, the PDE and boundary conditions are directly incorporated in residual form to express the loss function during training. However, their generalization across boundary conditions is limited and they remain strongly domain-dependent. Here, we present a framework that generalizes across domains, boundary conditions and coefficients while simultaneously learning the PDE in weak form. Our work explores the ability of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoder–decoder architectures to learn to solve a PDE in greater generality than its restriction to a particular boundary value problem. In this first Communication, we take the canonical path through elliptic PDEs and focus on steady-state diffusion, linear and nonlinear elasticity. Importantly, the learning happens independently of any labeled field data from either experiments or direct numerical solutions. We develop probabilistic CNNs in the Bayesian setting using variational inference. Extensive results for these problem classes demonstrate the framework’s ability to learn PDE solvers that generalize across hundreds of thousands of domains, boundary conditions and coefficients, including extrapolation beyond the learning regime. Once trained, the machine learning solvers are orders of magnitude faster than discretization-based solvers. They therefore have relevance to high-throughput solutions of PDEs on varied domains, boundary conditions and coefficients, such as for inverse modeling, optimization, design and decision-making. We place our work in the context of other recent machine learning solvers of PDEs including continuous operator learning frameworks, as well as make comparisons of performance where possible. Finally, we note extensions to transfer learning, active learning and reinforcement learning.},

  abstract     = {Neuron growth is a complex, multi-stage process that neurons undergo to develop sophisticated morphologies and interwoven neurite networks. Recent experimental research advances have enabled us to examine the effects of various neuron growth factors and seek potential causes for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A computational tool that studies the neuron growth process could shed crucial insights on the effects of various factors and potentially help find a cure for neurodegeneration. However, there is a lack of computational tools to accurately and realistically simulate the neuron growth process within reasonable time frames. Bio-phenomenon-based models ignore potential neuron growth factors and cannot generate realistic results, and bio-physics-based models require extensive, high-order governing equations that are computationally expensive. In this paper, we incorporate experimental neurite features into a phase field method-based neuron growth model using an isogeometric analysis collocation (IGA-C) approach. Based on a semi-automated quantitative analysis of neurite morphology, we obtain relative turning angle, average tortuosity, neurite endpoints, average segment length, and the total length of neurites. We use the total neurite length to determine the evolving days in vitro (DIV) and select corresponding neurite features to drive and constrain the neuron growth. This approach archives biomimetic neuron growth patterns with automatic growth stage transitions by incorporating corresponding DIV neurite morphometric data based on the total neurite length of the evolving neurite morphology. Furthermore, we built a convolutional neural network (CNN) to significantly reduce associated computational costs for predicting complex neurite growth patterns. Our CNN model adopts a customized convolutional autoencoder as the backbone that takes neuron growth simulation initializations and target iteration as the input and predicts the corresponding neurite patterns. This approach achieves high prediction accuracy (97.77%) while taking 7 orders of magnitude less computational times when compared with our IGA-C neuron growth solver.},

The method was inspired by Thomas Hughes’s 1987 work on space–time finite element methods for elastodynamics. The original DSD/SST method is now called “ST-SUPS”, reflecting its stabilization components, which are the Streamline-Upwind/Petrov–Galerkin ( SU PG) method, pioneered by Hughes, and the Pressure-Stabilizing/Petrov–Galerkin ( PS PG) method, inspired by Hughes’s work on a Stokes-flow Petrov–Galerkin formulation allowing equal-order interpolations for velocity and pressure. Hughes’s work on the residual-based variational multiscale (RBVMS) method inspired the ST-VMS method, which is the VMS version of the DSD/SST. A number of special methods were introduced in connection with the core methods ST-SUPS and ST-VMS. Hughes’s work on isogeometric analysis (IGA) inspired one of those special methods, the “ST-IGA”, with IGA basis functions not only in space but also in time. The core and special ST methods enabled first-ever solutions in some of the most challenging classes of MBI problems, including particle-laden flows, spacecraft parachute fluid–structure interactions, and car and tire aerodynamics. We provide an overview of the ST methods inspired by Hughes’s work and highlight some of the first-ever solutions in these three classes of MBI problems.},

  abstract     = {The challenges of classic rate-independent crystal plasticity models regarding the determination of active slip systems and computation of solutions due to linear dependent slip systems are still a field of active research. In that regard, interior-point methods are promising approaches because a logarithmic barrier term naturally avoids the combinatorial active set search, and these methods are applicable even when the gradient of inequality constraints is linearly dependent . In this paper, a new interior-point algorithm suitable for rate-independent crystal plasticity at finite strains is developed. For that purpose, the postulate of maximum dissipation is recast as a constrained optimization problem whose optimality conditions are derived by utilizing interior-point approaches. This optimization problem is discretized in time by means of an exponential time integration of the flow rule, and the time-discrete equations are solved by a Newton scheme. The focus of this paper is the efficiency and robustness of the implementation of this approach. In particular, the effect of different line search procedures, favorable residual forms, preconditioning methods, barrier parameter updates and the consistent algorithmic tangent modulus are discussed and further elaborated. In addition, aspects regarding uniqueness and well-posedness of the algorithm are analyzed in a geometrically linearized setting. Efficiency and robustness of the developed algorithm are shown by numerical examples of an FCC crystal including finite element simulations without stabilizing hardening or rate-dependent effects. Furthermore, the results are compared to the well-established augmented Lagrangian formulation .},

  abstract     = {Shape and topology optimization problems are usually associated with geometrical restrictions. Effective control of structural complexity during the optimization process is important for various considerations, e.g., functionality, manufacturability, and aesthetics. Most existing approaches characterize structural complexity as the number of cavities. However, for three-dimensional structures, the genus (i.e., the number of tunnels) should also be considered as an additional topological constraint. In this paper, a hole-filling method is integrated into the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) computational framework to control the number and size of existing cavities and tunnels during the form-finding process. In the hole-filling method, excess cavities are filled with solid material and excess tunnels are covered by building sheet-like patches. The minimum size of the truss-like components and the minimum thickness of the sheet-like components can be controlled separately. Several two- and three-dimensional compliance minimization problems are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential applications of the proposed approach. The structural performances of the optimized structures with and without complexity control are compared and analyzed. The results show that the developed methodology can produce structurally efficient designs with controllable topologies. It is also demonstrated that the generation of sheet-like components can considerably increase the stiffness of the optimized structure. The proposed approach is capable of generating diverse and competitive designs for architects and engineers to achieve a fine balance between architectural novelty and structural efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Simulation of wave propagation in poroelastic half-spaces presents a common challenge in fields like geomechanics and biomechanics , requiring Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABCs) at the semi-infinite space boundaries. Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) are a popular choice due to their excellent wave absorption properties . However, PML implementation can lead to problems with unknown stresses or strains, time convolutions , or PDE systems with Auxiliary Differential Equations (ADEs), which increases computational complexity and resource consumption. This article introduces a novel hybrid PML formulation for arbitrary poroelastic domains. Instead of using ADEs, this formulation utilizes time-history variables to reduce the number of unknowns and mathematical operations . The modification of the PDEs to account for the PML is limited to the PML domain only, resulting in smaller matrices while maintaining the governing equations in the interior domain and preserving the temporal structure of the problem. The hybrid approach introduces three scalar variables localized within the PML domain. The proposed formulation was tested in three numerical experiments in geophysics using realistic parameters for soft sites with free surfaces . The results were compared with numerical solutions from extended domains and simpler ABCs, such as paraxial approximation , demonstrating the accuracy, efficiency, and precision of the proposed method. The article also discusses the applicability of the method to complex media and its extension to the Multiaxial PML formulation.

  abstract     = {We formulate a class of velocity-free finite-particle methods for mass transport problems based on a time-discrete incremental variational principle that combines entropy and the cost of particle transport, as measured by the Wasserstein metric. The incremental functional is further spatially discretized into finite particles, i.e., particles characterized by a fixed spatial profile of finite width, each carrying a fixed amount of mass. The motion of the particles is then governed by a competition between the cost of transport, that aims to keep the particles fixed, and entropy maximization, that aims to spread the particles so as to increase the entropy of the system. We show how the optimal width of the particles can be determined variationally by minimization of the governing incremental functional. Using this variational principle, we derive optimal scaling relations between the width of the particles, their number and the size of the domain. We also address matters of implementation, including the acceleration of the computation of diffusive forces by exploiting the Gaussian decay of the particle profiles and by instituting fast nearest-neighbor searches. Sources, advection, boundary flux and diffusion are accounted for by fractional steps We demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the finite-particle method by means of a test problem concerned with the injection of mass into a sphere. There test results demonstrate the meshless character of the method in any spatial dimension, its ability to redistribute mass particles and follow their evolution in time, its ability to satisfy flux boundary conditions for general domains based solely on a distance function, and its robust convergence characteristics.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel mesh-free method for solving nonconvex energy minimization problems for martensitic phase transitions and twinning in crystals using the deep learning approach. These problems pose significant challenges to analysis and computation because they involve multiwell gradient energies with large numbers of local minima, each involving a topologically complex microstructure of free boundaries with gradient jumps. We use the Deep Ritz method, which represents candidates for minimizers using parameter-dependent deep neural networks, and minimize the energy with respect to network parameters. The key feature of our method is a newly proposed activation function called SmReLU, which captures the structure of minimizers where traditional activation functions fail. Our mesh-free approach allows for the approximation of free boundaries, essential to this problem, without any special treatment, making it extremely simple to implement. We demonstrate the success of our method through numerous numerical computations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a practical meshfree large deformation method (MFLDM) is proposed for numerical analysis in geotechnical engineerings , including: soil foundation, slop, dam, etc. The MFLDM leverages both the flexible nodal distribution in the meshfree method and the high stability in the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) framework. In each calculation step, two sets of Gauss points , fixed and moving Gauss points, are generated in the background mesh. In addition, the radial basis function (RBF) is used to map field variables , including stress, stain, and constitutive variables, between the fixed and moving Gauss points to achieve the field variable redistribution during the large-deformation analysis. The proposed MFLDM, which is written in C++ using the object-oriented programming approach, can be completely integrated into the self-development calculating system named GEODYNA and coupled with the finite element method (FEM) at the matrix level, which significantly broadens its practical application. The proposed model is verified by several numerical examples and compared with different constitutive models, including the linear elasticity model, ideal elastic–plastic model, and generalized elastic–plastic model. The comparison results verify the high accuracy, fast convergence, and good robustness of the proposed MFLDM. Finally, the proposed MFLDM is applied to a local large deformation analysis between the cut-off wall and the core wall on a deep overburden.},

  abstract     = {A novel isogeometric collocation method is proposed for the static limit analysis of axially-symmetric masonry domes subject to their self-weight. A shell-based static formulation is employed, alongside Heyman’s assumptions on masonry, to characterize the equilibrated and statically admissible stress states in the dome. As a distinctive feature of the approach, a vector stress function is introduced, generating point-wise self-equilibrated shell stress resultants in the dome. Accordingly, the classical minimum-thrust problem is formulated in terms of the unknown vector stress function, and the static admissibility conditions are enforced as the only optimization constraint . NURBS-based isogeometric analysis is adopted to accomplish the need for an accurate geometric description of the dome and a high-order continuous interpolation of the vector stress function. A discrete minimum-thrust problem is derived as a linear programming problem , with the static admissibility conditions checked at suitable collocation points . Instrumental to its solution is the computation of a particular solution of the equilibrium equations , which is obtained by an isogeometric collocation method. By a mechanical interpretation of the dual optimization problem , the settlement mechanism of the dome corresponding to its minimum-thrust state is also computed. Numerical results, dealing with a thorough convergence analysis , parametric analyses on spherical and ogival domes with parameterized geometry, and the real case of the Taj Mahal central dome are presented to prove the computational merit of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This contribution proposes a second-order computational homogenisation formulation for natural and architected materials in the presence of voids. The macro-scale is described by a second gradient continuum theory in the finite strain regime, and the micro-scale is modelled by the concept of representative volume element (RVE) within the classical first-order continuum mechanics . The Method of Multi-scale Virtual Power is employed to link the two scales, ensuring a variationally consistent scale transition. Unlike the multi-scale model proposed by Rodrigues Lopes and Andrade Pires (2022), the developed formulation allows the consideration of voids in the RVE domain and boundary, which is critical for modelling cellular materials, lattice structures, and metamaterials, among others. This is achieved by defining the kinematical quantities only in the solid domain of the RVE and postulating a new homogenisation relation for the second-order gradient. The kinematic constraints are imposed on the RVE by the Lagrange multiplier method and particularised for minimal (lower bound), periodic and direct (upper bound) conditions. It is demonstrated that the homogenised macroscopic stress tensors can be expressed in terms of the Lagrange multipliers . The finite element method is adopted for the numerical solution of the micro and macro equilibrium. The Newton–Raphson scheme is employed to solve the non-linear systems of equations at both scales and the consistent macroscopic tangents required for the FE 2 2 framework are derived. Several numerical examples of porous solids, lattice structures and metamaterials illustrate the consistency and applicability of the formulation for two and three-dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {The article is aimed to provide an effective digital solution in support of the infill microstructural design within objectives generated from normal computer aided design (CAD) systems. The key here is to deploy the microstructure and to analyse the performance of the resulting multiscale objective in the parameter domain, from which a CAD objective is mapped, usually by means of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) functions. In the regularly shaped domain defined in the parameter space, another set of mapping functions are defined for the description of spatially-varying microstructure (in the parameter space), and the actual multiscale CAD objective gets represented through composition of these mapping functions with the NURBS-based functions for CAD geometry generation. When the introduced mapping functions are also NURBS-based, the proposed representation strategy becomes more favoured by CAD systems, in the sense that the CAD geometry and its infill can be tuned simultaneously but independently with a same set of NURBS basis. Moreover, our computer-aided engineering (CAE) module is also installed over the parameter domain, based on a machine-learning-based homogenisation formulation for compliance and strength analysis. Thus the finite element meshes stay unchanged although the accommodating CAD geometry keeps varying. With the aforementioned treatments, a consecutive CAD-consistent scheme is proposed. Our numerical results show that each time as the control points are moved (by a CAD designer), one may choose to wait several seconds for two-dimensional cases and/or a few minutes for three-dimensional cases, to get a CAD geometry filled with microstructure bearing optimised compliance.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the investigations on Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) in complex flows have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to accurately describe flow field details. In this study, we propose a novel and accurate numerical technique based on the Lagrangian–Eulerian Stabilized Collocation Method (LESCM) for computing the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLEs), which is essential for extracting LCSs in viscous incompressible flows . LESCM, previously employed for simulating fluid–structure interaction problems, was developed based on the Material Point Method (MPM). The hybrid Lagrangian–Eulerian​ description in LESCM enables explicit tracking of fluid flow trajectories throughout the simulation and direct evaluation of the FTLE field. Furthermore. The errors in FTLEs caused by the Particle Shifting Technique (PST) are completely avoided due to the Eulerian characteristic of LESCM as the deformation gradient is calculated based on fixed Eulerian nodes rather than fluid particles with unphysical shifting. Consequently, the novel technique based on LESCM surpasses the accuracy of pure Lagrangian particle methods and provides an accurate way of detecting complex LCSs in flow fields. Additionally, By harnessing the remarkable efficiency of LESCM, MATLAB can now handle up to 16 million particles with ease, eliminating the need for parallel computation techniques. Several numerical examples , such as 2D Taylor-Green​ vortices, flow passing a circular cylinder and a 3-dimensional shear driven cavity problem, have been tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel approach under various conditions.},

The proposed method targets ROM bases consisting of a relatively small set of base vectors while accuracy is still guaranteed. For this, several fully automated update and maintenance techniques for the ROM basis are investigated and combined. In order to remain effective for flexible structures, path derivatives are added to the ROM basis. The corresponding sensitivity analysis (SA) strategies are presented and the accuracy and efficiency are examined. Various geometrically nonlinear examples involving both solid as well as shell elements are studied to test the proposed ROM techniques. Test cases demonstrates that the set of degrees of freedom appearing in the nonlinear equilibrium equation typically reduces to several tenth.

Template meshes are further introduced to group particles of different shapes to save computing memory. Key to RTDEM are innovative ray tracing-based algorithms specially designed for accurate and efficient contact detection and resolution between arbitrarily shaped particles. Based on the RT algorithms, discrete potential field functions are further proposed for the discrete mesh vertices and facets to define energy-conservative contact models that include vertex-potential, facet-potential models, and their combination. The integration of these key elements into RTDEM offers a whole new DEM framework that readily empowers any parallel computing architecture for high acceleration on granular media modeling. It matches particularly well with the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to fully unleash the computing power of ray tracing cores for large-scale DEM simulations of arbitrarily shaped particles, even on a personal computer with a common gaming GPU card.},

It is demonstrated that in the case of large rotation of the beam, both Saint Venant–Kirchhoff and neo-Hookean models show the same behavior.

  abstract     = {Compared with conventional symmetric sandwich structures with two identical face-sheets and uniform core, geometrically asymmetric sandwich structures (GASSs) enable better dynamic performance due to the expanded design space provided by two unidentical face-sheets and graded cellular cores (GCCs). This paper proposes a dynamic response-oriented multiscale topology optimization method for the GASSs, which is capable of designing the thicknesses of two solid face-sheets, graded distribution of GCCs and their topological configurations to minimize dynamic compliance. Specifically, at macroscale , a variable thickness sheet method is employed to optimize the thicknesses of two solid face-sheets and then generate an overall free distribution of cellular cores within sandwich layers. At microscale , a parametric level set method combining with a numerical homogenization approach is adopted to progressively optimize multiple representative cellular cores (RCCs), achieving their similar topological configurations. Benefitting from the level set-based topology description of RCCs, a shape interpolation technology is conveniently applied to interpolate the shapes of these RCCs to generate the configurations of GCCs. Moreover, a Kriging metamodel constructed by some cellular cores as sample points is adopted to predict the effective properties of each cellular core within sandwich layers, significantly reducing the computational burden. Several 2D and 3D numerical examples are illustrated to show the validity of the proposed method. The results indicate that the optimized GASSs show superior dynamic performances over the conventional sandwich structures designed by microscale and macroscale topology optimization, as well as filled with the commonly applied lattice and honeycomb cores.},

  abstract     = {Phenomenological constitutive modeling is prone to uncertainty and results in loss of information as data coming from experiments are not used directly in calculations. Data-driven approaches are a promising alternative to constitutive modeling. We present a new data-adaptive approach to model hyperelastic rubber-like materials at finite strains. Our proposed modeling procedure combines the advantages of phenomenological hyperelasticity with the data-driven paradigm of directly including experimental data in calculations. We suggest formulating a finite-element-like approximation of the strain energy function as a sum of basis functions expanded over a set of invariants multiplied by unknown parameters. The parameters are determined by an optimization algorithm to match measured experimental data (full-field displacements and global reaction forces) in a least-squares sense. We verify our approach and show that computation times are similar compared to those of phenomenological models . By numerical examples , we demonstrate the ability of our approach to re-identify O ( 10 ) O(10) parameters.},

  abstract     = {Balancing accuracy and computational cost is a challenge in the modelling of turbulent flows. A widely used method for turbulence modelling is large–eddy simulation (LES). LES allows one to describe large scale flow features at a reasonable computational cost compared to the more accurate direct numerical simulation (DNS), making it a popular choice for engineering applications. One strategy to balance accuracy and cost with LES is through the use of mesh adaptivity, which allows the degrees of freedom in a problem to be reduced by changing spatial discretisation. However, mesh adaptivity can affect accuracy when using the standard Smagorinsky LES model with an implicit filter, considering that the parameter C s Cs is highly dependent on the filter width, which depends on mesh resolution. This work is aimed to develop an LES model that does not require any user–defined parameters and is suitable for mesh adaptivity with implicit filter. In this study we introduce a parameter–free LES model incorporating an anisotropic eddy–viscosity formulation combined with anisotropic mesh adaptivity. In our model, the parameter C s Cs in the eddy–viscosity formulation of the Smagorinsky model, is replaced by a function that evaluates the relative location of turbulence fluctuations in each element with respect to the turbulence spectrum inertial range. The anisotropic formulation of the eddy–viscosity allows for the application of an appropriate filter width in different directions, improving accuracy. Additionally, the mesh adaptivity algorithm assesses the local turbulence fluctuations via local Reynolds number and vortex identification criteria. This assessment leads to the refinement of regions with higher turbulence fluctuations down to the smallest scale limit in the inertial range in the corresponding direction, and also leads to the coarsening of regions without turbulence fluctuation up to largest scale limit in the inertial range. This method is tested using a flow past a sphere test case. The results are compared both qualitatively and quantitatively to results obtained with the standard Smagorinsky model, and demonstrate the better performance of our method with lower computational cost. This allows us to simulate large Reynolds number cases and compare our quantitative results to experimental results found in the literature, emphasising that our method produces good results at reasonable computational cost.},

A two-level, or discrete, adjoint-based approach for error estimation is considered. The traditional method to derive an error estimate in this context requires linearizing both the nonlinear variational form and the nonlinear functional of interest which introduces linearization errors into the error estimate . In this paper, we investigate these linearization errors. In particular, we develop a novel discrete goal-oriented error estimate that accounts for traditionally neglected nonlinear terms at the expense of greater computational cost. We demonstrate how this error estimate can be used to drive mesh adaptivity. We show that accounting for linearization errors in the error estimate can improve its effectivity for several nonlinear model problems and quantities of interest. We also demonstrate that an adaptive strategy based on the newly proposed estimate can lead to more accurate approximations of the nonlinear functional with fewer degrees of freedom when compared to uniform refinement and traditional adjoint-based approaches.},

The different material domains are discretized independently thus avoiding time-consuming, conformal meshing . In this approach, the superposition of foreground (inclusion) and background (matrix) domain integration smoothing cells are corrected by a quasi-conforming quadtree subdivision on the background integration smoothing cells. Due to the non-conforming nature of the background integration smoothing cells near the material interfaces , a variationally consistent (VC) correction for domain integration is introduced to restore integration constraints and thus optimal convergence rates at a minor computational cost. Additional interface integration smoothing cells with area (volume) correction, while non-conforming, can be easily introduced to further enhance the accuracy and stability of the Galerkin solution using VC integration on non-conforming cells. To properly approximate the weak discontinuity across the material interface by a penalty-free Nitsche’s method with enhanced coercivity , the interface nodes on the surface of the foreground discretization are also shared with the background discretization . As such, there are no tunable parameters, such as those involved in the penalty type method, to enforce interface compatibility in this approach. The advantage of this meshfree formulation is that it avoids many of the instabilities in mesh-based immersed and embedded methods. The effectiveness of QCE-RKPM is illustrated with several examples.},

In this respect, material symmetry significantly helps to reduce the amount of necessary data. This study applies the data-driven paradigm to elasto-plasticity with isotropic hardening. We formulate our approach employing Haigh–Westergaard coordinates, providing information on the underlying material yield surface. Based on this, we use a combined tension–torsion test to cover the knowledge of the yield surface and a single tensile test to calculate the corresponding tangent space.

Recent developments in the MPM have led to a better understanding of the error and dissipation that arise in the particle-to-grid and grid-to-particle mapping, but significant error and high-frequency noise can still occur in simulations involving strong shock waves. This error appears to be associated with the kinematics on the background computational grid common to all MPM implementations. An investigation of forward- and reverse-ballistic impact simulations has revealed that sub grid-scale variations in the material state arise as the shock front enters a grid cell, and that this non-equilibrium state can persist unless the background grid has some means to relax the resultant particle-scale noise. Relaxation can occur when (i) the background grid shape functions have non-constant gradient, (ii) the shocked material has a sufficiently high velocity relative to the background grid, or (iii) the velocity field is enriched with additional degrees of freedom for treating weak discontinuities between particles.},

The method involves a two-step iterative process to minimize the functional: first, regions with high modeling errors are localized, then their associated parameters are updated. The localization step requires solving large linear systems at each iteration, which makes the method less suitable for industrial models. In this work, a domain decomposition formulation is proposed. It makes the method more flexible, as subdomains can use different models which are independently modified during the updating algorithm without any additional cost. Moreover, this approach is very efficient numerically as it benefits from the same advantages as domain decomposition methods . In its standard form, it lacks a coarse problem which seems problematic; this is however addressed by using a multi-preconditioned solver such as MPGMRES.

  abstract     = {Patient-specific finite element analysis (FEA) holds great promise in advancing the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases by providing detailed biomechanical insights such as high-fidelity stress and deformation on a patient-specific basis. Albeit feasible, FEA that incorporates three-dimensional, complex patient-specific geometry can be time-consuming and unsuitable for time-sensitive clinical applications. To mitigate this challenge, machine learning (ML) models, e.g., deep neural networks (DNNs), have been increasingly utilized as potential alternatives to finite element method (FEM) for biomechanical analysis. So far, efforts have been made in two main directions: (1) learning the input-to-output mapping of traditional FEM solvers and replacing FEM with data-driven ML surrogate models; (2) solving equilibrium equations using physics-informed loss functions of neural networks. While these two existing strategies have shown improved performance in terms of speed or scalability, ML models have not yet provided practical advantages over traditional FEM due to generalization issues. This has led us to the question: instead of abandoning or replacing the traditional FEM framework that can reliably solve biomechanical problems, can we integrate FEM and DNNs to enhance performance? In this study, we propose a synergistic integration of DNNs and FEM to overcome their individual limitations. Using biomechanical analysis of the human aorta as the test bed, we demonstrated two novel integrative strategies in forward and inverse problems. For the forward problem, we developed DNNs with state-of-the-art architectures to predict a nodal displacement field, and this initial DNN solution was then updated by a FEM-based refinement process, yielding a fast and accurate computing framework. For the inverse problem of heterogeneous material parameter identification, our method employs DNN as a regularizer of the spatial distribution of material parameters, aiding the optimizer in locating the optimal solution. In our demonstrative examples, despite that the DNN-only forward models yielded small displacement errors in most test cases; stress errors were considerably large, and for some test cases, the peak stress errors were greater than 50%. Our DNN-FEM integration eliminated these non-negligible errors in DNN-only models and was magnitudes faster than the FEM-only approach. Additionally, compared to FEM-only inverse method with errors greater than 50%, our DNN-FEM inverse approach significantly improved the parameter identification accuracy and reduced the errors to less than 1%.},

  abstract     = {Time-domain vibro-acoustic finite element simulation gained considerable interest in recent years because of the rise of some applications such as auralization and virtual sensing. Efficiency and stability are of great importance for this topic. The number of elements needed per wavelength to reach acceptable accuracy often results in a large model size, which requires lots of computational resources and cannot run efficiently. Model order reduction can significantly alleviate this problem by reducing the size of these models, while maintaining the high-fidelity property. However, many model order reduction techniques fail to preserve the stability for non-locally reacting absorbers, which are often accounted for by using the Helmholtz equation with frequency-dependent density and bulk modulus, known as the equivalent fluid method. When discretized into a finite element model, frequency-dependent mass and stiffness matrices are introduced, which hinder the preservation of stability in the context of model order reduction. This paper presents a method that enables the creation of a stable reduced order model of a vibro-acoustic system with non-locally absorbers. This method reforms the Helmholtz equation and considers it as the interconnection of several passive systems. Stacking the states of these subsystems gives the final descriptor representation of the non-locally reacting absorbers. Furthermore, a possible second-order representation of the descriptor model is chosen such that it satisfies the stability-preserving condition under model order reduction. The resulting second-order model is coupled with a vibro-acoustic system in a velocity potential-displacement formulation, leading to a second-order model satisfying the aforementioned stability-preserving condition. The proposed method is successfully verified by several numerical simulations.},

This study proposes a method of optimal sensor placement for the best localization and reconstruction of external excitations when considering multi-source uncertainties. The excitation inversion is achieved in the framework of minimizing the discrepancy between the forward and inversed modal loads. To accurately obtain the modal force in the time-domain excitation reconstruction algorithm, three combined indicators of the interested modal matrix are defined, which integrate measures of effectiveness, stability, orthogonality, and robustness of inverse modal transformation. The optimal sensor placement is determined by multi-objective particle swarm optimization and Pareto optimal solution. In addition, to alleviate the computational burden of loading localization, a surrogate model based on an interval kriging interpolation model and sequential sampling strategies is established for the forward modal forces. And a time-dependent interval error of modal forces inspired by the theory of second-order narrow bounds in system reliability is developed to guide the inversion process. Notably, the developed sensor selection and excitation inversion methods are independent of the type, location, and time evolution of external excitations. Eventually, two numerical examples and an experimental case are discussed to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the developed approach.},

This necessitates a framework that can efficiently predict stress distribution in geometries based on given boundary and loading conditions. In this paper, we present StressD, a framework for predicting von Mises stress fields based on the denoising diffusion model. The StressD framework involves two models, a U-net-based denoising diffusion model and an auxiliary network to generate and predict stress distribution in structures. The denoising diffusion model generates a normalized stress map based on the given geometry, boundary conditions and loading condition, while the auxiliary network is used to determine the scaling information needed to un-normalize the generated stress map.

However, such meshes are not useful from the standpoint of most practical problems which are posed on irregular domains. The present study extends the DMCDM for the analysis of plane elasticity problems involving non-rectangular domains meshed with arbitrarily shaped elements. The approach makes use of the isoparametric formulation, in which the primal mesh used for the approximation of the geometry is also used for approximating the dependent unknowns. Several boundary value problems of elasticity are solved using the DMCDM, and the results are compared with those obtained using the finite element method (FEM). The results show that the DMCDM exhibits excellent convergence and accuracy while requiring less computational cost when compared with the FEM.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a procedure to assess the predictive accuracy of stochastic models subject to model error and sparse data. Model error is introduced as uncertainty on the coefficients of appropriate polynomial chaos expansions (PCE). The error associated with finite sample size allows us to conceive of these coefficients as statistics of the data that we describe as random variables whose influence on output quantities of interest is evaluated through the extended polynomial chaos expansion (EPCE). A Bayesian data assimilation scheme is introduced to update these expansions by considering the resulting nested chaos expansion as a hierarchical probabilistic model. Stochastic models of quantities of interest (QoI) are thus constructed and efficiently evaluated. The Metropolis–Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure is used to sample the posterior. Two illustrative analytical and numerical problems are used to demonstrate the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {S-splines (Simple splines) is a generalization of T-splines that solves the problem of additional control points propagation in T-spline’s local refinement algorithm. However, when applying S-splines to isogeometric analysis (IGA), the existing local refinement algorithm for S-splines can result in a matrix with an extremely large condition number . This paper provides a solution to this problem by introducing an improved local refinement algorithm. The improvement is achieved through an optimized postprocessing process for decomposing the blending functions before insertion. We also prove that the improved local refinement algorithm can preserve the linear independence of blending functions , the partition of unity , and create nested spline spaces during local refinement. Numerical experiments show that the resulting S-splines require fewer degrees of freedom than T-splines and analysis-suitable T-splines under the same error. Additionally, the condition numbers of the matrices are much smaller than those with the original S-splines local refinement algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The phase field method is becoming the de facto choice for the numerical analysis of complex problems that involve multiple initiating, propagating, interacting, branching and merging fractures. However, within the context of finite element modelling, the method requires a fine mesh in regions where fractures will propagate, in order to capture sharp variations in the phase field representing the fractured/damaged regions. This means that the method can become computationally expensive when the fracture propagation paths are not known a priori . This paper presents a 2D h p hp -adaptive discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for phase field fracture that includes a posteriori error estimators for both the elasticity and phase field equations, which drive mesh adaptivity for static and propagating fractures. This combination means that it is possible to be reliably and efficiently solve phase field fracture problems with arbitrary initial meshes, irrespective of the initial geometry or loading conditions. This ability is demonstrated on several example problems, which are solved using a light-BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) quasi-Newton algorithm. The examples highlight the importance of driving mesh adaptivity using both the elasticity and phase field errors for physically meaningful, yet computationally tractable, results. They also reveal the importance of including p p -refinement, which is typically not included in existing phase field literature. The above features provide a powerful and general tool for modelling fracture propagation with controlled errors and degree-of-freedom optimised meshes.},

  abstract     = {This papers considers the topology optimization of duct flows governed by the three-dimensional steady state Navier–Stokes equations, using anisotropic mesh adaptation to achieve a high-fidelity description of all fluid–solid interfaces. The numerical framework combines an immersed volume method solving stabilized, linear equal-order finite element formulations cast in the Variational Multiscale (VMS) framework, and level set representations of the interface, used as a posteriori anisotropic error estimator to minimize the interpolation error under the constraint of a prescribed number of nodes in the mesh. Both the resolution and remeshing steps are performed in a massively parallel framework allowing for the optimization of large-scale systems. In particular, an original parallelization strategy is used for mesh adaptation, that combines local remeshing performed sequentially and independently on each subdomain with blocked interfaces, and constrained repartitioning to optimally move the interfaces between subdomains in an optimal way, both iterated until a satisfying mesh and partition are obtained. The proposed approach reduces the computational burden related to the call of the finite element solver, compared to classical optimization schemes working on uniform grids with similar mesh refinement. For a given number of nodes, it improves the accuracy in the geometric description of all layouts. Finally, it has the potential to alleviates the end user from most of the post-processing step aiming at extracting the final layout, due to ability of anisotropic adapted meshes to generate intrinsically smooth designs. Numerical results are provided for several three-dimensional problems of power dissipation minimization involving several dozen million state degrees of freedom, for which the optimal designs agree well with reference results from the literature, while providing superior accuracy over prior studies solved on isotropic meshes (in the sense that the flow is better resolved, especially in the near-wall regions, and the layouts are more smooth). The potential of the method for engineering problems of practical interest is eventually exposed by optimizing the distributor section conveying the cold fluid within the plates of a plate fin heat exchanger.},

For this, a hyperelastic physics-augmented neural network model is calibrated to data generated with an analytical potential. In all finite element simulations , the proposed discretization techniques show excellent performance. All of this demonstrates that, from a formal point of view, neural networks are essentially mathematical functions . As such, they can be applied in numerical methods as straightforwardly as analytical constitutive models.

  abstract     = {Owing to the random nature of heterogeneity, damage and fracture behavior of quasi-brittle materials exhibits a considerable degree of uncertainty. Computational modeling of stochastic fracture in quasi-brittle materials has become an indispensable tool for analysis and design of engineering structures. To this end, we present in this paper a computational framework to capture probabilistic fracture in heterogeneous quasi-brittle solids by combining the random field theory and the phase-field cohesive zone model ( PF-CZM ). The spatial variation of the material strength and fracture energy is represented by a cross-correlated bivariate random field generated by the Karhunen–Loève expansion. The recently proposed PF-CZM is employed to simulate the stochastic crack nucleation and propagation in quasi-brittle solids. The objectivity of the Monte-Carlo simulation is achieved by imposing a specific condition on the phase-field length scale parameter and the correlation length of the random field. In particular, upon this condition the width of the fracture process zone (FPZ) is considerably smaller than the correlation length of the random field such that the material inside the FPZ does not exhibit significant spatial variations of mechanical properties. As the fracture energy is intrinsically incorporated in the PF-CZM , it is unnecessary in this case to explicitly consider the FPZ width. The resulting probabilistic PF-CZM together is applied to the Monte-Carlo simulations of fracture in concrete structures of different geometries. It is shown that the stochastic simulation results are insensitive to both the phase-field length scale parameter and the finite element mesh discretization as in the previous deterministic analyses. Enhanced with the specific condition on the involved characteristic lengths, the PF-CZM provides a viable tool for stochastic simulations of damage and fracture in quasi-brittle structures.},

  abstract     = {While porous composites are drawing growing attention for their excellent lightweight and multifunctional characteristics, inherent stress concentration in these porous composites often presents a main concern of structural integrity . This study aims to develop a multiscale topology optimisation (MTO) method for design of porous composites with clustered microstructures under a prescribed stress constraint. First, the concurrent topology optimisation (TO) for both macrostructures and microstructures are implemented via a multiscale algorithm. Meanwhile, a clustering technique is implemented based on a so-called k -means method to simultaneously determine the allowable volume fraction and microstructural configuration. Second, a consistent density-and-strain based clustering technique is developed for both 2D and 3D multiscale TO. Finally, two benchmark design examples, namely Messerschmitt–Bölkow–Blohm (MBB) and L-bracket structures, are implemented using the presented MTO method by considering either 2D or 3D situations to demonstrate the design effectiveness. The results indicate that, when optimising a high-stiffness porous composites subject to the stress constraint, the maximum von Mises stresses of the 2D MBB and L-bracket structures are well restrained, which are respectively 20% and 29% lower than those without the stress-constraint. In design of a 3D L-bracket, the present MTO method can achieve around 19% reduction in the maximum stress. The study demonstrates the importance of stress constraint to the topological design of multiscale porous composite structures.},

This approach simplifies the data augmentation step and enables us to constitute the high-dimensional yield surface in a feature space spanned by the feature kernels. In the numerical examples , we first verified the implementations with data generated from known models, then tested the capacity of the models to discover feature spaces from meso-scale simulation data generated from representative elementary volume (RVE) of heterogeneous materials with internal structures. The neural kernel plasticity model and other alternative machine learning approaches are compared in a computational homogenization problem for layered geomaterials.

Similarly to prior applications of a three-field principle, volume constraints are invoked to embed microscale-to-macroscale correspondences for kinematic and static volumetric measures, like mean strain and its energy-conjugate stress invariant. Unlike prior applications, our three-field principle realizes a strain-driven model for effective constitutive behavior due to bonded intergranular contact. The resultant micro-sphere integration-based homogenization is demonstrated in comparison to existing publicly-available measurements to capture the extreme tension/compression constitutive asymmetry exhibited by PBPMs (specifically PBX-9501) during material softening.},

For CDA-Picard, we prove the method has an improved convergence rate compared to usual Picard, and the rate improves as more measurement data is incorporated. We also prove that CDA-Picard is contractive for larger Reynolds numbers than usual Picard, and the more measurement data that is incorporated the larger the Reynolds number can be with CDA-Picard still being contractive. For CDA-Newton, we prove that the domain of convergence, with respect to both the initial guess and the Reynolds number, increases as the amount of measurement data is increased. Additionally, for both methods we show that CDA can be implemented as direct enforcement of measurement data into the solution.

  abstract     = {We propose the use of machine learning techniques to find optimal quadrature rules for the construction of stiffness and mass matrices in isogeometric analysis (IGA). We initially consider 1D spline spaces of arbitrary degree spanned over uniform and non-uniform knot sequences, and then the generated optimal rules are used for integration over higher-dimensional spaces using tensor products . The quadrature rule search is posed as an optimization problem and solved by a machine learning strategy based on adaptive gradient-descent. However, since the optimization space is highly non-convex, the success of the search strongly depends on the number of quadrature points and the parameter initialization. Thus, we use a dynamic programming strategy that initializes the parameters from the optimal solution over the spline space with a lower number of knots. With this method, we found optimal quadrature rules for spline spaces when using IGA discretizations with up to 50 uniform elements and polynomial degrees up to 8, showing the generality of the approach in this scenario. For non-uniform partitions, the method also finds an optimal rule in a reasonable number of test cases. We also assess the generated optimal rules in two practical case studies , namely, the eigenvalue problem of the Laplace operator and the eigenfrequency analysis of freeform curved beams, where the latter problem shows the applicability of the method to curved geometries . In particular, the proposed method results in savings with respect to traditional Gaussian integration of up to 44% in 1D, 68% in 2D, and 82% in 3D spaces.},

The shell model includes curvature terms up to order 5 in the shell thickness, which are crucial to reliably simulate high-curvature deformations such as near-folds or creases. The original model is generalized to shells that are not homeomorphic to a subset of R 2 R2 . For this, we replace the originally planar parameter domain by an abstract two-dimensional manifold, and verify that the hyperelastic shell energy and three-dimensional reconstruction are invariant under changes of the local coordinate systems . This general approach allows to determine the elastic response for even non-orientable surfaces like the Möbius strip and the Klein bottle . We discretize the model with a geometric finite element method and, using that geometric finite elements are H 1 H1 -conforming, prove that the discrete shell model has a solution. Numerical tests then show the general performance and versatility of the model and discretization method.},

This paper proposes a novel people identity attributes-based heuristic technology, named the People Identity Attributes-based Information-learning Search Optimization (ISO), inspired by people’s psychological assessment and learning behaviors for information resources based on the social status-based identity attribute and the self-survival demands-based identity attribute. For the former, a four-level information delivery mechanism is constructed through leader, manager, executor, and freelancer, emphasizing global optimization. For the latter, the staged transforming model based on random accumulation and directed induction behaviors are constructed according to self-survival demands, emphasizing global optimization and exploration. The dual identity attributes-based search strategy emphasizes psychological assessment and selection for the information loss, including the learning behavior for two kinds of information resources with different identity attributes, and the recovering behavior for the information loss by constructing the information resilience equation, which emphasizes local optimization and exploitation. This paper qualitatively analyzes the swarm behavior, search history, and the exploration and exploitation capabilities of ISO. The optimization performances are quantitatively analyzed for ISO and 9 competitive algorithms on 39 benchmark tests, including the convergence, solution accuracy, robustness, sensitivity, significance, statistical investigation-based Wilcoxon test and Friedman test. The scalability of ISO is investigated on CEC2017 (30Dim, 50Dim, 100Dim) and the latest CEC2022 (10Dim, 20Dim) suites. The results reveal that compared to other competitive algorithms, ISO possesses best computing performance with ranking the first in all competitors. In addition, the proposed ISO and 12 competitors consider 10 constraint engineering optimization problems and the real application of path planning with multiple obstacles, suggesting that ISO possesses significant optimization performance.},

A supplementary variable method (SVM) of second-order was recently introduced in [1] , [2] to preserve thermodynamic consistency for thermodynamically consistent models. In this paper, we present a new class of high-order supplementary variable methods. These methods consist of two parts: firstly, the original model is discretized using a high-order prediction method, and secondly, the SVM reformulated system is approximated by a high-order correction method. The newly developed schemes are rigorously proven to preserve high-order accuracy with increased stability through the use of a stabilizer. Additionally, the schemes inherently maintain thermodynamic consistency for thermodynamically consistent models, retaining the original energy law at the discrete level. To assess the high-order supplementary variable methods, we apply them to two thermodynamically consistent partial differential equation systems: the functionalized Cahn–Hilliard model and the ternary Cahn–Hilliard model. We then provide several benchmark examples to demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and efficiency of the newly developed high-order numerical methods .},

This study explores previously proposed forms of the poroelastic strain energy with diffused fracture and assesses their ability to recover the explicit fracture opening aperture. We then propose a new form of degraded poroelastic strain energy derived from micromechanical analyses. Unlike the previously proposed models, our poroelastic strain energy degradation depends not only on the phase-field variable (damage) but also on the type of strain energy decomposition. Comparisons against closed form solutions suggest that our proposed model can recover crack opening displacement more accurately irrespective of Biot’s coefficient or the pore-pressure distribution. We then verify our model against the plane strain hydraulic fracture propagation, known as the KGD fracture, in the toughness dominated regime. Finally, we demonstrate the model’s ability to handle complex hydraulic fracture interactions with a pre-existing natural fracture.},

The sOED design policy incorporates elements of feedback and lookahead simultaneously, and we show it to generalize the commonly-used batch and greedy design strategies. We solve for the sOED policy using the policy gradient (PG) method from reinforcement learning, and provide a derivation for the PG expression in the sOED context. Adopting an actor–critic approach, the policy and value functions are parameterized using deep neural networks and improved via PG estimates produced from simulated episodes of designs and observations. The new PG-sOED algorithm is first validated on a linear-Gaussian benchmark, and then compared against other design baselines on a sensor movement problem for contaminant source inversion in a convection–diffusion field.

  abstract     = {The application of composite materials has increased manifolds in aerospace and high-speed vehicle industries, where structures experience dynamic loads along with temperature variation. To ensure safety of these structures, the stochastic dynamic analysis in varying thermal environments is essential. The generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion method is a well-known metamodel used to quantify uncertainties in engineering systems instead of using the direct Monte Carlo simulation . Though the gPC expansion method is used extensively for engineering systems, its classical version has some limitations while implementing in dynamical systems . The accuracy of the gPC expansion method reduces in delayed time domain and can be improved to some extent by increasing the order of polynomial, which though is computationally intensive. Furthermore, the classical gPC expansion method is suitable for low-dimensional problems having independent random parameters. To overcome these limitations in the classical gPC expansion method, a system identifier, i.e., nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input (NARX) is coupled with it to avoid response degeneration in delayed time domain. The temperature-dependent material properties of composite lamina can be random and correlated, however the classical gPC expansion method is unable to accommodate the correlated random parameters. To address these challenges, the NARX-gPC expansion method is modified to conduct stochastic dynamic analysis of composite plates using correlated random material properties of the composite lamina in varying thermal environments. The study indicates that the correlation has a significant effect on the stochastic dynamic response at low and high temperatures for cross-ply laminates in comparison with angle-ply laminates, which is not captured through uncorrelated random material properties. The prediction efficiency of the developed surrogate by using the adaptive NARX-gPC expansion method is established even though it is trained using data in a shorter time domain, thereby computational performance is enhanced. Additionally, this surrogate is implemented effectively for higher order randomness in the input parameters.},

Data-driven FWI has been increasingly studied with various neural network architectures to improve accuracy and computational efficiency. Nevertheless, the applicability of pre-trained neural networks is severely restricted by potential discrepancies between the source function used in the field survey and the one utilized during training. Here, we develop a Fourier-enhanced deep operator network (Fourier-DeepONet) for FWI with the generalization of seismic sources, including the frequencies and locations of sources. Specifically, we employ the Fourier neural operator as the decoder of DeepONet, and we utilize source parameters as one input of Fourier-DeepONet, facilitating the resolution of FWI with variable sources. To test Fourier-DeepONet, we develop three new and realistic FWI benchmark datasets (FWI-F, FWI-L, and FWI-FL) with varying source frequencies, locations, or both. Our experiments demonstrate that compared with existing data-driven FWI methods, Fourier-DeepONet obtains more accurate predictions of subsurface structures in a wide range of source parameters. Moreover, the proposed Fourier-DeepONet exhibits superior robustness when handling data with Gaussian noise or missing traces and sources with Gaussian noise, paving the way for more reliable and accurate subsurface imaging across diverse real conditions.},

However, simulations of real patterns still incur significant computational costs, which could be alleviated by leveraging large image datasets. Physics-informed machine learning and operator learning are two new emerging and promising concepts for this application. Here, we propose “Phase-Field DeepONet”, a physics-informed operator neural network framework that predicts the dynamic responses of systems governed by gradient flows of free-energy functionals. Examples used to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the method include the Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard equations, as special cases of reactive phase-field models for nonequilibrium thermodynamics of chemical mixtures. This is achieved by incorporating the minimizing movement scheme into the framework, which optimizes and controls how the total free energy of a system evolves, instead of solving the governing equations directly. The trained operator neural networks can work as explicit time-steppers that take the current state as the input and output the next state. This could potentially facilitate fast real-time predictions of pattern-forming dynamical systems, such as phase-separating Li-ion batteries, emulsions, colloidal displays, or biological patterns.},

  abstract     = {Projection-based Reduced Order Models are based on the idea of minimizing the discrete residual of a “full order model” (FOM) while at the same time constraining the unknowns to live in a space of reduced dimension. For problems with symmetric positive definite (SPD) Jacobians , this minimization can be achieved optimally by projecting the full order residual onto the approximation basis (Galerkin Projection). This approach is sub-optimal for problems with non-SPD Jacobians since it only guarantees that the projection of the residual onto the chosen basis is minimized and not the residual itself. One possible alternative in such cases is to directly minimize the 2-norm of the residual. This minimization can be achieved either by using QR factorization to solve the resulting least-squares problem or by employing the method of the normal equations (LSPG) to the same end. The first approach involves constructing and factorizing a rectangular tall and skinny matrix of size proportional to the number of unknowns of the FOM. The LSPG method avoids the use of the large matrix by directly constructing the product by its transpose. Unfortunately, constructing such a product element by element is not feasible and requires the use of a complementary mesh, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the hyper-reduction process when performing mesh sampling. The main idea of this work is to propose an alternative technique based on the idea of Petrov–Galerkin minimization. Essentially, we choose a left basis so that a least-squares minimization procedure can be carried out on a reduced problem while guaranteeing that the discrete full order residual is minimized. The resulting procedure is applicable to problems with both SPD and non-SPD Jacobians. Additionally, the resulting minimization problem can be assembled element by element, avoiding the use of the complementary mesh and simplifying implementation in the context of finite elements . The resulting technique is amenable to hyper-reduction by the use of the Empirical Cubature Method and can be readily applied in the context of nonlinear reduction procedures.},

Numerical examples demonstrate that this scheme is able to accelerate fatigue fracture simulations without sacrificing much accuracy, and can be up to 200 times faster than direct numerical simulations in some cases.

  abstract     = {In this work we develop new finite element discretisations of the shear-deformable Reissner–Mindlin plate problem based on the Hellinger–Reissner principle of symmetric stresses. Specifically, we use conforming Hu-Zhang elements to discretise the bending moments in the space of symmetric square integrable fields with a square integrable divergence M ∈ HZ ⊂ H sym ( Div ) M∈HZ⊂Hsym(Div) . The latter results in highly accurate approximations of the bending moments M M and in the rotation field being in the Lebesgue space ϕ ∈ [ L 2 ] 2 ϕ∈[L2]2 , such that the Kirchhoff–Love constraint can be satisfied for t → 0 t→0 . In order to preserve optimal convergence rates across all variables for the case t → 0 t→0 , we present an extension of the formulation using Raviart–Thomas elements for the shear stress q ∈ RT ⊂ H ( div ) q∈RT⊂H(div) . We prove existence and uniqueness in the continuous setting and rely on exact complexes for inheritance of well-posedness in the discrete setting. This work introduces an efficient construction of the Hu-Zhang base functions on the reference element via the polytopal template methodology and Legendre polynomials , making it applicable to hp-FEM. The base functions on the reference element are then mapped to the physical element using novel polytopal transformations, which are suitable also for curved geometries . The robustness of the formulations and the construction of the Hu-Zhang element are tested for shear-locking, curved geometries and an L-shaped domain with a singularity in the bending moments M M . Further, we compare the performance of the novel formulations with the primal-, MITC- and recently introduced TDNNS methods.},

First, a two-dimensional stent unit cell is designed by inverse homogenization topology optimization . In particular, the unit cell is optimized in terms of contact area with the target of matching prescribed mechanical properties. The topology optimization is enriched by an anisotropic mesh adaptation strategy, enabling a time- and cost-effective procedure that promotes original layouts. Successively, the optimized stent unit cell is periodically repeated on a hollow cylindrical surface to construct the corresponding three-dimensional device. Finally, structural mechanics and computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out to verify the performance of the newly-designed stent. The proposed workflow is being tested through the design of five proof-of-concept stents. These devices are compared through specific performance evaluations, which include the assessments of the minimum requirement for usability, namely the ability to be crimped into a catheter, and the quantification of the radial force , the foreshortening, the structural integrity and the induced blood flow disturbances.},

  abstract     = {A novel anisotropic ductile damage model at finite strains is proposed in this work. The model is formulated based on the fictitious configuration concept and includes deformation induced evolution of anisotropic damage properties. As a key contribution, different effective driving forces for both, plasticity and damage are elaborated in the context of a so-called two-surface formulation, i.e. the consideration of two admissible (but not independent) domains — one related to plastic flow and one related to damage evolution. The investigations include the introduction of effective stresses driving plastic flow on the one hand, and effective driving forces related to the evolution of anisotropic damage on the other. In addition and as an alternative to the introduction of effective driving forces, contributions influencing the respective threshold values related to plastic flow and damage evolution are proposed. Specification of the underlying constitutive equations together with the introduction of a suitable algorithmic implementation allows the model to predict experimentally observed material behaviour. Moreover, fundamental properties of the model are discussed by means of non-proportional loading paths generated by combinations of loading under uniaxial tension and simple shear. In view of the simulation of inhomogeneous boundary value problems, the implementation of the model into a finite element formulation is discussed. Since softening, respectively material degradation and necking phenomena, may results in mesh-dependent simulation results, an appropriate regularisation must be included in the model. In this work, gradient-enhancements in the form of a so-called micromorphic approach are included. In particular, gradients of scalar-valued hardening variables related to plasticity and damage are accounted for. A detailed analysis of the necessity of these gradient-enhancements of both, damage and plasticity is carried out based on the proposed multi-surface anisotropic ductile damage model. It turns out that gradient-enhanced regularisation of the damage contribution alone is not sufficient to regularise the problem (and vice versa, i.e. gradient-enhanced regularisation of the plasticity contribution alone is not sufficient as well) but contributions related to both phenomena, i.e. damage and plasticity, need to be regularised.},

The training framework, along with the training data generated by an experimentally validated viscoelastic-viscoplastic model, enables the DL model to accurately capture the rate-dependent stress–strain relationship and consistent tangent moduli. In addition, the DL-based constitutive model is implemented into finite element analysis. Finite element simulations are performed to study the effect of load rate and moisture content on the force–displacement response of nanoparticle/epoxy samples. Numerical examples show that the computational efficiency of the DL model depends on the loading condition and is significantly higher than the conventional constitutive model.

This observation led to the development of a novel physics-informed radial basis network (PIRBN), which is capable of maintaining the local approximating property throughout the entire training process. Unlike deep neural networks , a PIRBN comprises only one hidden layer and a radial basis “activation” function. Under appropriate conditions, we demonstrated that the training of PIRBNs using gradient descendent methods can converge to Gaussian processes . Besides, we studied the training dynamics of PIRBN via the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory. In addition, comprehensive investigations regarding the initialisation strategies of PIRBN were conducted. Numerical examples demonstrated that PIRBN is more effective than PINN in solving nonlinear partial differential equations with high-frequency features and ill-posed computational domains. Moreover, the existing PINN numerical techniques , such as adaptive learning, decomposition and different types of loss functions, are applicable to PIRBN.

The proposed scheme achieves full decoupling while maintaining linearity and energy stability through a combination of the Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) method, which discretizes the nonlinear potential, and the “Zero-Energy-Contribution” (ZEC) method, which handles the coupled nonlinear advective/surface tension terms. The efficiency of this scheme is attributed to its linear decoupling structure and the fact that it requires only a few elliptic equations with constant coefficients to be solved at each time step. We rigorously establish the scheme’s unconditional energy stability. Further, some numerical simulations are provided in both 2D and 3D to show its effectiveness, including its accuracy, stability, and efficiency.},

Two key ingredients of the proposed surrogate modeling are the introduction of a variable representing the macroscopic strain history along with the macroscopic strain and the application of radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Not only the coefficients of the RBF but also the type of its function form are considered hyperparameters and are determined by applying an optimization algorithm. In the offline process, numerical material tests (NMTs) are performed on a unit cell consisting of multiple elastoplastic materials subjected to various patterns of macroscopic strain to create a database that stores the discrete relationships between variables representing macroscopic deformation states with the macroscopic stresses. Then, RBF interpolation is applied to represent the macroscopic stress in a continuous function with these input data as independent variables. In the online process, this function is used as a macroscopic constitutive law in the macroscopic analysis, which can be followed by localization analysis using an arbitrary macroscopic strain history if necessary.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a method for computing the averaged free energy and constitutive relations in hyperelastic material models with distributed fibres, as they apply to soft fibre-reinforced materials and biological tissues. While these models are currently implemented through either spherical cubature of the fibre free energy or its Taylor series, we here propose a new method based on a univariate Gauss quadrature rule with integration points and weights informed by the statistical moments of the distribution of fibre stretch. As an intrinsic property, the new approach separates the integration of the fibre constitutive law from the integration of the orientation distribution, the latter leading to structural tensors of even order. Provided the latter 2 n − 1 2n−1 tensors are computed accurately up to tensorial order 2 ( 2 n − 1 ) 2(2n−1) , the method integrates exactly any polynomial of order 2 n − 1 2n−1 that agrees with the fibre law at the n n integration points. After formally introducing the quadrature method for generally non-affine fibre deformations and arbitrary order, we focus on the important special case of affine fibre kinematics and discuss the rules with n ≤ 3 n≤3 integration points, for which the corresponding positions and weights are determined analytically. At a computational cost comparable to the existing approaches, the new method does not require the fibre law to be analytic and can thus robustly deal with piece-wise definitions of the fibre energy, in contrast to Taylor-series approaches, and it does not induce additional anisotropy as it can occur with spherical cubature rules. The 3-point rule is further investigated and illustrated in numerical examples relating to soft collagenous tissues based on a Fortran implementation of the method suitable for use in finite element analyses.},

Trimming operations violate the tensor-product structure of the used Non-Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBS) basis functions and of typical quadrature rules. Existing efficient patch-wise quadrature rules consider actual knot vectors and are determined in 1D. They are extended to further dimensions by means of a tensor-product. Therefore, they are not directly applicable to trimmed structures. The herein proposed method extends patch-wise quadrature rules to trimmed surfaces. Thereby, the number of quadrature points can be significantly reduced. Geometrically linear and non-linear benchmarks of plane, plate and shell structures are investigated.

In the paper at hand, full waveform inversion is the inverse problem under consideration. The performance of PINNs is compared against classical adjoint optimization. The comparison focuses on three key aspects: the forward-solver, the representation of the material, and the sensitivity computation for the gradient-based minimization. Starting from PINNs, each of these key aspects is investigated and adapted individually until the classical adjoint optimization emerges. It is shown that it is beneficial to use the neural network only for the discretization of the unknown spatially varying material field. Here the neural network produces reconstructions without oscillatory artifacts as typically encountered in classical full waveform inversion approaches. Due to this finding, a hybrid method is proposed. It exploits both the efficient gradient computation with the continuous adjoint method as well as the neural network ansatz for the unknown material field. This new hybrid method outperforms Physics-Informed Neural Networks and the classical adjoint optimization in two-dimensional and three-dimensional settings.},

  abstract     = {A novel deep operator network (DeepONet) with a residual U-Net (ResUNet) as the trunk network is devised to predict full-field highly nonlinear elastic–plastic stress response for complex geometries obtained from topology optimization under variable loads. The proposed DeepONet uses a ResUNet in the trunk to encode complex input geometries, and a fully-connected branch network encodes the parametric loads. Additional information fusion is introduced via an element-wise multiplication of the encoded latent space to improve prediction accuracy further. The performance of the proposed DeepONet was compared to two baseline models, a standalone ResUNet and a DeepONet with fully connected networks as the branch and trunk. The results show that ResUNet and the proposed DeepONet share comparable accuracy; both can predict the stress field and accurately identify stress concentration points. However, the novel DeepONet is more memory efficient and allows greater flexibility with framework architecture modifications. The DeepONet with fully connected networks suffers from high prediction error due to its inability to effectively encode the complex, varying geometry. Once trained, all three networks can predict the full stress distribution orders of magnitude faster than finite element simulations. The proposed network can quickly guide preliminary optimization, designs, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and many other nonlinear analyses that require extensive forward evaluations with variable geometries, loads, and other parameters. This work marks the first time a ResUNet is used as the trunk network in the DeepONet architecture and the first time that DeepONet solves problems with complex, varying input geometries under parametric loads and elasto-plastic material behavior.},

  abstract     = {A multi-scale approach to topology optimization has recently emerged due to its lightweight, robust, and multi-functional characteristics. Considering material diversity, an increasing number of materials leads to a computational burden due to numerous design variables and homogenization equations. This study proposes DL-MSTO+, a deep learning-based multi-scale topology optimization framework. The framework consists of two distinct deep neural networks for multi-scale topology optimization problems to reduce the dimensionality of design variables and predict homogenized material properties. First, a generator network learns the low-dimensional representation of a material microstructure in an unsupervised manner . Thus, the trained generator produces a micro-structural image from a low-dimensional vector. Second, a predictor network is trained in a supervised manner to predict the homogenized elasticity matrix for a given micro-structural image. Additionally, the predictor is specifically designed to ensure the positive definiteness of the predicted elasticity matrix. Lastly, the networks are integrated into the algorithm to improve the efficiency of multi-scale topology optimization. The numerical experiments demonstrate higher efficiency for the proposed algorithm than the conventional multi-scale approach. Moreover, the proposed method provides connectable multi-scale designs, and the low-dimensional latent representation enables semantic interpolation between solutions.},

  abstract     = {Nonlocal implicit gradient enhancements are widely used to suppress mesh dependency in simulations involving strain localization . For example, nonlocality is often introduced through internal variables that account for possible material softening. This work, however, shows that this approach may become ineffective if the solid displays plastic non-normality (i.e., non-associated plastic flow). For this purpose, we consider an over-nonlocal formulation and mathematically inspect the conditions at which regularization is lost in the presence of plastic non-normality. Specifically, such loss of regularization is linked to the loss of uniqueness and/or existence of the incremental plastic response that is kinematically compatible with the development of a deformation band. By doing so, we find a lower limit for the admissibility of the parameters controlling the effectiveness of nonlocal implicit gradient regularization . Furthermore, we show that such a lower limit is regulated by a plastic modulus reflecting the loss of controllability of the constitutive response, and, hence, depends on the degree of plastic non-normality. We also derive a closed-form expression relating the thickness of the deformation band to both the controllability modulus and gradient regularization constants, which suggests that the thickness of the process zone may change in response to the prevailing plastic flow characteristics and evolve during active plastic deformation . The proposed nonlocal enhancement is applied to a non-associated elasto-plastic model for porous sedimentary rocks, which is capable of displaying both shear-dominated and compaction-dominated bands. Numerical simulations reveal that effective regularization can be enforced only when the over-nonlocal weighting coefficient is larger than the above-mentioned lower limit.},

  abstract     = {The conventional no-slip boundary condition does not always hold in several fluid flow applications and must be replaced with appropriate slip conditions according to the wall and fluid properties. However, not only slip boundary conditions are still a subject of discussion among fluid dynamicists, but also their numerical treatment is far from being well-developed, particularly in the context of very high-order accurate methods. The complexity of these conditions significantly increases when the boundary is not aligned with the chosen coordinate system and, even more challenging, when the fluid slips along a curved boundary. The present work proposes a simple and efficient numerical treatment of general slip boundary conditions on arbitrary curved boundaries for three-dimensional fluid flow problems governed by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. In that regard, two critical challenges arise: (i) achieving very high-order of convergence with arbitrary curved boundaries for the classical no-slip boundary conditions and (ii) extending the developed numerical techniques to impose general slip boundary conditions. The conventional treatment of curved boundaries relies on generating curved meshes to eliminate the geometrical mismatch between the physical and computational boundaries and achieve high-order of convergence. However, such an approach requires sophisticated meshing algorithms, cumbersome quadrature rules on curved elements, and complex non-linear transformations. In contrast, the reconstruction for off-site data (ROD) method handles arbitrary curved boundaries approximated with linear piecewise elements while employing polynomial reconstructions with specific linear constraints to fulfil the prescribed boundary conditions . For that purpose, the general slip boundary conditions are reformulated on a local orthonormal basis to allow a straightforward application of the ROD method with scalar boundary conditions. The Navier–Stokes equations are discretised with a staggered finite volume method , and the numerical fluxes are computed solely on the polygonal mesh elements. Several benchmark test cases of fluid flow problems in non-trivial three-dimensional curved domains are addressed and confirm that the proposed method effectively achieves up to the eighth-order of convergence.},

The scheme involves incorporating a nudging term into a traditional deferred correction scheme in order to calibrate a model to match coarse mesh or spatial observations at a larger scale.

The framework is based on eXtended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (X-PINNs), domain decomposition in space–time, but we augment the original X-PINN method by imposing flux continuity across the domain interfaces. The well-known Allen–Cahn equation is used to demonstrate the approach. The Frobenius matrix norm is used to evaluate the accuracy of the X-PINN predictions and the results show excellent performance. In addition, symbolic regression is employed to determine the closed form of the unknown part of the equation from the data, and the results confirm the accuracy of the X-PINNs based approach. To test the framework in a situation resembling real-world data, random noise is added to the datasets to mimic scenarios such as the presence of thermal noise or instrument errors. The results show that the framework is stable against significant amount of noise. As the final part, we determine the minimal amount of data required for training the neural network. For the systems studied here, the framework is able to predict the correct form of the underlying dynamical equation when at least 50% data is used for training. However, relying solely on 50% of the data is inadequate for accurately predicting the unknown coefficients. To ensure accurate predictions for the coefficients, it was necessary to train the network with a minimum of 60% of the available data.},

However, AHA has an imbalance between exploration and utilization abilities, often prematurely converging with low precision. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-strategy boosted hybrid artificial hummingbird algorithm called LCAHA combined with sinusoidal chaotic map strategy, Lévy flight, cross, and update foraging strategy is proposed. Firstly, LCAHA is initialized by the sinusoidal chaotic map strategy to obtain a population with better ergodicity. Secondly, introducing the Lévy flight can boost the diversity of the population, control premature convergence and boost the stability of the population. Then, two new strategies, cross foraging and update foraging, are introduced. The introduction of new foraging strategies further enhances the exploration and developmental capabilities. These three strategies work together to improve the overall performance of the AHA. Finally, the performance of the LCAHA is examined on 23 classical test suites, the CEC2017, CEC2019, and CEC2020 test suites, and six engineering optimization cases. The numerical experimental results show that LCAHA provides very promising numerical results in solving challenging optimization problems. The algorithm is applied to two spacecraft trajectory optimization cases. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability and potential of the LCAHA in solving practical applications.},

  abstract     = {In practical applications, some random variables follow multimodal distributions . However, conventional reliability analysis methods in reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO), such as the first order reliability method , often result in considerable computational errors when dealing with problems involving multimodal distributions. Consequently, the corresponding RBTO design is incredible. Moreover, the RBTO problem also faces the challenge of high computational cost. To this end, this paper proposes an efficient two-phase approach for RBTO of continuum structures with multimodal distributions combining sequential approximate integer programming with trust region (SAIP-TR) and direct probability integral method (DPIM). Firstly, DPIM is advanced to address the difficult problems of failure probability estimation and efficient sensitivity analysis under multimodal distributions. Secondly, a reliability-based discrete variable topology optimization framework based on SAIP-TR and DPIM is established, which yields clear topology configurations and facilitates engineering manufacturing . Owing to the merit of SAIP-TR, the original RBTO process is divided into two phases: the first phase performs deterministic topology optimization, and the second phase focuses on RBTO. Moreover, an adaptive selection strategy of representative points , considering structural compliance as performance function, is devised to further enhance computational efficiency. Finally, several examples illustrate high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. The multimodal random variable and the random field are employed separately to describe global and local uncertainties in materials. In contrast, the optimized result considering global material uncertainty is more suitable for additive manufacturing . The proposed approach also presents potential in handling complex RBTO problems with random fields.},

  abstract     = {Artificial meat is an eco-friendly alternative to real meat that is marketed to have a similar taste and feel. The mechanical properties of artificial meat significantly influence our perception of taste, but how precisely the mechanics of artificial meat compare to real meat remains insufficiently understood. Here we perform mechanical tension, compression, and shear tests on isotropic artificial meat (Tofurky® Plant-Based Deli Slices), anisotropic artificial meat (Daring™ Chick’n Pieces) and anisotropic real meat (chicken) and analyze the data using constitutive neural networks and automated model discovery. Our study shows that, when deformed by 10%, artificial and real chicken display similar maximum stresses of 21.0 kPa and 21.8 kPa in tension, -7.2 kPa and -16.4 kPa in compression, and 2.4 kPa and 0.9 kPa in shear, while the maximum stresses for tofurky were 28.5 kPa, -38.3 kP, and 5.5 kPa. To discover the mechanics that best explain these data, we consulted two constitutive neural networks of Ogden and Valanis–Landel type. Both networks robustly discover models and parameters to explain the complex nonlinear behavior of artificial and real meat for individual tension, compression, and shear tests, and for all three tests combined. When constrained to the classical neo Hooke, Blatz Ko, and Mooney Rivlin models , both networks discover shear moduli of 94.4 kPa for tofurky, 35.7 kPa for artificial chick’n, and 21.4 kPa for real chicken. Our results suggests that artificial chicken succeeds in reproducing the mechanical properties of real chicken across all loading modes, while tofurky does not, and is about three times stiffer. Strikingly, all three meat products display shear softening and their resistance to shear is about an order of magnitude lower than their resistance to tension and compression. We anticipate our study to inspire more quantitative, mechanistic comparisons of artificial and real meat. Our automated-model-discovery based approach has the potential to inform the design of more authentic meat substitutes with an improved perception of taste, with the ultimate goal to reduce environmental impact, improve animal welfare, and mitigate climate change , while still offering the familiar taste and texture of traditional meat.

  abstract     = {We present a new theoretical and computational framework for modelling electro-chemo-mechanical fracture. The model combines a phase field description of fracture with a fully coupled characterisation of electrolyte behaviour, surface chemical reactions and stress-assisted diffusion. Importantly, a new physics-based formulation is presented to describe electrolyte-containing phase field cracks, appropriately capturing the sensitivity of electrochemical transport and reaction kinetics to the crack opening height. Unlike other existing methods, this approach is shown to accurately capture the results obtained with discrete fracture simulations. The potential of the electro-chemo-mechanical model presented is demonstrated by particularising it to the analysis of hydrogen embrittlement in metallic samples exposed to aqueous electrolytes. The finite element implementation takes as nodal degrees-of-freedom the electrolyte potential, the concentrations of relevant ionic species, the surface coverage, the concentration of diluted species, the displacement field and the phase field order parameter. Particular attention is devoted to improve stability and efficiency, resulting in the development of strategies for avoiding ill-constrained degrees of freedom and lumped integration schemes that eliminate numerical oscillations. The numerical experiments conducted showcase the ability of the model to deliver assumptions-free predictions for systems involving both free-flowing and crack-contained electrolytes. The results obtained highlight the role of electrolyte behaviour in driving the cracking process, evidencing the limitations of existing models.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a reduced order model (ROM) for incompressible flows based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and having a finite element approximation as full order model (FOM). The main idea is to start from a purely POD-based ROM, projecting the equations onto the ROM space , and then add a nonlinear correction that depends on the ROM unknowns to enhance the final ROM model. This correction is based on the fact that we do have some available high fidelity data, namely, the snapshots. Thus, the correcting term is built as an artificial neural network (ANN) constructed with the snapshots as the training set. This correction is then introduced in the fully discrete ROM system to achieve more accurate solutions. A further feature of our approach is that we construct both the ROM and the FOM using the variational multi-scale (VMS) concept, and this allows us to understand the correction term as an approximation to the scales that are lost when passing from the FOM to the ROM. The resulting corrected ROM has a significant higher accuracy than the original one.},

  abstract     = {Performing reliability-based design optimization with insufficient input data is a significant and challenging issue as accurately quantifying epistemic uncertainty can be difficult in such scenarios. Non-probabilistic models can marginally alleviate the need for a large sample size by constructing the boundaries of uncertainty parameters. However, most of the existing non-probabilistic models account for only the available or known samples. For cases with insufficient data, the compact uncertainty domain may result in considerably hazardous results, particularly for the problems that require high reliability. Therefore, a novel bootstrap-based ellipsoidal convex model (BECM) is proposed herein to account for both known and unknown data. Herein, the bootstrap method is introduced to non-probabilistic convex models for the first time to quantify the ellipsoidal shape uncertainty caused by insufficient input data. Further, the proposed BECM is also integrated into non-probabilistic reliability-based design optimization. The entire framework of uncertainty quantification and reliability optimization design for insufficient input data is established. Marginally conservative results can finally be achieved in a rational and objective manner by partially sacrificing the ellipsoid volume. Comprehensive comparisons and detailed discussions on aspects, including the problem complexity, initial sample size, and distribution type, are also conducted. The numerical results show that the BECM displays the best performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. It can achieve an approximate balance between being conservative and taking risks. The significant advantages are also illustrated by an engineering example of linear buckling analysis of stiffened cylindrical shells.},

A modified Ritz formulation using the H 1 / 2 ( Γ D ) H1/2(ΓD) norm is introduced and analyzed for linear elasticity equation in order to deal with the (essential) Dirichlet boundary condition. We show that the resulting deep Ritz method provides the best approximation among the set of deep neural network (DNN) functions with respect to the “energy” norm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the total error of the deep Ritz simulation is bounded by the sum of the network approximation error and the numerical integration error, disregarding the algebraic error. To effectively control the numerical integration error, we propose an adaptive quadrature-based numerical integration technique with a residual-based local error indicator. This approach enables efficient approximation of the modified energy functional. Through numerical experiments involving smooth and singular problems, as well as problems with stress concentration, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed deep Ritz method with adaptive quadrature.},

These equations can predict cavitation inception without phenomenological assumptions about mass transfer. We present a modification to the bulk free energy of the fluid that can help us simulate cavitation at much larger length scales than previously possible. We propose a numerical scheme based on a Taylor–Galerkin discretization, a residual-based discontinuity capturing operator and a spatial filtering scheme. Our numerical method can be used for high speed flows with large pressure gradients, which are distinctive features of flows where we observe cavitation inception. We present numerical examples that show the accuracy, stability and robustness of our scheme. Finally, we use the proposed numerical scheme to study benchmark problems in the field of cavitation inception such as flow past a wedge and flow past a bluff body. The proposed numerical scheme opens opportunities to understand different aspects of cavitation in general and inception in particular, in much more detail.},

While the DEM captures phenomena with discontinuous behaviours , such as fracturing and granular flow, the BEM excels in accurately modelling seismic wave propagation in infinite domains. By separately solving the governing equations of the DEM and BEM at different time instants, the proposed scheme considerably enhances computational efficiency compared to conventional monolithic coupling schemes. The incorporation of non-conforming interfaces enables larger time steps in the BEM, thereby reducing computational costs and memory usage. Moreover, an innovative coupling of DEM rotations with the BEM displacement field is introduced, leading to more accurate and realistic modelling of complex dynamics. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, establishing its potential for modelling a wide range of dynamic problems.},

The data used for creating a surrogate model are essential for the model accuracy and often restricted due to cost and time constraints. Adaptive sampling strategies have been shown to reduce the number of samples needed to create an accurate model. This paper proposes a new sampling strategy for global fit called Gradient and Uncertainty Enhanced Sequential Sampling (GUESS). The acquisition function uses two terms: the predictive posterior uncertainty of the surrogate model for exploration of unseen regions and a weighted approximation of the second and higher-order Taylor expansion values for exploitation. Although various sampling strategies have been proposed so far, the selection of a suitable method is not trivial. Therefore, we compared our proposed strategy to 9 adaptive sampling strategies for global surrogate modeling , based on 26 different 1 to 8-dimensional deterministic benchmarks functions . Results show that GUESS achieved on average the highest sample efficiency compared to other surrogate-based strategies on the tested examples. An ablation study considering the behavior of GUESS in higher dimensions and the importance of surrogate choice is also presented.},

Hence, improving the activation mechanisms in simulation models can provide interesting and useful achievements in this field. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to develop a multi-scale chemo-mechanical material model to consider the active behavior of skeletal muscle in 3D geometries. The model was used to investigate the response of abdominal muscles which represent a challenging scenario due to their complex geometry and anatomical conditions. Realistic muscle geometries and other tissues of the human abdomen, including transverse abdominis (TA), internal oblique (IO), external oblique (EO), rectus abdominis (RA), rectus sheath (RSH), linea alba (LA) and aponeurosis (APO) were considered. Since the geometry of these tissues was obtained from magnetic resonance images, an iterative algorithm was implemented to find the initial stress state that achieve the equilibrium of them with the intra-abdominal pressure. In order to investigate the functionality of the proposed model, the increase of intra-abdominal pressure was calculated during cough in the supine position while the Ca 2 + Ca2+ signal for activating the muscles was set in regard to experimentally recorded electrical activity from previous studies. The amount of intra-abdominal pressure calculated by the model is consistent with reported experimental results. This model can serve as a virtual laboratory to analyze the role of the abdominal wall components in different conditions, such as the performance of meshes used for repairing hernia defects.},

The decoder, in return, converts an element in the latent space back to a weighted graph that represents a finite element solution. As such, the deformed configuration of the shell can be obtained by decoding the predictions in the latent space without running extra finite element simulations . For engineering applications where the shell is often subjected to concentrated loads or a local portion of the shell structure is of particular interest, we use the solutions stored in a graph to reconstruct a smooth manifold where the balance laws are enforced to control the curvature of the shell.

Based on this integrated design approach of IGA/ABM/FCM, shape optimization can be implemented by directly optimizing the control-point coordinates of the NURBS surface in the physical space , while topology optimization could be carried out simultaneously in the parametric domain as easily as for 2D planar structures .

  abstract     = {Stereocorrelation (SC) is a powerful tool for measuring 3D surface deformations in mechanical tests. However, it may suffer from convergence issues for large displacements or speckle changes. A global space–time formulation is proposed herein using Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) as a regularization strategy. The entire image sequence is considered as a whole, and the kinematics is sought as the sum of modes, each of which is a function of space multiplied by a function of time (smoothed over high frequencies if needed). A discriminative benchmark case is chosen to validate this approach: an impact test on glass laminated with PVB layers. This case is difficult for many reasons, particularly because of severe contrast changes due to light reflections occurring at several places. It is shown that the new formulation outperforms classical approaches in robustness and measurement accuracy and provides results within a much shorter processing time.},

  abstract     = {Numerically understanding the dynamic response of soft materials subject to high-speed penetration is crucial for advancing transdermal delivery technologies and analyzing injuries related to ballistics. Due to the complexity in material correspondence models and the difficulty of simulating high-speed impact damage problems using traditional mesh-based numerical techniques , precisely capturing mechanical behaviors of soft materials following ballistic penetration remains challenging. This work proposes a novel hybrid polymer–water model within the peridynamics (PD) framework to accurately clarify the complex damage process of soft materials subject to ballistic penetration. We propose the hybrid interactions comprising of water–water, polymer–polymer, and polymer–water interactions, which embodies the subscale nature of various components and captures the constitutive features of soft materials. A novel decomposition scheme for the deformation gradient is proposed to overcome the limitations in traditional non-ordinary state-based PD where only homogeneous particles are involved in the influence domain, extending the scope of PD theory to mixed material systems. The superior effectiveness and applicability of proposed model are demonstrated through compression, shear, fracture tests. Regarding to the case of high-velocity penetration, both motion profiles of projectile and pressure profiles of gelatin after penetration can be captured in line with physics awareness. The proposed model offers a reasonable and practical representation of soft material from the perspective of a particle-based approach and enhances the potential applications of PD framework for simulating large deformation and dynamic response of soft materials.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop a high-order method for the steady two-phase compressible Navier–Stokes equations closed by generic equations of state, adapted to gas–liquid flows. Our framework relies on the extended discontinuous Galerkin method that is tailored here to a general viscous compressible two-phase configuration. While the imposition of interface jumps conditions is commonly recognized as one of the main difficulties to overcome in the context of geometrically unfitted methods, the setting considered in this work makes this aspect even more challenging. To enforce the non-linear coupling conditions at the interface in a sharp manner, we devise a novel strategy combining multiphase Riemann solvers to handle the convective fluxes across the interface and a weighted stabilized Nitsche’s method for the viscous jumps. The weak enforcement of the jumps conditions along with implicit steady-state iterations and cell-agglomeration procedure make the approach robust to treat arbitrary large contrast phase interface problems governed by stiff models, irrespective of the interface location on the mesh. The study is here restricted to static interfaces. Based on the method of manufactured solution, reference solutions are designed. This allows to conduct a detailed numerical study investigating the influence of several numerical parameters. It is shown that to reach optimal error convergence, the use of pressure-velocity-temperature variables set, appropriate all-speed bulk Riemann solver and Symmetric Interior Penalty method combined with tensorial penalty is necessary.},

At each node of the element, an independent structural theory can be imposed, thus obtaining a node-dependent kinematic model . This method permits to focus on the finite element node . In this way, several combinations of kinematics can be used together. In particular, Taylor-based and Legendre-based expansions have been adopted in this paper to create global–local models without using special coupling methods. The results have been compared with well-established benchmarks from the literature. Compact section and thin-walled beams have been taken into account.

The description of their constitutive modeling is challenging and often time-consuming. Numerical algorithms to automatically calibrate model parameters have provided invaluable tools to help this purpose. However, these are mostly limited to the fitting of a set of pre-defined parameters associated with the model used. In this work, we go a step further by developing a machine learning framework capable of automatically identifying not only such model parameters but also the optimal kinematics and rheological model. To this end, we present a multiphysics model-driven framework that optimally selects the most suitable model kinematics, its rheological components and their arrangement for a given set of experimental curves. Subsequently, it calibrates all the material constants belonging to such a model, independent of its complexity. We demonstrate the versatility and capabilities of this framework with examples on hyperelastic, viscohyperelastic and magneto-viscohyperelastic materials. The present work opens new routes to not only fit model parameters but to identify the constitutive ingredients and underlying mechanisms needed to describe nonlinear responses of soft active materials.},

Specifically, level set functions are adopted to model hierarchal lattice unit cells (LUCs). Then LUCs with different morphology are treated as distinct lattice materials (LMs) and the SF-based hybrid transition strategy is employed to realize smooth transition between multi-morphology LUCs. Besides, Kriging metamodels are constructed to predict the equivalent properties of LUCs efficiently so that the topology optimization of HMMLSs can be achieved with an affordable computational cost. Two kinds of design variables are involved in the topology optimization of HMMLSs, where discrete variables indicate the categories of lattice materials and continuous variables determine the relative densities of lattice microstructures. The proposed KUMMI model can couple the two kinds of design variables dexterously to realize concurrent optimization of relative densities of LUCs, and distribution regions and percentages of different LMs within HMMLSs. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method. Results indicate the optimized HMMLSs exhibit rational distribution of hierarchal multi-morphology LUCs, hence achieving superior structural performance.},

Melt pool geometries are fit with Bézier curves using melt pool dimensions of width, length, and depth obtained from FEM calculations of the thermal process. Assuming a steady state pool geometry, microstructures are simulated incrementally in the heat affected zone in much the same way an additively manufactured material part is built. The approach is computationally tractable as microstructure simulation is only required in the fusion and heat affected zones, thus requiring less computational resources than would be needed if the entire material/part domain was taken into account. Using the model, microstructures are simulated for LENS™ processed stainless steel.

  abstract     = {In many applications in engineering and sciences analysts have simultaneous access to multiple data sources. In such cases, the overall cost of acquiring information can be reduced via data fusion or multi-fidelity (MF) modeling where one leverages inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) sources to reduce the reliance on expensive high-fidelity (HF) data. In this paper, we employ neural networks (NNs) for data fusion in scenarios where data is very scarce and obtained from an arbitrary number of sources with varying levels of fidelity and cost. We introduce a unique NN architecture that converts MF modeling into a nonlinear manifold learning problem. Our NN architecture inversely learns non-trivial (e.g., non-additive and non-hierarchical) biases of the LF sources in an interpretable and visualizable manifold where each data source is encoded via a low-dimensional distribution. This probabilistic manifold quantifies model form uncertainties such that LF sources with small bias are encoded close to the HF source. Additionally, we endow the output of our NN with a parametric distribution not only to quantify aleatoric uncertainties, but also to reformulate the network’s loss function based on strictly proper scoring rules which improve robustness and accuracy on unseen HF data. Through a set of analytic and engineering examples, we demonstrate that our approach provides a high predictive power while quantifying various sources of uncertainty.

  abstract     = {Multifidelity uncertainty quantification (MF UQ) sampling approaches have been shown to significantly reduce the variance of statistical estimators while preserving the bias of the highest-fidelity model, provided that the low-fidelity models are well correlated. However, maintaining a high level of correlation can be challenging, especially when models depend on different input uncertain parameters, which drastically reduces the correlation. Existing MF UQ approaches do not adequately address this issue. In this work, we propose a new sampling strategy that exploits a shared space to improve the correlation among models with dissimilar parameterization. We achieve this by transforming the original coordinates onto an auxiliary manifold using the adaptive basis (AB) method (Tipireddy and Ghanem, 2014). The AB method has two main benefits: (1) it provides an effective tool to identify the low-dimensional manifold on which each model can be represented, and (2) it enables easy transformation of polynomial chaos representations from high- to low-dimensional spaces. This latter feature is used to identify a shared manifold among models without requiring additional evaluations. We present two algorithmic flavors of the new estimator to cover different analysis scenarios, including those with legacy and non-legacy high-fidelity (HF) data. We provide numerical results for analytical examples, a direct field acoustic test, and a finite element model of a nuclear fuel assembly. For all examples, we compare the proposed strategy against both single-fidelity and MF estimators based on the original model parameterization.},

  abstract     = {Predictive simulations are essential for applications ranging from weather forecasting to material design. The veracity of these simulations hinges on their capacity to capture the effective system dynamics. Massively parallel simulations predict the systems dynamics by resolving all spatiotemporal scales, often at a cost that prevents experimentation. On the other hand, reduced order models are fast but often limited by the linearization of the system dynamics and the adopted heuristic closures. We propose a novel systematic framework that bridges large scale simulations and reduced order models to extract and forecast adaptively the effective dynamics (AdaLED) of multiscale systems. AdaLED employs an autoencoder to identify reduced-order representations of the system dynamics and an ensemble of probabilistic recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the latent time-stepper. The framework alternates between the computational solver and the surrogate, accelerating learned dynamics while leaving yet-to-be-learned dynamics regimes to the original solver. AdaLED continuously adapts the surrogate to the new dynamics through online training. The transitions between the surrogate and the computational solver are determined by monitoring the prediction accuracy and uncertainty of the surrogate. The effectiveness of AdaLED is demonstrated on three different systems - a Van der Pol oscillator, a 2D reaction–diffusion equation, and a 2D Navier–Stokes flow past a cylinder for varying Reynolds numbers (400 up to 1200), showcasing its ability to learn effective dynamics online, detect unseen dynamics regimes, and provide net speed-ups. To the best of our knowledge, AdaLED is the first framework that couples a surrogate model with a computational solver to achieve online adaptive learning of effective dynamics. It constitutes a potent tool for applications requiring many computationally expensive simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a class of decoupled first- and second-derivatives models for the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, which were inspired by the Lagrangian Differencing Dynamics (LDD) (Bašić et al., 2018) and (Bašić et al., 2022) and arranged to the SPH framework. Being extensions of existing gradient and Laplacian SPH models , the proposed decoupled models include the cross-derivatives, which are crucial to ensure 2nd-order accuracy. Under the framework of the proposed class of decoupled models, we defined five second-derivative models, here termed, Naïve ( NI ), Block Diagonal ( BD ), SUM , Part Inverse ( PI ), and Full Inverse ( FI ). Among these models, only the NI and BD have equivalences in existing models, while the other three are completely original. Therefore, we believe that, besides the development of new models, this work may provide a standard classification for second-derivative models in SPH. In addition, applying the FI model into the first-derivative model, we propose the first instance of a 2nd-order accurate gradient model in SPH. Then, we demonstrated that the convergence rate of the truncation error decreases the higher the order of the model, and the results were investigated for different particle disorder levels. After that, we applied the proposed derivative models to incompressible fluid flow simulations for validation. The validation includes four famous benchmark tests: the lid-driven cavity, the Kármán vortex behind a cylinder, the rotating square patch, and the dam break problem. The first two tests are used to discuss the accuracy of the spatial derivative models without a free surface , while the third test already includes the effects of the free surface, where particle disorder is more severe. All examples demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our proposed spatial derivatives at 2nd-order accuracy. Since the combination of the FI Laplacian model and the 2nd-order gradient model can satisfy 2nd-order accuracy, we expect this to be the second generation of SPH formulations, which we call SPH(2).},

  abstract     = {This work considers a Stokes flow in a deformable fracture interacting with a linear elastic medium. To this end, we employ a phase-field model to approximate the crack dynamics. Phase-field methods belong to interface-capturing approaches in which the interface is only given by a smeared zone. For multi-domain problems, the accuracy of the coupling conditions is, however, of utmost importance . Here, interface-tracking methods are preferred, since the interface is resolved on mesh edges up to discretisation errors , but it does not depend on the length scale parameter of some smeared zone. The key objective of this work is to construct a robust framework that computes first a crack path via the phase-field method (interface-capturing) and then does an interface-tracking reconstruction. We then discuss several approaches to reconstruct the Eulerian description of the open crack domain. This includes unfitted approaches where a level-set of the crack interface is constructed and an approach where the geometry is re-meshed. Using this reconstructed domain, we can compute the fluid–structure interaction problem between the fluid in the crack and the interacting solid. With the explicit mesh reconstruction of the two domains, we can then use an interface-tracking Arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) discretisation approach for the resulting fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problem. Our algorithmic procedure is realised in one final numerical algorithm and one implementation. We substantiate our approach using several numerical examples based on Sneddon’s benchmark and corresponding extensions to Stokes fluid-filled regimes.},

  abstract     = {Stiffener design plays a crucial role in the lightweight design of stiffened panels. We propose a CAD-integrated stiffener design approach for shells. The problem is partitioned into two steps: (1) generating clear force flow members (FFM) based on the direction of principal stress, and (2) introducing a nodal variable-based sizing-topology optimization for further lightweight design enhancement. Specifically, we generate dense principal stress trajectory families using the iterative tracing technique, and extract FFM through hierarchical clustering. Generating high-precision principal stress trajectories on free-form surfaces is a challenging task. Our method differs from previous approaches in that we employ tensor transformations to convert principal stress directions from the 3D physical space into the 2D parameter space. We then create NURBS curve-based FFM in the 2D parameter space. The NURBS-based free-form deformations (NFFD) technique is utilized to map FFM from the 2D parameter space to the 3D physical space, ensuring FFMs are precise and watertight constructions of geometries. We propose a nodal variable-based sizing-topology method for the lightweight design of FFM. The heights of FFM control points are designated as design variables. Steadily eliminating pseudo-heights is achieved by using the Sigmoid function to penalize the design variables. Moreover, we introduce an NFFD-based isogeometric analysis method for stiffened panels modeled by NFFD-based FFM to realize the integration of design and analysis. The effectiveness and robustness of the presented method are demonstrated through various benchmarks and examples with industrial backgrounds. The proposed optimization framework exhibits strong application potential in the lightweight design of stiffened panels.},

In brief, MSA consists of three optimization stages, including the search for prey (exploration), attack prey (exploitation), and sexual cannibalism. Those operators are simulated using various mathematical models to effectively tackle optimization challenges across diverse search spaces. The performance of MSA is rigorously tested on fifty-two optimization problems and three real-world applications (five engineering design problems, and the parameter estimation problem of photovoltaic modules and fuel cells) to show its versatility and adaptability to different scenarios. To disclose the MSA’s superiority, it is compared to two categories from the rival optimizers: the first category involves well-established and highly-cited optimizers, like Differential evolution; and the second category contains recently-published algorithms, like African Vultures Optimization Algorithm. This comparison is conducted using several performance metrics, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Friedman mean rank to disclose the MSA’s effectiveness and efficiency. The results of this comparison highlight the effectiveness of this new approach and its potential for future optimization applications.

The Northern Goshawk Optimization (NGO) is an effective optimization algorithm, however, its convergence rate is slow and it tends to fall into local optima in some cases. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-strategy Enhanced Northern Goshawk Optimization (MENGO) algorithm, which introduces a novel exploration strategy based on Levy flights to mitigate the risk of getting trapped in local optima. To balance exploration and exploitation, a new nonlinear reduction strategy based on the sine function is proposed. Additionally, a novel exploitation strategy is employed to accelerate the convergence speed while ensuring accuracy. The effectiveness of MENGO is demonstrated by comparing it with 13 advanced algorithms using 23 classical benchmark and 12 CEC2022 test functions in different dimensions. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach in real-world applications, it is studied for nine constrained engineering problems, and the performance is compared with other contender algorithms extracted from the literature. The all experimental results show that MENGO outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and stability, making it a more competitive option.},

  abstract     = {A novel continuum mechanical framework for decoupling the material behavior in in-plane and thickness directions is presented that is motivated by the macroscopic behavior of paper and paperboard . Due to the manufacturing process of these composite materials and the underlying microstructure resulting thereof, the material response is highly anisotropic and can be divided into in-plane and out-of-plane behavior that is independent of each other. This decoupling is mostly incorporated in existing material models by setting the corresponding material parameters to zero which limits the models to an extension to nonlinear problems and is restrictive from a continuum mechanical point of view. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to derive a continuum mechanical framework that captures the in-plane and out-of-plane decoupling in a thermodynamically consistent manner for large deformations . Thus, the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor was split into in-plane and out-of-plane deformations by use of structural tensors that were aligned with the preferential material directions. Therefore, the Helmholtz free energy was formulated in terms of modified invariants of the deformation tensor for in-plane and out-of-plane deformations separately, which lead to a decoupled framework that could easily be modified due to the flexible formulation of the Helmholtz free energy terms. The extension to inelasticity, in particular viscoelasticity here, was straightforward due to the split of the deformation tensor. Finally, the decoupling of the in-plane and out-of-plane response of the presented framework was demonstrated by structural examples for elastic and inelastic material behavior. The presented model incorporates the split into in-plane and out-of-plane behavior in a continuum mechanical manner, and thus, is a flexible constitutive framework for decoupled material responses that can easily be adjusted to different material behavior.},

  abstract     = {Numerical prediction of ductile tearing during a car crash is necessary to ensure the structural integrity of the vehicle. Recently, encouraging results were obtained by Davaze et al., (2021) with a non-local damage approach, compatible with dynamic explicit simulations and preserving parallel computation: an implicit gradient model enabled to reproduce experimental results with DP450 steel sheets with 3D solid elements. However, in the automotive industry, thin sheets of metals are mostly modeled with shell elements for computation time efficiency. Shell elements have a more complex formulation: their kinematic description is enriched accounting for displacements but also rotations, leading to two different strain contributions: membrane strain and bending strain. The transverse strain is computed independently in a post-processing step from local internal variables with a zero normal stress assumption. This formulation is known to lead to strain localization after the onset of necking, while this is not the case with 3D solid elements. The problem is even more challenging when considering shells in association with a softening material accounting for damage as this also leads to strong mesh dependency, as with 3D solid elements. This complex problem is solved using non-local formulations for the material behavior. The proposed solution accounts for both in-plane and in-thickness damage gradients. It consists of a two-step regularization procedure introducing nested wire elements in the shell thickness. Using non-local variables to evaluate the transverse strain enables to obtain a continuous spatial distribution for strains, in agreement with the 3D solid case. An updated Lagrangian formulation is used to account for large strains. The performance of the strategy is demonstrated in three test cases, with a comparison with an experimental result for one of them. The results obtained following the proposed strategy lead are equivalent to the ones obtained with the non-local method proposed by Davaze et al., (2021) and are thus consistent with the experimental data.},

This paper presents an improved framework of the immersed boundary method (IBM)-based fully resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM), with an emphasis on irregular-shaped particles and the implications to particle–fluid interactions. The improved CFD-DEM framework is featured by two novel enhancements with signed distance field (SDF). First, an SDF-based formulation is employed to enable handling of granular particles with arbitrary shapes in DEM robustly and efficiently. Second, the IBM is modified to be consistent with SDF to fully resolve fluid–particle interactions in the presence of non-spherical particles. Such treatments leverage SDF as a generic interface to furnish a new SDF-CFD-DEM framework for universal modeling of arbitrarily shaped particles interacting with multiphase fluids with desired resolutions. Exemplified particle shape models include super-quadrics, spherical harmonics, polyhedron and level set, and new shape models can be flexibly developed by implementing the unified SDF-based shape interface. The proposed SDF-CFD-DEM is validated and showcased with examples including particle settling, drafting–kissing–tumbling, immersed granular collapse, and mudflow. The results demonstrate the good accuracy and robustness of the SDF-CFD-DEM and its potential for efficient computational modeling of multiphase granular flows involving granular particles with arbitrary shapes.},

This paper proposes an enhanced-LOOCV method that incorporates hyperparameters from the Kriging model based on the complete training dataset (i.e., the complete Kriging model) into the LOOCV error calculation. By keeping the model hyperparameters in LOOCV consistent with the complete Kriging model, it reduces the number of hyperparameter optimizations and significantly increases the accuracy and efficiency of the LOOCV process. Additionally, a decremental calculation is proposed to reduce the computational costs of the correlation matrix inversion without sacrificing accuracy, resulting in an improved time complexity of the traditional LOOCV from O ( n 4 ) O(n4) to O ( n 3 ) O(n3) . Experimental results with thirty test functions verify that the enhanced-LOOCV has better estimation performance than the Kriging model with significantly higher efficiency compared to the traditional LOOCV. Numerical experiments and an engineering case in optimization demonstrate that the enhanced-LOOCV can reduce the number of samples needed for infilling in the Kriging model, and it is more suitable for expensive optimizations in engineering.},

  abstract     = {Multiferroic materials, which simultaneously possess piezomagnetic, piezoelectric, and electromagnetic coupling effects, have a wide range of applications in various fields. Multiferroic materials are generally brittle with low fracture toughness , and accurate prediction of the fracture behaviors of multiferroics is challenging. In this work, a phase field model for brittle fracture in multiferroic materials is developed with the help of the Hamilton principle . In light of the second law of thermodynamics , the constitutive equations are derived in the context of the phase field method. The present theoretical framework unifies two classical phase field models and four combinations of the electric and magnetic boundary conditions. The residual controlled staggered algorithm, which enjoys a higher accuracy and lower computational cost, is extended to the fracture problems in the context of magneto-electro-elasticity. Systematic numerical simulations are performed in both 2D and 3D cases. The influences of the external magnetic field , electric field , and electric and magnetic boundary conditions on fracture behaviors of multiferroic materials are studied in detail. The applied magnetic field may not only accelerate or delay the fracture, but also influence the crack path. The present work is beneficial to assess the safety of multiferroic-based devices in engineering applications .},

  abstract     = {Double–double (DD) laminates are a new type of composite layups, which can achieve different structural properties by adjusting two sets of balanced fiber orientations. The combination of topology optimization and DD laminates can further enhance the advantages of composite materials as lightweight designs. Currently, most topology optimizations use compliance as the target. Existing optimization studies implementing stress control are mostly for isotropic materials. It is a great challenge to implement stress control during topology optimization of composite laminates, because the layer-wisely distributed stress brings a lot of design constraints and leads to many local optima . In this paper, we propose a nested p-norm method that integrates the Tsai–Hill failure criterion indexes of different elements in different layers into one design response, thus realizing the effective stress control for topology optimization of laminated structures . There are two levels of p-norm nested in the process: the inner p-norm approximates the maximum failure index of all the layers for one element, and the outer p-norm approximates the maximum failure index for all elements. The nested p-norm scheme is implemented under the framework of the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) model, which is extended to DD laminates by interpolating the stiffness matrix of composites. Then, the optimization model is established by minimizing the maximum Tsai–Hill failure index using the function formulated by the proposed nested p-norm method under the constraint of the structural volume fraction and compliance. Next, stress sensitivities are calculated using the adjoint method. It is noticeable that the sensitivity with respect to the filtered projection density is separately calculated to improve the computational efficiency. Finally, typical examples of topology optimization with stress singularity such as an L-shaped bracket, a crack problem, a corbel structure, and an antenna support bracket are given. It is validated that the proposed nested p-norm method can effectively and efficiently reduce the stress concentration of laminate structures compared with the methods using single p-norm and layer-wise p-norm. Additionally, the optimization results show that the DD laminate has similar optimized configurations and optimization effects as those of the conventional Quad laminate with the equivalent stiffness .},

  abstract     = {The numerical implementation of advanced plastic damage models has been challenging due to the diverse computational difficulties caused by material nonlinearity . In this study, firstly, a plastic damage model is developed by a nonsmoothed Mohr–Coulomb yield criterion. The nonorthogonal flow rule without plastic potential function is employed to describe the dilatancy behavior of concrete. The stiffness degradation is considered through two tensile and compressive damage variables. Subsequently, an implicit stress update algorithm incorporating several advanced numerical methods is proposed to tackle difficulties arising in the numerical calculation of the plastic damage model. In the model implementation, the Mohr–Coulomb yield function with corners is replaced by a single smooth expression to ensure the stability of the numerical calculation. A line search method is used to solve nonlinear systems of integral stress equations to obtain better convergence than Newton method . The complex step derivative approximation is used to evaluate the consistent tangent operator to provide quadratic convergence speed of the global equilibrium iterations, thus avoiding tedious analytical derivative operations. The integral nonlocal method is also used to regularize the finite element solution. At the material point scale, the ability of the proposed model to describe the complex mechanical behavior of concrete is verified by utilizing nine sets of monotonic and cyclic loading and unloading tests. Finally, the algorithm and model’s performance is well tested by the failure analysis of five numerical examples .

  abstract     = {Topology optimization is a powerful tool utilized in various fields for structural design. However, its application has primarily been restricted to static or passively moving objects, mainly focusing on hard materials with limited deformations and contact capabilities. Designing soft and actively moving objects, such as soft robots equipped with actuators, poses challenges due to simulating dynamics problems involving large deformations and intricate contact interactions. Moreover, the optimal structure depends on the object’s motion, necessitating a simultaneous design approach. To address these challenges, we propose “4D topology optimization,” an extension of density-based topology optimization that incorporates the time dimension . This enables the simultaneous optimization of both the structure and self-actuation of soft bodies for specific dynamic tasks. Our method utilizes multi-indexed and hierarchized density variables distributed over the spatiotemporal design domain, representing the material layout, actuator layout, and time-varying actuation . These variables are efficiently optimized using gradient-based methods. Forward and backward simulations of soft bodies are done using the material point method , a Lagrangian–Eulerian hybrid approach, implemented on a recent automatic differentiation framework. We present several numerical examples of self-actuating soft body designs aimed at achieving locomotion, posture control, and rotation tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully designing soft bodies with complex structures and biomimetic movements, benefiting from its high degree of design freedom.},

Thus, data is not only expected to enable diagnosis, but also to update the nominal model to incorporate the effects of localized damage, from data assimilation. Such a data-driven model enrichment can be performed by using different routes.

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) holds immense potential for rapidly producing complexly-shaped composite components and structures. However, AM is also well known for producing composites of lesser quality than more traditional manufacturing methods. Hence, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and/or embedded sensing (i.e. integrated NDE) is important for mitigating failures in these materials. Unfortunately, many prevailing NDE modalities are ill-suited for complex AM-produced shapes or are not amenable to embedded sensing. To overcome this limitation, we herein study electrical impedance tomography (EIT) as a means of detecting and localizing damage in a complexly-shaped carbon fiber composite truss structure produced by Impossible Objects. Unlike the current state of the art which is overly fixated on applying EIT to flat composite plates not representative of real components and structures, this work shows that EIT can indeed adeptly find damages in complex shapes. We also present a novel mixed smoothness + conditionally Gaussian regularization formulation for the EIT inverse problem that shows marked improvement over the traditionally used smoothness-only prior. Combined, these two contributions are an important step in translating EIT into practice for AM composites.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been rapidly developed for solving partial differential equations . The E xact Dirichlet boundary condition P hysics- i nformed N eural N etwork (EPINN) is proposed to achieve efficient simulation of solid mechanics problems based on the principle of least work with notably reduced training time. There are five major building features in the EPINN framework. First, for the 1D solid mechanics problem, the neural networks are formulated to exactly replicate the shape function of linear or quadratic truss elements. Second, for 2D and 3D problems, the tensor decomposition was adopted to build the solution field without the need of generating the finite element mesh of complicated structures to reduce the number of trainable weights in the PINN framework. Third, the principle of least work was adopted to formulate the loss function. Fourth, the exact Dirichlet boundary condition (i.e., displacement boundary condition) was implemented. Finally, the meshless finite difference (MFD) was adopted to calculate gradient information efficiently. By minimizing the total energy of the system, the loss function is selected to be the same as the total work of the system, which is the total strain energy minus the external work done on the Neumann boundary conditions (i.e., force boundary conditions). The exact Dirichlet boundary condition was implemented as a hard constraint compared to the soft constraint (i.e., added as additional terms in the loss function), which exactly meets the requirement of the principle of least work. The EPINN framework is implemented in the Nvidia Modulus platform and GPU-based supercomputer and has achieved notably reduced training time compared to the conventional PINN framework for solid mechanics problems. Typical numerical examples are presented. The convergence of EPINN is reported and the training time of EPINN is compared to conventional PINN architecture and finite element solvers. Compared to conventional PINN architecture , EPINN achieved a speedup of more than 13 times for 1D problems and more than 126 times for 3D problems. The simulation results show that EPINN can even reach the convergence speed of finite element software. In addition, the prospective implementations of the proposed EPINN framework in solid mechanics are proposed, including nonlinear time-dependent simulation and super-resolution network.},

Model validation usually involves the comparison of experimental data (outputs from the system of interest) and model predictions, both obtained at a specific validation scenario. The design of this validation experiment should be directly relevant to the objective of the model, that of predicting a quantity of interest at a prediction scenario. In this paper, we address two specific issues arising when designing validation experiments. The first issue consists in determining an appropriate validation scenario in cases where the prediction scenario cannot be carried out in a controlled environment. The second issue concerns the selection of observations when the quantity of interest cannot be readily observed. The proposed methodology involves the computation of influence matrices that characterize the response surface of given model functionals. Minimization of the distance between influence matrices allows one to select a validation experiment most representative of the prediction scenario. We illustrate our approach on two numerical examples. The first example considers the validation of a simple model based on an ordinary differential equation governing an object in free fall to put in evidence the importance of the choice of the validation experiment. The second numerical experiment focuses on the transport of a pollutant and demonstrates the impact that the choice of the quantity of interest has on the validation experiment to be performed.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural network provides an effective way to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) where physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a typical representative of which the outputs are constrained to approximate the solution of PDEs. However, the PINN method still fails to learn some solutions of particular properties and the reasons of failure are still unclear. In this paper, we employ both the loss landscape of the final optimization parameters of network and the imbalance of back-propagation gradient during the training to analyze why the PINN method fails to learn large amplitude solution and high-frequency solution of the Klein–Gordon equation. Consequently, we find that the PDE-based soft constraints in the loss function take a major responsibility for the failures of the PINN method in predicting such types of solutions. To remedy the pathologies we remove the PDE-based soft constraints in the loss function and calibrate a supervised learning model for predicting such types of particular solutions for a class of PDEs which cannot be learned by the PINN method and the two weight-related improved PINN methods. Specifically, if the governing PDEs under study admit a Lie symmetry group and the unique solution of the corresponding initial boundary problem is obtained via the symmetry group, we utilize the symmetry group to generate labeled data in the interior domain of PDEs from the discrete points on the known initial and boundary conditions. Then, with the labeled data we leverage the supervised learning model to predict the large amplitude solution and the high-frequency solution of the Klein–Gordon equation on a rectangular domain by means of a space–time translation group and a singular solution of the heat equation on a moving boundary domain with a physical symmetry group. Numerical experiments confirm the good performances of the proposed supervised learning method.},

In the framework of phase-field method, a ternary Cahn–Hilliard model is modified by adding a term reflecting the wetting condition of liquid phase on the liquid–solid interface. The contact angle dynamics can be implicitly achieved by solving the phase-field equations and the explicit treatment on liquid–solid boundary is absent. Therefore, various discretization methods in space can be naturally adopted. To update the creeping flows in arbitrary domains, we herein consider the incompressible Darcy equations with a penalty term. The coupled binary fluid system theoretically satisfies the energy dissipation law with respect to a total energy functional. An energy dissipation-preserving time-marching scheme is constructed based on the auxiliary variable approach. Furthermore, a simple correction technique is utilized to improve the consistency between original and numerical values . We analytically prove that the proposed scheme still satisfies the energy law in its discrete version. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy, consistent stability, and capability of our method.},

  abstract     = {The first-order reliability method (FORM) is commonly used in the field of structural reliability analysis , which transforms the reliability analysis problem into the solution of an optimization problem with equality constraint. However, when the limit state functions (LSFs) in mechanical and engineering problems are complex, particularly for implicit partial differential equations (PDEs), FORM encounters computation difficulty and incurs unbearable computational effort . In this study, the physics-informed neural network (PINN), which is a new branch of deep learning technology for addressing forward and inverse problems with PDEs, is applied as a black-box solution tool. For LSFs with implicit PDE expressions, PINN-FORM is constructed by combining PINN with FORM, which can avoid the calculation of the real structure response. Moreover, a loss function model with an optimization target item is established. Then, an adaptive weight strategy, which can balance the interplay between different parts of the loss function, is suggested to enhance the predictive accuracy . To demonstrate the effectiveness of PINN-FORM, five benchmark examples with LSFs expressed by implicit PDEs, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, and steady state and transient state problems are tested. The results illustrate the proposed PINN-FORM not only is very accurate, but also can simultaneously predict the solutions of PDEs and reliability index within a single training process.},

  abstract     = {In density-based topology optimization , the design space is parameterized by assigning a density to each element that discretizes the domain. However, establishing a limit on the maximum attainable thickness of the structural components in this framework is non-trivial. To control the thickness, knowledge of both the central axis of the components and the elements that reside beyond a specified thickness is required for penalizing the correct design variables. This study proposes a geometric constraint-based method for exerting control over the maximum allowable thickness of the structural members in topology optimization. The central axis of the structural components is traced by identifying the inflection points of the density distribution, where the density is locally maximum. By computing the angle of the spatial gradient of the density distribution and taking their divergence, the inflection points can be reliably located in all regions of the design domain. Based on geometric information , domains of elements beyond the specified thickness from the inflection points are constructed. Then, a constraint is defined to penalize material formation only in these elements. As a result, control over the maximum thickness of the structural components can be achieved during topology optimization. The framework can also be utilized to regulate the minimum thickness of the structural components by enforcing material formation within a specified thickness. Special measures are implemented to enable the formation of junction regions within the domain while preserving the imposed thickness constraint. The proposed method is applied to topology optimization of minimum compliance and heat conduction problems to demonstrate its applicability.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we examine a numerical phase-field fracture framework in which the crack irreversibility constraint is treated with a primal–dual active set method and a linearization is used in the degradation function to enhance the numerical stability . The first goal is to carefully derive from a complementarity system our primal–dual active set formulation, which has been used in the literature in numerous studies, but for phase-field fracture without its detailed mathematical derivation yet. Based on the latter, we formulate a modified combined active-set Newton approach that significantly reduces the computational cost in comparison to comparable prior algorithms for quasi-monolithic settings. For many practical problems, Newton converges fast, but active set needs many iterations, for which three different efficiency improvements are suggested in this paper. Afterwards, we design an iteration on the linearization in order to iterate the problem to the monolithic limit. Our new algorithms are implemented in the programming framework pfm-cracks from Heister and Wick (2020). In the numerical examples , we conduct performance studies and investigate efficiency enhancements. The main emphasis is on the cost complexity by keeping the accuracy of numerical solutions and goal functionals. Our algorithmic suggestions are substantiated with the help of several benchmarks in two and three spatial dimensions. Therein, predictor–corrector adaptivity and parallel performance studies are explored as well.},

  abstract     = {Recently, consistent meshfree particle methods have been intensively studied. It has been pointed out that numerical inaccuracy or instability could easily occur with incomplete or biased neighbor support. This study proposes a new meshfree particle method called the compact moving particle semi-implicit (CMPS) method to decrease the condition number . In the proposed CMPS, the first-order and second-order derivatives are discretized separately, enhancing the numerical stability significantly. By adopting a small dilation parameter of the compact support, the CMPS can remarkably improve accuracy and reduce computational costs. Formulations for zeroth-order, first-order, and second-order derivatives are derived, and various boundary conditions, e.g., Dirichlet and Neumann, are discussed. In order to better deal with complex free-surface flows using the CMPS, some new numerical techniques , i.e., optimized regularization and reconstructed particle shifting schemes, are also developed. Furthermore, the surface fitting method is extended to address the surface tension. A convergence study is conducted in complex geometry to verify the stability, accuracy, and efficiency of the CMPS. Then, second-order accuracy is confirmed using the Taylor–Green vortex problem. After that, numerical examples concerning various free-surface flows, including square patch, hydrostatic pressure, dam break, droplet oscillation, and droplet coalescence, are calculated to demonstrate the potential of the CMPS.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a deep learning based methodology for both remote sensing and design of acoustic scatterers . The ability to determine the shape of a scatterer, either in the context of material design or sensing, plays a critical role in many practical engineering problems. This class of inverse problems is extremely challenging due to their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and ill-posed nature. To overcome these technical hurdles, we introduce a geometric regularization approach for deep neural networks (DNN) based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) and capable of predicting complex 2D scatterer geometries in a parsimonious dimensional representation. Then, this geometric regularization is combined with physics-embedded learning and integrated within a robust convolutional autoencoder (CAE) architecture to accurately predict the shape of 2D scatterers in the context of identification and inverse design problems. An extensive numerical study is presented in order to showcase the remarkable ability of this approach to handle complex scatterer geometries while generating physically-consistent acoustic fields. The study also assesses and contrasts the role played by the (weakly) embedded physics in the convergence of the DNN predictions to a physically consistent inverse design.},

  abstract     = {The properties of granular materials depend strongly on the shapes of their individual constituent particles or granules. Nonetheless, incorporating the effects of non-spherical or complex particle shapes into existing modelling frameworks, such as the discrete element method (DEM), has remained challenging. In this work, we propose the volume-interaction level set DEM (VLS-DEM) approach for carrying out physically accurate simulations of particles with arbitrary geometries. VLS-DEM builds upon level set DEM (LS-DEM), both of which implicitly define the geometry of a particle through a discrete signed distance function. However, instead of using surface nodes to compute the interparticle forces, VLS-DEM uses the overlap volume as computed by an Octree integration algorithm. This addresses some of the shortcomings of LS-DEM in terms of the accuracy and precision of the shape description and opens up the possibility for bottom-up parametrisation methods. A number of tests were performed to compare VLS-DEM with regular DEM, LS-DEM, and analytical models. VLS-DEM is shown to give physically accurate results, comparable to analytical theory, even for highly complex systems such as those with concave interlocked particles.},

In the proposed coupling method, the FEM and LBM are strongly coupled through the implicit Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) ensuring exactly the no-slip condition. Comparing with volumetric FEMs, the adopted corotational beam formulation can not only allow for large structural displacements, but also help improve the computational efficiency, as the solid structures for energy harvesting devices are usually slender under large motion. The piezoelectric effects are incorporated into the corotational beam dynamics with the help of the virtual work principle. The FEM, LBM and PEM are coupled together in a strong way in the sense that the time integrations are carried out without staggered communications.

Nevertheless, DC based on fourth-order Legendre polynomials provided overall better results, especially regarding dynamics integration accuracy compared to DMS based on a fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. Furthermore, expressing the rigid-body constraints using inverse dynamics was usually faster than forward dynamics. DC with dynamic constraints based on inverse dynamics converged to better and less variable solutions. We recommend starting with this transcription to solve OCPs but keep testing other methods.},

Despite their success, PROMs can be susceptible to inaccuracies, even instabilities, due to the improper accounting of the interaction between the resolved and unresolved scales of the multiscale system (known as the closure problem). In the current work, we interpret closure as a multifidelity problem and use a multifidelity deep operator network (DeepONet) framework to address it. In addition, to enhance the stability and accuracy of the multifidelity-based closure, we employ the recently developed “in-the-loop” training approach from the literature on coupling physics and machine learning models. The resulting approach is tested on shock advection for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation and vortex merging using the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations. The numerical experiments show significant improvement of the predictive ability of the closure-corrected PROM over the un-corrected one both in the interpolative and the extrapolative regimes.},

In this paper, we enhance the rigor and performance of I-FENN by focusing on two crucial aspects of its PINN component: (a) the error convergence analysis and (b) the hyperparameter-performance relationship. Guided by the available theoretical formulations in the field, we introduce a systematic numerical approach based on a novel set of holistic performance metrics to answer both objectives. In the first objective, we explore in detail the convergence of the PINN training error and the global error against the network size and the training sample size. We demonstrate a consistent converging behavior of the two error types for any investigated combination of network complexity, dataset size and choice of hyperparameters, which empirically proves the conformance of the PINN setup and implementation to the available convergence theories. In the second objective, we establish an a-priori knowledge of the hyperparameters which favor higher predictive accuracy, lower computational effort, and the least chances of arriving at trivial solutions. The analysis leads to several outcomes that contribute to the better performance of I-FENN, and fills a long-standing gap in the PINN literature with regards to the numerical convergence of the network errors while accounting for commonly used optimizers (Adam and L-BFGS). The proposed analysis method can be directly extended to other ML applications in science and engineering. The code and data utilized in the analysis are posted publicly to aid the reproduction and extension of this research.},

Here two different possible approaches, based respectively on Moving Least Square (MLS) and on convective fluxes have been adopted to embed the IIPS formulation in an ALE-SPH scheme. The theoretical second-order convergence rate has been achieved for the Taylor–Green flow at Reynolds number R e = 100 Re=100 . Results obtained with the proposed numerical scheme for the Moving box and the Impinging jet test cases confirm that the accuracy is significantly improved, with respect to existing quasi-Lagrangian ALE-SPH schemes.},

Besides the velocity, magnetic field and a Lagrange multiplier associated to the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field , a convenient translation of the velocity gradient and the pseudostress tensor are introduced as further unknowns. As a consequence, we obtain a five-field Banach spaces-based mixed variational formulation , where the aforementioned variables are the main unknowns of the system. The resulting mixed scheme is then written equivalently as a fixed-point equation, so that the well-known Banach theorem , combined with classical results on nonlinear monotone operators and a sufficiently small data assumption, are applied to prove the unique solvability of the continuous and discrete systems. In particular, the analysis of the discrete scheme requires a quasi-uniformity assumption on mesh. The finite element discretization involves Raviart–Thomas elements of order k ≥ 0 k≥0 for the pseudostress tensor, discontinuous piecewise polynomial elements of degree k k for the velocity and the translation of the velocity gradient , Nédélec elements of degree k k for the magnetic field and Lagrange elements of degree k + 1 k+1 for the associated Lagrange multiplier . Stability, convergence, and optimal a priori error estimates for the associated Galerkin scheme are obtained. Numerical tests illustrate the theoretical results.},

To this end, a numerical method is proposed that takes into account one-sided contact (Signorini condition) and impact phenomena together with plasticity in a monolithic solver, while accounting for the non-smooth character of the dynamics. The formulation of the plasticity and the contact laws are based on inclusions into normal cones of convex sets , or equivalently, variational inequalities following the pioneering work of Moreau (1974) and Halphen and Nguyen (1975), who introduced the assumptions of normal dissipation and of generalized standard materials (GSM) in the framework of associated plasticity with strain hardening. The proposed time–stepping method is an extension of the Jean and Moreau (1987) scheme for nonsmooth dynamics. The discrete energy balance shows that spurious numerical damping can be suppressed and that the scheme is in practice unconditionally stable. Furthermore, the finite-dimensional variational inequality at each time–step is well–posed and can be solved by optimization methods for convex quadratic programs , providing an interesting alternative to the return mapping algorithm coupled with a dedicated frictional contact method. The paper is completed by illustrative numerical examples of impacts on steel structures consisting of beams.},

High-fidelity numerical simulations constitute the backbone of engineering design, providing insight into the performance of complex systems. However, large-scale, dynamic, non-linear models require significant computational resources and are prohibitive for real-time digital twin applications. To this end, reduced order models (ROMs) are employed, to approximate the high-fidelity solutions while accurately capturing the dominant aspects of the physical behavior. The present work proposes a new machine learning (ML) platform for the development of ROMs to handle large-scale numerical problems dealing with transient nonlinear partial differential equations . Our framework, named as FastSVD-ML-ROM , utilizes (i) a singular value decomposition (SVD) update methodology, to compute a linear subspace of the multi-fidelity solutions during the simulation process, (ii) convolutional autoencoders for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, (iii) feed-forward neural networks to map the input parameters to the latent spaces, and (iv) long–short term memory networks to predict and forecast the dynamics of parametric solutions. The efficiency of the FastSVD-ML-ROM framework is demonstrated for a 2D linear convection–diffusion benchmark, the problem of fluid flow around a cylinder, the 2D lid-driven cavity problem at high Reynolds numbers , and the 3D blood flow inside an arterial segment. The accuracy of the reconstructed results indicates the robustness of the proposed approach.},

Additionally, the spatial discretization relies on locally refined non-uniform rational B-splines (LR NURBS) with a local refinement scheme, which utilizes a prescribed threshold of the phase-field variable as an error indicator.

  abstract     = {The a posteriori error analysis of a reduced basis (RB) method may certify the accuracy of an RB solution without the truth finite element (FE) solution. However, the error theory necessitates a numerically expensive stability factor such as coercivity or an inf–sup factor. Consequently, we perforce resort to the successive constraint method (SCM) to achieve a stability lower bound for a rigorous albeit rapid RB analysis. As an alternative, we propose an adaptive Gaussian process (AGP) to produce a stability lower bound for the rigorous, rapid, and sharp estimation of an RB solution error . We utilize linear elastostatic and Helmholtz acoustic problems with geometric parameterization to compare the AGP with the SCM for a numerical investigation. The results show that the AGP significantly surpasses the SCM. This is because the a posteriori error estimation of an RB solution obtained with the AGP is sharper and faster than that obtained with the SCM by factors of at least 1 0 3 103 and 10, respectively. With regard to a rigorous error estimation, the AGP succeeds for the linear elastostatic problem but fails for the Helmholtz acoustic problem when an RB size is one at parameter values incurring only resonance. Otherwise, it manages to attain a rigorous error estimation. To conclude, the AGP is observed to be heuristically more practical than the SCM for a certified RB analysis. This research may considerably aid a static condensation RB element (scRBE) method because the technique numerously repeats the a posteriori error estimation of a reduced bubble function for the a posteriori error estimation of an scRBE solution.},

  abstract     = {With increasing complexity of engineering problems, various traditional reliability analysis methods are facing rising challenges in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. Surrogate models , especially Kriging model , have received growing attention and been widely used in reliability analyses by the virtue of their advantages for achieving high computational efficiency and ensuring high numerical accuracy. Nevertheless, there have been still two significant problems in the Kriging model-assisted reliability analyses due to the absence of prior knowledge: i.e. (1) the size of candidate sample pool tends to be quite large in order to ensure prediction of a convergent failure probability ; and (2) local prediction accuracy of limiting state surface by Kriging model is generally excessive. These above two issues can often result in high computational cost for Kriging-based reliability analyses. To enhance computational efficiency, a new method that combines adaptive Kriging and n -hypersphere rings, named an AK-HR n n method, is proposed in this study. First, the n -hypersphere rings, which can update its position and radius adaptively, is adopted to divide the design space into potential safety domains and potential failure domains. Second, these potential failure domains are used as the sampling domains for implementing importance sampling method to generate a suitably-sized candidate sample pool. Third, a novel learning function is presented to enrich the design of experiment (DoE), which avoids excessive local prediction accuracy of Kriging models by establishing the rejection domains. Finally, the efficiency and robustness of AK-HR n n is compared with other Kriging-based reliability analysis methods through four illustrative numerical examples and one 6-DOF industrial robot case study . Comparison shows that the proposed AK-HR n n method has high efficiency and robustness to solve complex reliability analysis problems.},

  abstract     = {We present a structure-preserving scheme based on a recently-proposed mixed formulation for incompressible hyperelasticity formulated in principal stretches. Although there exist several different Hamiltonians introduced for quasi-incompressible elastodynamics based on different multifield variational formulations , there is not much study on the fully incompressible materials in the literature. The adopted mixed formulation can be viewed as a finite-strain generalization of Herrmann variational formulation, and it naturally provides a new Hamiltonian for fully incompressible elastodynamics. Invoking the discrete gradient and scaled mid-point formulas, we are able to design fully-discrete schemes that preserve the Hamiltonian and momenta. Our analysis and numerical evidence also reveal that the scaled mid-point formula is non-robust numerically. The generalized Taylor–Hood element based on the spline technology conveniently provides a higher-order, robust, and inf-sup stable spatial discretization option for finite strain analysis. To enhance the element performance in volume conservation, the grad-div stabilization, a technique initially developed in computational fluid dynamics , is introduced here for elastodynamics. It is shown that the stabilization term does not impose additional restrictions for the algorithmic stress to respect the invariants, leading to an energy-decaying and momentum-conserving fully discrete scheme. A set of numerical examples is provided to justify the claimed properties. The grad-div stabilization is found to enhance the discrete mass conservation effectively. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional algorithms based on Cardano’s formula and perturbation techniques , the spectral decomposition algorithm developed by Scherzinger and Dohrmann is robust and accurate to ensure the discrete conservation laws and is thus recommended for stretch-based material modeling.},

In contrast to traditional numerical integration methods, PI defines a projection operator based on a weighted norm to systematically approximate meshfree shape functions in an appropriate and consistent function space. Then a substitute function space is established by utilizing projected shape functions as a basis, and Galerkin weak form is approximately calculated by substituting the projected shape functions for the original meshfree shape functions. Owing to the projection consistency of the projection operator, the projected shape functions can still meet consistent conditions. For convenient implementations, the triangular finite element space is selected to approximate meshfree shape functions and the weight function in the weighted norm is carefully chosen to simplify the projection operator in this paper. Arbitrary order integration constraint conditions can be easily met by utilizing the corresponding order triangular finite element shape functions with low order Gauss quadrature rules, which means the optimal convergence rate can be obtained. A series of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed method’s efficiency and superior convergence performance.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new family of high order accurate semi-implicit schemes for the solution of nonlinear time-dependent systems of partial differential equations (PDE) on unstructured polygonal meshes. The time discretization is based on a splitting between explicit and implicit terms that may arise either from the multi-scale nature of the governing equations, which involve both slow and fast scales, or in the context of projection methods, where the numerical solution is projected onto the physically meaningful solution manifold. We propose to use a high order finite volume (FV) scheme for the explicit terms, hence ensuring conservation property and robustness across shock waves, while the virtual element method (VEM) is employed to deal with the discretization of the implicit terms, which typically requires an elliptic problem to be solved. The numerical solution is then transferred via suitable L 2 2 projection operators from the FV to the VEM solution space and vice-versa. High order time accuracy is then achieved using the semi-implicit IMEX Runge–Kutta schemes, and the novel schemes are proven to be asymptotic preserving (AP) and well-balanced (WB). As representative models, we choose the shallow water equations (SWE), thus handling multiple time scales characterized by a different Froude number, and the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (INS), which are solved at the aid of a projection method to satisfy the solenoidal constraint of the velocity field. Furthermore, an implicit discretization for the viscous terms is also devised for the INS model, which is based on the VEM technique. Consequently, the CFL-type stability condition on the maximum admissible time step is based only on the fluid velocity and not on the celerity nor on the viscous eigenvalues. A large suite of test cases demonstrates the accuracy and the capabilities of the new family of schemes to solve relevant benchmarks in the field of incompressible fluids.},

  abstract     = {The physics-informed neural network (PINN) has received much attention in the field of partial differential equation (PDE) solving due to its adaptability to different governing equations. Boundary dependent PINN (BDPINN) has much higher precision than PINN, but requires to manually design complex form of a trial function to fit boundary conditions (BCs). In this paper, an automatic boundary fitting framework is introduced into BDPINN for the automatic construction of a trial function satisfying BCs to solve PDE problems with complex geometry , and radial basis function (RBF) and neural network function (NNF) are used to construct boundary fitting functions, respectively. The proposed automatic boundary fitting framework can successfully construct a trial function of BDPINN for common BCs and their combinations, including initial conditions, Dirichlet BCs , symmetric BCs and periodic BCs. With this framework, BDPINN is applied in to 4 cases. The corresponding governing equations include diffusion, advection , and advection–diffusion equations, with dimensions ranging from 2D to 4D, and the corresponding geometric boundaries include random, irregular, and distorted boundaries. The calculation results show that the BDPINN with this framework succeeds in various governing equations, in various dimensions, and in various BCs with high accuracy, and that BDPINN with RBF is more accurate than that with NNF.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven methods and algorithms show immense potential for future advancements in the modeling and simulation of complex mechanical systems. However, in order to actually exploit this potential, the methods must be extended to consider inelastic and path-dependent material behavior—a step that appears more complex than in conventional material modeling, where this can be achieved with the help of additional, mostly internal, history variables. The effect of such history variables must thereby be transferred to the data-driven framework. This is achieved in the present paper by defining an appropriate history surrogate as well as a so-called propagator. The history surrogate contains tangible quantities that represent the backward path–uniquely in the ideal case–and enrich the conventional database entries of matching pairs of stresses and strains. The propagator defines the update of the history surrogate from one discrete time step to another. As a major advantage, the newly developed method retains the structures of the data-driven algorithm for elastic material behavior and therefore allows a rather straightforward extension of preexisting program codes. Thus, for instance, heterogeneous problems in which purely elastic and elastoplastic materials are present can be solved without further significant coding effort. Furthermore, several material classes covering different inelastic phenomena such as plasticity with isotropic and kinematic hardening as well as phase transformations in shape memory alloys can be considered in our framework.},

  abstract     = {The total Lagrangian material point method (TLMPM) is a recent modification to the conventional material point method (MPM). It poses the weak form in the undeformed configuration, and has shown great potential in solid mechanics applications because it seamlessly eliminates the so-called cell-crossing instability and overcomes numerical fracture. Despite its promise, it has not been widely adopted by the MPM community yet, and only a handful of research groups have employed it. At the same time, due to TLMPM’s recent appearance, there are open research questions, such as the subject of near-incompressibility that has not been thoroughly studied within its context . In this paper we attempt to strengthen TLMPM’s position in the field by providing an independent assessment of the method in a set of benchmark problems. Furthermore, we evaluate the need of using higher order spline shape functions, which have been shown to be crucial for the success of the conventional MPM. Finally, we present a simple projection technique for addressing solid mechanics problems that fall within the near-incompressible regime. The numerical results show that TLMPM is indeed a strong alternative to conventional MPM, whereas our near-incompressibility approach produces solutions that are free of volumetric locking and pressure oscillations, while introducing very minor modifications to existing codes.},

The coupling between the solid and an incompressible fluid is formulated by means of the method of localized Lagrange multipliers (LLM). Instead of applying a direct coupling between the fluid and the structure, which is the traditional approach, LLM introduces an intermediate surface with its own degrees of freedom that is connected to the fluid and structure sides using independent fields of localized Lagrange multipliers. This approach allows the connection of non-matching meshes with mortar or classical localized methods and provides consistent dynamic equations of motion for the interface that can be integrated in parallel. Interface multipliers are later eliminated and the interface motion is used to update the fluid and structure states. This way, dedicated stand-alone software modules for the fluid and the structure are connected to a third interface system treating their interaction, thus preserving the modularity of the single-discipline software modules. Different numerical examples are solved with the proposed methodology to prove its efficiency and accuracy by running a series of classical dynamic FSI benchmark problems.},

Our approach is based on the Kuhn–Grün model of randomly jointed polymers with extensible chains, which allows the rupture of polymers through the chain scission mechanism. We introduced a novel mesoscale potential function that intrinsically incorporates an Arruda–Boyce type model into a nonlocal continuum framework with the purpose of modeling the mechanical response of general polymeric materials and the fracture of polymers. We have demonstrated through a series of numerical examples , both two-dimensional and three-dimensional, that the proposed model is robust and efficient in modeling crack growth in polymeric materials. The model is carefully validated with experimental data and numerical results obtained on the basis of existing continuum mechanics polymer models. We have shown that the proposed peridynamic model is accurate and stable in various configurations and loading modes, such as mode I and shear crack opening. In comparison to existing continuum polymer models and fracture modeling methods, our present technique has the advantages of being theoretically simple, rigorous, and computationally fast. The numerical results show that the nonlocal polymer model can easily capture the fracture process in polymeric materials without complex ad hoc modeling parameters under finite deformation, and it has the potential to become a convenient simulation tool for modeling the polymer failure process in the design and optimization of polymeric materials.},

Macroscopic strain and stress data are directly assigned to the material points of the macroscopic finite element models without constitutive model. Here, the macroscopic problems are solved with the offline macroscopic material genome database, without solving the microscopic problems simultaneously. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in using a deep neural network to enable adaptive sampling points without prior knowledge of the specific mechanical problem. The proposed data augmentation framework updates the sampling points gradually using the distance minimization algorithm with the mechanistic constraints, including the equilibrium and compatibility equations. Particularly, the deep neural network plays a crucial role as a guide in the phase space sampling process, facilitating the efficient use of sparse data. Thus, this method shows high feasibility and significantly improves the computational efficiency of offline computing.},

We restrict ourselves to brittle fracture and frictionless contact and focus on numerical challenges associated with the coupling of unilateral constraints emerging from the Griffith’s criterion and the contact conditions. The formulation is based on the configurational mechanics framework and is solved using the finite element method . The approach utilises a monolithic Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation permitting simultaneous resolution of crack propagation and unilateral contact constraints. Contact is embedded in the model using the well-known mortar contact formulation. Evolving cracks are explicitly modelled as displacement discontinuities within the mesh. Heterogeneous approximation of arbitrary order is used to discretise spatial displacements, enabling h p hp -adaptive refinement around the crack front and the contact interfaces traversed by the crack. The result is a holistic approach which handles issues associated with thermodynamic consistency, numerical accuracy and robustness of the computational scheme. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the model formulation and implementation; they also highlight how contact pressure and load applied on surfaces traversed by cracks influence their propagation. The robustness of the approach is validated by comparison of our simulations with existing numerical results and an industrial experiment involving cracks of complex morphologies propagating along contact interfaces between multiple deformable bodies .},

To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of the coupled effects of growth and electric fields on the deformation behaviour , a finite element framework for coupled electro-elastic growth is established. Based on the extended volume growth theory, the governing equations of the growing electro-elastic solid are obtained. A coupled three-field mixed displacement-pressure-potential finite element formulation using inf–sup stable combinations is adapted. The finite element formulation is implemented in ABAQUS via a user element subroutine. The implementation is validated first by comparing the deformation and stress components of a growing tubular structure under axial strain and radial voltage. Using the example of a bi-layer beam actuator, it is illustrated that growth parameters and the external voltage can precisely control the bending angle. The framework is then applied to simulate pattern formation and transition behaviour, such as doubling and tripling of wrinkles, by specifying growth parameters and external voltage in a 3D stiff film/soft substrate structure. Furthermore, the suppression of wrinkles by applying external voltage is demonstrated. It is observed that the electric field plays a significant role in stress redistribution and guiding growth, resulting in the promotion or suppression of wrinkles, which is demonstrated by the numerical simulation of a long tubular structure. The proposed finite element scheme provides an accurate, efficient and stable tool for numerical simulation of electro-elastic solids incorporating growth effect, which can be used for understanding coupled growth phenomenon in biological soft matter and developing smart devices for medical treatment.},

As an example of a parabolic problem, we consider the advection–dispersion equation (ADE) with a point (Gaussian) source initial condition. In the d d -dimensional ADE, perturbations in the initial condition decay with time t t as t − d / 2 t−d/2 . We demonstrate that for d ≥ 2 d≥2 , this decay rate can cause a large approximation error in the PINN solution. Furthermore, localized large gradients in the ADE solution make the (common in PINN) Latin hypercube sampling of the equation’s residual highly inefficient. Finally, the PINN solution of parabolic equations is sensitive to the choice of weights in the loss function. We propose a normalized form of ADE where the initial perturbation of the solution does not decrease in amplitude and demonstrate that this normalization significantly reduces the PINN approximation error. Next, we present an adaptive sampling scheme based on the analytical estimate of the solution decay rate that significantly reduces the PINN estimation error for the same number of sampling (residual) points. Finally, we develop criteria for selecting weights based on the order of magnitude of different terms in the loss function. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed PINN model for forward, inverse, and backward ADEs.},

  abstract     = {The well-known phase-field approach applied to fracturing solids has recently been embedded in the Theory of Porous Media for the description of dynamic hydraulic fracturing scenarios based on fully saturated porous media . This method has further been enhanced by the introduction of a crack-opening indicator to distinguish between open and closed cracks accompanied by a switch between Darcy-type and Navier–Stokes-type flow situations in the unbroken porous domain and in fully broken areas. Based on these achievements, the present article extends the challenging matter of fully saturated media by the introduction of partially saturated scenarios, where the pore space contains both a liquid, such as water or oil, and a pore gas, such as air or natural gas. Proceeding from the Theory of Porous Media, the setup of the model is based on first principles of continuum mechanics , while the numerical study proceeds from the Finite-Element Method, where coupled problems of fracturing multi-component and multi-phasic media are treated by a monolithic solution strategy provided by a solver for coupled problems. By use of this procedure, it can be shown by comparison of fully and partially saturated porous media that the existence of pore gas slows down the fracture evolution. It is furthermore pointed out that the existence of closed precracks combined with external loads does not only lead to opening and evolving fractures, but also to fractures that do not open as a result of compressive boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {Prairie Dog Optimization is a population-based optimization method that uses the behavior of prairie dogs to find the optimal solution. This paper proposes a novel optimization method, called the Opposition-based Laplacian Distribution with Prairie Dog Optimization (OPLD-PDO), for solving industrial engineering design problems . The OPLD-PDO method combines the concepts of opposition-based Laplacian distribution and Prairie Dog Optimization to find near-optimal solutions. This causes faster convergence to the optimal solution and reduces the chances of getting stuck in a local minimum . The OPLD-PDO method was tested on several benchmark problems to validate its performance. The results were compared with other methods, and the OPLD-PDO method was superior regarding solution quality. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the OPLD-PDO method as a useful tool for solving industrial engineering design problems and photovoltaic (PV) solar problems.},

The present method introduces the total energy function consisting of the elastic, plastic, and fracture terms. The plasticity is coupled with the fracture through the degradation function which is applied to the tensile part of the elastic strain energy. The proposed higher-order nonlocal operator method brings several advantages over the original nonlocal operator method that requires only first-order terms. Moreover, the proposed method does not require the direct computation of kernel function or moment matrix derivatives. Therefore, this approach can improve the computational efficiency and simplify in implementation. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through various numerical examples , which have the ability to detect complex patterns of ductile fracture, such as crack propagation and plastic localization.},

Resolving a large range of spatial scales typically requires prohibitively high computational costs. The small dissipation in wave systems poses a significant challenge to further developing multiscale modelling methods in multiple dimensions. This article develops and evaluates two families of equation-free multiscale methods on novel 2D staggered patch schemes, and demonstrates the power and utility of these multiscale schemes for weakly damped linear waves. A detailed study of sensitivity to numerical roundoff errors establishes the robustness of developed staggered patch schemes. Comprehensive eigenvalue analysis over a wide range of parameters establishes the stability, accuracy, and consistency of the multiscale schemes. Analysis of the computational complexity shows that the measured compute times of the multiscale schemes may be 100,000 times smaller than the compute time for the corresponding (same resolution) full-domain computation. This work provides the essential foundation for efficient large-scale simulation of challenging nonlinear multiscale waves.},

Not only do these formulations yield the optimal number of samples required, but also the optimal selection of low-fidelity models to use.

The novelties of this method are threefold: (1) The peridynamic bond force–stretch​ relationship of the Mooney–Rivlin hyperelastic model is original formulated and implemented based on thermomechanical theories and energy equivalence principles; (2) A novel contact algorithm is proposed to reduce the complexity of realistic loading and boundary conditions in blunt ballistic impact simulations; (3) This computational framework enables 3D dynamic simulations of hyperelastic polymer gels with complex geometric configurations. Tensile and compressive tests with varying loading rates are studied to validate the capability and accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed computational framework outperforms its finite element counterparts in modeling blunt impacts on polymer gels. It can be readily extended to penetration impact problems since accounting for failures is straightforward in this peridynamics framework.},

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are generative models that use diffusion-based dynamics to gradually denoise images and generate realistic synthetic samples. By learning the reverse of a Markov diffusion process, we design an artificial intelligence to efficiently manipulate the topology of microstructures to generate a massive number of prototypes that exhibit constitutive responses sufficiently close to designated nonlinear constitutive behaviors. To identify the subset of microcstructures with sufficiently precise fine-tuned properties, a convolutional neural network surrogate is trained to replace high-fidelity finite element simulations to filter out prototypes outside the admissible range. Results of this study indicate that the denoising diffusion process is capable of creating microstructures of fine-tuned nonlinear material properties within the latent space of the training data. More importantly, this denoising diffusion algorithm can be easily extended to incorporate additional topological and geometric modifications by introducing high-dimensional structures embedded in the latent space. Numerical experiments are conducted on the open-source mechanical MNIST data set (Lejeune, 2020). Consequently, this algorithm is not only capable of performing inverse design of nonlinear effective media, but also learns the nonlinear structure–property map to quantitatively understand the multiscale interplay among the geometry, topology, and their effective macroscopic properties.},

  abstract     = {This work deals with the discretization of single-phase Darcy flows in fractured and deformable porous media, including frictional contact at the matrix–fracture interfaces. Fractures are described as a network of planar surfaces leading to so-called mixed-dimensional models. Small displacements and a linear poro-elastic behavior are considered in the matrix. One key difficulty to simulate such coupled poro-mechanical models is related to the formulation and discretization of the contact mechanical sub-problem. Our starting point is based on the mixed formulation using facewise constant Lagrange multipliers along the fractures representing normal and tangential stresses . This is a natural choice for the discretization of the contact dual cone in order to account for complex fracture networks with corners and intersections. It leads to local expressions of the contact conditions and to efficient semi-smooth nonlinear solvers. On the other hand, such a mixed formulation requires to satisfy a compatibility condition between the discrete spaces restricting the choice of the displacement space and potentially leading to sub-optimal accuracy. This motivates the investigation of two alternative formulations based either on a stabilized mixed formulation or on the Nitsche’s method. These three types of formulations are first investigated theoretically in order to enhance their connections. Then, they are compared numerically in terms of accuracy and nonlinear convergence. The sensitivity to the choice of the formulation parameters is also investigated. Several 2D test cases are considered with various fracture networks using both P 1 P1 and P 2 P2 conforming Finite Element discretizations of the displacement field and an Hybrid Finite Volume discretization of the mixed-dimensional Darcy flow model.},

  abstract     = {We present a general form of the gradient-enhanced damage theory and its numerical implementation using finite element method (FEM) in modeling quasi-static brittle crack growth in one- (1D), two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) bodies. Coupled equations of the equilibrium and a new implicit gradient damage formulation are introduced to govern the deformation of the solid and evolution of the damage. The resulting nonlocal damage evolution equation featuring the growth of diffusive crack is integrated with a characteristic length scale to eliminate the common mesh-bias issue in FEM implementation. In contrast to the traditional gradient-enhanced damage approaches, the nonlocal damage field here is defined as the primary variable of the damage evolution equation without interpolation mismatch between the displacement and nonlocal damage fields. For derivation of the material constitutive law and local damage parameter, a novel strain energy density (SED) function based on the energy limiter theory for brittle crack growth problems under small strain regime is introduced. To further improve the performance of the developed model, an initial SED threshold, which is used for determining the critical point when damage starts to initiate in the material, is integrated into the novel energy limiter theory. For preventing nonphysical failure in compression domains, the spectral decomposition technique for the strain tensor is adopted to split the reference SED. With integrating the energy limiter into the developed theory, unlike the conventional nonlocal damage theories where the interpretation of the length scale is still ambiguous, the developed nonlocal damage model defines the length scale parameter as the problem-dependent factor. The performance and ability of the proposed model are demonstrated via a set of representative numerical examples in 1D, 2D and 3D fracture problems.},

We propose a method for solving multi-material problems in solid mechanics using physics-informed neural networks. Inspired by domain decomposition technology, the calculation domain is divided according to the geometric distribution of materials, with different subnetworks applied to represent field variables. This study explains how the invariant momentum balance, kinematic relations, and different constitutive relations controlled by the material properties are incorporated into the subnetworks, and use additional regular terms to describe the contact relations between materials. Various test cases ranging from two-dimensional plane strain problems to three-dimensional stretching problems are solved using the proposed method. We introduce the concept of parameter sharing in multi-task learning (MTL) and incorporate it in the proposed method, which yields additional degrees of freedom in choosing the sharing structure and sharing mode. Compared with common physics-informed neural network algorithms, which are based on fully independent parameters, we develop a network structure with partial sharing structure and all-sharing mode that achieves higher accuracy when solving the example problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a computational framework for the design optimization of stable structures under large deformations by incorporating nonlinear buckling constraints. A novel strategy for suppressing spurious buckling modes related to low-density elements is proposed. The strategy depends on constructing a pseudo-mass matrix that assigns small pseudo masses for DOFs surrounded by only low-density elements and degenerates to an identity matrix for the solid region. A novel optimization procedure is developed that can handle both simple and multiple eigenvalues wherein consistent sensitivities of simple eigenvalues and directional derivatives of multiple eigenvalues are derived and utilized in a gradient-based optimization algorithm — the method of moving asymptotes. An adaptive linear energy interpolation method is also incorporated in nonlinear analyses to handle the low-density elements distortion under large deformations. The numerical results demonstrate that, for systems with either low or high symmetries, the nonlinear stability constraints can ensure structural stability at the target load under large deformations. Post-analysis on the B-spline fitted designs shows that the safety margin, i.e., the gap between the target load and the 1st critical load , of the optimized structures can be well controlled by selecting different stability constraint values. Interesting structural behaviors such as mode switching, and multiple bifurcations are also demonstrated.},

Three non-iterative algorithms, namely hierarchical r r -adaptivity, element deletion, and Kirigami-inspired sub-tetrahedralization are then introduced to generate a high-quality conforming mesh by relocating background mesh nodes, eliminating degenerate elements, and subdividing non-conforming tetrahedra to match material interfaces and domain boundaries.

The subdomains are connected by the condition of the continuity of the acceleration field at the interface. In addition, the a posteriori technique is applied to satisfy the continuity of the displacement and velocity fields. Another important contribution of this paper lies in the description of the implementation — we offer the reader a general description of the implementation of the case of any number of subdomains with any number of constraints between them, while the basics of the algorithm are explained on a single domain pair. The functionality of the asynchronous integrator is verified by solving selected problems and comparing with analytical solutions and experimental measurements obtained using a Split Hopkinson pressure bar setup.},

  abstract     = {We develop a novel cut discontinuous Galerkin (CutDG) method for stationary advection–reaction problems on surfaces embedded in R d Rd . The CutDG method is based on embedding the surface into a full-dimensional background mesh and using the associated discontinuous piecewise polynomials of order k k as test and trial functions. As the surface can cut through the mesh in an arbitrary fashion, we design a suitable stabilization that enables us to establish inf-sup stability, a priori error estimates, and condition number estimates using an augmented streamline-diffusion norm. The resulting CutDG formulation is geometrically robust in the sense that all derived theoretical results hold with constants independent of any particular cut configuration. Numerical examples support our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in the field of data-driven dynamics allow for the discovery of ODE systems using state measurements. One approach, known as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), assumes the dynamics are sparse within a predetermined basis in the states and finds the expansion coefficients through linear regression with sparsity constraints. This approach requires an accurate estimation of the state time derivatives, which is not necessarily possible in the high-noise regime without additional constraints. We present an approach called Derivative-based SINDy (DSINDy) that combines two novel methods to improve ODE recovery at high-noise levels. First, we denoise the state variables by applying a projection operator that leverages the assumed basis for the system dynamics. Second, we use a second order cone program (SOCP) to find the derivative and governing equations simultaneously. We derive theoretical results for the projection-based denoising step, which allow us to estimate the values of hyperparameters used in the SOCP formulation. This underlying theory helps limit the number of required user-specified parameters. We present results demonstrating that our approach leads to improved system recovery for the Van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the Rössler attractor, and the Lorenz 96 model.},

  abstract     = {Advanced fibre composite materials are often used for weight-efficient thin-walled designs, making a plate-based modelling approach suitable for their structural assessment. However, as the sub-structural geometrical features of these materials govern much of their behaviour, a multi-scale approach is necessary. A related challenge, however, is that the in-plane variation of these sub-structural features may be much larger than the total thickness of the material, whereby tailored homogenisation techniques for shell elements are needed. Existing frameworks for plate- and shell-based homogenisation are typically developed using second-order homogenisation in combination with the Hill–Mandel (macro-homogeneity) condition. However, it has been reported in the literature that this approach can lead to kinematic inconsistencies in the macro- to micro-scale transition. One inconsistency that is commonly reported, is the inability to correctly account for the macro-scale transverse shear behaviour on the sub-scale level. In this contribution, we show how the method of Variationally Consistent Homogenisation (VCH) can be used to develop a homogenisation framework for Reissner-Mindlin plate elements, which guarantees kinematically consistent prolongation and homogenisation operations. The homogenisation approach is demonstrated in four numerical examples, where it is shown that the method accurately homogenise the effective sectional plate stiffnesses of homogeneous and heterogeneous sub-structures.},

A novel enrichment is defined to incorporate the singular behavior of the electric potential due to dislocation. Nonlinear material properties due to temperature are taken for a thermo-electro-elastic analysis. The constituting materials having different lattice parameters result in a mismatch–misfit​ strain near the interface. This nonuniform misfit strain distribution affects the dislocations near the bi-material interface. Volterra dislocation modeling is performed to obtain all the primary and secondary fields around dislocations. An expression of the Peach–Koehler force considering the combined effect of the multiple fields is proposed. The results are obtained when the misfit strain is present on one side of the interface and both sides of the interface. A comparative study is performed on the Peach–Koehler force obtained in different cases of the misfit consideration with the case when the misfit strain is absent. Also for the case when the misfit strain is taken on the same side of the interface, the Peach–Koehler force is obtained by varying the misfit percentages corresponding to the different amounts of misfit relaxation.},

The capability to design such structures to achieve programmable shape morphing in three dimensions (3D) under magnetic actuation is highly desirable for many applications. In this work, we develop a multi-physics topology optimization framework for the inverse design of magneto-active metasurfaces that can undergo programmable shape morphing in 3D under external magnetic fields . These metasurfaces remain planar in their initial configurations and are deformed into complex 3D target shapes. The proposed framework accounts for large-deformation kinematics and optimizes both the topologies and magnetization distributions of metasurfaces in conjunction with the directions and magnitudes of the external magnetic fields . We demonstrate the framework in the design of kirigami metasurfaces, bio-inspired robots with “swimming”, “steering”, “walking”, and “climbing” motions, and multi-modal magnetic actuators, and the optimized designs show high precision and performance in achieving complex 3D deformations. We also use a hybrid fabrication procedure to manufacture representative designs and conduct experimental tests to validate their programmed 3D deformations, with results showing good agreement with simulation predictions. We envision that the proposed framework could lead to a systematic and versatile approach for the design of magneto-active metasurfaces for robotics applications .},

  abstract     = {Accurate and fast modeling of the temperature distribution and phase transitions in laser powder bed fusion is a major milestone in achieving its quality assurance. Commonly referred to as digital twin technology, the goal is to find agile, fast-to-compute but also sufficiently accurate simulators that can replicate the 3D printing process while enhancing the quality of its outcomes. In this work, we propose a surrogate model for the nonlinear heat transfer equation coupled with subspace projection and randomized sketching, that exploits the accuracy and explainability of finite element time-domain simulation with the computational efficiency of Monte Carlo sampling, applied to the modality of laser powder bed fusion. Focusing on tackling the high-dimensionality imparted from the finite element approximation and the nonlinearity in the governing equations, our surrogate relies on low-dimensional projection with subspace selection and subsequently sub-samples the Picard iterations utilized to solve the projected non-linear system of equations. The projection bases are generated in the process of simulation by combining previous temperature profiles and locally deployed anisotropic Gaussian functions, while the sketching process utilizes efficient sampling without replacement based on approximate optimal sampling distributions. Both the projection and the sketching are designed to implement alongside the printing process, which makes the proposed surrogate capable of handling different process parameters without requiring prior computations offline. A series of numerical experiments are presented to validate the surrogate’s accuracy and reduction in compute time compared to high-fidelity finite element simulations. Although the achieved speed-up can be as a high ten, computational times are still orders of magnitude away from what would be required for real-time computations. The presented methodology allows to handle different printing attributes (laser power and scan speed) and arbitrary thermal conductivity anisotropy.},

In contrast to previous researches where the sliding motions are prescribed at sliding boundaries and the existence of configurational forces is not identified, the configurational momentum equation that governs the evolution of sliding motions is derived in a consistent variational framework in the present paper. To this end, the time-varying material domain due to the presence of sliding motion is mapped onto a time-invariant mesh domain, variations at fixed material and at fixed mesh coordinates are introduced, and their relationship with variation of material coordinates at fixed mesh coordinates are derived. Hamilton’s principle of variation of action is employed to derive the strong form of mechanical and configurational momentum equations together with natural boundary conditions at the sliding boundaries. In the finite element formulation, transfinite interpolation is employed to relate material coordinates of nodes inside the domain to the values at the sliding boundaries. The discrete form of Hamilton’s variational principle leads to discrete governing equations of the proposed ALE formulation. The generalized- α α scheme is adjusted to integration the resulting mechanical and configurational momentum equations. Numerical examples are presented to validate correctness and efficiency of the proposed formulation.},

Based on the observation that the crack tip area has a significant impact on the convergence of the iterative method while the other mesh points do not, the finite element mesh is partitioned into two types: the regular subdomains and the crack tip subdomains. To construct the additive Schwarz preconditioner , the global matrix is partitioned into submatrices which are solved exactly in the crack tip subdomains by the LU factorization and inexactly in the regular subdomains by an incomplete LU factorization. As the crack propagates, we develop a scheme to update the subdomain problems without resolving of them, in which, in order to save the computational cost, only the subdomains around the crack are updated, and all the other regular subdomains remain unchanged. To further speed up the Krylov subspace method , an auxiliary subproblem including crack tips of the previous and current time steps is constructed and solved to provide a better initial guess .

This study discusses the quantification performance of the extended finite element method , the crack band method and the phase-field approaches combined with different sources of uncertainties. These well-known computational techniques are typical representatives of the common fracture modelling philosophies including the embedded, smeared and regularized ones. The essence of this work is to compare the main differences of the uncertainty quantification models (i.e., probabilistic, non-probabilistic) at the fracture formulation levels and investigate the major progress and challenges existing in the real-life applications for the past and future decades. Some critical remarks, which are denoting the advantages and major issues of various non-deterministic fracture models, are provided and explained in the practical structural failure conditions. Different fracture simulation cases are implemented with comparative results amongst analytical, numerical and experimental methods, and the corresponding fracture quantification ability is evaluated through the standards of the random fracture capacity, load–deflection plots, crack propagation , crack mechanisms, and computational efficiency, etc.},

In this study, a novel extended ordinary state-based peridynamic model was developed for nonlinear deformation and fracture analysis , which established a general relationship with continuum-based parameters and permitted the selection of different influence functions. Based on the principle of virtual displacement, the complete derivations of the peridynamic parameters were presented for two and three-dimensional conditions. After that, the specific numerical scheme and algorithm implementation were summarized. The capability and accuracy of the proposed nonlinear model were verified by comparing with the experimental and finite element simulation results. Finally, several other numerical examples were provided to further demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the proposed model and its implementation.},

  abstract     = {This detailed study investigates Bayesian inference with material model parameters, exemplified using an advanced damage-plastic model with parameters identified from recently proposed innovative tests of concrete cylinders subjected to confined compression. The study has two main objectives—one specific and the other more general: (i) to evaluate the potential and benefits of the elaborated experimental setup for estimating 15 material parameters in the damage-plastic model for concrete (CDPM2) and (ii) to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the numerical tools applied to the problem of simultaneous probabilistic identification for a large number of parameters from limited and noisy data. The paper therefore provides sufficient detail about all steps included in the identification procedure, allowing its application to any other material model calibration problem. The computational burden connected to probabilistic analysis based on Markov chain Monte Carlo method is mitigated here by using a surrogate model based on polynomial chaos expansion. As a benefit, this type of surrogate allows global sensitivity analysis to be performed easily, and it also facilitates analysis of complexity in the relationship between particular material parameters (or pairs of parameters) and simulated material response components. The description also includes strategies for the construction of an efficient anisotropic polynomial expansion with varying degrees in particular parameters. As a problem-specific acceleration of the surrogate construction, two variants of the model simulating the confined compression experiment are described. One is a high-fidelity model that considers detailed specimen geometry, while the other is a computationally faster and more stable low-fidelity variant which simulates the test on the level of a single material point. The robustness and efficiency of the elaborated identification strategy are illustrated by calibration from synthetic as well as from experimental data obtained for four distinct sets of specimens made of the same concrete and equipped with aluminum hoops. The consistent results of particular calibrations, sensitivity analysis and also expert expectations based on deep understanding of material laws confirm the robustness of the identification strategy and its ability to simultaneously estimate 11 out of 15 parameters in a complex damage-plastic model from relatively inexpensive failure tests.},

  abstract     = {Realistic microscale domains are an essential step towards making modern multiscale simulations more applicable to computational materials engineering. For this purpose, 3D computed tomography scans can be very expensive or technically impossible for certain materials, whereas 2D information can be easier obtained. Based on a single or three orthogonal 2D slices, the recently proposed differentiable microstructure characterization and reconstruction (DMCR) algorithm is able to reconstruct multiple plausible 3D realizations of the microstructure based on statistical descriptors, i.e., without the need for a training data set. Building upon DMCR, this work introduces a highly accurate two-stage reconstruction algorithm that refines the DMCR results under consideration of microstructure descriptors. Furthermore, the 2D-to-3D reconstruction is validated using a real computed tomography (CT) scan of a recently developed binary β β -Ti/TiFe alloy as well as anisotropic “bone-like” spinodoid structures. After a detailed discussion of systematic errors in the descriptor space, the reconstructed microstructures are compared to the reference in terms of the numerically obtained effective elastic and plastic properties. Together with the free accessibility of the presented algorithms in MCRpy , the excellent results in this study motivate interdisciplinary cooperation in applying numerical multiscale simulations for computational materials engineering.},

Following the trend of sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI), Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), known as the third generation of neural networks, are proposed for developing surrogate models for mechanical tasks. SNNs are inherently recurrent and communicate through sparse signals consuming only a fraction of the energy needed by artificial neural networks (ANNs) of the second generation such as current deep learning methods. To take advantage of the energy-efficient spike models, an autoencoding strategy is proposed to convert the real-valued data at a certain time step to its binary spike representation which allows the model to be used for regression tasks. Further, we propose a hybrid model consisting of the spiking variant of the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU), spiking recurrent cells, and classical dense transformations to compute the nonlinear (physically and geometrically) response of shock wave-loaded plate elements. The inclusion of spikes enables the proposed model to be deployed on neuromorphic hardware, such as the Loihi chip. Thus, for a series of both training and validation experiments, a detailed comparison of the proposed hybrid model and its second-generation counterpart in terms of energy consumption and accuracy is presented.},

The proposed SNS-PFEM framework requires only basic length parameters for constructing stabilization terms, thus yielding a simpler implementation and less computational cost than the existing methods. Based on this framework, an efficient dual mortar contact algorithm is introduced for finite frictional sliding analysis, utilizing the segment-to-segment discretization and dual Lagrange multiplier method . The resulting stiffness matrix is well-conditioned and positive-defined, leading to higher accuracy and less computational cost than penalty-type methods. Furthermore, a dynamic mesh adjustment technique is proposed to ensure high mesh quality throughout the large deformation process . Since all variables are stored on the node in our SNS-PFEM framework, the process of mesh adjustment is both straightforward and computationally efficient. The precision and robustness of our methods are validated through three classical benchmarks and two representative geotechnical problems. Results show that the proposed SNS-PFEM framework effectively eliminates the over-soft issue seen with the NS-PFEM; the dual mortar method offers an accurate, and efficient performance for nonlinear contact analysis; and the dynamic mesh adjustment technology is effective in preventing mesh quality degradation during large deformations.},

However, in many cases a high-fidelity numerical emulation of systems cannot be optimized due to code complexity and computational costs which prohibit the use of intrusive and many query algorithms. Rather, lower-fidelity models are constructed to enable intrusive algorithms for large-scale optimization. As a result of the discrepancy between high and low-fidelity models, optimal solutions determined using low-fidelity models are frequently far from true optimality . In this article we introduce a novel approach that uses post-optimality sensitivities with respect to model discrepancy to update the optimization solution. Limited high-fidelity data is used to calibrate the model discrepancy in a Bayesian framework which in turn is propagated through post-optimality sensitivities of the low-fidelity optimization problem. Our formulation exploits structure in the post-optimality sensitivity operator to achieve computational scalability. Numerical results demonstrate how an optimal solution computed using a low-fidelity model may be significantly improved with limited evaluations of a high-fidelity model.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents for the first time an approach to the problem of electromechanical fracture and crack propagation in piezoelectric solids with peridynamics . Fracture in piezoelectric ceramics is an important problem in engineering due to its complexity. The majority of the computational models available on the literature rely on sharp crack representations, which have difficulties dealing with complex crack patterns, or rely on diffusive crack models, such as the phase-field fracture model, that can predict complex patterns but does not represent cracks in a discrete way. On the other hand, peridynamics has been designed to solve this problems and is able to simulate discrete cracks as well as complex crack phenomena like fragmentation and branching. We present a novel approach to the implementation of different electric crack face boundary conditions in a peridynamic way, by a field selective bond breaking approach. Moreover, it is also presented the first electromechanical failure criterion for fracture in piezoelectric ceramics. We develop an energy based failure criterion due to its generality and wide range of applications. These approaches are presented in a way such that they are valid for any type of peridynamic formulation. The used numerical model is implemented using correspondence-based peridynamics with the linear piezoelectricity constitutive setting, using a meshfree discretization and solved quasi-statically with an implicit incremental-iterative scheme. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of these new approaches and assess the performance of the model against experimental results. The model is capable of numerically predicting complicated fracture behaviour and crack propagation in an intrinsic/autonomous way, as demonstrated by the results.},

  abstract     = {Strain localization is a common phenomenon existing in various multiscale materials or structures, e.g., the bulking bands of thin-walled structures, the local collapse of porous materials, and the crack in solid materials, etc. However, this phenomenon cannot be captured by the conventional homogenization methods, such as mean-field homogenization (e.g., Mori–Tanaka method), first-order or high-order computational homogenization (e.g., the Finite Element Square method), etc., due to the high strain gradient associated with strain localization. Aiming at this, a hybrid Direct FE 2 method is proposed by combining the D-FE 2 (Direct FE 2 ) and the traditional FE methods, while the multiscale structure is modeled using the D-FE 2 method in the region exhibiting low deformation gradient , and the other region displaying high deformation gradient is modeled using the traditional FE method. Moreover, a node displacement constraint and an overall node displacement constraint derived from the multilevel equilibrium equations using the Gauss–Ostrogradsky theorem are respectively prescribed to the interface between the D-FE 2 model and the FE model of the multiscale structure, to enforce the energy equilibrium and deformation continuity. The proposed hybrid D-FE 2 method is then applied to predict the strain localization behavior of multiscale materials or structures, including local bulking of honeycomb structures , in-situ crack propagation , and localized plastic deformation in fiber reinforced composites , etc. Comparison of the simulation results obtained from the hybrid D-FE 2 method and the traditional FE method validates the accuracy, efficiency and ease of numerical implementation of the proposed hybrid D-FE 2 method.},

By doing so, fracturing in early-age concrete structures can be easily accommodated by NOSBPD featuring an elegant treatment of discontinuities. The accuracy of the proposed approach is evaluated by a benchmark problem with experimental and existing numerical solutions. The capability of the proposed approach for simulating the complex crack initiation and propagation in early-age ring and T-shaped concrete structures is demonstrated.

The HWENO-L scheme reduced storage and increased efficiency by using restricted derivatives only for time discretizations . However, it cannot control spurious oscillations well when facing strong shocks since the derivatives are directly used in spatial discretizations without any restrictions. To address such an issue, our proposed HWENO scheme performs flux reconstructions in the finite difference framework without using the derivative value of a target cell, which can result in a simpler and more robust scheme. The resulting scheme is simpler while achieving fifth order accuracy, making it more efficient. Besides, numerically we find it is very robust for some extreme problems even without positivity-preserving limiters. The proposed scheme also inherits advantages of previous HWENO schemes, including arbitrary positive linear weights in flux reconstructions, compact reconstructed stencils, and high resolution. Extensive numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the fifth order accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and high resolution of the proposed HWENO scheme.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a continuous density-field based isogeometric topology optimization (ITO) using Polynomial splines over Hierarchical T-meshes (PHT-Splines). Taking the benefit of isogeometric methods, the design density values for the mesh are defined using spline basis functions as a continuous density function (CDF) through the control points. The material density at the control points will then appear as a facade over the domain, which is further employed to generate a very smooth topology and also to propose a marking criterion for an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) strategy during the optimization process. During this adaptive meshing , the isogeometric domain mesh is refined during each adaptive step, properly tracking the density variation over the elements and sharpening the boundaries of the optimized topologies. By utilizing the rationale of the Geometry Independent Field approximaTion (GIFT) framework, any complex multi-patch geometry constructed in an industry-standard CAD package using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) may be imported and discretized using PHT-Splines, including higher dimensions . This helps to maintain the geometrical accuracy through an initial coarse mesh and computational accuracy of the optimization iterations through the local refinement feature of the PHT-Splines. An adaptive first-neighbourhood smoothening algorithm based on the Shepard function is also proposed to obtain manufacturable topologies and to circumvent post-processing stages. The proposed method was observed to provide remarkably smooth topologies with an initial coarse mesh, thereby obtaining a computationally efficient domain to be solved. Compared to existing element density based methods, the proposed method demonstrates a substantial minimization in Degree’s-of-Freedom (DoF) requirement to arrive at clear and realistic solutions. Also, when compared to globally refined solutions, a 50%–90% reduction in DoF is achieved using the adaptive refinement strategy.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the effect of small-cut elements on the critical time-step size in an immersogeometric explicit dynamics context. We analyze different formulations for second-order (membrane) and fourth-order (shell-type) equations, and derive scaling relations between the critical time-step size and the cut-element size for various types of cuts. In particular, we focus on different approaches for the weak imposition of Dirichlet conditions: by penalty enforcement and with Nitsche’s method. The conventional stability requirement for Nitsche’s method necessitates either a cut-size dependent penalty parameter, or an additional ghost-penalty stabilization term. Our findings show that both techniques suffer from cut-size dependent critical time-step sizes, but the addition of a ghost-penalty term to the mass matrix serves to mitigate this issue. We confirm that this form of ‘mass-scaling’ does not adversely affect error and convergence characteristics for a transient membrane example, and has the potential to increase the critical time-step size by orders of magnitude. Finally, for a prototypical simulation of a Kirchhoff–Love shell, our stabilized Nitsche formulation reduces the solution error by well over an order of magnitude compared to a penalty formulation at equal time-step size.},

  abstract     = {Phononic crystal, which can block the propagation of elastic waves in a certain frequency range, is widely used in acoustic devices, vibration reduction , and other fields. However, most of the previous studies on the design of phononic crystals only consider the problem of the maximum band gap of adjacent two orders and cannot give the design for a prescribed band gap, which is more applicability in practical engineering problems. To solve this issue, this study proposes a novel topology optimization method to realize the prescribed band gaps design of phononic crystal. Compared to the vibration structural design with prescribed band gaps, the difficulty of phononic crystals’ prescribed band gaps design lies in the correlation between stiffness matrix and wave vector, which is a typical eigenvalue problem with multi-class boundary conditions. Directly utilizing the frequency band constraints proposed by the authors in the previous papers may lead to numerical convergence difficulties. Thus an ipsilateral frequency constraint based on a modified Heaviside function is further proposed. Since the developed function is continuous and differentiable, the sensitivity of the constraint function can be derived for using the gradient-based optimization solver. Furthermore, in order to eliminate the checkerboard phenomena, grey elements and give the minimum size control in topology optimization, the “Robust formulation” is applied. Several numerical examples , including single-band gap and double-band gaps problems, are solved by the proposed method. The results validate the effectiveness of the developed method.},

Current topology optimizations with the polar formalism are based on optimality criteria, and limited to performing compliance minimization for thermodynamically feasible materials. The proposed optimization approach uses a sequential approximations approach, based on the Methods of Moving Asymptotes. The material density, orientation and anisotropic modules are updated separately at each iteration, in parallel sub-problems constructed with different types of approximations and settings. The proposed optimization approach is successfully validated for compliance minimization against the Alternate Directions method for general orthotropic materials, defined by the thermodynamic bounds. The importance of the anisotropy initialization in the gradient-based approach is highlighted to obtain stiffer solutions. The gradient-based strategy is also extended to incorporate geometric bounds on the polar parameters, defining the domain of existence of composite laminates. Obtained results for compliance minimization with laminates are compared to published results using lamination parameters. Finally, new solutions are presented showing the improvement of the compliance with the expansion of the anisotropy design domains. This paper paves the way for strength-based topology optimization of parts made of orthotropic materials or composite laminates.},

Despite the great interest in practical engineering applications , many efforts from the research community have been devoted to improving the standard LS. This paper aims at offering some new insights into the LS method, leading to an innovative method, termed ‘partially Bayesian active learning line sampling’ (PBAL-LS). The problem of evaluating the failure probability integral in the LS method is treated as a Bayesian, rather than frequentist, inference problem, which allows to incorporate our prior knowledge and model the discretization error . The Gaussian process model is used as the prior distribution for the distance function, and the posterior mean , and an upper bound of the posterior variance of the failure probability are derived. Based on the posterior statistics of the failure probability, we also put forward a learning function and a stopping criterion, which enable us to use active learning. Besides, an efficient algorithm is also designed to implement the PBAL-LS method, with the ability to automatically adjust the important direction and efficiently process the lines. Five numerical examples are studied to demonstrate the performance of the proposed PBAL-LS method against several existing methods.},

Firstly, the generalized rigid body and elastic coordinates are defined to describe the overall motion of a discrete unconstrained structure. Secondly, the corresponding equations of motion for generalized elastic coordinates are established with a tiny computational cost, and the stiffness matrix is still sparse. Finally, the elastic deformation in physical space can be exactly caught by the proposed equations of motion after determining the rigid body modes and the coordinate system of the rigid body motion. Different from directly solving the original semi-positive definite system in physical space, in which the overall displacement can only obtain, and the direct modal projection, the modal truncation error problem can be effectively overcome based on the established positive definite system when the modal order reduction is carried out. In light of this, the modal truncation error correction of the elastic displacement for the transient time domain and steady-state frequency domain of unconstrained structures is directly realized, summed the above as GECM, and the validity and practicability are illustrated through the numerical examples.},

In this paper, inspired by the multi-armed bandit strategy, a portfolio allocation of different learning functions is proposed to resolve the issue of selecting a single one, where the better learning functions are selected online according to their past performance.

  abstract     = {Deep neural operators can learn nonlinear mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces via deep neural networks. As promising surrogate solvers of partial differential equations (PDEs) for real-time prediction, deep neural operators such as deep operator networks (DeepONets) provide a new simulation paradigm in science and engineering. Pure data-driven neural operators and deep learning models, in general, are usually limited to interpolation scenarios, where new predictions utilize inputs within the support of the training set. However, in the inference stage of real-world applications, the input may lie outside the support, i.e., extrapolation is required, which may result to large errors and unavoidable failure of deep learning models. Here, we address this challenge of extrapolation for deep neural operators. First, we systematically investigate the extrapolation behavior of DeepONets by quantifying the extrapolation complexity, via the 2-Wasserstein distance between two function spaces and propose a new strategy of bias–variance trade-off for extrapolation with respect to model capacity. Subsequently, we develop a complete workflow, including extrapolation determination, and we propose five reliable learning methods that guarantee a safe prediction under extrapolation by requiring additional information—the governing PDEs of the system or sparse new observations. The proposed methods are based on either fine-tuning a pre-trained DeepONet or multifidelity learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for various types of parametric PDEs. Our systematic comparisons provide practical guidelines for selecting a proper extrapolation method depending on the available information, desired accuracy, and required inference speed.},

To prevent the vesicles from overlapping, we deploy an interaction energy definition to maintain a short-range repulsion between the vesicles. The fluid flow is modeled using Navier–Stokes equations under the assumption of incompressible flows, and the vesicle evolution in time is modeled using two advection equations describing the process of advecting each vesicle by the fluid flow. Rather than solving the velocity–pressure saddle point system, we apply the Residual-Based Variational MultiScale (RBVMS) method to Navier–Stokes equations and solve the coupled systems monolithically using isogeometric analysis. We study vesicle doublet hydrodynamics in shear flow, planar extensional flow, and parabolic flow under various configurations and boundary conditions.

Due to its simple structure and efficiency, the researchers employed the algorithm to address real-world optimization problems in multiple domains. However, in large-scale mechanical and engineering applications, it still needs to balance exploration and exploitation effectively and easily fall into local optimum. Therefore, in order to ameliorate these shortcomings, a multi-strategy improved YDSE optimizer named IYDSE is developed in this study. In IYDSE, introducing the Bernoulli map strategy ensures a higher quality initial population in the initialization, thus improving the convergence speed. Then, Levy flight is utilized as a local development engine to avoid local search stagnation of the optimal solution during optimization. In addition, mirror reflection learning is designed to enhance group diversity. Finally, the information entanglement strategy is introduced to enhance the information exchange between light and dark fringes, thus balancing the exploration-development capability. The superiority of the proposed IYDSE is comprehensively demonstrated by comparing it with state-of-the-art algorithms on the CEC2019 and CEC2020 test suites, respectively. Meanwhile, the practicability of IYDSE is also verified by solving five specific engineering design cases and 50 different types of engineering optimization suites. Finally, the IYDSE algorithm is applied to three truss topology optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability and development potential of the proposed algorithm in practical engineering applications. Therefore, IYDSE is potentially an effective and competitive algorithm for solving applied mechanics and engineering.},

  abstract     = {The homogenized constrained mixture theory (H-CMT) is an attractive and efficient computational framework to simulate growth and remodeling (G&amp;R) of soft tissues within finite deformations . It considers several prestressed constituents within a mixture and it enables their continuous individual mass removal and production to be taken into account. However, the referred theory was developed for specific mixtures, whose remodeling occurred on unidimensional constituents (fibers) only, while being embedded in an isotropic matrix. As the microstructure of soft tissues is generally more complex, we propose an extension of the H-CMT, which enables remodeling to occur on tridimensional constituents. This was achieved by manipulating the remodeling stress rate equation of the H-CMT. By rearranging the tensorial expression, it was possible to re-interpret its terms as variables of the classical plasticity theory and the resulting equation is a particular case of kinematic hardening . This interpretation, in turn, enables standard return mapping algorithms , which are classical in plasticity, to be quickly adapted to G&amp;R problems. Therefore, not only we explore the intersection of both the H-CMT and the plasticity frameworks, but we also propose new algorithmic implementations of G&amp;R that closely resemble those used in standard elasto-plastic problems. Applications to the simulation of G&amp;R in mixtures composed of anisotropic constituents are eventually shown to demonstrate the capabilities of the new algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, a multipatch isogeometric analysis method for geometrically exact shell problems is proposed. Generalized curvilinear coordinates are used for the first-order shear-deformable geometrically exact shell elements. This general tensor-based shell formulation can be directly linked to a computer-aided design system such as nonuniform rational basis spline (NURBS), which is represented by two parameters. Nitsche’s method for patch-to-patch connections in conforming or nonconforming meshes is adopted. The compatibility conditions between NURBS patches in Nitsche’s coupling are weakly imposed using the continuity of displacements, rotations, and stress resultants. The final algebraic equation for the solution fields has a simple symmetric form with previously derived strain–displacement relation matrices and material modulus for membrane, bending, and transverse shear terms. To alleviate the locking phenomenon , the B-bar method, which utilizes the strain projected onto a lower-order field, is used in the isogeometric shell element. Reduced-order B-splines for strain fields are constructed based on tying points, which eased the locking phenomenon compared with the classical B-bar method. To further alleviate additional shell locking by a higher-order regularity, the Bézier extraction method is adopted to reduce the element regularity. The proposed combination of Nitsche’s coupling and B-bar projection demonstrates the superior accuracy and robustness in the multipatch isogeometric shell examples with a high convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {Swept volumes are widely existed in various significant engineering applications . However, an effective design method for the lightweight swept volume with porous infills is lacking. This paper develops a novel topology optimization method for the design of curved volumes filled with spatially-varying microstructures. The infill optimization formulation for the curved swept volume is established to concurrently optimize both the microstructural geometry and the macroscopic distribution of the graded infills, aiming at minimizing the structural compliance subject to a global volume constraint. A conformal sweeping approach is developed to map the curved volume into a regular parameterization​ cube along the sweeping trajectory. In this fashion, the graded infills defined in a regular unit cell can be first filled into this cubic parameterization space, and then reversely mapped into the original volume to conformally match the curved geometry . A numerical homogenization method for parallelepiped microstructures is introduced to evaluate several sampling microstructures. The local level sets approach is used to create a family of connectable microstructures, while a polynomial interpolation is employed to rapidly interpolate the graded property of the generated microstructures based on the properties of sampling microstructures. Two different sweeping volume types are investigated. Several examples with respect to the infill optimization design of curved swept volumes are provided to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic methods have recently been the subject of increased attention in Computational Mechanics for their ability to account for the stochasticity of both material parameters and geometrical features in their predictions. Among them, the Galerkin Stochastic Finite Element Method (GSFEM) was shown to be particularly efficient and able to provide accurate output statistics, although at the cost of intrusive coding and additional theoretical algebraic efforts. In this method, distributions of the stochastic parameters are used as inputs for the solver, which in turn outputs nodal displacement distributions in one simulation. Here, we propose an extension of the GSFEM—termed the A posteriori Finite Element Method or APFEM—where uniform distributions are taken by default to allow for parametric studies of the inputs of interest as a postprocessing step after the simulation. Doing so, APFEM only requires the knowledge of the vertices of the parameter space. In particular, one key advantage of APFEM is its use in the context of Bayesian inferences, where the random evaluations required by the Bayesian setting (usually done through Monte Carlo) can be done exactly without the need for further simulations. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of APFEM by solving forward models with parametric boundary conditions in the context of (i) metamaterial design and (ii) pitchfork bifurcation of the buckling of a slender structure; and demonstrate the flexibility of its use for Bayesian inference by (iii) inferring friction coefficient of a half plane in a contact mechanics problem and (iv) inferring the stiffness of a brain region in the context of cancer surgical planning.},

However, as energy demands peak shortly before sunset and persist for several hours afterwards, the integration of solar-thermal systems is extremely advantageous as a green “bridge” energy source. Accordingly, this work develops a digital-twin model to track and optimize the flow of incoming solar power through a complex solar-thermal storage system, consisting of a large array of adaptable mirrors, an optical-receiver and a power distribution system for customers to extract energy. Specifically, the solar power flow is rapidly computed with a reduced order model of Maxwell’s equations, based on a high-frequency decomposition of the irradiance into multiple rays that experience mirror reflections, losses and ultimately receiver absorption and customer delivery. The method allows for rapid testing (in microseconds) of the performance of large numbers of mirror-receiver layout configurations in design space, over extremely long time periods, such as weeks, months and years, using a genetic-based machine-learning digital-twin framework, which integrates submodels for:},

  abstract     = {Petrov–Galerkin formulations with optimal test functions allow for the stabilization of finite element simulations. In particular, given a discrete trial space, the optimal test space induces a numerical scheme delivering the best approximation in terms of a problem-dependent energy norm. This ideal approach has two shortcomings: first, we need to explicitly know the set of optimal test functions; and second, the optimal test functions may have large supports inducing expensive dense linear systems. A concise proposal on how to overcome these shortcomings has been raised during the last decade by the Discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) methodology. However, DPG has also some limitations and difficulties: the method requires ultraweak variational formulations, obtained through a hybridization process, which is not trivial to implement at the discrete level. Our motivation is to offer a simpler alternative for the case of parametric PDEs, which can be used with any variational formulation. Indeed, parametric families of PDEs are an example where it is worth investing some (offline) computational effort to obtain stabilized linear systems that can be solved efficiently in an online stage, for a given range of parameters. Therefore, as a remedy for the first shortcoming, we explicitly compute (offline) a function mapping any PDE parameter, to the matrix of coefficients of optimal test functions (in some basis expansion) associated with that PDE parameter. Next, as a remedy for the second shortcoming, we use the low-rank approximation to hierarchically compress the (non-square) matrix of coefficients of optimal test functions. In order to accelerate this process, we train a neural network to learn a critical bottleneck of the compression algorithm (for a given set of PDE parameters). When solving online the resulting (compressed) Petrov–Galerkin formulation, we employ a GMRES iterative solver with inexpensive matrix–vector multiplications thanks to the low-rank features of the compressed matrix. We perform experiments showing that the full online procedure is as fast as an (unstable) Galerkin approach. We illustrate our findings by means of 2D–3D Eriksson–Johnson problems, together with 2D Helmholtz equation.},

  abstract     = {Highly accurate simulations of complex phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) typically require intrusive methods and entail expensive computational costs, which might become prohibitive when approximating steady-state solutions of PDEs for multiple combinations of control parameters and initial conditions. Therefore, constructing efficient reduced order models (ROMs) that enable accurate but fast predictions, while retaining the dynamical characteristics of the physical phenomenon as parameters vary, is of paramount importance . In this work, a data-driven, non-intrusive framework which combines ROM construction with reduced dynamics identification, is presented. Starting from a limited amount of full order solutions, the proposed approach leverages autoencoder neural networks with parametric sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to construct a low-dimensional dynamical model . This model can be queried to efficiently compute full-time solutions at new parameter instances, as well as directly fed to continuation algorithms. These aim at tracking the evolution of periodic steady-state responses as functions of system parameters, avoiding the computation of the transient phase, and allowing to detect instabilities and bifurcations. Featuring an explicit and parametrized modeling of the reduced dynamics, the proposed data-driven framework presents remarkable capabilities to generalize with respect to both time and parameters. Applications to structural mechanics and fluid dynamics problems illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Traditional Riemann solvers fall into two broad categories: exact solvers, which require multiple iterations to achieve high accuracy, and approximate linearized solvers, which achieve fast runtime at the expense of reduced accuracy. Here we explore learning-based Riemann solvers, termed FluxNets, as a new approach that balances accuracy and computational efficiency especially for transcritical and supercritical flow problems involving non-ideal thermodynamics. Various designs and training strategies are applied to fully connected neural networks . By comparing data-driven versus physics-informed loss functions, as well as neural networks of varying size, the results show that order-of-magnitude reductions in error compared to the Roe solver can be achieved with compact architectures. Numerical validation on 1D and 2D test cases reveals that a physics-informed FluxNet promotes smoothness, numerical stability , and generalizability , and is capable of producing entropy-stable results free of non-physical expansion shocks as compared to the Roe solver. Parallelization can be leveraged to accelerate inference such that the gains in accuracy are achieved at one quarter the runtime of exact solvers. The trade-off in accuracy versus efficiency may be justified in the case of non-ideal flows where even minor errors can result in spurious oscillations and instabilities.},

  abstract     = {The finite element-based three-dimensional crack propagation analysis has increasingly been used in many design assessment applications, particularly those high reliability-demanding structures subject to complex multi-axial fatigue loading. Such analysis is computationally intensive and poses a great challenge to current uncertainty quantification methods, which normally require a substantial number of finite element model runs. This study proposes a new method for uncertainty quantification of finite element-based three-dimensional crack propagation analysis under material uncertainty via extremely few, normally 2 d 2d , model runs, and d d is the number of uncertain variables. When the classical two-parameter Paris’ equation is employed as the fatigue crack growth rate model, a total number of 4 model runs are sufficient. The method employs the Hankel matrix of moments associated with the uncertainty variables to determine the optimal nodes and weights in the variable space for Gauss quadrature under prescribed distributions. A two-step time integration scheme is employed to further reduce the number of propagation steps within an individual finite element model run. The accuracy of the proposed method is validated using a practical case with realistic fatigue testing data and analytical solutions. The holistic method is applied to two three-dimensional crack propagation problems to demonstrate the effectiveness. It is shown that using 4 model runs the mean and variance of the crack front can be accurately captured under material uncertainty.},

To avoid the application of fine uniform meshes that are constrained by the element size requirement when adopting phase field models, an adaptive refinement strategy based on quadtree meshes is adopted. The unique advantage of the scaled boundary finite element method is conducive to the application of quadtree adaptivity, as it can be directly formulated on quadtree meshes without the need for any special treatment of hanging nodes. Efficient computation is achieved by exploiting the unique patterns of the quadtree cells. An appropriate scaling is applied to the relevant matrices and vectors according the physical size of the cells in the mesh during the simulations. This avoids repetitive calculations of cells with the same configurations. The proposed model is validated using a benchmark with a known analytical solution.

In this work, four-node quadrilateral and eight-node hexahedral elements are developed to simulate size effect based on strain gradient theory. Since only displacement DOFs are placed on each node without using displacement gradient DOFs, there is dramatic reduction in computational cost. The displacements are approximated with shape functions of standard finite elements . The displacement gradient field is approximated with linear polynomials and the coefficients are determined using the superconvergent patch recovery. It was found that the superconvergent properties of Barlow points are still valid even though the gradient recovery is performed during the calculation of the element stiffness matrix . The preconditioned conjugate gradient method is utilized to solve the system equations. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed elements. Size effect observed in experiments is captured by using the developed finite elements .},

  abstract     = {Along with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, scientific research enters a new era of AI. Topology optimization (TO) and AI technology are recently showing a growing trend of cross development, which has received continuous attentions from relative researchers. In this paper, we introduce a concept of Implicit Neural Representations from AI into TO field and establish a novel TO framework which is named as TOINR. In TOINR, the Topology Description Function is the inherent combination factor, which is constructed by a Neural Network (NN) and determines the topology statuses of structural materials in the design domain. We adopt sine as a periodic activation function combined with MLP as the architecture of the NN. The inputs of NN are a predefined set of spatial points’ coordinates, while the outputs are the implicit representations of corresponding topological boundaries. Along with updating NN’s parameters (i.e., design variables), the structural topologies iteratively evolve according to the responses analysis results and optimization functions . A boundary-adaptive multi-resolution finite element analysis method is developed to improve the physical response accuracy. At each step of TOINR, we ensure the computational differentiability . Thus, the automatic differentiation is used in sensitivity analysis. The multi-penalty function approach is applied to handle objects with constraints. Besides, we design an adaptive adjustment scheme for learning rates to enhance the stability of the optimization process. Numerical examples illustrate that TOINR can stably obtain optimized structures for different problems with high performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce ShipHullGAN, a generic parametric modeller built using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) for the versatile representation and generation of ship hulls. At a high level, the new model intends to address the current conservatism in the parametric ship design paradigm, where parametric modellers can only handle a particular ship type. We trained ShipHullGAN on a large dataset of 52,591 physically validated designs from a wide range of existing ship types, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, tugboats, and crew supply vessels. We developed a new shape extraction and representation strategy to convert all training designs into a common geometric representation of the same resolution, as typically GANs can only accept vectors of fixed dimension as input. A space-filling layer is placed right after the generator component to ensure that the trained generator can cover all design classes. During training, designs are provided in the form of a shape-signature tensor (SST) which harnesses the compact geometric representation using geometric moments that further enable the inexpensive incorporation of physics-informed elements in ship design. We have shown through extensive comparative studies and optimisation cases that ShipHullGAN can generate designs with augmented features resulting in versatile design spaces that produce traditional and novel designs with geometrically valid and practically feasible shapes.

Computational models are paving the way for personalized therapeutic treatment but they rely on accurate constitutive equations for predicting their biomechanical behavior .

To facilitate the viscoelastic modeling of cardiovascular soft tissues, we previously developed a fractional viscoelastic modeling approach, which extends existing hyperelastic models . This has comparable computational costs to the conventional hyperelastic model and only requires two additional material parameters for the viscoelastic response. This approach was demonstrated to be able to accurately capture the viscoelastic response of the human myocardium. However, the numerical properties of this fractional viscoelastic approach have not yet been examined. In this work, we present its implementation in Finite Element Analysis, examine its numerical properties in uniaxial extension and 2D inflation test examples, and examine its physiological implication in a computational model of an idealized left ventricle in a fully idealized circulatory system. Optimal convergence properties were observed and the importance of viscoelasticity during passive filling, ventricular motion, and regional fiber strain and stresses were explained.},

For spherical integral domains, PDOM recovers all types of Peridynamics (PD) and Dual-horizon Peridynamics (DH-PD) formulations. We also present a simple and efficient approach without zero-energy modes and develop PDOM for scattered data, ordinary and partial differential equations. One key feature of this approach is that it does not require any special treatment in the presence of discontinuities or singularities.

  abstract     = {The extended finite element method (XFEM) has achieved unprecedented success in crack analysis. However, challenges still remain for a multiple crack simulation. One issue is the difficulty of level set construction, where cracks are generally represented by combinations of different level set functions . Another issue is the rapidly increasing condition number of the global stiffness matrix , which is even more severe than the single crack case. In order to overcome these issues, we make two improvements as follows. On the one hand, inspired by the discontinuous description via cover cutting in Numerical Manifold Method (and later phantom node method in XFEM), we propose a level set templated cover cutting method, which makes use of level set values to cut a nodal patch and then to add virtual nodes. This method, which combines the advantages of both the level set method and the cover cutting technique, is simple and straightforward to implement. The method also plays a role in templated subdivision of discontinuous elements and hence presents an efficient and robust integration scheme. On the other hand, we extend the Improved XFEM (IXFEM), previously proposed by our research group, to the scenario of multiple crack problems. The method fundamentally eliminates the daunting issues of linear dependence and ill-conditioning of the standard XFEM, because it uses an extra-dof-free singularity enrichment around the crack tip. Numerical studies on multiple crack problems show that the developed approach offers various advantages: (1) Highly accurate SIF evaluation over the standard XFEM; (2) Well-conditioning of the global stiffness matrix independent of the number of cracks — condition number being of the same order as the standard FEM ; (3) Efficient and robust linear system solving and geometric computations. Thus the developed approach is well capable of modeling arbitrary multiple crack problems.},

  abstract     = {The failure process in a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system can be complicated due to complex microstructure, material property mismatch, high temperature change, chemical reactions during the failure process, etc. It brings considerable difficulties to the modeling technique. A complete failure process in TBC contains multiple failure types, e.g., bulk fracture, delamination of TC (top coating)/TGO (thermally grown oxide) interface and TGO/BC (bond coating) interface, and the interaction among them. However, existing approaches mainly focus on a single failure type and thus are faced with limits on exploring the complete failure mechanism. In this work, we propose a chemo-thermo-mechanical coupled phase field model based on thermodynamic laws, such that the complete TBC fracture process can be captured. The present contribution provides a step forward in comparison with the existing phase field models. Couplings among thermal conduction, material oxidation and damage are considered, and the fundamental differential equations are derived strictly follow the thermodynamic laws. The proposed model is first validated through several benchmarks, and then followed by several simulations of the failure process of a TBC system. The simulations and experiments show that the bulk fracture occurs when the TGO is thin at the cooling process, the growth effect of TGO layer causes damage initiation at the interface and finally transformed into the interfacial delamination, the interaction of interface cracking and bulk material cracking is captured. The proposed model is proven to be a powerful tool in solving the failure process of a TBC system and is promising to handle other similar problems.},

The parameters of the airfoil shape are provided as inputs to the PINN and the multidimensional search space of shape parameters is populated with collocation points to ensure that the Navier–Stokes equations are approximately satisfied throughout. We use the fact that the PINN is automatically differentiable to calculate gradients of the lift-to-drag ratio with respect to the airfoil shape parameters. This allows us to optimize with the L-BFGS gradient-based algorithm, which is more efficient than non-gradient-based algorithms, without deriving an adjoint code. We train the PINN with adaptive sampling of collocation points, such that the accuracy of the solution improves as the solution approaches the optimal point. We demonstrate this on two examples: one that optimizes a single parameter, and another that optimizes eleven parameters. The method is successful and, by comparison with conventional CFD, we find that the velocity and pressure fields have small pointwise errors and that the method converges to optimal parameters. We find that different PINNs converge to slightly different parameters, reflecting the fact that there are many closely-spaced local minima when using stochastic gradient descent. This method can be applied relatively easily to other optimization problems and avoids the difficult process of writing adjoint codes. It is, however, more computationally expensive than adjoint-based optimization. As knowledge about training PINNs improves and hardware dedicated to neural networks becomes faster, this method of simultaneous training and optimization with PINNs could become easier and faster than using adjoint codes.},

As an example application, the crack initiation, propagation and coalescence processes of gypsum specimens with various double-flaw configurations are investigated.

Hence, a new cross-scale optimization is proposed based on Wei–Hutchinson strain gradient theory by employing the non-local homogenization model, which could describe and explain the size dependence during optimization process when considering micro structures. The topological optimization procedure simultaneously has the ability of coupled computing by using subdomain parameterized coarse meshes. The numerical computations involved in the entire model can be solved in one iteration, which helps to eliminate mesh dependencies and greatly reduce the computation time . It is shown that the final stiffness of the optimized periodic structure can be significantly increased by considering the strain gradient theory compared with the classic homogenization scheme in the process of cross-scale optimization.},

  abstract     = {The relationships between porous microstructures and transport properties are of fundamental importance in various scientific and engineering applications . Due to the intricacy, stochasticity and heterogeneity of porous media, reliable characterization and modeling of transport properties often require a complete dataset of internal microstructure samples. However, it is often an unbearable cost to acquire sufficient 3D digital microstructures by purely using microscopic imaging systems . This paper presents a machine learning-based technique to hierarchically reconstruct 3D well-connected porous microstructures from one isotropic or several anisotropic low-cost 2D exemplar(s). To compactly characterize the large-scale microstructural features , a Gaussian image pyramid is built for each 2D exemplar. Local morphology patterns are collected from the Gaussian image pyramids, and then they serve as the training data to embed the 2D morphological statistics into feed-forward neural networks at multiple length levels. By using a specially-developed morphology integration scheme, the 3D morphological statistics at different levels can be inferred from the statistics-informed neural networks . Gibbs sampling is adopted to hierarchically reconstruct 3D microstructures by using multi-level 3D morphological statistics, where the large-scale, regional and local morphological patterns are statistically generated and successively added to the same 3D random field. The proposed method is tested on a series of porous media with distinct morphologies, and the statistical equivalence between the reconstructed and the real microstructures is systematically evaluated by comparing morphological descriptors and transport properties. The results demonstrate that the proposed 2D-to-3D microstructure reconstruction method is a universal and efficient approach to generating morphologically and physically realistic samples of porous media.},

  abstract     = {This work presents topology optimisation implementations for linear elastic compliance minimisation in three dimensions , accelerated using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Three different open-source implementations are presented for linear problems. Two implementations use GPU acceleration, based on either OpenMP 4.5 or the Futhark language to implement the hardware acceleration . Both GPU implementations are based on high level GPU frameworks, and hence, avoid the need for expertise knowledge of e.g. CUDA or OpenCL . The third implementation is a vectorised and multi-threaded CPU code, which is included for reference purposes. It is shown that both GPU accelerated codes are able to solve large-scale topology optimisation problems with 65.5 million elements in approximately 2 h using a single GPU, while the reference implementation takes approximately 3 h and 10 min using 48 CPU cores. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to solve nonlinear topology optimisation problems using GPU acceleration, demonstrated by a nonlinear end-compliance optimisation with finite strains and a Neo-Hookean material model discretised by 1 million elements.},

The DEM captures discontinuous material behaviour, such as fractured and granular media. However, applying the method to real-life applications embedded into infinite domains is challenging. The authors propose a solution to this challenge by coupling the DEM with the BEM. The capability of the BEM to model infinite domains accurately and efficiently, without the need for numerical artifices, makes it the perfect complement to the DEM. This study proposes a direct monolithic interface-based coupling method that resolves any incompatibilities between the two methods in two dimensions. The benchmark results show that the proposed methodology consistently produces results that align with analytical solutions. The final example in the paper showcases the full potential of this innovative methodology, where the DEM models a fracturing process, and the BEM evaluates its far-field effect.},

  abstract     = {The numerical simulation of hydraulic fractures is a critical yet challenging computational problem due to its multi-physics nature. This paper develops an integrated hydraulic fracturing simulator by coupling a planar three-dimensional (PL3D) fracture propagation model with an efficient Eulerian–Lagrangian (E–L) proppant transport model. The fracture propagation model uses the finite volume method (FVM) and displacement discontinuity method (DDM) to solve the fluid flow and rock deformation , respectively. For proppant transport, we develop a pseudo-3D multiphase particle-in-cell (P3D MP-PIC) model, in which the fluid flow is addressed by FVM as a continuum, but the particles are tracked in a Lagrangian fashion as discrete phases. In contrast to Eulerian–Eulerian (E–E) proppant transport models, the P3D MP-PIC can efficiently deal with multi-modal particle simulations (i.e., particles of different sizes or materials) and avoid the problem of numerical diffusion. The fracture propagation and proppant transport models are validated by analytical solutions and laboratory experiments. We adopt a one-way coupling strategy to consider the effect of complex fracture propagation and fluid leak-off on slurry transport, in which the dynamic fracture geometry and fluid leak-off is first computed via the fracture propagation model , followed by the fully coupled fluid–particle simulation using the P3D MP-PIC. The integrated model can simulate the fracturing treatments in multilayered reservoirs with varying confining stresses at an industrial field scale. The simulation results can improve the prediction of effective/propped fracture geometries and better the fracturing designs.},

  abstract     = {Cellular structures have recently been received a tremendous growth in discussions and applications in the engineering due to their several fascinating structural properties, such as the ultra-lightweight, high stiffness and crashworthiness. However, the discussions on the design of cellular structures in the complex structural domain with the non-conforming mesh are still unavailable, resulting from the fact that the non-conforming mesh causes several difficulties in numerical analysis and design optimization. Hence, the main purpose of the work is to propose a Multi-Patch Isogeometric Topology Optimization (MP-ITO) method with powerful capabilities for periodic or graded cellular structures. Firstly, the Nitsche’s method is applied to couple non-conforming meshes in multiple NURBS patches and conduct multi-patch isogeometric analysis. Secondly, a multi-patch topology description model is developed, in which a local smoothing mechanism and the two-resolution scheme of discretization meshes are constructed to avoid terrible structural features and improve smoothness and continuity of boundaries at the interfaces within adjacent subdomains. The separation and independency of the Density Distribution Function (DDF) at each subdomain can offer high flexibility for cellular designs with the imposing of several kinds of periodic constraints. Thirdly, the MP-ITO method is proposed for complex structures and the mathematical formulation for cellular designs considering periodic constraints is developed. Finally, the effectiveness and indispensability of the local smoothing mechanism and the two-resolution scheme in the MP-ITO are discussed, and several numerical examples are addressed to present the compelling effectiveness and capabilities of the MP-ITO method with the high flexibility on the designs of periodic and graded cellular structures.},

Various active learning functions have been proposed to reduce the computation burden of Kriging-based reliability analysis for engineering problems. This paper proposes a new active learning Kriging-based method for estimating the failure probability. A penalty learning function is proposed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the failure probability estimate based on a simple penalty function. Also, a distance constraint term is considered to avoid a cluster of the selected sample points. Additionally, by an error-based stopping criterion, convergence conditions of the proposed new active learning reliability analysis method are investigated. Finally, five numerical examples are provided to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method and convergence strategy. Numerical results demonstrated that the novel proposed method significantly improves the computational efficiency of reliability analysis with high estimating accuracy of the failure probability.},

The advantage of peridynamic method in the modeling of crack propagation is taken into consideration to be coupled with that of finite elements which is computationally less expensive and covers various boundary value problems . In this novel method, the whole domain of the problem is initially dominated by FEM solver with coarse mesh grids. Coupling process is then introduced to those regions which have critical conditions according to damage criterion. The capability of the proposed coupling method in the modeling of cohesive crack growth in quasi-brittle materials is demonstrated. In comparison to other conventional PD-FEM coupling methods, the computational cost of the proposed method is considerably improved and total running time of the solution is significantly attenuated.

For applications in structural dynamics, the solution of the linear system is frequently approximated through so-called mass lumping, which consists in replacing the mass matrix by some diagonal approximation . Mass lumping has been widely used in engineering practice for decades already and has a sound mathematical theory supporting it for finite element methods using the classical Lagrange basis. However, the theory for more general basis functions is still missing. Our paper partly addresses this shortcoming. Some special and practically relevant properties of lumped mass matrices are proved and we discuss how these properties naturally extend to banded and Kronecker product matrices whose structure allows to solve linear systems very efficiently. Our theoretical results are applied to isogeometric discretizations but are not restricted to them.},

  abstract     = {Lattice-based mechanical metamaterials are known to exhibit quite a unique mechanical behavior owing to their rational internal architecture. This includes unusual properties such as a negative Poisson’s ratio, which can be easily tuned in reentrant-hexagonal metamaterials by adjusting the angles between beams. However, changing the angles also affects the geometrical dimensions of the unit cell. We show that by replacing traditional straight beams with curved ones, it is possible to control Poisson’s ratio of reentrant-hexagonal metamaterials keeping their overall dimensions constant. While the mechanical properties of these structures can be predicted through finite element simulations or, in some cases, analytically, many applications require the identification of architectures with specific target properties. To solve this inverse problem , we introduce a deep learning framework for generating metamaterials with desired properties . By supplying the generative model with a guide structure in addition to the target properties, we are able to generate a large number of alternative architectures with the same properties and express a preference for a specific shape. Deep learning predictions, together with experimental measurements, prove that this approach allows us to accurately generate unit cells fitting specific properties for curved-beam metamaterials.},

The state-of-the-art approaches transform equality information into inequality information by introducing an auxiliary standard normal parameter. These methods, however, encounter the loss of computational efficiency due to the difficulty in finding the maximum of the likelihood function, the large coefficient of variation (COV) associated with the posterior failure probability and the inapplicability to dynamic updating problems where new information is constantly available. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an innovative method called RU-SAIS (reliability updating using sequential adaptive importance sampling), which combines elements of sequential importance sampling and K -means clustering to construct a series of important sampling densities (ISDs) using Gaussian mixture . The last ISD of the sequence is further adaptively modified through application of the cross entropy method. The performance of RU-SAIS is demonstrated by three examples. Results show that RU-SAIS achieves a more accurate and robust estimator of the posterior failure probability than the existing methods such as subset simulation .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a local model reduction approach for subsurface flow problems in stochastic and highly heterogeneous media. Generally, we apply the mixed generalized multiscale finite element method (MGMsFEM) to solve the single-phase flow equation. As for the two-phase flow, we use mixed finite element method (MFEM) with piecewise constant bases on a fine mesh to deal with the transport equation and a standard Implicit Pressure Explicit Saturation (IMPES) scheme is utilized in the time-marching process. To guarantee the mass conservation, we consider the mixed formulation of the flow problem and aim to solve the problem in a coarse grid to reduce the complexity of a large-scale system. We decompose the entire problem into a training and a testing stage, namely the offline coarse-grid multiscale basis generation stage and online simulation stage with different parameters. In the training stage, a parameter-independent and small-dimensional multiscale basis function space is constructed, which includes the media, source and boundary information. The key part of the basis generation stage is to solve some special local problems. With the parameter-independent basis space, one can efficiently solve the concerned problems corresponding to different samples of permeability field in a coarse grid without repeatedly constructing a multiscale space for each new sample. A rigorous analysis on convergence of the proposed method is presented. In particular, we consider a generalization error, where bases constructed with one source will be used to a different source. In the numerical experiments, we apply the proposed method for both single-phase and two-phase flow problems. Simulation results for both 2D and 3D representative models demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model reduction techniques.},

  abstract     = {Modelling the highly localised and rapid phenomena occurring during metal additive manufacturing (MAM) processes such as the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) demands the adoption of very fine time- and space-discretisation and therefore high computational cost for the classical simulation approaches, namely the finite element method (FEM). Particularly, when the solution is required for a range of scenarios, e.g. in sensitivity or optimisation analyses, computation costs of such simulations are not affordable. As an alternative strategy, this study explores the application of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) as a low-cost physics-based simulation approach for the thermal analysis of the LPBF process, through which reliable transient and steady-state temperature profiles for single-track LPBF depositions are achieved. An unsupervised learning strategy is employed for PINNs to parametrically solve the heat transfer equation for the LPBF process. The trained PINNs calculate the temperature profiles and the melt-pool dimensions evolving during the LPBF process for any given set of material’s thermal properties and process conditions at practically zero computational cost. The reliability of the PINNs outcomes is verified through ground-truth data generated based on several benchmark equivalent finite element simulations .},

  abstract     = {The mechanical behaviors of polymer composites exhibit strong time-dependent nonlinearities , and the tensile and compressive strengths can be vastly different. Such a strength differential effect poses a great challenge in fracture modeling using existing phase-field models. To address this problem, this study develops a new viscoelastic fracture phase-field model, in which the strain tensor spectral decomposition is proposed to decompose the elastic energy of the equilibrium and non-equilibrium branches into tensile and compressive components. The non-negativity of elastic energy and the thermodynamic consistency are theoretically verified. Various case studies , spanning from material uniaxial tension–compression and compression under isostatic pressure to fracture processes of realistic structural components, are used to validate the proposed method. Results of the proposed method are compared with those of existing methods and the actual testing data of polymer composites to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. It is shown that the proposed method can accurately model not only the strong strength differential effect but also the isostatic pressure dependence of viscoelastic materials. Furthermore, the proposed method offers a more precise prediction of the fracture path and can deal with the loading rate effect.},

  abstract     = {Designing durable polymer-based materials and structures requires understanding how the physical processes and failure mechanisms associated with moisture intrusion and loading rate combine to produce the complex damage modes observed in their applications. While numerous experiments have assisted us in gaining general insight into the above issues, in-situ characterization is still lacking, and rational prediction on the failure procedure of polymer in the moisture–mechanical​ coupling environment remains challenging. Here we present a thermodynamically consistent theoretical framework and its computational implementation to reveal how the dependence of epoxy’s mechanical behavior on rate- and moisture dictates the initiation and evolution of highly localized deformation zones and cracks. A multi-physical hydrothermal-viscoelastic–viscoplastic-damage model is first proposed to fully couple the effects of strain rate, moisture degradation, strain softening, and adiabatic heating of the bulk epoxy in a highly humid environment. The constitutive models are augmented by a phase field that enables spontaneous tracing of the nucleation and growth of cracks under a wide range of strain rates (from 4.60 × 10 −5 /s to 3.80 × 10 3 /s). The theoretical model is implemented into an efficient computational procedure that is used to calculate illustrative examples to demonstrate the influence of the intimate coupling between the multi-physical phenomena. The results highlight significant mechanisms underlying the coupled damage process, including: heat accumulation along the crack propagation path; identification of the energies associated with moisture-induced toughening; prediction of crack deflection in the presence of moisture absorption; and illustration that a portion of the plastic work plays a dominant role in the nucleation of cracks at a wide scale of strain rates.},

A way to circumvent this problem is to consider a quasi-Lagrangian SPH scheme and use a Particle Shifting Technique (PST). In this framework, we include an approximate Riemann solver to represent the particle interaction and obtain two different quasi-Lagrangian Riemann-based SPH schemes: one is a mass-constant SPH model whereas the other is derived from an ALE formalism. These schemes are examined and validated by focusing on their energy balance. In particular, the energy contribution provided by the terms associated to Riemann solver and PST is studied from both a theoretical and numerical point of view. The consistency and the diffusive properties of these energy terms are investigated on test cases involving confined and free-surface flows. Albeit the investigation is performed for a specific Riemann solver and PST, the proposed methodology can be easily extended to other formulations.},

Existing embedded beam theories are geometrically linear or two-dimensional, motivating the need for the present work. We propose a geometrically nonlinear beam theory that accounts for cracks through displacement discontinuities in 3D. To represent the three modes of fracture inside an element, we enrich each displacement field with an incompatible mode parameter in the form of a jump, an additional degree of freedom. We then eliminate these nodeless degrees of freedom through static condensation and evaluate them within the framework of inelasticity by utilizing an operator split solution procedure. Seeing that the coupled strain-softening problem is non-convex, we present an alternating minimization (staggered) algorithm, thus retaining a positive definite stiffness matrix . Finally, the four-parameter representation by quaternions describes a three-dimensional finite rotation. We demonstrate a very satisfying and robust performance of these new finite elements in several numerical examples , including the fracture of random lattice structures with application to fibrous materials. We show that accounting for geometrical nonlinearity in the beam formulation is necessary for direct numerical simulations of fiber networks regardless of the density.},

Regularization techniques are adopted to efficiently evaluate the weakly singular and Cauchy principal integrals in boundary integral equations. Potential problems and elastostatic problems are mainly concerned in this article as a demonstration. The proposed method has several outstanding advantages: First, the dimensions of the original problem are reduced by one, thus the degrees of freedom are greatly reduced. Second, the proposed method does not require any extra treatment to introduce the boundary conditions, since they are naturally considered through the boundary integral equations. Therefore, the method is suitable for complex geometries . Third, BINN is suitable for problems on the infinite or semi-infinite domains.

To ensure that a structure performs adequately over a wide range of thermoelastic loading conditions and thermal expansion, incorporating the finite strain theory in the design strategy is critical. In this study, we investigate the two energy-based objective functions, namely the end compliance and strain energy under thermomechanical conditions. The numerical examples considered indicate that the optimized layout is highly dependent on the selected objective function; such differences among the layouts can be attributed to the manner in which the structure accommodates the changing temperature. The end compliance is minimized by leveraging the direction of the thermal load to offset the mechanical load, while the minimization of the strain energy contributes to the strength of the structure by limiting the thermal contribution to the overall stress within the structure. Furthermore, we show the effects of different strain assumptions on the optimality of layouts. Thus, this study reveals the significance of adopting each thermoelastic compliance and highlights the importance of accounting for structural nonlinearity when considering the thermal effect.},

  abstract     = {Choosing the best constitutive model and the right set of model parameters is at the heart of continuum mechanics . For decades, the gold standard in constitutive modeling has been to first select a model and then fit its parameters to data. However, the success of this approach dependends hugely on user experience and personal preference. Here we propose a new method that simultaneously and fully autonomously discovers the best model and parameters to explain experimental data . Mathematically, model discovery translates into a complex non-convex optimization problem . We solve this problem by formulating it as a neural network , and leverage the success, robustness, and stability of the optimization tools developed in deep learning . Yet, instead of using a classical off-the-shelf neural network , we design our own family of Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks with activation functions that feature popular constitutive models and parameters that have a clear physical interpretation. Our new network inherently satisfies general kinematic, thermodynamic, and physical constraints and trains robustly, even with sparse data. We illustrate its potential for biaxial extension experiments on skin and demonstrate that the majority of network weights train to zero, while the small subset of non-zero weights defines the discovered model. Unlike classical network weights, these weights are physically interpretable and translate naturally into engineering parameters and microstructural features such as stiffnesses and fiber orientations. Our results suggest that Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks enable a fully automated model, parameter, and experiment discovery and could induce a paradigm shift in constitutive modeling, from manual to automated model selection and parameterization.

To verify the theoretical feasibility, the susceptibility of material fracture properties to hydrogen content is well revealed, and a typical problem, i.e., damage of multi-layered composite hydrogen storage vessels in distinct working stages, is investigated and discussed insightfully. We highlight that (i) the fracture phase field theory is rederived under the thermodynamic consistent framework; (ii) the proposed computational model can accurately capture the heat conduction response under the coupled effects of chemical diffusion and crack propagation; (iii) through a detailed analysis of the energy evolution, the model allows precise yield of the dominant mechanisms in the diverse damage stages of the materials. This study can reproduce the different damage patterns of composite structures under the action of multi-physical fields in extreme environments, thus providing a predictive computational approach to prevent disastrous failures.},

Firstly, underlying the inverse piezoelectric effects , a load-independent layout design framework of piezoelectric actuators is developed in the context of topology optimization , in which the desired structural vibration suppression can be achieved and the robustness of system performance index representing actuating energies may be guaranteed once uncertainties are involved. Then, based on the direct piezoelectric effects, some piezoelectric sensors are effectively selected from the optimized distributed piezoelectric elements for mechanical load identification considering inevitable signal noises and material dispersion To improve the accuracy of identified results, an adaptive load identification method and an independence-driven sensor selection strategy are conducted. To strengthen the robustness of identified results, an uncertain-oriented load identification method and variance-driven sensor selection strategy are completed. Moreover, interval quantification and propagation methods are adopted to deal with multi-source uncertainties.

The presence of geometrical parameters in unfitted domain discretizations entails challenges for the application of standard ROMs. Therefore, in this work we propose a methodology based on (i) extension of snapshots on the background mesh and (ii) localization strategies to decrease the number of reduced basis functions. The method we obtain is computationally efficient and accurate, while it is agnostic with respect to the underlying discretization choice. We test the applicability of the proposed framework with numerical experiments on two model problems, namely the Poisson and linear elasticity problems . In particular, we study several benchmarks formulated on two-dimensional, trimmed domains discretized with splines and we observe a significant reduction of the online computational cost compared to standard ROMs for the same level of accuracy. Moreover, we show the applicability of our methodology to a three-dimensional geometry of a linear elastic problem .},

An algorithm for determining the basic probabilistic characteristics has been developed using the iterative generalized stochastic higher-order perturbation method adjacent to symmetrically truncated Gaussian random variables. It has been confirmed that usage of a sufficiently high order of the Truncated Iterative Stochastic Perturbation Technique (TISPT) allows for achieving any desired accuracy in determining up to the fourth-order probabilistic characteristics of static structural response. The semi-analytical probabilistic approach is the reference solution in this study, which is based upon the same composite response functions determined with the use of the Least Squares Method created using specific series of FEM experiments. The entire methodology has been provided for the given extreme value of the coefficient of variation α max αmax of the input uncertainty source. On the other hand, a selection procedure of the stochastic perturbation method order to achieve 1% numerical accuracy in all up to the fourth-order probabilistic moments has been proposed.

Aiming at having a computationally efficient solution via spatial adjustable resolutions for the two phases, the SPH-FEA coupling herein presented implements the Euler–Bernoulli beam model, based on a simplified model that incorporates axial and flexural deformations, to introduce a solid solver in the DualSPHysics framework. This approach is particularly functional and very precise for slender beam elements undergoing large displacements, and large deformations can also be experienced by the structural elements due to the non-linear FEA implementation via a co-rotational formulation. In this two-way coupling, the structure is discretised in the SPH domain using boundary particles on which the forces exerted by fluid phases are computed. Such forces are passed over to the FEA structural solver that updates the beam shape and, finally, the particle positions are subsequently reshuffled to represent the deformed shape at each time step. The SPH-FEA coupling is validated against four reference cases, which prove the model to be as accurate as other approaches presented in literature.},

The resulting curvature dependence then implicitly affects the loading behaviour, the predicted fracture energy and also the damage distribution. Two extended approaches are presented here for curvature control and applied to a micromorphic gradient damage model and to a phase-field model for fracture. Both allow for a better control of the crack path and consider the Hessian of the non-local damage field by means of an additional micromorphic field, since curvature is connected to second derivatives. The first approach is based on an additional curvature-dependent potential within the Helmholtz energy and automatically fulfils the second law of thermodynamics . The second approach modifies the micro forces of the balance law that is responsible for the curvature dependence directly. Unlike the first approach, it allows to eliminate the curvature dependence completely. However, thermodynamic consistency has to be checked explicitly.},

This paper proposes a deep learning based closure modeling approach for classical POD-Galerkin reduced order models (ROM). The proposed approach is theoretically grounded, using neural networks to approximate well studied operators. In contrast with most previous works, the present CD-ROM approach is based on an interpretable continuous memory formulation, derived from simple hypotheses on the behavior of partially observed dynamical systems . The final corrected models can hence be simulated using most classical time stepping schemes. The capabilities of the CD-ROM approach are demonstrated on two classical examples from Computational Fluid Dynamics , as well as a parametric case, the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation.},

  abstract     = {While ventricular electromechanics is extensively studied in both physiological and pathological conditions, four-chamber heart models have only been addressed recently; most of these works however neglect atrial contraction. Indeed, as atria are characterized by a complex anatomy and a physiology that is strongly influenced by the ventricular function, developing computational models able to capture the physiological atrial function and atrioventricular interaction is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a biophysically detailed electromechanical model of the whole human heart that considers both atrial and ventricular contraction. Our model includes: (i) an anatomically accurate whole-heart geometry; (ii) a comprehensive myocardial fiber architecture; (iii) a biophysically detailed microscale model for the active force generation; (iv) a 0D closed-loop model of the circulatory system, fully-coupled with the mechanical model of the heart; (v) the fundamental interactions among the different core models , such as the mechano-electric feedback or the fibers-stretch and fibers-stretch-rate feedbacks; (vi) specific constitutive laws and model parameters for each cardiac region. Concerning the numerical discretization, we propose an efficient segregated-intergrid-staggered scheme that includes a computationally efficient strategy to handle the non-conductive regions. We also propose extending recent stabilization techniques – regarding the circulation and the fibers-stretch-rate feedback – to the whole heart, demonstrating their cruciality for obtaining a stable formulation in a four-chamber scenario. We are able to reproduce the healthy cardiac function for all the heart chambers, in terms of pressure–volume loops, time evolution of pressures, volumes and fluxes, and three-dimensional cardiac deformation, with volumetric indexes within reference ranges for cardiovascular magnetic resonance. We also show the importance of considering atrial contraction, fibers-stretch-rate feedback and the proposed stabilization techniques, by comparing the results obtained with and without these features in the model. In particular, we show that the fibers-stretch-rate feedback, often neglected due to the numerical challenges that it entails, plays a fundamental role in the regulation of the blood flux ejected by ventricles. The proposed model represents the state-of-the-art electromechanical model of the iHEART ERC project – an Integrated Heart Model for the Simulation of the Cardiac Function – and is a fundamental step toward the building of physics-based digital twins of the human heart.},

  abstract     = {Rubber-like materials have a broad scope of applications due to their unique properties like high stretchability and increased toughness. Hence, computational models for simulating their fracture behavior are paramount for designing them against failures. In this study, the phase field fracture approach is integrated with a multiscale polymer model for predicting the fracture behavior in elastomers. At the microscale, damaged polymer chains are modeled to be made up of a number of elastic chain segments pinned together. Using the phase field approach, the damage in the chains is represented using a continuous variable. Both the bond stretch internal energy and the entropic free energy of the chain are assumed to drive the damage, and the advantages of this assumption are expounded. A framework for utilizing the non-affine microsphere model for damaged systems is proposed by considering the minimization of a hypothetical undamaged free energy, ultimately connecting the chain stretch to the macroscale deformation gradient. At the macroscale, a thermodynamically consistent formulation is derived in which the total dissipation is assumed to be mainly due to the rupture of molecular bonds. Using a monolithic scheme, the proposed model is numerically implemented and the resulting three-dimensional simulation predictions are compared with existing experimental data. The capability of the model to qualitatively predict the propagation of complex crack paths and quantitatively estimate the overall fracture behavior is verified. Additionally, the effect of the length scale parameter on the predicted fracture behavior is studied for an inhomogeneous system.},

In the first part, different formulations for the total energy, characterized by different choices for the coupling between the damage and the poro-mechanical fields, are evaluated based on their ability to lead to qualitatively reasonable predictions for two benchmark cases of free and restrained desiccation. In the second part, for a selected energy formulation, we conduct the variational analysis of the quasi-static damage evolution. Hereby, we focus on restrained desiccation under a given capillary pressure distribution, resulting from the solution of Richards equation with either flux-driven or pressure-driven boundary conditions. Extending the analysis in Sicsic et al. (2014) to the present case, we show that the damage evolution follows first a fundamental branch without localization, and then bifurcates into another branch with damage localization, which leads to the initiation of periodic cracks. The analysis enables the computation of the drying crack spacing as a function of material and loading parameters.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose an efficient solution of the inverse Stefan problem by multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization. We construct a multi-fidelity Gaussian process surrogate model by combining many low-fidelity estimates of a solidification problem with only a few high-fidelity measurements. To solve the inverse problem, we employ the Gaussian process model in a Bayesian optimization approach based on a multi-fidelity knowledge gradient acquisition function. To account for the specific structure of the target function, we reformulate it as a composite function and thus significantly improve the stability of the optimization procedure. Target values can be switched easily, and previously obtained samples and surrogate models can be reused. The proposed method iteratively improves the recommended solution of the inverse problem. Explicitly adding recommended points of previous iterations to the solution procedure enhances the convergence properties of the algorithm. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm by solving the inverse problem for a planar solidification front in a single-fidelity setting. Process parameters are identified for targeted crystal-growth velocities during directional dendritic solidification. The relation between these velocities and process parameters, such as undercooling, thermal diffusivity, capillarity, and capillary anisotropy, defines the thermo-mechanical properties of the solidified part in metal-based additive manufacturing. Material design is based on the corresponding inverse problem. Cost-efficiency of solving the inverse problem is improved by introducing a fidelity hierarchy based on coarse-grid approximations of high-fidelity numerical simulations. The open-source simulation framework ALPACA for multiphase flows allows to generate data at all fidelities. We demonstrate the superior convergence properties of the presented multi-fidelity approach by comparison with an approach solely based on high-fidelity measurements of the tip velocity.},

  abstract     = {The newly proposed nonlocal macro-meso-scale consistent damage model (NMMD) is extended to compression/shear-dominate failure problems. For this purpose, the nonlocal strain of a material point pair in the NMMD is split into elastic strain and structured strain according to the theory of structured deformation. Then the structured part of the deformation of a material point pair, i.e., the structured positive elongation quantity, can be evaluated based on the structured strain. When the structured positive elongation quantity, rather than the original full positive elongation, of a material point pair exceeds a critical value, the material point pair become damaged, leading to mesoscopic damage. The macroscopic topologic damage at one point is then given by the weighted summation of mesoscopic damage of the point pairs connected to this point within its influence domain. Through the energetic degradation function, which bridges the damage in the geometric sense and the damage in the energetic sense, the topologic damage is incorporated into the framework of continuum damage mechanics . This model can be solved numerically. In contrast to the original NMMD for tensile-failure dominate problems, the driving force of topologic damage, i.e., the positive elongation quantity of material point pairs, is modified according to different types of structured strain, and thus the extended model is appropriate for various fracture mechanisms if a proper structured strain is adopted. The proposed model facilitates implementation, and can not only trace the crack path automatically without initial cracks, but also accurately predict the load–deformation curves without mesh sensitivity. The computational efficiency of the proposed model is illustrated via a benchmark problem. Examples verifies that when the masonry-like structured strain is adopted the structured deformation driven NMMD can well capture the vertical crack in quasi-brittle materials under uniaxial compression. In addition, an intuitive interpretation in the principal strain space is given to reveal the underlying physical mechanism for this problem. Alternatively, if the deviatoric structured strain is adopted to modify the driving force of topologic damage, the horizontal crack (true mode II crack) under pure shear can be obtained via NMMD. It is numerically verified that the mode II crack evolves according to the von Mises criterion , i.e., the crack propagates along the direction of the largest distortion energy density. Numerical results also indicate that the key features of the crack patterns from the NMMD and the phase field model are similar when the same structured strain is adopted to decompose the driving force of damage in these two models. This consistency between NMMD and the phase field model is preliminarily interpreted by Green’s function theory. Problems to be further investigated are also discussed, especially for the extension to anisotropic materials.},

  abstract     = {A coupling approach of the isogeometric–meshfree method and the peridynamic method is developed for static and dynamic crack propagation . The coupling approach exhibits advantages in the flexibility of modeling cracks and the exactness of geometry representation. The isogeometric–meshfree method, which adopts the moving least-squares approximations to establish the equivalence between meshfree shape functions and isogeometric basis functions, is capable of obtaining the exact geometry. The isogeometric–meshfree nodes located on the geometry can be directly coupled with peridynamic points by the balanced force principle, which is straightforward and effective. With this approach, the boundary conditions can be enforced directly using the isogeometric–meshfree method, and the surface effects of peridynamics are effectively eliminated. Moreover, the present approach is flexible in switching the isogeometric–meshfree nodes to peridynamic points and achieving adaptive coupling with the same convergence rate as the one for the isogeometric–meshfree method, which is higher than the one for the original peridynamic method. The dual-horizon peridynamic method is adopted for non-uniform discretization . Based on the exact geometry representation, the coupling approach is further extended to crack problems with contact loading. Several representative examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the present approach in solving static/dynamic crack problems and studying fractures caused by contact.},

  abstract     = {A variational formulation of small strain ductile fracture , based on a phase-field modeling of crack propagation , is proposed. The formulation is based on an effective stress description of gradient plasticity, combined with an AT1 phase-field model. Starting from established variational statements of finite-step elastoplasticity for generalized standard materials, a mixed variational statement is consistently derived, incorporating in a rigorous way a variational finite-step update for both the elastoplastic and the phase-field dissipations. The complex interaction between ductile and brittle dissipation mechanisms is modeled by assuming a plasticity driven crack propagation model . A non-variational function of the equivalent plastic strain is then introduced to modulate the phase-field dissipation based on the developed plastic strains. Particular care has been devoted to the formulation of a consistent Newton–Raphson scheme for the case of Mises plasticity, with a global return mapping and relative tangent matrix, supplemented by a line-search scheme, for the solution of the gradient elastoplasticity problem for fixed phase field. The resulting algorithm has proved to be very robust and computationally effective. Application to several benchmark tests show the robustness and accuracy of the proposed model.},

In order to deploy pROMs in the context of high-consequence decision making, accurate error estimates are required to determine the region(s) of applicability in the parameter space. The following paper considers the dual-weighted residual (DWR) error estimate for pROMs and compares it to another promising pROM error estimate, machine learned error models (MLEM). In this paper, we show how DWR can be applied to ROMs and then evaluate DWR on two partial differential equations (PDEs): a two-dimensional linear convection–reaction–diffusion equation, and a three-dimensional static hyper-elastic beam. It is shown that DWR is able to estimate errors for pROMs extrapolating outside of their training set while MLEM is best suited for pROMs used to interpolate within the pROM training set.},

To enhance the smoothness of the structural boundaries, a multilevel isogeometric density field (IDF) defined at control points (CPs) is designed by utilizing the values of the non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) basis functions from the previous design iteration . A global stress measure is approximated by a smooth maximum function with an additional error term . The k-means clustering originally from signal processing is used to partition the stress observations with dynamic centroids and indices, which improves the accuracy of the sensitivity results. The sensitivity analyses of the stress-related problems are derived from the multilevel IDF model.

This method utilizes a two-scale expansion of the temperature field of spatially uniform composites in terms of macroscopic and fluctuating contributions. The latter is estimated using deep neural network layers. The DHN is trained on a set of collocation points to obtain the fluctuating temperature field over the unit cell domain by minimizing a cost function given in terms of residuals of strong form steady-state heat conduction governing differential equations. Novel use of a periodic layer with several independent periodic functions with adjustable training parameters ensures that periodic boundary conditions of temperature and temperature gradients at the unit cell edges are exactly satisfied. Automatic differentiation is utilized to correctly compute the fluctuating temperature gradients. Homogenized properties and local temperature and gradient distributions of unit cells reinforced by unidirectional fiber or weakened by a hole are compared with finite-element reference results, demonstrating remarkable correlation but without discontinuities associated with temperature gradient distributions in the finite-element simulations. We also illustrate that the DHN enhanced with transfer learning provides a substantially more efficient and accurate simulation of multiple random fiber distributions relative to training the network from scratch.},

As materials with properties beyond natural materials are required to achieve this task, metamaterials with spatially varying microstructures are employed in this work. Similar to the functionally graded material , the present metamaterial has graded stiffness from the cloak to the surrounding region, via graded material volume fractions in the microstructures. Therefore, we present a multiscale topology optimization model that considers the cloak macrostructure and material microstructures , by which concurrent optimization of the structural topology and material properties of mechanical cloaking devices is investigated. The optimization model is implemented via (1) novel mathematical formulations for material microstructures based on the finite element method (FEM) and (2) an extended moving iso-surface threshold (MIST) method with a multi-volume fraction topology update scheme. Numerical examples are provided for multiscale design cases for cloaking a void or stiffer solid (e.g., wood, copper, and diamond), and also include finite element analysis (FEA) of the resulting multiscale metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a rigorous mathematical formulation for topology optimization of a macro structure undergoing ductile failure . The prediction of ductile solid materials which exhibit dominant plastic deformation is an intriguingly challenging task and plays an extremely important role in various engineering applications . Here, we rely on the phase-field approach to fracture which is a widely adopted framework for modeling and computing the fracture failure phenomena in solids. The first objective is to optimize the topology of the structure in order to minimize its mass, while accounting for structural damage. To do so, the topological phase transition function (between solid and void phases) is introduced, thus resulting in an extension of all the governing equations. Our second objective is to additionally enhance the fracture resistance of the structure. Accordingly, two different formulations are proposed. One requires only the residual force vector of the deformation field as a constraint, while in the second formulation, the residual force vector of the deformation and phase-field fracture simultaneously have been imposed. An incremental minimization principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative materials are used to derive the governing equations. Thereafter, to obtain optimal topology to enhance the structural resistance due to fracture, the level-set-based formulation is formulated. The level-set-based topology optimization is employed to seek an optimal layout with smooth and clear boundaries. Sensitivities are derived using the analytical gradient-based adjoint method to update the level-set surface for both formulations. Here, the evolution of the level-set surface is realized by the reaction–diffusion equation to maximize the strain energy of the structure while a certain volume of design domain is prescribed. Several three-dimensional numerical examples are presented to substantiate our algorithmic developments.},

  abstract     = {Data-Driven (DD) computing is an emerging field of Computational Mechanics , motivated by recent technological advances in experimental measurements, the development of highly predictive computational models , advances in data storage and data processing, which enable the transition from a material data-scarce to a material data-rich era. The predictive capability of DD simulations is contingent on the quality of the material data set, i.e. its ability to closely sample all the strain–stress states in the phase space of a given mechanical problem. In this study, we develop a methodology for increasing the quality of an existing material data set through iterative expansions. Leveraging the formulation of the problems treated with the DD paradigm as distance minimization problems , we identify regions in phase space with poor data coverage, and target them with additional experiments or lower-scale simulations. The DD solution informs the additional experiments so that they can provide better coverage of the phase space of a given application. We first illustrate the convergence properties of the approach through a DD finite element simulation of a linear elastic cylinder under triaxial compression. The same numerical experiment is then performed on a specimen of Hostun sand, a material with complex history-dependent behavior. Data sampling is performed with Level-Set Discrete Element Method (LS-DEM) calculations of unit cells representative of this granular material, subjected to loading paths determined by the proposed method. It is shown that this adaptive expansion of the data set, tailored for a particular application, leads to convergent and accurate DD predictions, without the computational cost of using large databases with potentially redundant or low-quality data.},

The topology optimization process is divided into two scales: in macroscale optimization, the flexibility matrix factor is used as the constraint function, and the Augmented Lagrangian method is used to transform the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained model, and the free materials optimization approach is used to generate a compliant mechanism with multiple material attribute elements at the macroscale. In microscale optimization, each microstructures are optimized to obtain special mechanical properties issued from macroscale optimized results. Within the allowable elastic deformation range, the compliant mechanism with arbitrary mechanical properties can be designed, and several numerical examples demonstrate that the compliant mechanisms have expected motion characteristics. The proposed method solved the quantitative design of mechanical properties of compliant mechanisms and can be extended to other fields of compliant mechanisms using macro–microscale topology optimization.},

  abstract     = {Much work has been done in topology optimization of multiscale structures for maximum stiffness or minimum compliance design. Such approaches date back to the original homogenization-based work by Bendsøe and Kikuchi from 1988, which lately has been revived due to advances in manufacturing methods like additive manufacturing. Orthotropic microstructures locally oriented in principal stress directions provide for highly efficient stiffness optimal designs, whereas for the pure stiffness objective, porous isotropic microstructures are sub-optimal and hence not useful. It has, however, been postulated and exemplified that isotropic microstructures (infill) may enhance structural buckling stability but this has yet to be directly proven and optimized. In this work, we optimize buckling stability of multiscale structures with isotropic porous infill. To do this, we establish local density dependent Willam–Warnke yield surfaces based on local buckling estimates from Bloch–Floquet-based cell analysis to predict local instability of the homogenized materials. These local buckling-based stress constraints are combined with a global buckling criterion to obtain topology optimized designs that take both local and global buckling stability into account. De-homogenized structures with small and large cell sizes confirm validity of the approach and demonstrate huge structural gains as well as time savings compared to standard singlescale approaches.},

  abstract     = {Particle-based methods such as SPH have been proven to be powerful numerical tools for addressing challenges in solving coupled large deformation and failure of porous materials. In these applications, explicit time integration schemes are commonly adopted to integrate the coupled pore-water pressure equation. The Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition is required and imposes a strong restriction on the time increment, which is inversely proportional to the water bulk modulus, leading to a significant increase in the overall computational costs. This affects successful applications of SPH in solving field-scale fully coupled large deformation and failure of porous media. To address this problem, this study proposes a computationally efficient three-point integration (TPI) scheme that removes the influence of water bulk modulus from the pore-water pressure equation, enabling larger time increments for the time integration and hence saving computational costs for field-scale applications. Furthermore, a stabilised method is proposed to enable SPH to solve coupled flow-deformation of saturated porous media involving negative excess pore-water developments for the first time. The proposed SPH algorithm is verified against analytical and finite element solutions for small deformation ranges. Thereafter, it is applied to predict challenging problems involving large deformation and retrogressive failure of saturated porous materials, where contractive and dilative responses of porous materials can cause significant variations and instabilities in the development of excess pore-water pressure. The results suggest that the proposed SPH algorithm is stable and suitable for handling field-scale applications.},

  abstract     = {G-splines are a generalization of B-splines that deals with extraordinary points by imposing G 1 G1 constraints across their spoke edges, thus obtaining a continuous tangent plane throughout the surface. Using the isoparametric concept and the Bubnov–Galerkin method to solve partial differential equations with G-splines results in discretizations with global C 1 C1 continuity in physical space . Extraordinary points (EPs) are required to represent manifold surfaces with arbitrary topological genus. In this work, we allow both interior and boundary EPs and there are no limitations regarding how close EPs can be from each other. Reaching this level of flexibility is necessary so that splines with EPs can become mainstream in the design-through-analysis cycle of the complex thin-walled structures that appear in engineering applications . To the authors’ knowledge, the two EP constructions based on imposing G 1 G1 constraints proposed in this work are the first two EP constructions used in isogeometric analysis (IGA) that combine the following distinctive characteristics: (1) Only vertex-based control points are used and they behave as geometric shape handles, (2) any control point of the control net can potentially be an EP, (3) global C 1 C1 continuity in physical space is obtained without introducing singularities , (4) faces around EPs are not split into multiple elements, i.e., Bézier meshes with uniform element size are obtained, and (5) good surface quality is attained. The studies of convergence and surface quality performed in this paper suggest that G-splines are more suitable for IGA than EP constructions based on the D-patch framework. Finally, we have represented the stiffener, the inner part, and the outer part of a B-pillar with G-spline surfaces and solved eigenvalue problems using both Kirchhoff–Love and Reissner–Mindlin shell theories . The results are compared with bilinear quadrilateral meshes and excellent agreement is found between G-splines and conventional finite elements . In summary, G-splines are a viable alternative to design and analyze thin-walled structures using the same geometric representation so as to streamline the design-through-analysis cycle.},

We employ Monte Carlo, randomized quasi-Monte Carlo and stochastic spectral methods to estimate statistical moments of the phase-field variable. The two fourth-order phase-field models are shown to predict a very different response both in their deterministic and stochastic versions.

The new formulation is based on a three-phase mixture approach composed of a continuous air phase, a bubble phase, and a continuous water phase. A mass transfer mechanism that does not depend on an entrainment function and does not require calibration accounts for the incorporation of air into the flow. A modification in the formulation of the Volume-of-Fluid algorithm (used to track the free surface) allows one to capture the increase in water depth due to the presence of bubbles. The proposed formulation recovers the traditional Volume-of-Fluid formulation for free surface flows in the absence of bubbles, allowing the model to represent simultaneously the aerated and not aerated regions of a flow. Governing equations for the mixture are derived from mass and momentum conservation equations for each phase, and a numerical algorithm that ensures the boundedness of the numerical solution is proposed. The model is tested and validated using four experimental cases: a degassing tank, a bubble plume, a plunging jet, and a stepped spillway, showing very satisfactory results. The new methodology provides a significant advance in the current capabilities for simulating self-aerated flows.},

A design dependent non-uniform temperature field is considered for the heat conduction and the thermoelastic analysis during the topology optimization. Based on the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP), a topology optimization model is formulated to minimize the structural compliance under stress and overhang angle constraints. The overhang angle constraint to achieve the self-support property in additive manufacturing is established by connecting the elemental density values between the printing element and the corresponding support elements in the lower layer. The stress aggregation function is built to approximate the maximum stress value and an improved adaptive normalization scheme is applied to deal with the highly nonlinearity of the optimization. The sensitivity of the objective function and constraints with respect to the design variables are derived by the adjoint method, and the design variables are updated by the gradient-based optimization method. Moreover, a robustness scheme is proposed for the thermoelastic topology optimization to eliminate possible manufacturing issues such as “single node connection” and “thin rod” phenomena. Several typical numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in stress value reduction and overhang angle control. Meanwhile, the topology optimization with robustness scheme is also proved to result in more robust designs for manufacturing.},

In this paper, as an update equation for level set functions, (doubly) nonlinear diffusion equations with reaction terms are derived, and then the singularity and degeneracy of the diffusion coefficient are applied to obtain fast convergence of configurations and damping oscillation on boundary structures. In particular, the reaction terms in the proposed method do not depend on the topological derivatives, and therefore, sensitivity analysis to determine a descent direction for objective functionals is relaxed. Furthermore, a numerical algorithm for the proposed method is constructed and applied to typical minimization problems to show numerical validity.

Recently, researchers have used statistical and physical models to simulate the mechanical behavior of soft actuators. These simulations can help identify optimal actuator designs that fulfill specific robotic objectives. However, automated optimization of soft robots is a delicate balance between simplifying assumptions that reduce predictive fidelity and expensive simulations that limit design space exploration. Here we propose a generalized Bayesian optimization method to identify the designs of fiber-based biomimetic soft-robotic arms that minimize the actuation energy under arbitrary robotic control requirements. We use the reduced-order active filament theory as the overarching design paradigm and mechanical model, which enables a computationally robust and efficient optimization process. We evaluate the performance of our Bayesian optimization for a simple control objective in which the actuator has to reach a given target position. We show that our proposed optimization scheme outperforms a random-search baseline; it identifies more desirable designs faster and more frequently. Although we illustrate the performance of our approach for a single actuation problem, the derived method easily generalizes to the design optimization of fiber-based actuators under a large family of robotic applications.},

In terms of modeling , different from the single-level mapping of traditional FFD, MNFFD allows to establish multi-level and composite mapping, which provides strong flexibility for stiffened structures with complex assembly relationships. In terms of analysis , in order to achieve the integration of design and analysis, we propose a MNFFD-based IGA and derive a series of mapped elements. Furthermore, we implemented an isogeometric formulation of the 6-DOFs degenerated shell, and it is more convenient for the coupling of non-conforming NURBS surface patches in the frame of IGA, especially for the patches with kinks. In terms of optimization , all involved models, i.e., geometric models , analysis models, and optimization models, use the same geometric basis. We propose a simultaneous optimization framework of shape optimization and stiffener layout for lightweight design of stiffened thin-walled structures. Because the interaction between skin shape and stiffener layout is considered, the simultaneous optimization expands design space and may obtain better design Based on the proposed isogeometric design-analysis-optimization workflow, the integration of design-analysis-optimization for complex thin-walled structures is achieved. Several numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility and robustness of the proposed design-through-analysis workflow centered on MNFFD.},

  abstract     = {Phononic crystals can be designed to show band gaps—ranges of frequencies whose propagation is strongly attenuated in the material. In essence, their working principle is based on destructive interference of waves reflecting from the periodic arrangement of material interfaces ( i.e. , Bragg scattering). Consequently, capturing accurately the behavior at material interfaces requires appropriate numerical modeling and computational design techniques. However, the commonly used density-based representation in popular topology optimization methods results in a diffuse staircased boundary. The heavily refined finite element meshes required to compensate for this boundary description results in exceedingly large and expensive optimization problems . In this paper, we demonstrate the adverse effect of the density-based boundary description. Furthermore, we propose a level set-based topology optimization procedure with an enriched finite element method that shows improved performance when compared to the density-based approach.},

  abstract     = {The focus of this paper is on application of peridynamics (PD) to propagation of elastic waves in unbounded domains . We construct absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) derived from a semi-analytical solution of the PD governing equation at the exterior region . This solution is made up of a finite series of plane waves, as fundamental solutions (modes), which satisfy the PD dispersion relations . The modes are adjusted to transmit the energy from the interior region (near field) to the exterior region (far field). The corresponding unknown coefficients of the series are found in terms of the displacement field at a layer of points adjacent to the absorbing boundary. This is accomplished through a collocation procedure at subregions (clouds) around each absorbing point. The proposed ABCs offer appealing advantages, which facilitate their application to PD. They are of Dirichlet-type, hence their implementation is relatively simple as no derivatives of the field variables are required. They are constructed in the time and space domains and thus application of Fourier and Laplace transforms , cumbersome for nonlocal models , is not required. At the discrete level, the modes satisfy the same numerical dispersion relations of the near field , which makes the far-field solution compatible with that of the near field. We scrutinize the performance of the proposed ABCs through several examples. Our investigation shows that the proposed ABCs perform stably in time with an appropriate level of accuracy even in problems characterized by highly-dispersive propagating waves , including crack propagation in semi-unbounded brittle solids.},

  abstract     = {Shell finite element is computationally efficient and thereby favored in large-scale structural analysis. With the application of advanced materials, understanding the relation between micro-heterogeneities and structural behavior is important. To this end, we propose a multiscale method in the current contribution for modeling thin-walled fiber reinforced composite laminates with Mindlin–Reissner shell theory and Direct FE 2 2 . By exploiting the length scales in layered structure together with a shell formulation degenerated from continuum solid element, both in-plane and through-thickness periodicity can be assumed. A single-fiber unit cell attached to each Gauss point is employed as a representative volume element (RVE) rather than a through-thickness microstructure. In this way, the scale transitions are naturally dealt with using a first-order homogenization framework, in which the downscaling of transverse shear strain, commonly troublesome for the through-thickness RVE, is straightforward. The other merit inherited from Direct FE 2 2 is that the two-scale problem is formulated in a single finite element analysis wherein the macro and micro DOFs are coupled based on the downscaling kinematics. It avoids the upscaling of the macroscopic stresses and tangents in the conventional nested FE 2 2 scheme, which is challenging in the case of complex microstructural response. The developed method is then verified through several benchmarking examples, including a flat plate and two curve shells. Isotropic materials and composite laminates with homogeneous and heterogeneous RVEs have been examined. Two examples with plasticity and cohesive cracks are further presented to showcase its potential in modeling damage propagation in composite structures.},

The latter is used to estimate the constitutive properties of CNT-based composites, including the elastic tensor, fracture energy , electrical conductivity , and linear piezoresistive coefficients. These properties are inputted into a coupled electro-structural finite element model, which simulates the evolution of cracks based upon phase-field fracture. The coupled physical problem is solved in a monolithic manner, exploiting the robustness and efficiency of a quasi-Newton algorithm. 2D and 3D boundary value problems are simulated to illustrate the potential of the modelling framework in assessing the influence of defects on the electromechanical response of meso- and macro-scale smart structures. Case studies aim at shedding light into the interplay between fracture and the electromechanical material response and include parametric analyses, validation against experiments and the simulation of complex cracking conditions (multiple defects, crack merging). The presented numerical results showcase the efficiency and robustness of the computational framework, as well as its ability to model a large variety of structural configurations and damage patterns.

Developing efficient structural forms with better capacity for stability is important to keep structures safe. This study aims to optimize structural buckling capacity by using a density-based topology optimization scheme. Instead of treating the mechanical and thermal loadings as a single coupled part in the linearized buckling analysis, the effects of mechanical and thermal loadings are decoupled, which allows to separately analyze and optimize buckling aspects induced by mechanical or thermal loading. Two optimization models based on the decoupled analysis models are developed to respectively maximize the critical load factor of buckling induced by mechanical loading under a specified thermal loading and buckling induced by thermal loading under a specified mechanical loading. Further, based on a three-phase material model, a multi-material topology optimization scheme is employed to optimize the buckling capacity of active structures made of structural and actuating materials and prestressed structures containing prestressed components. The actuation effects are mimicked by the thermal loading of active material. The sensitivities of the objective functions and constraints are derived through the adjoint technique, and the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) is employed to solve the topology optimization problems . Numerical examples are adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Here, we propose a multi-fidelity cost-aware BO framework that dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art technologies in terms of efficiency, consistency, and robustness.

  abstract     = {Driven by the need to accelerate numerical simulations, the use of machine learning techniques is rapidly growing in the field of computational solid mechanics . Their application is especially advantageous in concurrent multiscale finite element analysis (FE 2 2 ) due to the exceedingly high computational costs often associated with it and the high number of similar micromechanical analyses involved. To tackle the issue, using surrogate models to approximate the microscopic behavior and accelerate the simulations is a promising and increasingly popular strategy. However, several challenges related to their data-driven nature compromise the reliability of surrogate models in material modeling. The alternative explored in this work is to reintroduce some of the physics-based knowledge of classical constitutive modeling into a neural network by employing the actual material models used in the full-order micromodel to introduce non-linearity. Thus, path-dependency arises naturally since every material model in the layer keeps track of its own internal variables. For the numerical examples , a composite Representative Volume Element with elastic fibers and elasto-plastic matrix material is used as the microscopic model . The network is tested in a series of challenging scenarios and its performance is compared to that of a state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A remarkable outcome of the novel framework is the ability to naturally predict unloading/reloading behavior without ever seeing it during training, a stark contrast with popular but data-hungry models such as RNNs. Finally, the proposed network is applied to FE 2 2 examples to assess its robustness for application in nonlinear finite element analysis .},

By not neglecting any of the strain terms at the constitutive level, full bending, compression and torsional strain couplings are enabled. This improves the model performance in capturing buckling phenomena and describing the developed post-critical configurations. Since the stress-resultants end up with elaborate expressions, numerical rather than analytical integration over the cross-section is preferred for their computation, which explains the need for knowing a priori the warping function (and its directional derivatives) in the entire cross-section, including in the thickness direction. The advances are implemented in a 7-DOF (3 displacements, 3 rotations and one warping intensity) rod model available in an in-house finite element program . Validation is performed using existing results from the literature as well as solutions obtained with shell models from a commercial software. The proposed advances proved to fix pathological behavior of previous rod models in both torsional and lateral–torsional buckling problems, as well as numerical convergence issues in developed post-critical configurations.},

  abstract     = {Although “classical” multi-scale methods can capture the behaviour of cellular, including lattice , materials, when considering lattices or metamaterial local instabilities, corresponding to a change of the micro-structure morphology, classical computational homogenisation methods fail. On the one hand, first order computational homogenisation, which considers a classical continuum at the macro-scale cannot capture localisation bands inherent to cell buckling propagation. On the other hand, second-order computational homogenisation, which considers a higher order continuum at the macro-scale, introduces a size effect with respect to the Representative Volume Element (RVE) size, which is problematic when the RVE has to consider several cells to recover periodicity during local instability. In this paper we reformulate in a finite-strain setting the second-order computational homogenisation using the idea of equivalent homogenised volume. From this equivalence, arises at the micro-scale a non-uniform body force that acts as a supplementary volume term over the RVE. In the presented method, this non-uniform body-force term arises from the equivalence of energy, i.e. the Hill–Mandel condition, between the micro- and macroscopic volumes and depends mainly on the relation between the micro-scale and macro-scale deformation gradient . We show by considering elastic and elasto-plastic metamaterials and cellular materials that this approach reduces the RVE size dependency on the homogenised response.},

  abstract     = {The development of highly accurate constitutive models for materials that undergo path-dependent processes continues to be a complex challenge in computational solid mechanics. Challenges arise both in considering the appropriate model assumptions and from the viewpoint of data availability, verification, and validation. Recently, data-driven modeling approaches have been proposed that aim to establish stress-evolution laws that avoid user-chosen functional forms by relying on machine learning representations and algorithms. However, these approaches not only require a significant amount of data but also need data that probes the full stress space with a variety of complex loading paths. Furthermore, they rarely enforce all necessary thermodynamic principles as hard constraints. Hence, they are in particular not suitable for low-data or limited-data regimes, where the first arises from the cost of obtaining the data and the latter from the experimental limitations of obtaining labeled data, which is commonly the case in engineering applications. In this work, we discuss a hybrid framework that can work on a variable amount of data by relying on the modularity of the elastoplasticity formulation where each component of the model can be chosen to be either a classical phenomenological or a data-driven model depending on the amount of available information and the complexity of the response. The method is tested on synthetic uniaxial data coming from simulations as well as cyclic experimental data for structural materials. The discovered material models are found to not only interpolate well but also allow for accurate extrapolation in a thermodynamically consistent manner far outside the domain of the training data. This ability to extrapolate from limited data was the main reason for the early and continued success of phenomenological models and the main shortcoming in machine learning-enabled constitutive modeling approaches. Training aspects and details of the implementation of these models into Finite Element simulations are discussed and analyzed.},

The morphology of crystal aggregates is represented employing Voronoi tessellations , which retain the main statistical features of polycrystalline materials. The behaviour of the individual grains is modelled starting from an integral representation for anisotropic thermo-elasticity, which is numerically addressed through a dual reciprocity boundary element method . The integrity of the aggregate is enforced through suitable intergranular thermo-elastic continuity conditions . By virtue of the features of the underlying formulation, the polycrystalline thermo-elastic problem is expressed in terms of grain boundary variables only, thus simplifying the subsequent task of meshing and reducing the overall computational cost of the analysis, ultimately providing an appealing tool for multiscale applications. The framework has been tailored for computational thermo-elastic homogenization of polycrystalline materials and it has been applied to the statistical computational homogenization of SiC and Al 2 2 O 3 3 polycrystals , with accurate results confirming its robustness and effectiveness. The extension of the proposed framework to multiscale modelling of materials failure in thermally active environments is eventually discussed.},

  abstract     = {Solid nano-structures exhibiting fast ion transport (cations moving in anionic crystal structures) are becoming increasingly relevant in industrial applications. However, it is challenging to model their mechanics due to the presence of electromagnetic couplings . In this paper, a mathematical, physical, and computational framework is introduced, for a cation particle moving through an anion sub-lattice structure in the presence of two electromagnetic fields : an external electromagnetic field; and a self-induced electromagnetic field coming from back-reaction phenomena caused by the relative movement of cations with respect to the mentioned structure. Our approach seeks to incorporate magnetic effects, such as magnetic induction and spin of cations, which are not incorporated in other models, mainly due to the intrinsic difficulty of 3D effects. We propose a quantum mechanical formalism based on a Schrödinger-type equation, where a wave function models the behavior of a cation in presence of an external electromagnetic potential, coupled with transient and self-induced electromagnetic effects. To solve the model, a space–time coupled numerical scheme is presented, which allows the possibility of time-evolving electromagnetic effects. The technique uses finite-elements in space and time-marching schemes in time. While a time-explicit marching scheme is used to update the magnetic and electric-potential fields, a time-implicit marching scheme is used to solve the coupled Schrödinger equation. This strategy allows us to update the electromagnetic contributions and wave functions at each time-step. Numerical examples in one and two spatial dimensions (and evolving in time) have been implemented for some meaningful models obtained from nanoionics literature.},

However, a large number of multi-source uncertainties exist in the real-world, and their applications pose significant challenges owing to the lack of unity and generality of the RBDO theory and high performance computational methods. This study proposes a unified reliability-based design optimization (URBDO) method to deal with multi-source uncertainties, in which probabilistic, uncertain-but-bounded, and fuzzy parameters are simultaneously considered. First, a novel URBDO model is proposed by combining the probabilistic, non-probabilistic, and fuzzy theories, and it consists of nested quadruple optimization loops. Second, the single-loop URBDO method is further developed based on the Lagrangian function to ease the unaffordable computational burden, where the probabilistic analysis, non-probabilistic analysis, fuzzy analysis, and deterministic optimization are simultaneously implemented. Third, the directional properties of non-probabilistic and fuzzy computations are disclosed, and the directional chaos single-loop method (DCSLM) and conjugate gradient single-loop method (CGSLM) are constructed based on the chaos control theory and conjugate gradient method. Finally, three numerical examples and three practical engineering examples are tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed URBDO model and the high performances of the DCSLM and CGSLM.},

In this work, the TSM is extended for viscoelastic structures with local random material fluctuations. The time-separated stochastic mechanics is based on a separation of the stochastic viscous evolution equation in time-dependent deterministic and time-independent stochastic terms enabling an efficient implementation . Here, the method is expanded by the Karhunen–Loéve expansion for the representation of the random fields of the material parameters. The method requires a low number of deterministic FEM simulations to approximate stress and reaction force, thus remarkably reducing the computational effort compared to classical Monte Carlo simulations .

To address this long-standing issue, we present an essentially non-hourglass formulation based on volumetric-deviatoric stress decomposition. Inspired by the fact that the artifact of nonphysical zigzag particle distribution induced by the hourglass modes is mainly characterized by shear deformation and the standard SPH discretization for the viscous term in the Navier–Stokes (NS) equation, the present formulation computes the action of shear stress directly through the Laplacian of displacement other than from the divergence of shear stress. A comprehensive set of challenging benchmark cases are simulated to demonstrate that, while improving accuracy and computational efficiency, the present formulation is able to essentially suppress the hourglass modes and achieves very good numerical stability with a single general effective parameter. In addition, the deformation of a practically relevant stent structure is simulated to demonstrate the potential of the present method in the field of biomechanics .},

Then, to measure correctly the convergence of the iterative process, we introduce a reference solution that revisits the product of classical and enriched functions. As a consequence, we are able to propose a purely matrix-based implementation of the global-local problem. The distributed approach is then compared to other parallel solvers either direct or iterative with domain decomposition . The comparison addresses the scalability as well as the elapsed time.

The employed partitioning framework introduces “fictitious” interfaces between contiguous subdomains, leading to a formulation with both subdomain and interface fields. We propose a low-dimensional parameterization at both subdomain and interface levels by using reduced-order bases precomputed in an offline stage by applying the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on solution snapshots. In this parameterization, the amplitude of the fictitious interfaces play the role of coarse-scale displacement unknowns. We demonstrate that, with this partitioned framework, it is possible to arrive at a solution strategy that avoids solving the typical nested local/global problem of other similar methods (such as the FE 2 2 method). Rather, in our approach, the coarse-grid cells can be regarded as special types of finite elements, whose nodes coincides with the centroids of the interfaces, and whose kinematics are dictated by the modes of the “fictitious” interfaces. This means that the kinematics of our coarse-scale FE are not pre-defined by the user, but extracted from the set of “training” computational experiments. Likewise, we demonstrate that the coarse-scale and fine-scale displacements are related by inter-scale operators that can be precomputed in the offline stage. Lastly, a hyperreduced scheme is considered for the evaluation of the internal forces, allowing us to deal with possible material nonlinearities.},

The most popular way to embed the laws of physics into neural networks is to apply partial differential equations . However, many complex mechanical problems, such as displacements near the phase interface in heterogeneous plates, are difficult to solve using differential equations expressed by higher-order derivatives. In this work, peridynamic (PD)-informed neural networks are established to characterize the displacement of homogeneous and especially heterogeneous elastic plates. The networks are directly constrained by the integro-differential equations of bond-based PD, thus avoiding higher-order derivatives. The networks are trained without labeled data, and the convergence of the training process is accelerated by a gradual-refinement sampling method. Four simulation experiments show that the displacements of two-dimensional plates with homogeneous or heterogeneous structures are globally approximated by the proposed network with small deviations compare to those obtained with peridynamic numerical solutions. Further investigations show that sampling refinement can significantly increase the prediction accuracy of the networks for complex heterogeneous plates.},

  abstract     = {A recently developed measure-theoretic framework solves a stochastic inverse problem (SIP) for models where uncertainties in model output data are predominantly due to aleatoric (i.e., irreducible) uncertainties in model inputs (i.e., parameters). The subsequent inferential target is a distribution on parameters. Another type of inverse problem is to quantify uncertainties in estimates of “true” parameter values under the assumption that such uncertainties should be reduced as more data are incorporated into the problem, i.e., the uncertainty is considered epistemic. A major contribution of this work is the formulation and solution of such a parameter identification problem (PIP) within the measure-theoretic framework developed for the SIP. The approach is novel in that it utilizes a solution to a stochastic forward problem (SFP) to update an initial density only in the parameter directions informed by the model output data. In other words, this method performs “selective regularization” only in the parameter directions not informed by data. The solution is defined by a maximal updated density (MUD) point where the updated density defines the measure-theoretic solution to the PIP. Another significant contribution of this work is the full theory of existence and uniqueness of MUD points for linear maps with Gaussian distributions. Data-constructed Quantity of Interest (QoI) maps are also presented and analyzed for solving the PIP within this measure-theoretic framework as a means of reducing uncertainties in the MUD estimate. We conclude with a demonstration of the general applicability of the method on two problems involving either spatial or temporal data for estimating uncertain model parameters. The first problem utilizes spatial data from a stationary partial differential equation to produce a MUD estimate of an uncertain boundary condition. The second problem utilizes temporal data obtained from the state-of-the-art ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model to obtain a MUD estimate of uncertain wind drag coefficients for a simulated extreme weather event near the Shinnecock Inlet located in the Outer Barrier of Long Island, NY, USA.},

The multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor into elastic and viscous parts, and making use of dissipation inequality , nonlinear evolution equations for the internal variables of the models are obtained. The mechanical behavior of the dampers is assumed to be linearly viscous. Therefore, the Cauchy-like stress in the dampers is similar to that in Newtonian fluids and includes terms for the hydrostatic pressure and viscosity . The implicit and second-order accurate trapezoidal method is employed for the time integration of the evolution equations. Due to the highly nonlinear governing differential equations including the effects of geometric nonlinearity and viscoelasticity , a nonlinear finite element formulation based on isoparametric elements is developed. The accuracy and performance of the developed formulation and time-dependent solutions are verified by studying several numerical examples .

  abstract     = {In previous work, Zhang et al. (2021) developed an integrated smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method to simulate the principle aspects of cardiac function, including electrophysiology, passive and active mechanical response of the myocardium. As the inclusion of the Purkinje network in electrocardiology is recognized as fundamental to accurately describing the electrical activation in the right and left ventricles, in this paper, we present a multi-order SPH method to handle the electrical propagation through the Purkinje system and in the myocardium with monodomain/monodomain coupling strategy. We first propose an efficient algorithm for network generation on arbitrarily complex surface by exploiting level-set geometry representation and cell-linked list neighbor search algorithm. Then, a reduced-order SPH method is developed to solve the monodomain equation to characterize the fast electrical activation through the Purkinje network. Finally, a multi-order coupling paradigm is introduced to capture the coupled nature of potential propagation arising from the interaction between the network and the myocardium. A set of numerical examples are studied to assess the computational performance, accuracy and versatility of the proposed method. In particular, numerical study performed in realistic left ventricle demonstrates that the present method features all the physiological issues that characterize a heartbeat simulation, including the initiation of the signal in the Purkinje network and the systolic and diastolic phases. As expected, the results underlie the importance of using physiologically realistic Purkinje network for modeling cardiac function.},

  abstract     = {A new algorithm based on the convolution finite element method (CFEM) is proposed for the nonlinear wave propagation in elastic media. The formulation is developed in the context of the total Lagrangian framework, encompassing contributions due to both geometrical and material nonlinearities. As a basis, a counterpart of equations of motion – namely, the alternative field equations – is first established. The satisfaction of the alternative field equations is then realized in a weak sense. Next, the Newton–Raphson procedure and the consistent tangential matrix are applied to the weak formulation, where the CFEM is used as the linear solver in each iteration. Finally, several examples are carried out to examine the theoretical aspects and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. In particular, problems of free vibration of Neo-Hookean and Saint Venant–Kirchhoff plates are explored. Also, a cantilever beam of the Neo-Hookean material is simulated for the case of forced vibrations. Conspicuously, in contrast to the existing time-step methods with finite order of accuracy, the new solution procedure obtains the accurate solution when the time-step size is increased.},

  abstract     = {Fractures have attracted the attention of computational scientists for several decades. The modeling and simulation of fractures have been a major motivation for developing enriched finite element methods (FEMs), such as the numerical manifold method (NMM). However, ill-conditioning has always haunted NMM and other enriched FEMs when they are utilized for linear elastic fracture problems. Generally, ill-conditioning for a fracture problem is caused by two main issues: the arbitrary cut of the mesh by the fracture path and linear dependence related to the crack-tip enrichments. It is significantly challenging to overcome these two types of ill-conditioning using a single technique. In this study, we employ a preconditioner based on global normalization and local Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization of bases to eliminate these two ill-conditioning issues in NMM entirely and simultaneously. Various numerical examples have demonstrated that the proposed preconditioning strategy is highly effective in reducing the condition number and iteration counts of a iterative solver. It is highly robust, stable, and efficient and can be incorporated into enriched FEM programs to significantly facilitate the analyses of linear elastic fractures.},

  abstract     = {Multi-fidelity Monte Carlo methods leverage low-fidelity and surrogate models for variance reduction to make tractable uncertainty quantification even when numerically simulating the physical systems of interest with high-fidelity models is computationally expensive. This work proposes a context-aware multi-fidelity Monte Carlo method that optimally balances the costs of training low-fidelity models with the costs of Monte Carlo sampling. It generalizes the previously developed context-aware bi-fidelity Monte Carlo method to hierarchies of multiple models and to more general types of low-fidelity models. When training low-fidelity models, the proposed approach takes into account the context in which the learned low-fidelity models will be used, namely for variance reduction in Monte Carlo estimation, which allows it to find optimal trade-offs between training and sampling to minimize upper bounds of the mean-squared errors of the estimators for given computational budgets. This is in stark contrast to traditional surrogate modeling and model reduction techniques that construct low-fidelity models with the primary goal of approximating well the high-fidelity model outputs and typically ignore the context in which the learned models will be used in upstream tasks. The proposed context-aware multi-fidelity Monte Carlo method applies to hierarchies of a wide range of types of low-fidelity models such as sparse-grid and deep-network models. Numerical experiments with the gyrokinetic simulation code Gene show speedups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to standard estimators when quantifying uncertainties in small-scale fluctuations in confined plasma in fusion reactors. This corresponds to a runtime reduction from 72 days to four hours on one node of the Lonestar6 supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center.},

The IGA approach based on Loop subdivision is used for the spatial discretizations , where the basis functions consist of the quartic box-splines corresponding to the hierarchic subdivided surface control meshes. The time discretization is based on the so-called explicit-IEQ method, which enables one to solve a few decoupled elliptic constant-coefficient equations at each time step.

The mechanical properties of the composites depend on various variables and parameters of the manufacturing process, which are challenging, if not impossible, to determine and optimize experimentally. Traditional first-principle modeling approaches are not accessible due to the complex physics involved. A hybrid model that combines incomplete physics knowledge with available measurement data within a differentiable programming framework opens up new avenues to tackle the challenges. In this work, a physics-integrated neural differentiable (PiNDiff) model is developed, where the partially known physics is integrated into the recurrent network architecture to enable effective learning and generalization. The merit and potential of the proposed method have been demonstrated in modeling the curing process of thick thermoset composite laminates, whose governing physics is partially given. The proposed PiNDiff model shows the capability to learn unknown physics from the limited, indirect data and, meanwhile, can be used to infer unobserved variables and parameters. The performance of the PiNDiff model has been compared with two state-of-the-art (SOTA) black-box deep learning models, and its advantages over the purely data-driven models and first-principles physics-based models have been discussed in detail. The demonstrated PiNDiff strategy may provide a general strategy to model phenomena where physics is only partially known and sparse, indirect data are available.},

In this method, the real aggregate surface segmented from CT images is first decomposed and mapped by the SH function to radius fields at different scales, whose statistical data are then extracted to reconstruct new aggregates through a spectral representation method and an innovative folding algorithm. The proposed method is verified by comparison of four morphology indices (sphericity, convexity, roundness and roughness) of the real aggregate and the new ones, and its flexibility in reconstructing new sets of random aggregates with specified morphology indices at selected scales is also demonstrated. As an application, eight sets of Fuller-grade random aggregates with target morphology indices are constructed and packed into a cube container to generate digital concrete specimens . The aggregate sphericity and convexity are found to be linearly correlated with the maximum aggregate volume fraction that can be packed into the cube. The developed method can be also applied to other granular materials, such as pharmaceutical particles, colloids, ceramics, soils and coal.},

For linear elastic materials, it was shown that a stress–displacement iteration solves this issue and reduces the computational cost even of several times. Convergence problems occur also when large rotations are coupled to material nonlinearity , even if this case is not well addressed in the literature. The extension of the mixed iteration to large deformation problems with nonlinear constitutive laws is faced in this work, focusing on elastoplasticity. New iterative schemes are derived for both displacement-based finite elements (DFEs) and mixed finite elements (MFEs), each featuring further variables in the linearization along with displacements. For DFEs, it is shown that the most convenient approach is to impose the constitutive law for an independent integration point strain, with the strain–displacement compatibility solved together with the global equilibrium. For MFEs, as an extension of this strategy, the most performing scheme solves element compatibility and global equilibrium simultaneously, with the element state evaluated for independent strains work-conjugate of the stress DOFs. In both cases, global linear systems in displacements only are required and strain-driven material laws are easily considered. Numerous tests validate the proposed iterative schemes showing a significant reduction of the computational cost compared to standard approaches.},

The distortion has a great influence on the structural performance and dimensional accuracy, e.g., for assembly. It is therefore of critical importance to model, predict and, ultimately, reduce distortion. In this paper, we present a computational framework for fabrication sequence optimization to minimize distortion in multi-axis additive manufacturing (e.g., robotic wire arc additive manufacturing), in which the fabrication sequence is not limited to planar layers only. We encode the fabrication sequence by a continuous pseudo-time field, and optimize it using gradient-based numerical optimization. To demonstrate this framework, we adopt a computationally tractable yet reasonably accurate model to mimic the material shrinkage in metal additive manufacturing and thus to predict the distortion of the fabricated components. Numerical studies show that optimized curved layers can reduce distortion by orders of magnitude as compared to their planar counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Soil shrinkage cracking is a hygro-mechanical coupled phenomenon and it can significantly weaken the mechanical properties of soil and cause various potential natural disasters. This study proposes an improved bond-based peridynamics (PD) formulation, based on a comprehensive review of the hygro-mechanical peridynamic models. The proposed model with a certain influence function can be recast as an existing bond-based PD diffusion model. Also, an attenuation kernel function and discretized micro-modulus are adopted to revise the bond force density in the prototype micro-elastic brittle (PMB) model. For the numerical implementation, both monolithic and staggered schemes are adopted for the coupled hygro-mechanical problem. Specifically, the coupled stiffness matrix in the discretized equilibrium equation is constructed by using the Lagrange multiplier method for the monolithic scheme. While the direct integration method of explicit dynamics with an artificial damping term is adopted for the staggered scheme. For modeling of soil drying and cracking, two-dimensional soil rings, and two- and three-dimensional soil strips are simulated and demonstrated. The soil ring model verifies the accuracy of the coupled moisture-soil bond-based PD model through an explicit staggered scheme, and explores the effect of the relative thickness of rings on the number of cracks. The implicit monolithic solution is adopted to analyze the mechanisms of soil strip cracking. A detailed discussion on the scheme for controlling the maximum number of bond breakage is provided to guarantee convergency and accuracy with optimal efficiency. The soil strip cracking pattern and upward curling deformation agree well with experimental observations.

  abstract     = {In this work, a new strong form-based implicit meshless particle method, NURBS based Particle Hydrodynamics (NBPH) is proposed. The kernel approximation is replaced by NURBS basis function interpolation. Thus, the calculation of physical field function relies on NURBS basis function-based interpolation, rather than weighted contributions from neighboring particles. Pseudo particles and real particles are configured in the algorithm to accomplish the physical field solution and geometry description. And the gradient operators and Laplacian operators are evaluated based on the partial derivatives of the NURBS basis functions combined with control variables. The update of the physical field functions is completed by an implicit time integration without pre-setting more constraints or intermediate intervention. Generally, the number of pseudo particles is less than the number of real particles, and the value of this difference is related to the order of NURBS basis functions. In addition, surface tension is achieved by cohesion and surface area minimization, tensile instability is solved by shifting particles. Based on the good performance of NBPH in solving numerical simulations of transient conduction and several incompressible flows, it is demonstrated that NBPH is a feasible meshless method. The proposed NBPH scheme provides an alternative computer method for nonlinear transient analysis, such as transient heat transfer and incompressible flow simulation in engineering.},

  abstract     = {A high quality finite element analysis of structural components requires an adequate, often complex, description of the material behaviour . Data-driven models based on artificial neural networks have been shown to possess the potential to substitute current material models, as they promise fast computation, high adaptability to new materials and uncoupling from closed analytical formulations of the model, among others. However, the training of these Machine Learning Material Models (MLMM) is currently limited to data acquired from simulations using classical material models, since this gives the stress-output as a response to a given strain input directly, required to train the MLMM using supervised learning. Although, from experiments only surficial strain field and global force are measurable, local stress values in an inhomogeneous field are not obtainable. We propose a methodology to uncouple MLMM from classical modelling, making them no longer surrogate models , with the promise to unleash their full potential of data-driven materials modelling. In a two-step optimization, starting with a pre-trained MLMM on a similar material and using only data practically acquirable from experiments, we re-train or re-calibrate the MLMM onto a new material. The first and major step is denoted pseudogradient-ES (evolutionary strategy), an external optimization of the neural network’s parameters, such as weights and biases, using mechanically-motivated loss-functions as the optimization objective. It uses a unique combination of evolutionary strategy and gradient based optimization, with a special formulation of a vector serving as an alternative to a gradient in the optimization process. The final step is required to reduce the amount of physical tests by taking advantage of the material symmetry, using our proposed rotation-backpropagation strategy, where new training data is constructed and used in a final training stage of the MLMM using backpropagation . The methodology is shown as a proof of concept on elastic virtual experiments, which however only uses data acquirable in real physical experiments. The final MLMM describing the new material is shown running in finite element analyses.},

  abstract     = {Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a successful and well-established inverse method for reconstructing material models from measured wave signals. In the field of seismic exploration, FWI has proven particularly successful in the reconstruction of smoothly varying material deviations. By contrast, non-destructive testing (NDT) often requires the detection and specification of sharp defects in a specimen. If the contrast between materials is low, FWI can be successfully applied to these problems as well. However, so far, the method is not fully suitable for reconstructing homogeneous Neumann boundaries such as hidden backsides of walls, crack-like defects, or internal voids, which are characterized by an infinite contrast in the material parameters. Inspired by fictitious domain methods, we introduce a dimensionless scaling function γ to model void regions in the forward and inverse scalar wave equation problem. Applying the scaling function γ to the material parameters in different ways results in three distinct formulations for mono-parameter FWI and one for two-parameter FWI. The resulting problems are solved by first-order optimization, where the gradient is computed using the adjoint state method. The corresponding Fréchet kernels are derived for each approach and the associated minimization is performed using an L-BFGS algorithm. A comparison between the different approaches shows that scaling the density with γ is most promising for parametrizing void material in forward and inverse problems. Finally, in order to consider arbitrary complex geometries known a priori, this approach is combined with an immersed boundary method, the finite cell method (FCM).},

  abstract     = {Understanding and projecting seasonal variations in sea ice is necessary to improve global climate predictions. However, accurately capturing changes in sea ice and its interactions with ocean and atmosphere variability remains a challenge for models, notably due to its complex behavior at the floe scale. In this work, we introduce a method to capture the floe-like behavior of sea ice, named the ‘Level Set Discrete Element Method for Sea Ice’ (LS-ICE). This model can resolve individual sea ice floes with realistic shapes, and represent their physical interactions by leveraging level-set functions for detecting contact between floes. LS-ICE can also be coupled to heat and momentum forcings from the atmosphere and the ocean, and simulate associated melt and breakage processes. The discrete representation of sea ice floes reveals melt dynamics, associated with their shapes and thickness distributions, which are currently not well represented by continuum models. We illustrate the model capabilities for two different years involving the spring to summer transition in Baffin Bay, where the sea ice concentration declines from approximately 80% to 0% between the months of June and July. Satellite imagery, along with oceanographic reanalysis data based on field measurements, are used to initialize the model and validate its subsequent evolution during these months. For an appropriate set of parameters, the model can reproduce the evolution of sea ice concentration, floe size distribution, oceanic temperature and mean sea ice thickness, despite only a small number of tunable parameters. This study identifies the potential for LS-ICE to simulate the interaction between floe shape, melt and breakage, to enhance seasonal scale forecasts for sea ice floes.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic simulators are non-deterministic computer models which provide a different response each time they are run, even when the input parameters are held at fixed values. They arise when additional sources of uncertainty are affecting the computer model, which are not explicitly modeled as input parameters. The uncertainty analysis of stochastic simulators requires their repeated evaluation for different values of the input variables, as well as for different realizations of the underlying latent stochasticity. The computational cost of such analyses can be considerable, which motivates the construction of surrogate models that can approximate the original model and its stochastic response, but can be evaluated at much lower cost. We propose a surrogate model for stochastic simulators based on spectral expansions. Considering a certain class of stochastic simulators that can be repeatedly evaluated for the same underlying random event, we view the simulator as a random field indexed by the input parameter space. For a fixed realization of the latent stochasticity, the response of the simulator is a deterministic function, called trajectory. Based on samples from several such trajectories, we approximate the latter by sparse polynomial chaos expansion and compute analytically an extended Karhunen–Loève expansion (KLE) to reduce its dimensionality. The uncorrelated but dependent random variables of the KLE are modeled by advanced statistical techniques such as parametric inference, vine copula modeling, and kernel density estimation. The resulting surrogate model approximates the marginals and the covariance function, and allows to obtain new realizations at low computational cost. We observe that in our numerical examples, the first mode of the KLE is by far the most important, and investigate this phenomenon and its implications.},

  abstract     = {The fourth-order phase-field modeling of ductile fracture in elastic–plastic materials is performed via an adaptive isogeometric-meshfree approach. In the developed phase-field model, the total energy functional consists of the elastic contribution and the dissipated contribution because of fracture and plasticity. The coupling of the plasticity to fracture is implemented by a degradation function that is applied to the elastic energy. The present fourth-order phase-field model is capable of relaxing the mesh size requirements while accurately regularizing sharp cracks. To further enhance the computational efficiency, the isogeometric-meshfree approach is adopted for the numerical implementation of the phase-field model within a staggered computational framework. The developed approach can flexibly implement the C 1 -continuity of a crack phase field that is required by the fourth-order model. Moreover, an adaptive mesh refinement strategy is developed, which includes the gradient-based refinement indicators and the field transfer operators. Numerical simulations of a series of representative cases show that the developed fourth-order model can accurately and efficiently capture complex ductile fracture patterns including plastic localization, crack initiation, propagation, and merging, which demonstrates the reliability of the adaptive fourth-order phase-field modeling of ductile fracture.},

In particular, quadrilateral and hexahedral elements are required to be convex. However, generating high quality tangle-free meshes, especially 3D hexahedral meshes, remains an open challenge. Recently, the tangled finite element method (TFEM) was proposed to handle concave (tangled) quadrilateral elements . However, even in 2D, it was found to be computationally expensive and programmatically complex. Here, we present a computationally efficient isoparametric-TFEM (i-TFEM) framework for inverted 2D quadrilateral and 3D hexahedral elements. i-TFEM employs the properties of isoparametric elements to make the formulation computationally much more efficient. In i-TFEM, the constraint on full invertibility (convexity) is replaced by partial invertibility by modifying the elemental stiffness matrices of the concave elements, and by incorporating certain piecewise-compatibility conditions. The proposed i-TFEM is simple, efficient, and provides accurate solutions with optimal convergence rate even in the presence of severely inverted elements. Moreover, i-TFEM requires minimal changes to the standard FEM framework and reduces to standard FEM for meshes without tangled elements. The accuracy and efficiency of i-TFEM are demonstrated by solving elastostatics problems on several 2D and 3D tangled meshes.},

  abstract     = {Crack-direction-based decomposition of elastic strain energy could effectively control the propagation of tensile and shear cracks in a phase field modelling context. The objective of the proposed double-phase field model is to extend the crack-direction-based decomposition strategy from 2D brittle fracture to complex mixed-mode crack modelling in a 3D setting, with plastic deformation incorporated. Both effective (undamaged) stress and plastic strain are split in the crack-orientation-based coordinate system . The decomposed tensile/shear stress contribute to tensile/shear damage evolution, respectively. The plastic contribution is coupled by relating the decomposed tensile/shear plastic strain to the corresponding tensile/shear crack energy release rates . Crack surface normal direction, represented by two orientation variables in 3D spatial domains, is determined by the F -criterion. The proposed model is implemented via ABAQUS subroutines with a staggered scheme for two phase field variables and crack direction. The simulation of a single-edge notch specimen under shear loading demonstrates that the ratio between shear and tensile crack energy release rates plays a significant role in the crack mode and mechanical response. Numerical results of a group of uniaxial tension, simple shear and tension shear specimens show good agreement with the experimental data in terms of the force–displacement curve and crack path, exhibiting the validity of the proposed model for capturing different crack modes. This model has also been proven effective for complex 3D problems via the third Sandia Challenge example.},

  abstract     = {Starling murmuration optimizer is a newly well-developed swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the behavior of starlings during stunning murmuration and has performed competitively with other well-known methods. However, starling murmuration optimizer faces the issues of poor search capability, iterative stagnation, and low convergence accuracy when dealing with complex engineering optimization and high-dimensional problems. To ameliorate these deficiencies, an efficient hybrid starling murmuration optimizer that combines dynamic opposition, Taylor-based optimal neighborhood strategy, and crossover operator is developed in this paper. Firstly, introducing the Taylor-based optimal neighborhood strategy ensures a more careful and reasonable reliance on optimal individuals, thus reducing the possibility of falling into local optima . Meanwhile, dynamic opposition successfully balances the exploration and development phases by incorporating the ideas of quasi- and reflective opposition. In addition, the exploration-development capability is further enhanced by introducing the crossover operator. To ensure the adaptivity of the crossover factor, 12 different inertia weights are explored for crossover factors, and the sigmoidal decreasing inertia weights achieve optimality . Finally, the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing it with the improved algorithm and the state-of-the-art search algorithms on 26 benchmark functions and the CEC2020 test suite, respectively. In addition, the proposed algorithm is used to optimize ten practical engineering optimization problems . Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has strong competitiveness in this algorithm regarding computational power and convergence accuracy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to two truss topology optimization designs. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability and potential of the proposed algorithm in practical applications. The proposed algorithm is a competitive optimization algorithm for solving optimization problems .},

  abstract     = {We propose a variational multiscale method stabilization of a linear finite element method for nonlinear poroelasticity. Our approach is suitable for the implicit time integration of poroelastic formulations in which the solid skeleton is anisotropic and incompressible. A detailed numerical methodology is presented for a monolithic formulation that includes both structural dynamics and Darcy flow . Our implementation of this methodology is verified using several hyperelastic and poroelastic benchmark cases, and excellent agreement is obtained with the literature. Grid convergence studies for both anisotropic hyperelastodynamics and poroelastodynamics demonstrate that the method is second-order accurate. The capabilities of our approach are demonstrated using a model of the left ventricle (LV) of the heart derived from human imaging data. Simulations using this model indicate that the anisotropicity of the myocardium has a substantial influence on the pore pressure. Furthermore, the temporal variations of the various components of the pore pressure (hydrostatic pressure and pressure resulting from changes in the volume of the pore fluid) are correlated with the variation of the added mass and dynamics of the LV, with maximum pore pressure being obtained at peak systole. The order of magnitude and the temporal variation of the pore pressure are in good agreement with the literature.},

The modeling is based on the energy of multi-phase-field elasticity system including the classical Ginzburg–Landau, the elastic potential and some constraints. The material layout is updated by using the volume constrained gradient flow of the system. In this work, we transform the traditional objective functional of multimaterial topology optimization into the energy functional of multi-phase-field elasticity system, and transform the optimal material layout into the solutions of volume constrained Allen–Cahn type equations. For these Allen–Cahn type equations, we propose the second-order unconditionally energy stable numerical scheme which combines linearly stabilized splitting method and Crank–Nicolson scheme. For the proposed second-order scheme, we give a theoretical proof of unconditional energy stability. Numerical results show that the scheme converges fast compared to traditional Cahn–Hilliard type equations.

  abstract     = {This work extends the smoothed finite elements method (S-FEM) to the use of arbitrarily complicated meshes, including nonconvex polygonal meshes for the first time. A novel formulation for arbitrarily polygonal elements based on the S-FEM is presented for analyses of elastic and elastoplastic problems. This enable the use of polygonal elements that are of conventional quadrilateral, convex polygonal, concave polygon elements and n-sides concave polygonal elements. This is achieved by making use of the exceptional unique features of S-FEM in terms of stability, accommodation to mesh distortion , and free from differentiation in strain field computation. The ear clipping technique is used to automatically generate smoothing domains without any dummy nodes. The stability in using such a complicated mesh is ensured by the gradient smoothing technique in S-FEM, and no additional stability control measure is required. In addition, domain integration is converted to boundary integral along sub-triangular domain, which requires only the shape function values at the field nodes. This avoiding coordinate mapping, and hence it is a Jacobian free formulation . The von Mises elastoplastic model is implemented in our S-FEM by decomposing the tangent stiffness matrix into three parts: elastic stiffness matrix , strain–displacement matrix and the derivative of the stress–strain matrix. The first two matrices are calculated only once at the initial stage, and only the derivative of the stress–strain matrix is updated in each iteration for capture the nonlinearity . The numerical results show that the proposed method can handle the general non-convex elements effectively with good accuracy and robustness. It offers an effective tool in dealing with polycrystalline metallic materials with crystal grains of arbitrary shapes .},

Furthermore, in applications where prediction time is critical, such as prediction of hurricane storm surge, the predictions of system response and uncertainties can be required within short time frames. Here, we develop an efficient stochastic shallow water model to address these issues. To discretize the physical and probability spaces we use a Stochastic Galerkin method and an Incremental Pressure Correction Scheme to advance the solution in time. To overcome discrete stability issues, we propose cross-mode stabilization methods which employs existing stabilization methods in the probability space by adding stabilization terms to every stochastic mode in a modes-coupled way. We extensively verify the developed method for both idealized shallow water test cases and hindcasting of past hurricanes. We subsequently use the developed and verified method to perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of the established shallow water surrogate models. Finally, we propose a predictor for hurricane storm surge under uncertain wind drag coefficients and demonstrate its effectivity for Hurricanes Ike and Harvey.},

The multiscale scheme is featured by (a) using a two-phase MPM in conjunction with the u − v − p u−v−p formulation to solve the solid–fluid interactions in the macroscopic domain of a boundary value problem of saturated porous media, and (b) employing a DEM assembly comprised of arbitrarily shaped particles to provide path-dependent effective constitutive responses for each material point under complex loading conditions. A semi-implicit integration scheme based on the fractional step algorithm is further implemented in the proposed multiscale approach to improve its overall efficiency. The proposed approach is validated by the one-dimensional consolidation test before being further used to simulate more challenging problems, including the cyclic shaking test, the column collapse, and the wave propagation in anisotropic saturated porous media. We demonstrate that the proposed MPM-DEM approach is powerful and versatile in capturing the complicated static and dynamic multiphysics interactions exhibited in saturated granular media that could be of practical importance in various engineering settings. We further establish connections between these macroscopic observations with their underlying microstructural mechanisms to offer multiscale insights into the complicated dynamic responses of saturated sand.},

The subdomain problems involve solving positive definite cell-centered pressure systems. The normal flux on the subdomain interfaces is the mortar coupling variable, which plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier to impose weakly continuity of pressure. We present well-posedness and error analysis based on reformulating the method as a mixed finite element method with a quadrature rule. We develop a non-overlapping domain decomposition algorithm for the solution of the resulting algebraic system that reduces it to an interface problem for the flux-mortar, as well as an efficient interface preconditioner .

This method provides a non-intrusive, real-time, and in-situ data assimilation framework for physical systems modeled by parameterized Partial Differential Equations . Given a sequential set of M M measurements at acquisition time t k tk , the key idea of the proposed formulation is to seek an approximation u N , M k = z N , M k + η N , M k uN,Mk=zN,Mk+ηN,Mk of the true state u t r u e k utruek employing projection-by-data; the first term comes from a background estimate z N , M k zN,Mk computed from a reduced-basis N N -dimensional linear space informed by the parameterized mathematical model , while the second term comes from an update state η N , M k ηN,Mk informed by experimental observations (hybrid modeling with correction of model bias). The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we present a new formulation adapted to time-dependent parameterized problems of the classical PBDW strategy. In particular, the N N -dimensional linear space is here constructed using a space/time/parameter decomposition. Furthermore, we exploit the evolution features to enrich the biased model with previous updates, and to extrapolate in time the estimated states in order to predict and monitor the physical system. We set up and analyze a synthetic numerical example of thermal diffusion with different biases to assess and compare performance of three formulations of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {We extend the scope of our recently developed approach for unsupervised automated discovery of material laws (denoted as EUCLID) to the general case of a material belonging to an unknown class of constitutive behavior. To this end, we leverage the theory of generalized standard materials, which encompasses a plethora of important constitutive classes including elasticity, viscosity, plasticity and arbitrary combinations thereof. We show that, based only on full-field kinematic measurements and net reaction forces, EUCLID is able to automatically discover the two scalar thermodynamic potentials, namely, the Helmholtz free energy and the dissipation potential, which completely define the behavior of generalized standard materials. The a priori enforced constraint of convexity on these potentials guarantees by construction stability and thermodynamic consistency of the discovered model; balance of linear momentum acts as a fundamental constraint to replace the availability of stress–strain labeled pairs; sparsity promoting regularization enables the automatic selection of a small subset from a possibly large number of candidate model features and thus leads to a parsimonious, i.e., simple and interpretable, model. Importantly, since model features go hand in hand with the correspondingly active internal variables, sparse regression automatically induces a parsimonious selection of the few internal variables needed for an accurate but simple description of the material behavior. A fully automatic procedure leads to the selection of the hyperparameter controlling the weight of the sparsity promoting regularization term, in order to strike a user-defined balance between model accuracy and simplicity. By testing the method on synthetic data including artificial noise, we demonstrate that EUCLID is able to automatically discover the true hidden material model from a large catalogue of constitutive classes, including elasticity, viscoelasticity, elastoplasticity, viscoplasticity, isotropic and kinematic hardening.},

Based on Hamilton–Jacobi theory for reachability and the level set method, the resulting methodology computes the Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective path planning problem , numerically solving the exact equations governing the evolution of reachability fronts and optimal paths in the augmented energy and physical-space domain. Our approach is applicable to path planning in various dynamic flow environments and energy types. We first validate the methodology through a benchmark case of crossing a steady jet for which we compare our results to semi-analytical optimal energy–time solutions. We then consider unsteady flow environments and solve for energy–time optimal missions in a quasi-geostrophic double-gyre flow field . Results show that our theory and schemes can provide all the energy–time optimal solutions and that these solutions can be strongly influenced by unsteady flow conditions .},

This work models and investigates the crack initiation, growth, propagation, and branching in two-dimensional single crystalline boron carbide at the nanometer length-scale and picosecond time-scale. A phase-field approach is used by carefully selecting the interfacial energy allowing a monolithic numerical solution method capturing strong coupling between mechanics and damage. Specifically, the transient Ginzburg–Landau equation is coupled with the balance of momentum including geometric nonlinearities and solved by using the open-source computing platform FEniCS. The monolithic computation ensures necessary accuracy for dynamic fracture under pure mode I loading, and also demonstrates the capability of crack branching depending on the loading rate. The effect of crack regularization length and kinetic coefficient on the crack interface profile and crack tip velocity is also studied. Altogether, the results are important for modeling anisotropic fracture in advanced ceramics and designing materials with desired dynamic failure characteristics.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel stochastic finite element scheme to solve partial differential equations defined on random domains. A geometric mapping algorithm first transforms the random domain into a reference domain. By combining the mesh topology (i.e. the node numbering and the element numbering) of the reference domain and random nodal coordinates of the random domain, random meshes of the original problem are obtained by only one mesh of the reference domain. In this way, the original problem is still discretized and solved on the random domain instead of the reference domain. A random isoparametric mapping of random meshes is then proposed to generate the stochastic finite element equation of the original problem. We adopt a weak-intrusive method to solve the obtained stochastic finite element equation. In this method, the unknown stochastic solution is decoupled into a sum of the products of random variables and deterministic vectors. Deterministic vectors are computed by solving deterministic finite element equations, and corresponding random variables are solved by a proposed sampling method. The computational effort of the proposed method does not increase dramatically as the stochastic dimension increases and it can solve high-dimensional stochastic problems with low computational effort, thus the proposed method avoids the curse of dimensionality successfully. Four numerical examples are given to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.},

This know-how is often difficult to be synthesised in a set of rules or steps as it remains in the intuition and expertise of engineers, designers, and other professionals. Today, a new research line in this concern spot-up thanks to the explosion of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms and its alliance with Computational Mechanics and Optimisation tools. However, a key aspect with industrial design is the scarcity of available data, making it problematic to rely on deep-learning approaches. Assuming that the existing designs live in a manifold, in this paper, we propose a synergistic use of existing Machine Learning tools to infer a reduced manifold from the existing limited set of designs and, then, to use it to interpolate between the individuals, working as a generator basis, to create new and coherent designs. For this, a key aspect is to be able to properly interpolate in the reduced manifold, which requires a proper clustering of the individuals. From our experience, due to the scarcity of data, adding topological descriptors to geometrical ones considerably improves the quality of the clustering. Thus, a distance, mixing topology and geometry is proposed. This distance is used both, for the clustering and for the interpolation. For the interpolation, relying on optimal transport appear to be mandatory. Examples of growing complexity are proposed to illustrate the goodness of the method.},

The prediction of real stress states and possibly resulting failure mechanisms is essential and a real challenge, e.g. in the design process. In this contribution, imperfections in elastic materials such as air voids in adhesive bonds between fiber-reinforced composites are investigated. They are modeled as arbitrarily shaped and positioned. The focus is on local displacement values as well as on associated stress concentrations caused by the imperfections. For this purpose, the resulting complex random one-scale finite element model is numerically solved by a new developed surrogate model using an overlapping domain decomposition scheme based on Schwarz alternating method. Here, the actual response of local subproblems associated with isolated material imperfections is determined by a single appropriate surrogate model, that allows for an accelerated propagation of randomness. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated for imperfections with elliptical and ellipsoidal shape in 2D and 3D and extended to arbitrarily shaped voids. For the latter one, a local surrogate model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) is constructed. Finally, a comparison to experimental results validates the numerical predictions for a real engineering problem.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces an isometric manifold embedding data-driven paradigm designed to enable model-free simulations with noisy data sampled from a constitutive manifold. The proposed data-driven approach iterates between a global optimization problem that seeks admissible solutions for the balance principle and a local optimization problem that finds the closest point projection of the Euclidean space that isometrically embeds a nonlinear constitutive manifold. To de-noise the database, a geometric autoencoder is introduced such that the encoder first learns to create an approximated embedding that maps the underlying low-dimensional structure of the high-dimensional constitutive manifold onto a flattened manifold with less curvature. We then obtain the noise-free constitutive responses by projecting data onto a denoised latent space that is completely flat by assuming that the noise and the underlying constitutive signal are orthogonal to each other. Consequently, a projection from the conservative manifold onto this de-noised constitutive latent space enables us to complete the local optimization step of the data-driven paradigm. Finally, to decode the data expressed in the latent space without reintroducing noise, we impose a set of isometry constraints while training the autoencoder such that the nonlinear mapping from the latent space to the reconstructed constituent manifold is distance-preserving. Numerical examples are used to both validate the implementation and demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and limitations of the proposed paradigm.},

Firstly, we produce the high-dimensional raw dataset, including uncertain material and load inputs and full-field displacement outputs, by the isogeometric Monte Carlo simulator. Secondly, assisted by proper orthogonal decomposition, we freshly convert the map between raw input and output to the map between their reduced basis coefficients, alleviating the limitations of traditional data-driven methods in handling high-dimensional issues. Thirdly, a machine learning Emulator based on Gaussian Process, from the perspective of Bayesian statistics, is built and trained using the reduced basis coefficients. Consequently, we use the proposed emulators to quickly and directly predict the full-field solution to the new input. The most salient characteristics illustrated by the engineering examples are: (1) the emulator is a universal data-driven/machine learning method that is capable of directly mapping from high-dimensional input to the high-dimensional (i.e., 2940) full-field solution. (2) It still produces accurate non-linear functional approximations with a small number of training samples, and offers the confidence interval indicating the level of trust we have in this prediction. Meanwhile, it significantly improves the scalability of traditional Gaussian Process Regression.

  abstract     = {Pyramid elements can facilitate meshing by simplifying transitions from hexahedral to tetrahedral regions and a second-order basis promotes robust accuracy in unstructured meshes . Over the last decade, second-order C 0 hexahedral, tetrahedral, and wedge elements that demonstrate important benefits have emerged for lumped-mass explicit dynamic methods in nonlinear solid mechanics. Whereas various second- and higher-order pyramid element formulations have been developed, none have addressed the necessities for lumped-mass explicit methods. Standard row-summation lumping for the popular 13- and 14-node pyramid elements, for example, produces negative lumped masses at the vertex nodes. Degeneration of hexahedral elements into pyramids is also unsatisfactory for second-order lumped-mass elements, except perhaps for low-interest fill regions. Such issues are resolved herein by developing 19-node second-order C 0 pyramid element formulations that provide all-positive row-sum nodal lumped masses and are also compatible with the other suitable second-order lumped-mass elements. Other specific requirements of explicit methods are also addressed, and several uniform and selectively reduced pyramid quadrature rules are investigated. Application to a variety of benchmark problems demonstrates robust performance, including no apparent ill effects arising from using rational shape functions to treat the apex and good accuracy with pyramids placed in critical regions of highly nonlinear inelastic analyses.},

The method extends the positive definite non-oscillatory finite element algorithm (NFEM) capabilities to predict sediment transport, multiphase flow, and evolution of the resulting interfaces limiting fluids, erodible sediment layers and non-erodible strata. Free surface hydrodynamics is simulated by the integration of the governing equations for incompressible multiphase flows, including the advection and reinitialization of a phase function to update the interface location. Sign preservation of the algorithm is essential both for fluid interface tracking procedure and for the landform tracking. In the first case, the property avoids unphysical overshoots along the free surface. In the second case, a positive definite thickness of the erodible layer of sediment is mandatory to account for interaction between evolving cohesionless sediment layers and rigid beds. To compute sediment layer thickness, the method incorporates a conservation law to balance evolution of the bed position with sediment mass flux, including a general template for saturated flux calculation. The framework permits the simulation from bed load dominant transport to saltation dominant transport. Fluid/terrain interface is explicitly captured by a surface tracking methodology whereby the mesh is adapted to the bedform. Numerical experiments explore several saturated sediment flow formulae for interactive evolution of dune/atmosphere system, as well as stringent dam-break type problems on channels with dry beds and partially and totally erodible beds.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a class of machine learning methods called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed and gained prevalence in solving various scientific computing problems. This approach enables the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) via embedding physical laws into the loss function. Many inverse problems can be tackled by simply combining the data from real life scenarios with existing PINN algorithms. In this paper, we present a multi-task learning method using uncertainty weighting to improve the training efficiency and accuracy of PINNs for inverse problems in linear elasticity and hyperelasticity. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of PINNs to a practical inverse problem in structural analysis: prediction of external loads of diverse engineering structures based on limited displacement monitoring points. To this end, we first determine a simplified loading scenario at the offline stage. By setting unknown boundary conditions as learnable parameters, PINNs can predict the external loads with the support of measured data. When it comes to the online stage in real engineering projects, transfer learning is employed to fine-tune the pre-trained model from offline stage. Our results show that, even with noisy gappy data, satisfactory results can still be obtained from the PINN model due to the dual regularization of physics laws and prior knowledge, which exhibits better robustness compared to traditional analysis methods. Our approach is capable of bridging the gap between various structures with geometric scaling and under different loading scenarios, and the convergence of training is also greatly accelerated through not only the layer freezing but also the multi-task weight inheritance from pre-trained models, thus making it possible to be applied as surrogate models in actual engineering projects.},

  abstract     = {When using Neural Networks as trial functions to numerically solve PDEs , a key choice to be made is the loss function to be minimised, which should ideally correspond to a norm of the error. In multiple problems, this error norm coincides with – or is equivalent to – the H − 1 H−1 -norm of the residual; however, it is often difficult to accurately compute it. This work assumes rectangular domains and proposes the use of a Discrete Sine/Cosine Transform to accurately and efficiently compute the H − 1 H−1 norm. The resulting Deep Fourier-based Residual (DFR) method efficiently and accurately approximate solutions to PDEs . This is particularly useful when solutions lack H 2 H2 regularity and methods involving strong formulations of the PDE fail. We observe that the H 1 H1 -error is highly correlated with the discretised loss during training, which permits accurate error estimation via the loss.},

  abstract     = {This article extends the subset of analysis-suitable unstructured T-splines (ASUT-splines) that have C 1 C1 continuity in irregular regions to allow non-uniform knots at extraordinary points. That is, we remove the preceding restriction that required uniform spoke edge knot spans of ASUT-splines. To achieve this, the degenerate-patch (D-patch) framework, which has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for generating refinable spline spaces over unstructured quadrilateral meshes, is generalized to the non-uniform case. We prove that uniform smoothing matrices are also valid for non-uniform knots. However, we also show that nested refinements of ASUT-splines are not available if using these matrices in the non-uniform case. Therefore, a new idempotent smoothing matrix is introduced to overcome this limitation. The detailed construction of this smoothing matrix is given, which helps to study more kinds of smoothing matrices in the future. Then, the non-uniform D-patch framework is employed for ASUT-splines. We provide a thorough discussion of the differences between the uniform and non-uniform cases. A new refinement strategy for the design space of ASUT-splines is also presented. Numerical experiments show that our extension of ASUT-splines can construct non-uniform parameterization around extraordinary points while maintaining the C 1 C1 continuity of the surface and optimal convergence rates for isogeometric analysis of both the Poisson problem and the biharmonic problem. A car hood model with complex shape features is used to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to design and analyze practical models within a seamlessly integrated framework.},

The weak form is consistently derived and linearized, including the contributions from kinematic constraints and configuration-dependent load. The nonlinear terms with respect to the cross-sectional coordinates are strictly considered, and the obtained constitutive model is scrutinized. The main features of the formulation are invariance with respect to the rigid-body motion, path-independence, and improved accuracy for strongly curved beams. A new reduced beam model is conceived as a special case, by omitting the rotational DOF. Although rotation-free, the reduced model includes the torsion of the beam axis, which allows simulations of spatial beams that are predominantly bent with respect to the binormal. The applicability of the obtained isogeometric finite element is verified via a set of standard academic benchmark examples. The formulation is able to accurately model strongly curved Bernoulli–Euler beams that have well-defined Frenet–Serret frames.},

  abstract     = {The present work addresses the issue of accurate stochastic approximations in high-dimensional parametric space using tools from uncertainty quantification (UQ). The basis adaptation method and its accelerated algorithm in polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) were recently proposed to construct low-dimensional approximations adapted to specific quantities of interest (QoI). The present paper addresses one difficulty with these adaptations, namely their reliance on quadrature point sampling, which limits the reusability of potentially expensive samples. Projection pursuit (PP) is a statistical tool to find the “interesting” projections in high-dimensional data and thus bypass the curse-of-dimensionality. In the present work, we combine the fundamental ideas of basis adaptation and projection pursuit regression (PPR) to propose a novel method to simultaneously learn the optimal low-dimensional spaces and PCE representation from given data. While this projection pursuit adaptation (PPA) can be entirely data-driven, the constructed approximation exhibits mean-square convergence to the solution of an underlying governing equation and thus captures the supports and probability distributions associated with the physics constraints. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a borehole problem and a structural dynamics problem, demonstrating the versatility of the method and its ability to discover low-dimensional manifolds with high accuracy with limited data. In addition, the method can learn surrogate models for different quantities of interest while reusing the same data set.},

The tip singularity enrichment is introduced to assure high accuracy through the extra-DOF free PU approximation. The BRSM, which is designed to solve the challenge about robust and efficient geometry representation of 3D non-planar surface crack growth, is applied to model the geometry of the 3D dynamic crack propagation in this paper.

  abstract     = {We present a new physics-based machine learning approach for solving parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) over generalized domains. Central to this method is the coupling of isogeometric representation with deep learning. This approach represents both the physical domain and the solution to a PDE as a linear combination of non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) basis functions and employs a deep feed-forward neural network to predict NURBS solution coefficients. Trained networks output the coefficients of NURBS to approximate PDE solutions for an entire range of physical and shape variables. Desirable aspects of the NURBS basis, such as its local support, refinement properties, and its capacity to represent freeform shapes compactly, are synergistically integrated with the ability of neural networks to learn hidden and non-linear mappings. Novel features of this isogeometric neural network (IGN) approach include its ability to perform physics-based learning over changing domains and efficient hierarchical learning. In contrast to classical PDE forward-solving techniques such as finite element analysis and isogeometric analysis, the IGN is able to learn PDE solutions for a range of parametric variables. We show empirically that no labeled data is required to obtain high-fidelity approximations to the solutions of parameterized PDEs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the IGN, 1D and 2D problems of various physics are addressed.},

In this work, we devise a new HDG method to approximate the solution of the Stokes tangential boundary control problem; the HDG method is also of independent interest for solving the Stokes equations .

The nominal computational cost of solving a rank- r r reduced-order model (ROM) based on time-dependent basis, a.k.a. TDB-ROM, is roughly equal to that of solving the full-order model for r r random samples. As of now, this nominal performance can only be achieved for linear or quadratic SPDEs—at the expense of a highly intrusive process. On the other hand, for problems with non-polynomial nonlinearity, the computational cost of solving the TDB evolution equations is the same as solving the full-order model. In this work, we present an adaptive sparse interpolation algorithm that enables stochastic TDB-ROMs to achieve nominal computational cost for generic nonlinear SPDEs. Our algorithm constructs a low-rank approximation for the right hand side of the SPDE using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The presented algorithm does not require any offline computation and as a result the low-rank approximation can adapt to any transient changes of the dynamics on the fly. We also propose a rank-adaptive strategy to control the error of the sparse interpolation. Our algorithm achieves computational speedup by adaptive sampling of the state and random spaces. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach for two test cases: (1) one-dimensional stochastic Burgers’ equation, and (2) two-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations subject to one-hundred-dimensional random perturbations. In all cases, the presented algorithm results in orders of magnitude reduction in the computational cost.},

In conventional studies, the internal boundary is modelled only considering the Neumann conditions of the local mesh; the global mesh is defined independently of the geometry of the internal boundary. Although this conventional method is effective in simplifying the meshing procedure for problems of a solid body with an internal boundary, its verification has not been sufficiently investigated. This study first clarifies the limitations of the conventional method based on strict verification and discussions of the weak form of the S-method. Three methods are proposed to solve the clarified issue: (i) FCM-based, (ii) IBM-based, and (iii) XFEM-based methods. The numerical results of the respective methods showed better accuracy than that of the conventional method. Particularly, the XFEM-based method demonstrated significantly higher accuracy and successfully solved the clarified issue. Consequently, the intrinsic strengths of the S-method, which are local high accuracy with low numerical costs and simplicity in the meshing procedure, are effectively utilised for the problems of a solid body with an internal boundary by the proposed strategy of the XFEM-based method.},

While some of the current methods can quantify response uncertainty and estimate the likelihood function of unknown parameters, calibration remains challenging when the parameters are uncertainties of unknown distribution. Considering model uncertainty inversion, we propose a collaborative calibration framework that quantifies and calibrates the distribution of unknown parameters. We used the Nested Stochastic Kriging (NSK) model to estimate the global trend and uncertainty of response data. The unknown parameters are then updated using the optimization-based calibration (OBC) method, where an infill sampling criterion is proposed. Finally, the variance of the parameter is calibrated. The calibrated model can reflect the uncertainty of the response data and can be further used to estimate the distribution of a new design. The proposed approach is tested using two numerical instances, and the bolt simulation model under tension-bending condition is calibrated using 30 experimental data points. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the best performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

Different from the conventional stabilization method, the penalty factor in the IS-PD-CMM is only related to the material properties and does not require the parameter calibration. In addition, an equivalent strain function is introduced into the IS-PD-CMM as the failure criterion for the nearly incompressible hyperelastic material, where the nonlocal damage of the model is determined by calculating the ratio of bond breakages of material particles. The high accuracy and adaptability of the IS-PD-CMM are demonstrated by three representative examples including the infinitesimal deformation of linear elastic materials and the finite deformation of hyperelastic materials. Finally, the in-plane tensile fracture behavior and the out-of-plane tearing fracture behavior are simulated and analyzed to illustrate the good performance of the IS-PD-CMM in predicting the crack propagation of nearly incompressible hyperelastic materials.},

  abstract     = {A novel phase field model of two-phase fluid flow based on the interaction between solid and pore fluids for modelling hydraulic fracture propagation in poro-elastic media is proposed. In this model, the two-phase fluid flow in the matrix obeys Darcy’s law. Moreover, the capillary pressure in the flow process is considered, and the anisotropic relative permeability model of the two-phase flow, which is related to fluid saturation , is introduced. The driving force of the phase field and Biot’s modulus of the two-phase fluid flow vary with the phase field and fluid saturation. Displacement, pressure, and saturation are solved in a staggered manner. The corresponding numerical solution iterative format is established using the finite element numerical discretisation and Newton–Raphson iterative methods. The correctness of the model is verified, and the limitations of the single-phase flow model are revealed. In addition, the influence of different matrix permeabilities on fracture propagation in porous media, the propagation law of hydraulic fractures under different matrix water saturations, and the effect of different stress differences on hydraulic fracture propagation in multi-layer superimposed formations are studied.},

This work focuses on the large class of physical systems that can be well described by models with quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms and proposes a regularizer for operator inference that induces a stability bias onto learned models. The proposed regularizer is physics informed in the sense that it penalizes higher-order terms with large norms and so explicitly leverages the polynomial model form that is given by the underlying physics. This means that the proposed approach judiciously learns from data and physical insights combined, rather than from either data or physics alone. Additionally, a formulation of operator inference is proposed that enforces model constraints for preserving structure such as symmetry and definiteness in linear terms. Numerical results demonstrate that models learned with operator inference and the proposed regularizer and structure preservation are accurate and stable even in cases where using no regularization and Tikhonov regularization leads to models that are unstable.},

As a typical and basic excitation form, the nonlinear principal resonance of FG nanotubes under the supercritical pulsatile flow and forced excitation is studied. Geometric nonlinearity originates from the tensile hardening of immovable boundary modeled​ by von Kármán’s nonlinear geometric relationship. Size-dependencies for both nanofluids and nanosolids are characterized by slip-flow model and nonlocal strain gradient model coupled with surface effects, respectively. Under the framework of Zhang–Fu’s beam theory, the governing equations for coupled resonance based on the initial post-buckling equilibrium state are established. A combination of perturbation-incremental harmonic balance method (IHBM) is established and employed in bifurcation analysis of such a strongly nonlinear coupled resonance system for the first time The softening-type nonlinear behavior and multiple-stable solutions are found and two dominant factors controlling the bifurcation topology are revealed. It is suggested that the size effects of both nanoflow and nanosolid are dual and may change the bifurcation topology through two mechanisms. One is the change of two excitations from strong interaction to weak interaction, and the other is the change of multi-solution threshold of the two-excitation amplitude ratio. The results can guide the nonlinear design and adjustment of the NEMS to obtain available working frequency band maintaining stable motion state.},

An efficient adaptive kriging (EAK) method is developed to solve the interval dynamic responses of structures with credible intervals and ellipsoids. In contrast to existing propagation methods, the proposed EAK method shares the samples of different time steps to improve the computational efficiency. A numerical example and two engineering applications are used to show the validity, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Comparisons show that the proposed method can effectively calculate interval dynamic responses with credibility and is competitive when addressing nonlinear or coupled structural systems.},

By minimal mass, we mean, for a given clustered tensegrity structure subject to prescribed external loads , the minimal mass is achieved when all the structure members simultaneously fail (buckle or yield). This paper helps to find the lower bound of the required mass of the CTS. Firstly, we introduce the connectivity and clustering definitions through respective matrices and derive the nonlinear clustered tensegrity statics equation in terms of the nodal vector of the structure. Since the mass of each member is in a one-to-one correspondence to its force density (force by unit length), the static equilibrium equations of the CTS with respect to the force density and force vectors are also given. Then, we formulated the mass and gravity of hollow bars and strings subject to buckling and yielding conditions. Finally, a nonlinear optimization algorithm is presented to compute the minimal mass of any CTS with any given external force and topology. We also demonstrate that the traditional tensegrity structure (TTS) is a particular case of the CTS by defining the cluster matrix as an identity matrix . At last, numerical examples are given to validate the CTS minimal mass design approach. The method proposed by this research can be used for the lightweight design of tensegrity, truss, cable nets, membrane structures, etc.},

To address such issues, a Stochastic Dependency Neural Estimator (SDNE) is proposed to construct the mapping from the input parameter domain to the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response domain, revealing the underlying relationship between the high-dimensional regression estimation and manifold distribution hypothesis. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCN) are integrated to capture nonlinear features from irregular geometries and time series simultaneously. Two high-speed impact cases involving large deformation and highly nonlinear transients are investigated to validate the proposed method. The proposed SDNE achieves highly accurate prediction compared with Finite Element (FE) evaluations. To further validate the practical application of the proposed method, multi-objective crashworthiness optimizations are performed with the proposed SDNE.

  abstract     = {Aggressive media in the environment will penetrate into the porous media through the connected pore channels, causing damage to the microstructure and reducing the working performance. In statistical physics, the connectivity of porous network is usually described by the concept of percolation. A critical yet unresolved subject has been how to adequately capture the percolation thresholds of these complex porous network including polyshaped–polysized pores, and their quantitative implications on the transport property of porous media. This paper presents theoretical and numerical approaches for precisely determining the effects of pore shape- and size-polydispersities on percolation thresholds and diffusivity of porous media. Combining the Monte Carlo simulation with finite-size scaling analysis, the statistical values of percolation thresholds are obtained. Incorporating the proposed pore size-polydispersity degree with the excluded volume, the influences of pore shape- and size-polydispersities on the percolation thresholds are characterized. Substituting the percolation thresholds into generalized effective medium theory, the diffusivities of porous media are theoretically predicted. Moreover, the lattice Boltzmann method is employed to numerically calculate the diffusivity . Comparison with the theoretical, numerical and experimental results reveals the present model can accurately predict the percolation thresholds and diffusivities of porous media. The results indicate that the enhancing of the pore excluded volume and the decline of the pore size-polydispersity degree will decrease the percolation threshold and increase the diffusivity. This work can provide novel insights into understanding the complex interactions between the composition (pore shape- and size-polydispersities), microstructure (percolation threshold), and macro-property (diffusivity) of porous media.},

  abstract     = {The multi-scale and nonlinear feature of additive manufacturing problems poses great challenges to numerical algorithms regarding computational efficiency and fidelity. In this work, we propose a novel local multi-mesh finite volume method for heat transfer and fluid flow problems in the additive manufacturing process. In this method, two sets of meshes (coarse base mesh and finer overlay mesh) are used to resolve the macroscopic temperature field of the whole domain and the mesoscopic heat transfer and fluid flow problem within a relatively small region covering the melt pool, respectively. The interaction between the base mesh and the overlay mesh is handled by the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the interface following the refinement-by-superposition idea, such that the powder-scale simulation is available with high efficiency. The finer mesh with cells of sub-powder size uses the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian description and moves with the heat source to keep coverage of the region with high solution gradients. According to the moving feature of the finer mesh, a particle-volume fraction conversion scheme is introduced to update the material distribution. The local multi-mesh finite volume method is further combined with the discrete element method as well as a surface reconstruction method to alternatively solve the powder layering process and the laser melting process. A set of numerical cases is presented, and the numerical results are compared with analytical and experimental data from the literature, with good agreement in cases where such data is available. Moreover, the computational efficiency of the proposed method is proved to be dozens of times (16 ∼ ∼ 50 for the given size ratios of the melt pool to the whole domain) of the finite volume method using a uniform structured mesh. It is expected to be a powerful tool for efficiently achieving powder-scale simulation of the additive manufacturing process and other similar multi-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {For multilayer structures, interfacial failure is one of the most important elements related to device reliability. For cohesive zone modeling, traction–separation relations represent the adhesive interactions across interfaces. However, existing theoretical models do not currently capture traction–separation relations that have been extracted using direct methods, particularly under mixed-mode conditions. Given the complexity of the problem, models derived from the neural network approach are attractive. Although they can be trained to model data along the loading paths taken in a particular set of mixed-mode fracture experiments, they may fail to obey physical laws for paths not covered by the training data sets. In this paper, a thermodynamically consistent neural network (TCNN) approach is established to model the constitutive behavior of interfaces when faced with sparse training data sets. Accordingly, four conditions are examined and implemented here: (i), positive energy dissipation ; (ii), maximum energy 10 dissipation; (iii), conservation of the J-integral; (iv), dependence of interfacial toughness on the fracture mode-mix. These conditions are treated as constraints and are implemented as such in the loss function. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by comparing the modeling results with a range of physical constraints and several different input data sets. Moreover, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is then adopted to optimize the weight factors associated with each of the constraints in order to overcome convergence issues that can arise when multiple constraints are present. The resultant numerical implementation of the ideas presented here produced well-behaved, mixed-mode traction–separation​ surfaces that maintained the fidelity of the experimental data that was provided as input. Some guidance is also provided on the desirable features of input data sets. The proposed approach heralds a new autonomous, point-to-point constitutive modeling concept for interface mechanics.},

  abstract     = {During proportional loading of structures a significant re-arrangement of stresses may occur. It may result e.g. in the transition from a softening to a stiffening structure. This may even be the case for constant material stiffness . Since the terms stiffening structure and softening structure are lacking universally accepted definitions, it is not astonishing that the search for conditions for minimum stiffness of proportionally loaded multi degree of freedom structures has so far attracted very little attention. Presentation of such a condition, in the framework of the Finite Element Method (FEM), is the task of this publication. It is based on a linear eigenvalue problem that renders complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors possible. The point of inflection in the real part of the complex section of a specific eigenvalue function is shown to mark the load-level of minimum stiffness of a proportionally loaded structure. Complex eigenvalues require the indefiniteness of both real symmetric coefficient matrices of the underlying linear eigenvalue problem. In the given case, the first one depends on a dimensionless load parameter, whereas the second one is obtained by specialization of the first one for the onset of loading. These matrices are established with the help of a special hybrid finite element, available in a commercial FE program. The proposed condition for minimum stiffness of proportionally loaded structures is verified numerically. The results obtained in a parameter study of the investigated structure are found to agree well with the ones following from an alternative condition for the transition from a softening to a stiffening structure. This condition is based on a mechanically objective arc length in the form of a representative displacement of the structure.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous energetic materials (EMs) subjected to mechanical shock loading exhibit complex thermo-mechanical processes which are driven by the high temperature, pressure, and strain rate behind the shock. These lead to spatial energy localization in the microstructure, colloquially known as “hotspots” where chemistry may commence and possibly culminating in detonation. Shock-induced pore collapse is one of the dominant mechanisms by which localization occurs. In order to physically predict the shock sensitivity of energetic materials under these extreme conditions, we formulate a multiplicative crystal plasticity model with key features inferred from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Within the framework of thermodynamics, we incorporate the pressure dependence of both monoclinic elasticity and critical resolved shear stress into the crystal plasticity formulation. Other fundamental mechanisms, such as strain hardening and pressure-dependent melting curves, are all inferred from atomic-scale computations performed across relevant intervals of pressure and temperature. To handle the extremely large deformation and the evolving geometry of the self-contact due to pore collapse, we leverage the capabilities of the Material Point Method (MPM) to track the interface via the Lagrangian motion of material points and the Eulerian residual update to avoid the mesh distortion issue. This combination of features enables us to simulate the shock-induced pore collapse and associated hotspot evolution with a more comprehensive physical underpinning , which we apply to the monoclinic crystal β β -HMX. Treating MD predictions of the pore collapse as ground truth,head-to-head validation comparisons between MD and MPM predictions are made for samples with identical sample geometry and similar boundary conditions for reverse-ballistic impact speeds ranging from 0.5 km s −1 to 2.0 km s −1 . Comparative studies are performed to reveal the importance of incorporating a frictional contact algorithm, pressure-dependent elastic stiffness , and non-Schmid critical resolved shear stress in the mesoscale model.},

Prevailing contact schemes developed for MPM suffer from numerical instabilities , especially for the coexistence of multiple material boundary conditions. This study proposes a generalized contact scheme based on a hybrid scheme of MPM and discrete element method (DEM) to tackle such issues. The new scheme contains two novel features of particle–particle and particle–structure contact schemes guided by a DEM contact model to handle multi-material interactions. It leverages the advantages of both MPM and DEM, offering a unified way to flexibly handle either the boundary–particle or particle–particle multi-material interactions. Several typical physical processes are simulated to showcase the versatility of the proposed approach, including interface rotation and sliding, penetration, and granular material impact. It demonstrates that the generalized contact scheme can flexibly capture the mechanical responses of multi-body and multi-material systems in MPM.},

  abstract     = {Data-based approaches are promising alternatives to the traditional analytical constitutive models for solid mechanics. Herein, we propose a Gaussian process (GP) based constitutive modeling framework, focusing on planar, hyperelastic and incompressible soft tissues. Specifically, the strain energy density of soft tissues is modeled as a GP, which can be regressed to experimental stress–strain data obtained from biaxial stretching experiments. Moreover, the GP model can be weakly constrained to be convex. A key advantage of a GP-based model is that, in addition to the mean value, it provides a probability density (i.e. associated uncertainty) for the strain energy density. To simulate the effect of this uncertainty, a non-intrusive stochastic finite element analysis (SFEA) framework is proposed. The proposed framework is verified against an artificial dataset based on the Gasser–Ogden–Holzapfel model and applied to a real experimental dataset of a porcine aortic valve leaflet tissue. The results show that the proposed framework can be trained with limited experimental data and fits the data better than several existing models. The SFEA framework provides a straightforward way of using the experimental data and quantifying the resulting uncertainty in simulation-based predictions.},

  abstract     = {When evaluating quantities of interest that depend on the solutions to differential equations, we inevitably face the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Especially for parametrized, time-dependent problems in engineering computations, it is often the case that acceptable computational budgets limit the availability of high-fidelity, accurate simulation data. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling has emerged as an effective strategy to overcome this difficulty. Its key idea is to leverage many low-fidelity simulation data, less accurate but much faster to compute, to improve the approximations with limited high-fidelity data. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven framework of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling for parametrized, time-dependent problems using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to enhance output predictions both for unseen parameter values and forward in time simultaneously — a task known to be particularly challenging for data-driven models. We demonstrate the wide applicability of the proposed approaches in a variety of engineering problems with high- and low-fidelity data generated through fine versus coarse meshes, small versus large time steps, or finite element full order versus deep learning reduced-order models. Numerical results show that the proposed multi-fidelity LSTM networks not only improve single-fidelity regression significantly, but also outperform the multi-fidelity models based on feed-forward neural networks.},

  abstract     = {We make connections between complexity of training of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and Kolmogorov n-width of the solution. Leveraging this connection, we then propose Lagrangian PINNs (LPINNs) as a partial differential equation (PDE)-informed solution for convection-dominated problems. PINNs employ neural-networks to find the solutions of PDE-constrained optimization problems with initial conditions and boundary conditions as soft or hard constraints. These soft constraints are often blamed to be the sources of the complexity in the training phase of PINNs. Here, we demonstrate that the complexity of training (i) is closely related to the Kolmogorov n-width associated with problems demonstrating transport, convection, traveling waves, or moving fronts, and therefore becomes apparent in convection-dominated flows, and (ii) persists even when the boundary conditions are strictly enforced. Given this realization, we describe the mechanism underlying the training schemes such as those used in eXtended PINNs (XPINN), curriculum learning, and sequence-to-sequence learning. For an important category of PDEs, i.e., governed by non-linear convection–diffusion equation, we propose reformulating PINNs on a Lagrangian frame of reference, i.e., LPINNs, as a PDE-informed solution. A parallel architecture with two branches is proposed. One branch solves for the state variables on the characteristics, and the second branch solves for the low-dimensional characteristics curves. The proposed architecture conforms to the causality innate to the convection, and leverages the direction of travel of the information in the domain, i.e., on the characteristics. This approach is unique as it reduces the complexity of convection-dominated PINNs at the PDE level, instead of optimization strategies and/or schedulers. Finally, we demonstrate that the loss landscapes of LPINNs are less sensitive to the so-called “complexity” of the problems, i.e., convection, compared to those in the traditional PINNs in the Eulerian framework.},

  abstract     = {Coronary outlet resistance, influenced by quantification and distribution of total hyperemic coronary blood flow, is critical for accurately estimating the computation of fractional flow reserve from computed tomography angiography (FFRCT). However, accurate estimation of FFRCT is still a challenging task due to the impractical of non-invasively measuring coronary outlet resistance in the clinic. While traditional methods have been used to estimate outlet resistance through population-averaged physiological assumption models, individual differences between patients limit the reliability of the models. In this work, we propose a personalized coronary flow model based on dynamic stress computed tomographic perfusion (CTP), called CTPV, to achieve a noninvasive estimation of the outlet resistance and FFRCT. The CTPV model employs myocardial blood flow (MBF) obtained from CTP to quantify the total hyperemic coronary blood flow directly. Then, myocardial perfusion territories corresponding to coronary artery branches are proposed to distribute the outlet coronary blood flow. For this purpose, we use the Voronoi algorithm to segment the myocardial perfusion territory. Finally, the outlet resistance and FFRCT are estimated based on the outlet coronary blood flow. Experiment studies on a clinical dataset consisting of 138 vessels from 86 subjects show the superiority of our CTPV model against the CTPD and LVMD models, including the method of quantifying total hyperemic coronary blood flow based on left ventricular myocardial mass (LVM) and distributing the outlet coronary blood flow based on outlet diameter. The CTPV model estimates a higher AUC for FFRCT (AUC = 0.96) than the CTPD model (AUC = 0.93) and the LVMD model (AUC = 0.92). The accuracies of CTPV, CTPD, and LVMD models are 90.6%, 87.7%, and 84.1%, respectively. Additionally, we use different outlet truncation locations to evaluate the repeatability of the CTPV and CTPD models for estimating FFRCT on a random dataset of 10 vessels. The result shows that the repeatability of the CTPV model is better than the CTPD model. These compelling results evince that the proposed CTPV model can accurately estimate the coronary outlet resistance and improve the diagnostic performance and repeatability of FFRCT.},

However, the non-isotropic particle distribution near the free surfaces and volume non-conservation still often occur, which will degenerate accuracy in the long-time simulation with violent flows. In this study, the two major concerns are solved by proposing a new PST. The Voronoi cell is constructed for the particles with incomplete kernel support, and the difference between the Voronoi cell centroid and the corresponding particle location is used to determine the shifting vector, which ensures a very isotropic particle distribution and that no clustering or nonphysical gap occurs in these areas. For the free-surface particles, the shifting vector is determined according to the volume change and thus the volume conservation is ensured, where the volume is calculated conveniently with the merit of Voronoi diagram. The present method is compared with the other two advanced PST methods, and a set of challenging cases with violent flows is simulated to validate its superior properties in terms of maintaining isotropic particle distribution and volume conservation. Moreover, the efficiency of the present method is almost the same as those of other advanced PSTs. Overall, the new PST method presents a strong potential in the long-time simulation of violent flows in coastal engineering.},

  abstract     = {Phase-field models are promising to tackle various fracture problems where a diffusive crack is introduced and modeled using the phase variable. Owing to the non-convexity of the energy functional, the derived partial differential equations are usually solved in a staggered manner. However, this method suffers from a low convergence rate, and a large number of staggered iterations are needed, especially at the fracture nucleation and propagation. In this study, we propose novel staggered schemes, which are inspired by the fixed-stress split scheme in poromechanics. By fixing certain invariants of the stress when solving the damage evolution, the displacement increment is expressed in terms of the increment of the phase variable. The relation between these two increments enables a prediction of the displacement and the active energy based on the increment of the phase variable. Hence, the maximum number of staggered iterations is reduced, and the computational efficiency is improved. We present three fast staggered schemes by fixing the first invariant, second invariant, or both invariants of the stress, denoted by S1, S2, and S3 schemes. The performance of the schemes is then verified by comparing with the standard staggered scheme through three benchmark examples, i.e., tensile, shear, and L-shape panel tests. The results exhibit that the force–displacement relations and the crack patterns computed using the fast schemes are consistent with the ones based on the standard staggered scheme. Moreover, the proposed S1 and S3 schemes can largely reduce the maximum number of staggered iterations and total cpu time in all benchmark tests. The S2 scheme performs comparably except in the L-shape panel test, where the underlying assumption is violated in the region close to the crack.},

Furthermore, the approach relies on the decomposition of the local states into a port component – associated with the solution on interior boundaries – and a bubble component that vanishes at ports: since the bubble components are uniquely determined by the solution value at the corresponding port, we can recast the constrained optimization statement into an unconstrained statement, which reads as a nonlinear least-squares problem and can be solved using the Gauss–Newton method.

  abstract     = {Since its original formulation, the material point method (MPM) has been repeatedly further developed to become a powerful tool for simulating large deformation problems. However, the imposition of boundary condition in the MPM remains a challenge since most material points are not located at the boundary and regular background mesh is most commonly used. Therefore, the existing methods to impose boundary condition always require a boundary tracking or reconstruction algorithm , which is not always efficient or accurate. In the current work, a novel strategy to apply nonconforming Neumann boundary condition is proposed that does not require the exact boundary position. The original problem with a nonconforming traction boundary condition is transformed into an equivalent problem with a prescribed virtual stress field. Importantly, both the original and the transformed problems produce the exact same response within the material domain. To solve the equivalent problem, a modified governing equation without boundary representation is subsequently constructed, where the volume integral terms are computed by both particle quadrature and cell quadrature. Several numerical examples are investigated to assess the accuracy and demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in simulating different engineering problems. These numerical examples include mesh refinement to illustrate the method’s good convergence and a 3D complex surface to illustrate the method’s capability.},

  abstract     = {With massive advancements in sensor technologies and Internet-of-things (IoT), we now have access to terabytes of historical data ; however, there is a lack of clarity on how to best exploit the data to predict future events. One possible alternative in this context is to utilize an operator learning algorithm that directly learns the nonlinear mapping between two functional spaces; this facilitates real-time prediction of naturally arising complex evolutionary dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel operator learning algorithm referred to as the Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO) that blends integral kernel with wavelet transformation . WNO harnesses the superiority of the wavelets in time–frequency localization of the functions and enables accurate tracking of patterns in the spatial domain and effective learning of the functional mappings. Since the wavelets are localized in both time/space and frequency, WNO can provide high spatial and frequency resolution. This offers learning of the finer details of the parametric dependencies in the solution for complex problems. The efficacy and robustness of the proposed WNO are illustrated on a wide array of problems involving Burger’s equation, Darcy flow , Navier–Stokes equation, Allen–Cahn equation, and Wave advection equation . A comparative study with respect to existing operator learning frameworks is presented. Finally, the proposed approach is used to build a digital twin capable of predicting Earth’s air temperature based on available historical data .},

  abstract     = {A theoretical framework for the accuracy analysis of meshfree collocation methods is presented with a particular focus on the effects of boundary conditions. In the proposed framework, the error of a meshfree collocation formulation is decomposed into three parts, namely, the collocation errors associated with the interior nodes, the Dirichlet boundary nodes and the Neumann boundary nodes , respectively. The errors arising from different parts of the computational domain can be conveniently obtained by performing a local truncation error analysis on the discrete meshfree collocation equations corresponding to the generic interior and boundary nodes. It turns out that the accuracy of a meshfree collocation formulation is controlled by the lowest accuracy order resulting from the collocation errors at both interior and boundary nodes, as well as the meshfree interpolation errors . Along this path, it is shown that accuracy of the standard node-based meshfree collocation method is governed by the collocation error related to interior nodes for both L 2 L2 and H 1 H1 error norms. Nonetheless, for different boundary conditions, the accuracy of the subdomain meshfree collocation method may rely on either the collocation error associated with interior nodes, the collocation errors corresponding to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary nodes, or the interpolation errors. It is further proved that the optimal convergence rates of Galerkin meshfree formulation can be achieved by the subdomain meshfree collocation method if the problems are purely subjected to Dirichlet boundary conditions . The proposed theoretical results are well confirmed by numerical examples .},

Geometry projection techniques are employed to efficiently perform the analysis using a non-conforming mesh. Laminates are assumed to be homogeneous through their thickness and a discrete set of fiber orientations is considered for each laminate. The fiber reinforcement design thus consists of optimizing the volume fraction of each orientation in each laminate. Several compliance minimization examples demonstrate the validity and efficacy of the method. The results demonstrate that substantial performance may be gained by optimizing the layup of each laminate while simultaneously optimizing the layout of these laminates in space.},

  abstract     = {Since most approximation functions in meshfree methods are rational functions which do not possess the Kronecker delta property, how to achieve exact integration and accurately impose the essential boundary conditions are two typical difficulties for meshfree methods. In this paper, a new stabilized Lagrange interpolation collocation method (SLICM) is proposed in which the Lagrange interpolation (LI) is employed for the approximation in a meshfree method. This method can satisfy the high order integration constraints which can conserves the high order consistency conditions in the integration form. This property leads to the exact integration in the subdomains and optimal convergence for the proposed method. Meanwhile, performing the integration in subdomains can also reduce the condition number of discrete matrix, which improves the stability of the algorithm. Since the Lagrange interpolation approximation has Kronecker delta property, the essential boundary conditions can be simply and exactly imposed like the finite element method, which further improves the accuracy of this method. Convergence studies present that the same convergence rate can be attained for utilizing the odd and even order LI shape functions, while the convergence rate is reduced if the odd order basis function is employed in the reproducing kernel (RK) approximation. Numerical examples validate the high accuracy and convergence as well as good stability of the presented method, which can outperform the direct collocation method and the stabilized collocation method based on RK approximation.},

The compatibility between neighbouring octree cells of different sizes is satisfied by employing polyhedral elements. Matrix operations within the solver are carried out by adopting an octree pattern-based pre-computation approach. Here, a limited number of master cells in a balanced octree mesh is exploited to reduce memory requirements and perform highly efficient matrix product computations. The parallelism is achieved by employing a mesh-partitioning strategy and message-passing-interface (MPI) directives. The results show that the developed PCG solver attains a significant parallel speed-up and efficiency with an increasing number of cores on distributed memory systems.

A combination of discrete surface Ricci flow algorithm and elastic iteration is proposed to predict the initial solution. It is proved applicable, even for the extremely curled parts which have negative angles and vertical walls. In addition, we propose a method that the external force of the punch is equivalent to the control point by means of Greville abscissae. A nonlinear equation system is established based on the principle of minimum potential energy . The Newton–Raphson iteration is used to calculate the blank shape and the thickness distribution of the stamping parts.

These methods provide reduced dimensionality representations of the design space, capable of maintaining a certain degree of the original design variability. Nevertheless, they usually do not allow to use directly the original parameterization method, representing a limitation to their widespread application in the industrial field, where the design parameters often pertain to well-established parametric models , e.g. CAD (computer aided design) models. This work presents how to embed the parametric-model original parameters in a reduced-dimensionality representation of the design space. The method, which takes advantage from the definition of a newly-introduced generalized feature space , is demonstrated, as a proof of concept , for the reparameterization of 2D Bezier curves and 3D free-form deformation design spaces and the consequent solution of simulation-driven design optimization problems of a subsonic airfoil and a naval destroyer in calm water, respectively.},

  abstract     = {We present a scalable block preconditioning strategy for the trace system arising from the high-order hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretization of incompressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We construct the block preconditioner with a least squares commutator (BFBT) approximation for the inverse of the Schur complement that segregates out the pressure unknowns of the trace system. The remaining velocity, magnetic field, and Lagrange multiplier unknowns form a coupled nodal unknown block for which a system algebraic multigrid (AMG) is used to approximate the inverse. The complexity of the MHD equations together with the algebraic nature of the statically condensed HDG trace system makes the choice of smoother in the system AMG part critical for the convergence and performance of the block preconditioner. Our numerical experiments show GMRES preconditioned by ILU(0) of overlap zero as a smoother inside system AMG performs best in terms of robustness, time per nonlinear iteration and memory requirements. With several transient test cases in 2D and 3D including the island coalescence problem at high Lundquist number we demonstrate the robustness and parallel scalability of the block preconditioner. Additionally for the upper block a preliminary study of an alternate nodal block system solver based on a multilevel approximate nested dissection is presented. On a 2D island coalescence problem the multilevel approximate nested dissection preconditioner shows better scalability with respect to mesh refinement than the system AMG, but is relatively less robust with respect to Lundquist number scaling. In the Appendix B, we rigorously show: (1) the uniqueness of the solution of the nonlinear MHD system for small time, (2) the convergence of the Picard iterations for each backward Euler step, and (3) the convergence of the entire time stepping procedure.},

  abstract     = {Material failure caused by diffusion-induced stress is one of the main obstacles to fulfill the potential of electrodes in lithium-ion batteries. The conventional numerical methods find difficulty in simulating material singularities such as cracks. In contrast, the peridynamic theory is an integral-type nonlocal model that allows fracture to be treated as a natural part of the solution process. Here we have developed a concurrently-coupled and multi-physical model considering lithium-ion diffusion, mechanical deformation, and crack growth based on peridynamics to simulate delayed fracture in electrodes under mechanical and chemical loads. The ability and the advantage of the model are demonstrated in the following simulations: (1) In the process of lithiation, lithium ions tend to accumulate around the crack tip due to the concentration of the stress field. The lithium-ion concentration in turn reduces the tensile stress and the bond stretch. Further, the lithium reaction causes embrittlement of the host materials. (2) The crack propagates in a “wait and go” fashion of delayed fracture in which the steady state of “wait” experiences the transport and supply of lithium ions at the crack tip and the rapid crack propagation of “go” depends on the lithium embrittlement of the host materials. (3) The model with double-sided pre-crack reveals that the cracks can deflect or even intersect due to the interference of the stress fields around the crack tips in the intermittent cracking process. The work lays a foundation for corrosive fracture and provides a useful tool for the future design of lithium-ion batteries.},

These techniques have been used to extract the characteristic spatial modes of the system and select a set of points (or functionals) corresponding to the optimal locations for the sensors. Collecting experimental measurements in the available points allows the construction of an empirical interpolation of the fields employed to estimate the variable of interest. However, when these data are affected by noise, the (G)EIM loses its good convergence properties. In this context, stabilization techniques allow good field reconstruction even with noisy data. This work provides an alternative and effective solution to the problem of reconstructing the system state in the presence of experimental data affected by random noise by using the Tikhonov regularization technique.

The implicit problem for obtaining the displacement at each time step is solved by transforming the equilibrium equations into Fourier space and solving the corresponding linear system with a preconditioned Krylov solver. The resulting method is validated against analytical solutions and compared with implicit and explicit finite element simulations and with an explicit FFT approach. The accuracy of the method is similar to or better than that of finite elements , and the numerical performance is clearly superior, allowing the use of much larger models.

  abstract     = {Repeatedly solving nonlinear partial differential equations with varying parameters is often an essential requirement to characterise the parametric dependences of dynamical systems. Reduced-order modelling (ROM) provides an economical way to construct low-dimensional parametric surrogates for rapid predictions of high-dimensional physical fields. This paper presents a physics-data combined machine learning (PDCML) method for non-intrusive parametric ROM in small-data regimes. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is adopted for dimension reduction by deriving basis functions from a limited number of high-fidelity snapshots, and parametric ROM is thus transformed into establishing reliable mappings between the system parameters and the POD coefficients. To overcome labelled data scarcity, a physics-data combined ROM framework is developed to jointly integrate the physical principle and the small labelled data into feedforward neural networks (FNN) via a step-by-step training scheme. Specifically, a preliminary FNN model is firstly fitted via data-driven training, and then the governing physical rules are embedded into the loss function to improve the model interpolation and extrapolation performances through physics-guided training constrained by the labelled data. During the constrained optimisation procedure, dynamic weighting factors are used to adjust the physics-data proportion of the loss functions, aiming at continuously highlighting the physics loss as the primary optimisation objective and keeping the data loss as the constraint. This new PDCML method is tested on a series of nonlinear problems with different numbers of physical variables, and it is also compared with the data-driven ROM, the physics-guided ROM and the traditional projection-based ROM methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a cost-effective way for non-intrusive parametric ROM via machine learning, and it possesses good characteristics of high prediction accuracy, strong generalisation capability and small data requirement.},

Hence, in each time step, s s merely linear systems have to be solved, where s s is the number of stages of these methods. While in ROW methods the system matrix is different in each time step, W-methods grant the possibility of keeping the system matrix fixed for some or even all time steps. In this paper, we conduct numerical studies in which we examine four different Rosenbrock-type methods in their ROW method variants and several different W-method variants.

  abstract     = {The history-dependent behaviors of classical plasticity models are often driven by internal variables evolved according to phenomenological laws. The difficulty to interpret how these internal variables represent a history of deformation, the lack of direct measurement of these internal variables for calibration and validation, and the weak physical underpinning of those phenomenological laws have long been criticized as barriers to creating realistic models. In this work, geometric machine learning on graph data (e.g. finite element solutions) is used as a means to establish a connection between nonlinear dimensional reduction techniques and plasticity models. Geometric learning-based encoding on graphs allows the embedding of rich time-history data onto a low-dimensional Euclidean space such that the evolution of plastic deformation can be predicted in the embedded feature space. A corresponding decoder can then convert these low-dimensional internal variables back into a weighted graph such that the dominating topological features of plastic deformation can be observed and analyzed.},

  abstract     = {We present a new Integrated Finite Element Neural Network framework (I-FENN), with the objective to accelerate the numerical solution of nonlinear computational mechanics problems. We leverage the swift predictive capability of neural networks (NNs) and we embed them inside the finite element stiffness function, to compute element-level state variables and their derivatives within a nonlinear, iterative numerical solution. This process is conducted jointly with conventional finite element methods that involve shape functions: the NN receives input data that resembles the material point deformation and its output is used to construct element-level field variables such as the element Jacobian matrix and residual vector. Here we introduce I-FENN to the continuum damage analysis of quasi-brittle materials, and we establish a new non-local gradient-based damage framework which operates at the cost of a local damage approach. First, we develop a physics informed neural network (PINN) to resemble the non-local gradient model and then we train the neural network offline. The network learns to predict the non-local equivalent strain at each material point, as well as its derivative with respect to the local strain. Then, the PINN is integrated in the element stiffness definition and conducts the local to non-local strain transformation, whereas the two PINN outputs are used to construct the element Jacobian matrix and residual vector. This process is carried out within the nonlinear solver, until numerical convergence is achieved. The resulting method bears the computational cost of the conventional local damage approach, but ensures mesh-independent results and a diffused non-local strain and damage profile. As a result, the proposed method tackles the vital drawbacks of both the local and non-local gradient method, respectively being the mesh-dependence and additional computational cost. We showcase through a series of numerical examples the computational efficiency and generalization capability of I-FENN in the context of non-local continuum damage, and we discuss the future outlook. The PINN training code and associated training data files have been made publicly available online, to enable reproducibility of our results.},

Therefore, in this study, to balance the exploitative and explorative features of conventional MAs, a multi-strategy improved slime mould algorithm called MSMA is introduced. In MSMA, a new search equation is developed to achieve a tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. Then the dynamic random search technique is utilized as a local search engine to enhance the search efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, the adaptive mutation probability is designed to avoid premature convergence. MSMA is evaluated using 28 benchmark functions and several practical engineering issues such as welded beam design, pressure vessel design, tension/compression spring design, and UAV path planning. The simulation results based on 30 independent runs demonstrate that it is more efficient and robust than other state-of-the-art techniques from the literature according to the selected performance metrics such as mean values and standard deviations.

  abstract     = {The topology design under uncertainties is an acceptable framework for providing a safe design and optimum configuration of structures. In this regard, the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the analytical topology optimization coupled with reliability analysis are the main efforts for reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) of continuous structures. In the present investigation, a hybrid RBTO approach is developed for robust iterative formulation of reliability loop and an effective and simple optimization approach for topology loop. A multi-level set analytical framework is proposed based on the performance measure approach to seek the optimum results under multi uncertainties in size, mechanical properties, and loads of structures. The considered topology optimization procedure to derive the optimal layout of the structure which is called moving iso-surface threshold (MIST) is a powerful and enhanced topology optimization method in which, unlike other optimization methods, it has the capability of having no direct sensitivity analysis making it easier and simple. The accelerated first-order reliability method is introduced for searching the most probability points in the reliability loop of the RBTO model. The proposed reliability method is developed based on a stable iterative formulation. For reducing the computational burden of the topology optimization loop, the machine learning approach given from the support vector regression (SVR) is applied for estimating the probabilistic constraints in the RBTO model. Four examples of 2D, and 3D compliance, 2D complaint mechanism problem, and frequency maximization are presented for validation and highlighting the abilities in having the most accuracy and safety levels of the proposed hybrid framework named SVR-TO-APMA. The results indicate that the hyperparameters of SVR are directly affected by the accuracy of RBTO results. The stability of the RBTO model is shown by the accelerated PMA and the optimum layout is different from topology optimization in comparison with the RBTO results for 3D compliance and frequency maximization problems. The optimum design with uncertainties is increased by about 40%–90% with a reliability index of 3 compared to TO results for the studied example.},

In this work, an explicit and general mathematical formulation of the minimum length scale constraint in the density-based topology optimization framework is proposed. Compared to the existing implicit method, such as robust formulation, the proposed method can give accurate length-scale control for arbitrary problems. In addition, the proposed formulation has remarkable advantages in terms of implementation simplicity and parameter insensitivity. Only computing the average density of elements in a small circular region is needed, similar to the typical filtering technique. Aggregation functions are used to gather all the local constraints into a single constraint, and the sensitivity analysis of the constraint function is derived.

  abstract     = {Immersogeometric analysis (IMGA) is a geometrically flexible method that enables one to perform multiphysics analysis directly using complex computer-aided design (CAD) models. While the IMGA approach is well-studied and has a remarkable advantage over traditional CFD, IMGA still requires a well-defined B-rep model to represent the geometry. Obtaining such a model can sometimes be equally as challenging as creating a body-fitted mesh. To address this issue, we develop a novel IMGA approach for the simulation of incompressible and compressible flows around complex geometries represented by point clouds in this work. The point cloud representation of geometries is a direct method for digitally acquiring geometric information using LiDAR scanners, optical scanners, or other passive methods such as multi-view stereo images. The point cloud object’s geometry is represented using a set of unstructured points in the Euclidean space with (possible) orientation information in the form of surface normals. Due to the absence of topological information in the point cloud model, there are no guarantees for the geometric representation to be watertight or 2-manifold or to have consistent normals. To perform IMGA directly using point cloud geometries, we first develop a method for estimating the inside–outside information and the surface normals directly from the point cloud. We also propose a method to compute the Jacobian determinant for the surface integration (over the point cloud) necessary for the weak enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions. We validate these geometric estimation methods by comparing the geometric quantities computed from the point cloud with those obtained from analytical geometry and tessellated CAD models. In this work, we also develop thermal IMGA to simulate heat transfer in the presence of flow over complex geometries.

  abstract     = {The metriplectic formalism is useful for describing complete dynamical systems which conserve energy and produce entropy. This creates challenges for model reduction, as the elimination of high-frequency information will generally not preserve the metriplectic structure which governs long-term stability of the system. Based on proper orthogonal decomposition, a provably convergent metriplectic reduced-order model is formulated which is guaranteed to maintain the algebraic structure necessary for energy conservation and entropy formation. Numerical results on benchmark problems show that the proposed method is remarkably stable, leading to improved accuracy over long time scales at a moderate increase in cost over naive methods.},

  abstract     = {Krylov subspace recycling has been extensively used to facilitate the solution of sequences of linear systems by constructing a deflation subspace and accelerating the convergence of a corresponding iterative solver. However, most existing techniques update the recycled subspace sequentially for each system, thus inducing a potentially high computational cost. In that context, this work proposes a method to accelerate the above procedure for the case of multiresolution analyses of affine parametric systems, by decoupling the solution of the system from the construction of the recycled subspace. The proposed method follows the projection based Model Order Reduction (MOR) logic that splits operations into an offline and an online phase and therefore proves particularly beneficial in case of affine parametrizations that involve multiple affine coefficients. In the offline phase of the method an especially tailored version of the Automatic Krylov subspaces Recycling (AKR) algorithm (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2021), proposed within this work and denoted as AKR-D, is employed. In brief, AKR-D constructs a high quality recycling basis W W for a predefined parameter interval Ψ Ψ by targeting a desirable convergence rate at an automatically generated set of parameter values Ω ⊂ Ψ Ω⊂Ψ . The upfront construction of W W enables an a-priori Galerkin projection of the affinely described full parametric system to yield a reduced order model (ROM). This ROM can be leveraged in the online phase of the proposed recycling method to accelerate the construction of the corresponding projector P P onto W = span { W } W=span{W} , whose implicit assembly is required in most recycling based deflation schemes. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is investigated in terms of algorithmic complexity and is demonstrated on a densely parametrized system arising within the boundary integral solver of the Helmholtz equation and a random sparse parametrization example.},

  abstract     = {The motor-driven intracellular transport plays a crucial role in supporting a neuron cell’s survival and function, with motor proteins and microtubule (MT) structures collaborating to promptly deliver the essential materials to the right location in neuron. The disruption of transport may lead to the onset of various neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is essential to study how neurons regulate the material transport process and have a better understanding of the traffic jam formation. In our earlier work, we developed a PDE-constrained optimization model and an isogeometric analysis (IGA) solver to simulate traffic jams induced by MT reduction and MT swirl. Here, we develop a novel IGA-based physics-informed graph neural network (PGNN) to quickly predict normal and abnormal transport phenomena such as traffic jam in different neuron geometries. In particular, the proposed method learns from the IGA simulation of the intracellular transport process and provides accurate material concentration prediction of normal transport and MT-induced traffic jam. The IGA-based PGNN model contains simulators to handle local prediction of both normal and two MT-induced traffic jams in pipes, as well as another simulator to predict normal transport in bifurcations. Bézier extraction is adopted to incorporate the geometry information into the simulators to accurately compute the physics informed loss function with PDE residuals. Moreover, a GNN assembly model is adopted to tackle different neuron morphologies by assembling local prediction into the entire geometry. In summary, the well-trained model effectively predicts the distribution of transport velocity and material concentration during traffic jam and normal transport with an average error less than 10% compared to IGA simulations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated within several complex neuron geometries.},

In particular, the collective behavior of dislocation dynamics at the mesoscale leads to avalanche, strain bursts, intermittent energy spikes, and nonlocal interactions producing anomalous features across different time- and length-scales, directly affecting plasticity, void and crack nucleation. Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) simulations are often used at the meso-level, but the cost and complexity increase dramatically with simulation time. To further understand how the anomalous features propagate to the continuum, we develop a probabilistic model for dislocation motion constructed from the position statistics obtained from DDD simulations. We obtain the continuous limit of discrete dislocation dynamics through a Probability Density Function for the dislocation motion, and propose a nonlocal transport model for the PDF. We develop a machine-learning framework to learn the parameters of the nonlocal operator with a power-law kernel, connecting the anomalous nature of DDD to the origin of its corresponding nonlocal operator at the continuum, facilitating the integration of dislocation dynamics into multi-scale, long-time material failure simulations.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to link random heterogeneous, multiphase materials to their elastic macroscale stiffness thus replacing explicit homogenization simulations. The proposed CNN model is universal in that it accounts for various types of microstructures, for arbitrary phase fractions, non-constant and thereby very large ranges of Young’s moduli of the constituent phases (from 1 to 1000 GPa) and of their Poisson’s ratios (from 0 to 0.4). Moreover, the CNN predicts the stiffness for periodic boundary conditions (BCs) along with its upper bound through kinematically uniform BCs and its lower bound through stress uniform BCs. The triple of BCs reduces the stiffness uncertainty due to the embedding of the material volume into arbitrary adjacent host materials. Beyond, the stiffness bounds provide an indicator for the proper size of a representative volume element. The proposed universal CNN model achieves high accuracy in its predictions. The reasons for the rare outliers with larger errors are rigorously analyzed. For a real, two-phase diamond–SiC coating material the universal CNN is almost as accurate as a CNN exclusively trained for fixed elastic phase properties of that material. The speedup compared to finite element computations for homogenization is above factor 20 500. The proposed CNN model hence enables fast and accurate stiffness predictions in universal analyses of heterogeneous materials in their linear elastic regime.},

The constitutive parameters are typically established by fitting of mechanical data, while microstructural data is used for verification. This paper develops a Pareto-based multi-objective machine learning methodology for efficient identification of crystal plasticity constitutive parameters. Specifically, the methodology relays on a Gaussian processes-based surrogate model to limit the number of calls to a given crystal plasticity model , and, consequently, to increase the computational efficiency. The constitutive parameters pertaining to an Elasto-Plastic Self-Consistent (EPSC) crystal plasticity model including a dislocation density-based hardening law, a backstress law, and a phase transformations law are identified for two materials, a dual phase (DP) steel, DP780, subjected to load reversals and a stainless steel (SS), 316L, subjected to strain rate and temperature sensitive deformation. The latter material undergoes plasticity-induced martensitic phase transformations. The optimization objectives were the quasi static flow stress data for the DP steel case study , while a set of strain-rate and temperature sensitive flow stress and phase volume fraction data for the SS case study. The procedure and results for the two case studies are presented and discussed illustrating advantages and versatility of the developed methodology. In particular, the efficiency of the developed methodology over an existing genetic algorithm methodology is discussed. Additionally, the parameters identified for the SS case study were utilized to simulate three biaxial tensile loading paths using a finite element implementation of EPSC for further verification.},

  abstract     = {Hyperelastic materials are frequently observed in the natural world and engineering applications such as rubbers and animal soft tissues. Modeling large deformation and progressive fracture of these materials is challenging for grid-based methods due to the severe mesh distortions at crack tips. To address this problem, we proposed a novel meshfree framework using bond-based peridynamics (PD) based on finite deformation theory . The proposed modeling framework has the following novelties: (1) An original bond strain, derived from the spectrum representation of hyperelastic models is used to describe the nonlinear bond force-stretch relationship, which gives more concise and robust solutions to large deformation problems; (2) A numerical damping parameter inspired by the mass–dashpot–spring system is developed to endow the proposed framework with numerical advantages in terms of enhancing the stability of explicit time integration in modeling quasi-static problems; (3) It outperforms grid-based methods in capturing notable features like non-smooth crack surfaces, secondary damages, and materials fragmentations. The capability of our framework was successfully validated via several examples, including large deformation, crack initiation and propagation tests of specimens with various notches and eccentric holes. Besides, the numerical performance of our model to capture the crack deflection in laminate rubber specimens was also tested, with results showing good consistency with experimental observations. This framework is compatible with diverse hyperelastic models and sheds new light on modeling of elastomer-hydrogel composites and soft tissues.},

  abstract     = {Artificial boundary method is widely used in the numerical modeling of unbounded wave problem. However, the accurate modeling of truncated infinite domain with general geometry and heterogeneous materials is still a challenging task, especially for direct time-domain analysis in three dimensions (3D). In this paper, a novel 3D time-domain artificial boundary method, called Scaled Boundary Perfectly Matched Layer (SBPML), is proposed. This method is a generalization of the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) based on a scaled boundary coordinates transformation inspired by the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM), which is capable of using artificial boundary of general geometry (not necessarily convex) and considering plane physical surfaces and interfaces extending to infinity in the truncated infinite domain. Local scaled boundary coordinates are firstly introduced on the element-level into the truncated infinite domain to describe general geometry properties of the infinite domain. Then, a complex stretching function from PML is applied to radial direction of the local scaled boundary coordinates to map the physical space onto the complex space, resulting in a SBPML domain. The spatial discretization of the SBPML domain produces semi-discrete mixed displacement–stress​ unsplit-field formulations of third orders in time. The order of the obtained formulation can be reduced by one, enabling a seamless coupling with the standard displacement-based finite element formulation of the interior domain. The coupled system can be solved by an explicit time integration algorithm efficiently. The validation of the SBPML is demonstrated through several benchmark tests, including wave problems in unbounded domains with general geometries and heterogeneous material properties. Furthermore, the application of the SBPML in dynamic soil–structure interaction (SSI) is demonstrated using two engineering problems, including an impact analysis of soft rock-nuclear island system and a vibration analysis of soil-lined tunnel system.},

  abstract     = {Fiber metal laminates (FML) are composite structures consisting of metals and fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) which have experienced an increasing interest as the choice of materials in aerospace and automobile industries. Due to a sophisticated built up of the material, not only the design and production of such structures is challenging but also its damage detection. This research work focuses on damage identification in FML with guided ultrasonic waves (GUW) through an inverse approach based on the Bayesian paradigm. As the Bayesian inference approach involves multiple queries of the underlying system, a parameterized reduced-order model (ROM) is used to closely approximate the solution with considerably less computational cost. The signals measured by the embedded sensors and the ROM forecasts are employed for the localization and characterization of damage in FML. In this paper, a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) based Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm and an Ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF) technique are deployed to identify the damage. Numerical tests illustrate the approaches and the results are compared in regard to accuracy and efficiency. It is found that both methods are successful in multivariate characterization of the damage with a high accuracy and were also able to quantify their associated uncertainties. The EnKF distinguishes itself with the MCMC-MH algorithm in the matter of computational efficiency. In this application of identifying the damage, the EnKF is approximately thrice faster than the MCMC-MH.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a Bayesian updating approach, called parallel Bayesian optimization and quadrature (PBOQ). It is rooted in Bayesian updating with structural reliability methods (BUS) and offers a coherent Bayesian approach for the BUS analysis by assuming Gaussian process priors. The first step of the method, i.e., parallel Bayesian optimization , effectively explores a constant c c in BUS by a novel parallel infill sampling strategy. The second step (parallel Bayesian quadrature) then infers the posterior distribution by another parallel infill sampling strategy using subset simulation . The proposed approach enables to make the fullest use of prior knowledge and parallel computing , resulting in a substantial reduction of the computational burden of model updating. Four numerical examples with varying complexity are investigated for demonstrating the proposed method against several existing methods. The results show the potential benefits by advocating a coherent Bayesian fashion to the BUS analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, Special Relativity Search (SRS) is developed for solving engineering problems. The interaction of particles in a magnetic field is considered as an optimizer model of the SRS in which the magnetic field is the feasible search space and the particles in this field are the possible design vectors. Particles interaction is investigated using the Lorentz force, velocity and distance between particles. Charged particles that move in opposite directions produce an inverse force and repel each other while charged particles that move in the same direction attract each other. The special relativity theory is implemented in an applicable way to develop SRS. In SRS, using the angular frequency, centripetal force, and inverse Lorentz transformations, main equations of the algorithm are developed. The design variables are randomly selected as a candidate for optimal answers from the initial population and updated their position in each iteration. This process continues until the global optimum is obtained. In this paper, to validate the SRS performance in solving engineering problems, total twenty-nine CEC-2017 Boundary Constraint (BC) problems and 12 engineering problems are optimized. To evaluate the superiority of the SRS algorithm, the results are compared with other well-known metaheuristic methods. Friedman’s test is also used to rank the best algorithm. The results show a good performance of the SRS in most problems with the lowest computational cost.},

  abstract     = {One of the state-of-the-art strategies for predicting crack propagation, nucleation, and interaction is the phase-field approach. Despite its reliability and robustness, the phase-field approach suffers from burdensome computational cost, caused by the non-convexity of the underlying energy functional and a large number of unknowns required to resolve the damage gradients. In this work, we propose to solve such nonlinear systems in a monolithic manner using the Schwarz preconditioned inexact Newton (SPIN) method. The proposed SPIN method leverages the field split approach and minimizes the energy functional separately with respect to displacement and the phase-field, in an additive and multiplicative manner. In contrast to the standard alternate minimization, the result of this decoupled minimization process is used to construct a preconditioner for a coupled linear system, arising at each Newton’s iteration. The overall performance and the convergence properties of the proposed additive and multiplicative SPIN methods are investigated by means of several numerical examples. A comparison with widely-used alternate minimization is also performed showing a significant reduction in terms of execution time. Moreover, we also demonstrate that this reduction grows even further with increasing problem size.},

Symbolic regression provides inherently interpretable machine learning, but relatively little work has focused on the use of symbolic regression on noisy data and the accompanying necessity to quantify uncertainty. A new Bayesian framework for genetic-programming-based symbolic regression (GPSR) is introduced that uses model evidence (i.e., marginal likelihood) to formulate replacement probability during the selection phase of evolution. Model parameter uncertainty is automatically quantified, enabling probabilistic predictions with each equation produced by the GPSR algorithm. Model evidence is also quantified in this process, and its use is shown to increase interpretability, improve robustness to noise, and reduce overfitting when compared to a conventional GPSR implementation on both numerical and physical experiments.},

  abstract     = {For more than 100 years, chemical, physical, and material scientists have proposed competing constitutive models to best characterize the behavior of natural and man-made materials in response to mechanical loading. Now, computer science offers a universal solution: Neural Networks . Neural Networks are powerful function approximators that can learn constitutive relations from large data without any knowledge of the underlying physics. However, classical Neural Networks entirely ignore a century of research in constitutive modeling, violate thermodynamic considerations, and fail to predict the behavior outside the training regime. Here we design a new family of Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks that inherently satisfy common kinematical, thermodynamical, and physical constraints and, at the same time, constrain the design space of admissible functions to create robust approximators, even in the presence of sparse data. Towards this goal we revisit the non-linear field theories of mechanics and reverse-engineer the network input to account for material objectivity, material symmetry and incompressibility ; the network output to enforce thermodynamic consistency; the activation functions to implement physically reasonable restrictions; and the network architecture to ensure polyconvexity. We demonstrate that this new class of models is a generalization of the classical neo Hooke, Blatz Ko, Mooney Rivlin, Yeoh, and Demiray models and that the network weights have a clear physical interpretation in the form of shear moduli , stiffness-like parameters, and exponential coefficients. When trained with classical benchmark data for rubber under uniaxial tension, biaxial extension, and pure shear, our network autonomously selects the best constitutive model and learns its set of parameters. Our findings suggest that Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks have the potential to induce a paradigm shift in constitutive modeling, from user-defined model selection to automated model discovery.

This new approach allows for the possibility of considering the effect of transient FSI on topologically optimized layouts. Throughout this work, the analysis domain for the fluid and structure is modeled using the unified monolithic approach, in which the structure equation and the Navier–Stokes equation are coupled. With a fixed mesh and design variables assigned to each finite element, the governing equations as well as the involved material properties are interpolated. This modeling and analysis approach provides accurate solutions to the strongly coupled FSI system. An adjoint approach for calculating the transient sensitivity information and a gradient-based optimizer are used. Several numerical examples are solved to reveal the importance of considering the transient FSI. In addition, these examples demonstrate that the present approach can control transient FSI phenomena.},

We formulated multiscale topology optimization problems where objective functions are defined by the macroscopic wave propagation behavior, and microstructures forming a metamaterial are set as design variables. Sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the concepts of shape and topological derivatives. As numerical examples , we offer optimized designs of metamaterials composed of multiple unit cell structures working as a demultiplexer based on negative permeability.

  abstract     = {In this work, we develop a pseudoinverse-based static finite-element solver to model the elastic deformation and non-local brittle fracture of solids. The pseudoinverse of the finite-element stiffness matrix is calculated using a QR decomposition-based method which is faster than using the traditional approach based on the singular value decomposition method. This new finite-element framework has two advantages: (1) the finite-element equations can still be solved even when the finite-element stiffness matrix is singular, and (2) there is no need for introducing an artificial elastic rest energy or viscous regularization for the sole purpose of keeping the finite-element stiffness matrix non-singular in order to solve the finite-element equations. We also show that the proposed method is robust in solving chosen boundary value problems involving the elastic deformation and abrupt non-local mode I and mixed-mode brittle fracture of solids when compared to the traditional element kill method where a small but finite residual stiffness is maintained at a material in order to prevent the finite-element stiffness matrix from being singular. Hence, this proposed method allows the modeling of separation/fragmentation of solids when fracture occurs. Finally, we use the new computational framework to model the fracture of PMMA beam samples at room temperature. By calibrating the material parameters in the constitutive theory using analytical methods and fitting to a Mode I fracture experiment force–displacement response, we show that our newly-proposed computational method is able to predict the experimental fracture loci and crack propagation characteristics in PMMA beam samples undergoing mixed-mode fracture conditions to good accord.},

  abstract     = {A new quadrature rule for 2D/3D domains is proposed. We first embed the domain in a circumscribing square/cube and then distribute a set of Gauss points in the square/cube. A generic function is approximated through a set of Legendre polynomials whose coefficients are determined by numerical integration. The information needed for the points falling outside the physical domain is re-generated through the polynomials and the unknown coefficients . The reproducibility of the polynomials and the sufficiency of the number of Gauss points may be analyzed through a simple factorization process during the solution of the resulting system of equations. Two simple adaptive algorithms are proposed for when the integration points are to be increased so that the targeted polynomials are fully reproduced. The adaptive processes are designed so that the coefficient matrix , which always is a square matrix , becomes regular. This contributes to the robustness of the whole procedure and also allows the use of conventional inverse processes The integration of the generic function is then summarized into a set of integrals (of the Legendre polynomials) multiplied by the function’s discrete values. The Legendre polynomials are integrated through the divergence theorem (or Stokes theorem). Although the formulation is suitable for arbitrary domains, the focus of this paper is on polytopes since the divergence theorem can easily be applied. To demonstrate the performance of the method, several 2D/3D integral problems are solved and discussed.},

Firstly, the displacement and regularized strain boundary integral equations for the thermoviscoelastic problems are derived. Secondly, the time-dependent shear modulus is expressed in the form of Prony series, and the memory stress is calculated by using the genetic integral, which reduces computing costs. In addition, the radial integration method (RIM) is applied to transform the domain integrals related to body force , temperature and memory stress into equivalent boundary integrals through applied points, which not only allows IGABEM to retain the advantage of discretization only on the boundary, but also reduces the singularity of the integral. Moreover, the adaptive integral method based on hierarchical quadtree decomposition algorithm is proposed to deal with the nearly singular integrals more flexible and efficient at optimal computational cost. The modified surface traction recovery method (TRM) of the thermoviscoelastic mechanics is proposed to solve the strains of the boundary points, which allows us to avoid solving hypersingular integrals. Furthermore, we construct the displacement (or tractions) coupling constraints among the non-conforming interface meshes by a virtual knot insertion technique. The main advantages of this method are simplicity and robustness, as it is problem-independent and only depends on the NURBS meshes on both sides of the interface. Some 2D and 3D examples are applied to prove the accuracy and efficiency of the present method for the multiscale thermoelastic–viscoelastic problems.},

Firstly, we derive a fourth-order compact finite difference scheme to discretize the 3D anisotropic convection–diffusion equation on a rectilinear grid. Then, the resulting large-scale asymmetric linear system of equations is solved by a generalized extrapolation cascadic multigrid (gEXCMG) method based on two novel multigrid (MG) prolongation operators. The highlight of this paper is the application of the quintic Lagrange interpolation and the completed Richardson extrapolation in the design of the new MG prolongation operator on nonuniform rectilinear grids, which can produce a good initial guess (sixth-order approximation to the finite difference solution) for the SSOR-preconditioned biconjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGStab) smoother. In the end, numerical experiments show that the gEXCMG method combined with the HOC scheme can achieve fourth-order accuracy for 3D anisotropic convection–diffusion problems with few smoothing steps on the finest grid. Moreover, the proposed gEXCMG method can offer substantially better efficiency than the state-of-the-art algebraic MG solver, namely, aggregation-based algebraic multigrid (AGMG) method, for large linear systems arising from the discretization of second order elliptic PDEs.},

This choice permits bypassing known issues related to the Serret–Frenet (SF) frame (in cases where the local beam curvature vanishes) and does not require the Darboux vector and its derivative, which are both affected by limitations of the SF frame. Moreover, in contrast to existing formulations mostly derived in the local SF frame, here the formulation is consistently derived by linearizing the governing equations in the material setting, where the multi-patch coupling can be enforced in a straightforward way.

  abstract     = {When submerged under a liquid, the microstructure of a SuperHydrophobic Surface (SHS) traps a lubricating layer of gas pockets, which has been seen to reduce the skin friction of the overlying liquid flow in both laminar and turbulent regimes. More recently, spatially homogeneous SHS have also been shown to delay laminar–turbulent transition in channel flows , where transition is triggered by modal mechanisms. In this study, we investigate, by means of topology optimization , whether a spatially inhomogeneous SHS can be designed to further delay transition in channel flows. Unsteady direct numerical simulations are conducted using the spectral element method in a 3D periodic wall-bounded channel. The effect of the SHS is modelled using a partial slip length on the walls, forming a 2D periodic optimization domain. Following a density-based approach, the optimization procedure uses the adjoint-variable method to compute gradients and a checkpointing strategy to reduce storage requirements. This methodology is adapted to optimizing over an ensemble of initial perturbations. This study presents the first application of topology optimization to laminar–turbulent transition. We show that this method can design surfaces that delay transition significantly compared to a homogeneous counterpart, by inhibiting the growth of secondary instability modes. By optimizing over an ensemble of streamwise phase-shifted perturbations, designs have been found with comparable mean transition time and lower variance.},

  abstract     = {The material point method (MPM) has been extensively used to solve problems involving large displacements and deformations. The standard MPM formulation, which adopts fluid-implicit-particle (FLIP) transfer, is less dissipative but also less stable than particle-in-cell (PIC) transfer. The affine PIC (APIC) transfer introduces the affine velocity and was developed to realize stable simulations while overcoming dissipations of the angular momentum in PIC. This paper presents Taylor-PIC (TPIC) transfer, which is a type of APIC transfer that combines the affine velocity based on the first-order Taylor series approximation and PIC transfer. TPIC is simple (only the particle velocity gradient is required) and inherits the key advantages of the original APIC, such as less dissipation and stability. Although TPIC does not conserve angular momentum , in contrast to APIC, the velocity gradient is preserved in the transfer between particles and the grid. This velocity gradient contains the angular information in its skew-symmetric component, which allows TPIC to adequately describe angular motion , similar to APIC. Furthermore, the MPM can cause stress oscillations near boundaries when boundary conditions are explicitly imposed, e.g., when the boundary grid velocity (or momentum) is set to zero. When affine-type transfers are used, this instability is exacerbated, and simulations can easily fail. Therefore, we propose a kernel correction method based on the weighted least squares for particles near boundaries. The proposed TPIC transfer and kernel correction are validated through five types of simulations, each using a different material—linear elastic, von Mises, Newtonian fluid , and Drucker–Prager. In the simulations, incorrect results due to stress oscillations are observed even for small deformations . Applying the corrected kernels successfully removes these spurious oscillations, and the results are consistent with the analytical solutions. Moreover, the numerical results confirm the accuracy and robustness of the proposed TPIC transfer.},

  abstract     = {Deep operator networks (DeepONets) are powerful and flexible architectures that are attracting attention in multiple fields due to their utility for fast and accurate emulation of complex dynamics. As their remarkable generalization capabilities are primarily enabled by their projection-based attribute, in this paper, we investigate connections with low-rank techniques derived from the singular value decomposition (SVD). We demonstrate that some of the concepts behind proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-neural networks can improve DeepONet’s design and training phases. These ideas lead us to a methodology extension that we name SVD-DeepONet. Moreover, through multiple SVD analyses of scenario- and time-aggregated snapshots matrices, we find that DeepONet inherits from its projection-based attribute strong inefficiencies in representing dynamics characterized by symmetries. Inspired by the work on shifted-POD, we develop flexDeepONet, an architecture enhancement that relies on a pre-transformation network for generating a moving reference frame and isolating the rigid components of the dynamics. In this way, the physics can be represented on a latent space free from rotations, translations, and stretches, and an accurate projection can be performed to a low-dimensional basis. In addition to improving DeepONet’s flexibility and interpretability, the proposed perspectives increase its generalization capabilities and computational efficiencies. For instance, we show flexDeepONet can accurately surrogate the dynamics of 19 thermodynamic variables in a combustion chemistry application by relying on 95% fewer trainable parameters than that of the ‘vanilla’ architecture. As stressed in the paper, we argue that DeepONet and SVD-based methods can reciprocally benefit from each other. In particular, the flexibility of the former in leveraging multiple data sources and multifidelity knowledge in the form of both unstructured data and physics-informed constraints has the potential to greatly extend the applicability of methodologies such as POD and principal component analysis (PCA).},

The key ingredient of the approach is a polynomial mapping between high-dimensional states and a low-dimensional embedding. This mapping consists of two parts: a representation in a linear subspace (computed in this work using the proper orthogonal decomposition) and a quadratic component. The approach can be viewed as a form of data-driven closure modeling, since the quadratic component introduces directions into the approximation that lie in the orthogonal complement of the linear subspace , but without introducing any additional degrees of freedom to the low-dimensional representation. Combining the quadratic manifold approximation with the operator inference method for projection-based model reduction leads to a scalable non-intrusive approach for learning reduced-order models of dynamical systems . Applying the new approach to transport-dominated systems of partial differential equations illustrates the gains in efficiency that can be achieved over approximation in a linear subspace.},

If not possible, we investigate if it is possible to determine it pressure robustly , i.e. pollution free from the pressure reaction. For convex domains there is but one variational boundary value problem among the investigated that allows the independent determination. It is the one with essential no-penetration conditions combined with homogeneous tangential traction conditions. Further, for the investigated cases, the weakly divergence-free displacement can be computed pressure robustly provided the total body force is decomposed into its direct sum of divergence- and rotation-free components using the Helmholtz decomposition . The elasticity problem is solved using these components as separate right-hand sides. The total solution is obtained using the superposition principle . We employ a ( u , p ) (u,p) higher-order finite element formulation with discontinuous pressure elements. It is inf–sup stable for polynomial degree p ≥ 2 p≥2 but not pressure robust by itself. We propose a three step procedure to solve the elasticity problem which includes by the Helmholtz decomposition of the total body force. The extra cost for the three-step procedure is essentially the cost for the Helmholtz decomposition of the assembled total body force, and the small cost of solving the elasticity problem with one extra right-hand side. The results are corroborated by theoretical derivations as well as numerical results.},

  abstract     = {Crack nucleation is crucial in many industrial applications. The phase field method for fracture transforms the crack nucleation problem into a minimization problem of the sum of the elastic potential energy and the crack surface energy. Due to the polyconvexity of the formulation, starting from a crackless solid, a standard Newton iteration may lead to a solution with no crack, even though a cracked solution has a lower total energy. As such, the critical load for cracking is highly overestimated. Here, we propose an algorithm termed “parallel universe” algorithm to capture the global minimum. This algorithm has two key ingredients: (a) a necessary condition for cracking solely based on the current crackless solution, and (b) beginning from when this condition is met, Newton iteration with two initial guesses, a crackles one and a cracked one, will both be performed and the converged candidate solution with lower energy is accepted as the solution at that load step. Once the cracked candidate solution is accepted, the crackless one is discarded, i.e., only one universe is retained. This cracked initial guess is obtained only once for all load steps by solving a series of similar minimization problems with a progressively reduced critical crack energy release rate. Numerical examples with isotropic and anisotropic critical crack energy release rates indicate that the proposed algorithm is more reliable (as there is no need to retrace) and more efficient than the standard Newton iteration and a well-known backtracking algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We extend the softFEM idea to isogeometric analysis (IGA) to reduce the stiffness (consequently, the condition numbers) of the IGA discretized problem. We refer to the resulting approximation technique as softIGA. We obtain the resulting discretization by first removing the IGA spectral outliers to reduce the system’s stiffness. We then add high-order derivative-jump penalization terms (with negative penalty parameters) to the standard IGA bilinear forms . The penalty parameter seeks to minimize spectral/dispersion errors while maintaining the coercivity of the bilinear form. We establish dispersion errors for both outlier-free IGA (OF-IGA) and softIGA elements. We also derive analytical eigenpairs for the resulting matrix eigenvalue problems and show that the stiffness and condition numbers of the IGA systems significantly improve (reduce). We prove a superconvergent result of order h 2 p + 2 h2p+2 for eigenvalues where h h characterizes the mesh size and p p specifies the order of the B-spline basis functions. To illustrate the main idea and derive the analytical results, we focus on uniform meshes in 1D and tensor-product meshes in multiple dimensions. For the eigenfunctions , softIGA delivers the same optimal convergence rates as the standard IGA approximation . Various numerical examples demonstrate the advantages of softIGA over IGA.},

  abstract     = {We extend the model-free Data-Driven computing paradigm to solids and structures that are stochastic due to intrinsic randomness in the material behavior. The behavior of such materials is characterized by a likelihood measure instead of a constitutive relation. We specifically assume that the material likelihood measure is known only through an empirical point-data set in material or phase space. The state of the solid or structure is additionally subject to compatibility and equilibrium constraints. The problem is then to infer the likelihood of a given structural outcome of interest. In this work, we present a Data-Driven method of inference that determines likelihoods of outcomes from the empirical material data and that requires no material or prior modeling. In particular, the computation of expectations is reduced to explicit sums over local material data sets and to quadratures over admissible states, i.e., states satisfying compatibility and equilibrium. The complexity of the material data-set sums is linear in the number of data points and in the number of members in the structure. Efficient population annealing procedures and fast search algorithms for accelerating the calculations are presented. The scope, cost and convergence properties of the method are assessed with the aid selected applications and benchmark tests.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical behavior of multibody systems can be modeled with several numerical methods . One can mention the Multibody Dynamics (MBD), the Finite Element Method (FEM), the Discrete Element Method (DEM) among others, which have the common feature of solving for the dynamics of a system of rigid/flexible bodies. In this context, the mechanical contact interaction between bodies has to be considered in the model. First, one needs to adopt a strategy to seek for contact occurrence and, when it is detected, to evaluate and include contributions into the mathematical model . However, handling contacts in such models is not a straightforward task, as they can be numerous (depending on the number of bodies considered in the model) and complex, due to the particularities in the geometric shape that each body presents, influencing in contact detection and in its inclusion, as a contribution into the model. In this work, we propose an integrated framework for handling and managing the automatic contact detection between bodies within a whole complex multibody system. Both rigid and flexible bodies can be considered. Strategies such as MBD, FEM and DEM can be employed together with the proposed strategy. Pointwise contact interactions are modeled based on the geometric description of each body’s boundary, with the aid of the master–master contact formulation. A hierarchy of bounding volumes for the collision detection is employed, ruling the creation of a contact–candidates pairs list, for which the Local Contact Problem (LCP) is solved — as a detailed determination for the contact pointwise location on local surface parameterizations , representing bodies’ boundaries. As the contact interface, we employ a particular hybrid law that can represent a classical linear contact stiffness , Hertzian contact and other possibilities, together with a barrier to avoid penetration between bodies. We show applications of the technique involving general rigid polyhedra in contact with beam finite elements — as a FEM/DEM coupling, such as rolling rigid bodies , as a classical multibody dynamics application. The herein proposed strategy can be incorporated using distinct time-integration solvers, such as it is independent on MBD/FEM/DEM particularities.},

The approach relies on a reduced-order model, the projection basis of which is randomized on a subset of the Stiefel manifold characterized by a set of linear constraints defining, e.g. , Dirichlet boundary conditions in the physical space . We first show that these constraints are, indeed, preserved through Riemannian pushforward and pullback actions to, and from, the tangent space to the manifold at any admissible point. This fundamental property is subsequently exploited to derive a probabilistic model that leverages the multimodel nature of the atomistic setting. The proposed formulation offers several advantages, including a simple and interpretable low-dimensional parameterization, the ability to constraint the Fréchet mean on the manifold, and ease of implementation and propagation. The relevance of the proposed modeling framework is finally demonstrated on various applications including multiscale simulations on graphene-based systems.},

Therefore, to reduce the computational expense, a quadratic-manifold-based energy-conserving sampling and weighting approach was employed to obtain the reduced tensors concerning only a few optimally selected elements.

The main advantage of this combined approach is that the fracture geometry is always represented explicitly, while the propagation remains geometrically flexible. We prove that our model is thermodynamically consistent. In order to solve our model numerically, we propose a mixed-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin scheme with a computational grid fully conforming to the fractures. As the fracture propagates, the diffuse phase-field acts as indicator to identify new fracture facets to be added to the discrete fracture network. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach reproduces classical scenarios for fracturing porous media.},

  abstract     = {Meshfree methods such as reproducing kernel (RK) approximation are suitable for modeling fluid flow problems because of their flexibility in controlling local smoothness and order of basis, as well as straightforward construction of higher-order gradients. However, Eulerian-described partial differential equations often suffer from numerical instability in the solution of Bubnov–Galerkin​ methods because of the non-self-adjoint advection terms . This is true for both mesh-based and meshfree methods. Although stabilized Petrov–Galerkin formulation, such as the variational multiscale method, has addressed this issue, a careless selection of the numerical quadrature can still result in variational inconsistency in the Galerkin weak form, which leads to a suboptimal convergence. Strong advection could also amplify the unstable modes from a reduced quadrature. This study provides a variationally consistent (VC) approach to correct the loss of Galerkin exactness in nodally integrated meshfree modeling for the advection diffusion equation . A gradient stabilization method is proposed to enhance the coercivity of the system. Several numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches in modeling advection dominated problems.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a computational framework for simulating shell structures interacting with fluids using the immersed approach. The approach captures the complex movement and motion of a thin structure represented with shell elements that have a finite thickness. Utilizing the concept of the immersed approach, the fluid domain is described using a fixed set of Eulerian grids and the shell structure uses finite element shell Lagrangian descriptions, thus allowing non-intrusive coupling of independent fluid and shell finite element solvers. Different from the traditional immersed boundary method where the boundary cannot replicate the thickness of the thin boundary or shell structures, our approach projects the shell structure along the directions normal to the shell surface based on a given thickness to create a volumetric structure. Such projection allows robust, accurate and realistic interfacial loading and immersed geometry when interacting with the surrounding fluid . The dynamic solution of the mid-surface obtained from the shell solver is extended and extrapolated into the thickness direction, which is then used to calculate the forces acting on the Eulerian grid nodes to manage the effects of the overlapping solid. The volume representation also helps in calculating consistent nodal forces and moments acting on the shell surface. In particular, the moments yielded across the thickness capture the additional bending that would otherwise be missed for an infinitely thin boundary. Allowing the volumetric representation of the thin shell thickness, deformation modes such as bending and shearing can be more accurately calculated. Intricate transformations between local shell element coordinate and global coordinate were also considered to enable the coupling process. The presented fluid–shell coupling algorithm is carefully verified and validated using three numerical test cases. The accuracy and the robustness of the results also demonstrate the versatility of the developed coupling technique for thin shells and structures with finite thickness.},

  abstract     = {The use of Electro-Active Polymers (EAPs) for the fabrication of evermore sophisticated miniaturised soft robotic actuators has seen an impressive development in recent years. The incorporation of crystallographic anisotropic micro-architectures, within an otherwise nearly uniform isotropic soft polymer matrix, has shown great potential in terms of advanced three-dimensional actuation (i.e. stretching, bending, twisting), especially at large strains, that is, beyond the onset of geometrical pull-in instabilities. From the computational point of view, the design of accurate and robust albeit efficient constitutive models is a very active area of research. This paper introduces a novel polyconvex phenomenological invariant-based transversely isotropic formulation (and relevant computational frameworks) for the simulation of transversely isotropic EAPs at large strains, where the ab initio satisfaction of polyconvexity is exploited to ensure the robustness of numerical results for any range of deformations and applied electric fields. The paper also presents key important results both in terms of the existence of minimisers and material stability of coupled electro-mechanics, enhancing previous works in the area of large strain elasticity. In addition, a comprehensive series of selected numerical examples is included in order to demonstrate the effect that the anisotropic orientation and the contrast of material properties, as well as the level of deformation and electric field, have upon the response of the EAP when subjected to large three-dimensional stretching, bending and torsion, including the possible development of wrinkling and the potential loss of ellipticity in ill-posed constitutive models.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades there has been considerable interest among the scientific community in modeling random system inputs from limited observations and propagating the system responses . In this paper, we develop a novel method for the reasonable modeling of system inputs and efficient propagation of response. Our method firstly constructs the random model of system inputs from observations by developing a novel kernel density estimator (KDE) for Karhunen–Loeve (KL) variables. By further implementing the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) formulation on dependent non-Gaussian KL variables, the associated aPC-based response propagation is then developed. In our method, the developed random model can accurately represent the input parameters from limited observations as the developed KDE of KL variables can incorporate the inherent relation between marginals of input parameters and KL variables, while empowering the input model to preserve the second-order correlations. Furthermore, since the statistical moments of KL variables can be analytically evaluated, the aPC formulation for achieving optimal convergence of system responses can be accurately determined. In addition, the system response can be accurately propagated in an efficient way by developing an aPC-based regression method using space-filling design, in which the conditional distributions in Rosenblatt transformation of aPC variables can be efficiently determined without evaluations of multi-dimensional integrations. In this way, the current work provides an effective framework for the reasonable stochastic modeling​ and efficient response propagation of real-life engineering systems with limited observations. Two numerical examples are presented to highlight the effectiveness of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {Chameleon swarm algorithm (CSA) is a newly proposed swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the chameleon’s foraging strategies of tracking, searching and attacking targets, and has shown well competitive performance with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Interestingly, CSA mathematically models and implements the steps of chameleon’s unique food-seeking behavior. Nevertheless, the original CSA suffers from the challenges of insufficient exploitation ability, ease of falling into local optima , and low convergence accuracy in complex large-scale applications. Aiming at these challenges, an efficient enhanced chameleon swarm algorithm termed MCSA, combined with fractional-order calculus, sinusoidal adjustment of parameters and crossover-based comprehensive learning (CCL) strategy, is developed in this paper. Firstly, a good fractional-order calculus strategy is added to update the chameleon’s attack velocity, which heightens the local search ability of CSA and accelerates the convergence speed of the algorithm; meanwhile, the sinusoidal adjustment of parameters is adopted to provide a better balance between exploration and exploitation of CSA. Secondly, the CCL strategy is used for the mutation to increase the diversity of the population and avoid becoming trapped in local optima. Three strategies enhance the overall performance and efficiency of the native CSA. Finally, the superiority of the presented MCSA is verified in detail by comparing it with native CSA and several state-of-the-art algorithms on the well-known 23 benchmark test functions, CEC2017 and CEC2019 test suites, respectively. Furthermore, the practicability of MCSA is also highlighted by six real-world engineering designs and two truss topology optimization problems. Simulation results demonstrate that MCSA has strong competitive capabilities and promising prospects. MCSA is potentially an excellent meta-heuristic algorithm for solving engineering optimization problems .},

Numerical investigations in nonperiodic systems which range from diatomic molecules to carbon allotropes demonstrate the systematic convergence that is offered by the finite element framework, not only for energy and force but also for geometric configuration and molecular statics parameters. A range of higher-order discretizations employing fixed meshes are invoked within these examples based on classical finite elements as well as on isogeometric analysis. Overall, this work contributes to recent advances which demonstrate the viability of the finite element method for carrying out ab initio molecular dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown to be effective tools for solving both forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs). PINNs embed the PDEs into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation , and this PDE loss is evaluated at a set of scattered spatio-temporal points (called residual points). The location and distribution of these residual points are highly important to the performance of PINNs. However, in the existing studies on PINNs, only a few simple residual point sampling methods have mainly been used. Here, we present a comprehensive study of two categories of sampling for PINNs: non-adaptive uniform sampling and adaptive nonuniform sampling. We consider six uniform sampling methods, including (1) equispaced uniform grid, (2) uniformly random sampling, (3) Latin hypercube sampling , (4) Halton sequence , (5) Hammersley sequence, and (6) Sobol sequence. We also consider a resampling strategy for uniform sampling. To improve the sampling efficiency and the accuracy of PINNs, we propose two new residual-based adaptive sampling methods: residual-based adaptive distribution (RAD) and residual-based adaptive refinement with distribution (RAR-D), which dynamically improve the distribution of residual points based on the PDE residuals during training. Hence, we have considered a total of 10 different sampling methods, including six non-adaptive uniform sampling, uniform sampling with resampling, two proposed adaptive sampling, and an existing adaptive sampling. We extensively tested the performance of these sampling methods for four forward problems and two inverse problems in many setups. Our numerical results presented in this study are summarized from more than 6000 simulations of PINNs. We show that the proposed adaptive sampling methods of RAD and RAR-D significantly improve the accuracy of PINNs with fewer residual points for both forward and inverse problems. The results obtained in this study can also be used as a practical guideline in choosing sampling methods.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new class of physics-informed neural networks, called the Physics-Informed Variational Auto-Encoder (PI-VAE), to solve stochastic differential equations (SDEs) or inverse problems involving SDEs. In these problems the governing equations are known but only a limited number of measurements of system parameters are available. PI-VAE consists of a variational autoencoder (VAE), which generates samples of system variables and parameters. This generative model is integrated with the governing equations. In this integration, the derivatives of VAE outputs are readily calculated using automatic differentiation, and used in the physics-based loss term. In this work, the loss function is chosen to be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for improved performance, and neural network parameters are updated iteratively using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We first test the proposed method on approximating stochastic processes. Then we study three types of problems related to SDEs: forward and inverse problems together with mixed problems where system parameters and solutions are simultaneously calculated. The satisfactory accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are numerically demonstrated in comparison with physics-informed Wasserstein generative adversarial network (PI-WGAN).},

The problem is formulated in the frequency domain and the method of solution seeks to minimize a distance between physically admissible histories of stress and strain, in the sense of compatibility and equilibrium, and the material data. We metrize the space of histories by means of the flat-norm of their Fourier transform, which allows consideration of infinite wave trains such as harmonic functions. Another significant advantage of the flat norm is that it allows the response of the system at one frequency to be inferred from data at nearby frequencies. We demonstrate and verify the approach by means of two test cases, a polymeric truss structure characterized by DMA data and a 3D soft gel sample characterized by MRE data. The examples demonstrate the ease of implementation of the Data-Driven scheme within conventional commercial codes and its robust convergence properties, both with respect to the solver and the data.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a mixed formulation based on the scaled boundary parameterization for the analysis of nearly-incompressible hyperelastic materials at finite strains. The formulation leads to a polygonal element with an arbitrary number of edges. The element domain is parameterized in both the boundary and scaling directions and necessitates the definition of a scaling center. Interpolation functions are introduced in both directions, which allow for an application to physically and geometrically nonlinear problems . This is an extension to the original scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM), in which an analytical solution in the scaling direction is employed. Whereas the SBFEM approach is restricted to star-convex element geometries, the present approach allows for non-star-convex polygonal element shapes. A mixed displacement-pressure formulation is proposed to alleviate volumetric locking, which typically occurs in case of nearly-incompressible material behavior . Several numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed approach is applicable to arbitrary polygonal meshes , such as Voronoi meshes. The results demonstrate an excellent behavior in terms of computational efficiency compared to standard quadrilateral elements and to the virtual element method (VEM). The ability of the present formulation to alleviate volumetric locking is shown and it is demonstrated that a higher accuracy can be reached on Voronoi meshes compared to quadrilateral discretizations .},

  abstract     = {Due to the global progress, the optimization problems are becoming more and more complex. Hence, deterministic and heuristic approaches are no longer adequate for dealing with such sophisticated problems. subsequently, metaheuristics have recently emerged as an effective alternative for addressing the optimization problems. This paper proposes a novel metaheuristic called Young’s Double-Slit Experiment (YDSE) optimizer, derived from a physical backdrop. The YDSE optimizer is inspired by Young’s double-slit experiment, which is regarded as one of the most well-known classical physics experiments, revealing the wave nature of light. In YDSE optimizer, each fringe represents a possible solution in the population. Many concepts are modeled from the experiment, such as monochromatic light waves, Huygens’ principle, constructive and destructive interference, wave intensity, amplitude, and path difference. The YDSE optimizer strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation by selecting either a constructive interference or a destructive interference based on the order number of the fringe. During the optimization process, the solution moves in search space based on its order number. If the solution has an odd number, it moves in the dark regions towards the central bright region, which is expected to contain the optimal solution. The algorithm exploits the promising areas in the bright fringe areas, which are assumed to contain the optimum. The performance of the YDSE optimizer is compared with another twelve metaheuristics using CEC 2014, CEC 2017, and CEC 2022. The benchmarks cover different unimodal, multimodal, hybrid, and composite test functions. Also, we consider ten constrained and unconstrained engineering optimization design problems. YDSE proved its superiority over the CEC 2014 and CEC 2017 winners, such as L-SHADE, LSHADE-cnEpSin, and LSHADE-SPACMA. The results and the statistical analysis demonstrated the outperformance of the proposed YDSE optimizer at a 95% confidence interval.},

  abstract     = {The finite element method (FEM) is commonly used for modeling continuum media, while particle simulation methods like the so-called discrete element method (DEM) are used for discrete systems. Coupling the discrete (DEM) and continuum (FEM) methods is conventionally achieved through a direct mapping between discrete particles and finite elements. Coarse-graining (CG) is a micro–macro transition (discrete-to-continuum) method that maps discrete particle data onto smooth, differentiable fields that satisfy the continuum equations. By choosing an appropriate length scale (the coarse-graining width c c ), the coarse-grained fields are then homogenized and projected onto a FEM spatial discretization. This concept is utilized here to reformulate FEM-DEM coupling methods, both surface and volume, where in the limiting case of c → 0 c→0 , the classical coupling is recovered. For surface coupling, the discrete particle–surface contact forces are first mapped onto a continuous surface traction field (using CG) which is then coupled to the continuum FEM model. For volume coupling (also known as the Arlequin framework), the homogenization operators are enriched with CG functions, offering a non-local coupling approach between discrete particles, their continuum fields, and the finite elements. The CG enrichment represents a new strategy that consists of (1) a discrete-to-continuum mapping and (2) a continuum-to-continuum coupling based on “CG-enriched homogenization” (CGH). It is shown for surface coupling that the CG-enriched formulation not only leads to more accurate results, conserving symmetry, but also reduces energies generated by the coupling. For volume coupling, there is consistently less numerical dissipation with than without CG-enrichment, especially when the dynamic load contains high-frequency content. Finally, the optimal CG widths are identified for very simple test cases, with which the surface or volume coupling performs best. CGH can be potentially extended beyond the present examples, by considering other continuum fields (e.g., higher-order) and equations (e.g., multi-physics), and used to formulate other multi-scale modeling methods.},

They enjoy most of the properties known in the polynomial spline case. In particular, under suitable assumptions, Tchebycheffian splines admit a representation in terms of basis functions, called Tchebycheffian B-splines (TB-splines), completely analogous to polynomial B-splines. A particularly interesting subclass consists of Tchebycheffian splines with pieces belonging to null-spaces of constant-coefficient linear differential operators. They grant the freedom of combining polynomials with exponential and trigonometric functions with any number of individual shape parameters. Moreover, they have been recently equipped with efficient evaluation and manipulation procedures. In this paper we consider the use of TB-splines with pieces belonging to null-spaces of constant-coefficient linear differential operators as an attractive substitute for standard polynomial B-splines and rational NURBS in isogeometric Galerkin methods. We discuss how to exploit the large flexibility of the geometrical and analytical features of the underlying Tchebycheff spaces according to problem-driven selection strategies. TB-splines offer a wide and robust environment for the isogeometric paradigm beyond the limits of the rational NURBS model.},

A central problem in achieving this objective is the reconstruction of analysis-suitable models from Computer-Aided Design models, which is in general a non-trivial and time-consuming task. In this article, we present a novel spline construction, that enables model reconstruction as well as simulation of high-order PDEs on the reconstructed models. The proposed almost- C 1 C1 splines are biquadratic splines on fully unstructured quadrilateral meshes (without restrictions on placements or number of extraordinary vertices). They are C 1 C1 smooth at all regular and extraordinary vertices. Moreover, they are C 1 C1 smooth across all edges between regular vertices and C 0 C0 smooth across all edges that are adjacent to an extraordinary vertex. The splines thus form H 2 H2 -nonconforming analysis-suitable discretization spaces. This is the lowest-degree unstructured spline construction that can be used to solve fourth-order problems. The associated spline basis is non-singular and has several B-spline-like properties (e.g., partition of unity , non-negativity, local support), the almost- C 1 C1 splines are described in an explicit Bézier-extraction-based framework that can be easily implemented. Numerical tests suggest that the basis is well-conditioned and exhibits optimal approximation behaviour.},
