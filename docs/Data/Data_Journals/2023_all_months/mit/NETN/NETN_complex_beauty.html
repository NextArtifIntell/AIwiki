  abstract     = {Decoding human brain activity on various task-based functional brain imaging data is of great significance for uncovering the functioning mechanism of the human mind. Currently, most feature extraction model-based methods for brain state decoding are shallow machine learning models, which may struggle to capture complex and precise spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity from the highly noisy fMRI raw data. Moreover, although decoding models based on deep learning methods benefit from their multilayer structure that could extract spatiotemporal features at multiscale, the relatively large populations of fMRI datasets are indispensable, and the explainability of their results is elusive. To address the above problems, we proposed a computational framework based on hybrid spatiotemporal deep belief network and sparse representations to differentiate multitask fMRI (tfMRI) signals. Using a relatively small cohort of tfMRI data as a test bed, our framework can achieve an average classification accuracy of 97.86\% and define the multilevel temporal and spatial patterns of multiple cognitive tasks. Intriguingly, our model can characterize the key components for differentiating the multitask fMRI signals. Overall, the proposed framework can identify the interpretable and discriminative fMRI composition patterns at multiple scales, offering an effective methodology for basic neuroscience and clinical research with relatively small cohorts. Decoding different cognitive processes using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI) is crucial for understanding the relationship between brain activities and cognitive states. However, existing machine learning–based feature extraction methods for decoding brain states may struggle to capture the complex and precise spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity from the highly noisy raw fMRI data. Additionally, current deep learning–based end-to-end decoding models struggle to unveil interpretable components in tfMRI signal decoding. To address these limitations, we proposed a novel framework, the hybrid spatiotemporal deep belief network and sparse representations (DBN-SR) framework, which effectively distinguished multitask fMRI signals with an average accuracy of 97.86\%. Furthermore, it simultaneously identified multilevel temporal and spatial patterns of multiple cognitive tasks. By utilizing a novel ratio-of-activation metric, our framework unveiled interpretable components with greater classification capacity, offering an effective methodology for basic neuroscience and clinical research.},

  abstract     = {The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas consists of anterograde tracing experiments targeting diverse structures and classes of projecting neurons. Beyond regional anterograde tracing done in C57BL/6 wild-type mice, a large fraction of experiments are performed using transgenic Cre-lines. This allows access to cell-class-specific whole-brain connectivity information, with class defined by the transgenic lines. However, even though the number of experiments is large, it does not come close to covering all existing cell classes in every area where they exist. Here, we study how much we can fill in these gaps and estimate the cell-class-specific connectivity function given the simplifying assumptions that nearby voxels have smoothly varying projections, but that these projection tensors can change sharply depending on the region and class of the projecting cells. This paper describes the conversion of Cre-line tracer experiments into class-specific connectivity matrices representing the connection strengths between source and target structures. We introduce and validate a novel statistical model for creation of connectivity matrices. We extend the Nadaraya-Watson kernel learning method that we previously used to fill in spatial gaps to also fill in gaps in cell-class connectivity information. To do this, we construct a “cell-class space” based on class-specific averaged regionalized projections and combine smoothing in 3D space as well as in this abstract space to share information between similar neuron classes. Using this method, we construct a set of connectivity matrices using multiple levels of resolution at which discontinuities in connectivity are assumed. We show that the connectivities obtained from this model display expected cell-type- and structure-specific connectivities. We also show that the wild-type connectivity matrix can be factored using a sparse set of factors, and analyze the informativeness of this latent variable model. While standard connectivity studies in mammalian models focus on the overall connection strength between areas, there is an increasing focus on specific connection types between cell classes when describing functions at a local circuit level. Having recently described the importance of such classes in the cortico-thalamic system, we now investigate their importance for estimating brain-wide mesoscopic connectivity. Even within our relatively large dataset, the connectivity data across cell classes is sparse, and so we introduce a method to more reliably extrapolate across classes and estimate connection-type-specific inter-areal connectivity. We observe that this complex connectivity may be described via a relatively small set of factors. While not complete, this connectivity matrix represents a categorical and quantitative improvement in mouse mesoscale connectivity models.},

  abstract     = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder associated with suboptimal outcomes throughout the life-span. Extant work suggests that ADHD-related deficits in task performance may be magnified under high cognitive load and minimized under high perceptual load, but these effects have yet to be systematically examined, and the neural mechanisms that undergird these effects are as yet unknown. Herein, we report results from three experiments investigating how performance in ADHD is modulated by cognitive load and perceptual load during a naturalistic task. Results indicate that cognitive load and perceptual load influence task performance, reaction time variability (RTV), and brain network topology in an ADHD-specific fashion. Increasing cognitive load resulted in reduced performance, greater RTV, and reduced brain network efficiency in individuals with ADHD relative to those without. In contrast, increased perceptual load led to relatively greater performance, reduced RTV, and greater brain network efficiency in ADHD. These results provide converging evidence that brain network efficiency and intraindividual variability in ADHD are modulated by both cognitive and perceptual load during naturalistic task performance. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects more than 500 million adults worldwide ( Song et al., 2021 ), and confers suboptimal outcomes in many areas of life. Emerging evidence suggests that ADHD-related cognitive deficits may be at least somewhat task-dependent, with some work showing that increased cognitive load results in reduced performance in ADHD relative to non-ADHD individuals, and other work showing that increased perceptual load may narrow, or even eliminate these deficits. However, these effects have yet to be examined together, and their neural underpinnings are unknown. In three experiments (one in the lab, one online, and one fMRI), we show that cognitive load worsens cognitive performance, and reduces brain network efficiency in ADHD relative to non-ADHD individuals, while perceptual load has largely the opposite effect.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a computerized executive functions (EFs)–based reading intervention on neural circuits supporting EFs and visual attention. Seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analysis was conducted focusing on large-scale attention system brain networks, during an fMRI reading fluency task. Participants were 8- to 12-year-old English-speaking children with dyslexia ( n = 43) and typical readers ( n = 36) trained on an EFs-based reading training ( n = 40) versus math training ( n = 39). Training duration was 8 weeks. After the EFs-based reading intervention, children with dyslexia improved their scores in reading rate and visual attention (compared to math intervention). Neurobiologically, children with dyslexia displayed an increase in functional connectivity strength after the intervention between the cingulo-opercular network and occipital and precentral regions. Noteworthy, the functional connectivity indices between these brain regions showed a positive correlation with speed of processing and visual attention scores in both pretest and posttest. The results suggest that reading improvement following an EFs-based reading intervention involves neuroplastic connectivity changes in brain areas related to EFs and primary visual processing in children with dyslexia. Our results highlight the need for training underlying cognitive abilities supporting reading, such as EFs and visual attention, in order to enhance reading abilities in dyslexia. The aim of the study was to determine the behavioral and neural effects of a computerized executive functions (EFs)-based reading intervention. A total of 79 participants (8–12-year-olds, English-speaking) with and without dyslexia trained either on an EFs-based reading training or a math training. After the EFs-based reading intervention, children with dyslexia improved their scores in reading rate and visual attention. Intervention-related increases in fMRI functional connectivity were observed between the cingulo-opercular network and occipital regions. Higher indices of connectivity were related to better speed of processing and visual attention. The reading improvement involved neuroplastic connectivity changes in brain areas related to EFs and primary visual processing. The importance of training the cognitive abilities supporting reading in dyslexia (e.g., EFs and visual attention) is highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Spontaneous activity during the resting state, tracked by BOLD fMRI imaging, or shortly rsfMRI, gives rise to brain-wide dynamic patterns of interregional correlations, whose structured flexibility relates to cognitive performance. Here, we analyze resting-state dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in a cohort of older adults, including amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, N = 34) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD, N = 13) patients, as well as normal control (NC, N = 16) and cognitively “supernormal” controls (SNC, N = 10) subjects. Using complementary state-based and state-free approaches, we find that resting-state fluctuations of different functional links are not independent but are constrained by high-order correlations between triplets or quadruplets of functionally connected regions. When contrasting patients with healthy subjects, we find that dFC between cingulate and other limbic regions is increasingly bursty and intermittent when ranking the four groups from SNC to NC, aMCI and AD. Furthermore, regions affected at early stages of AD pathology are less involved in higher order interactions in patient than in control groups, while pairwise interactions are not significantly reduced. Our analyses thus suggest that the spatiotemporal complexity of dFC organization is precociously degraded in AD and provides a richer window into the underlying neurobiology than time-averaged FC connections. Brain functions emerge from the coordinated dynamics of many brain regions. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analyses are a key tool to describe such dynamic complexity and have been shown to be good predictors of cognitive performance. This is particularly true in the case of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in which an impoverished dFC could indicate compromised functional reserve due to the detrimental effects of neurodegeneration. Here we observe that in healthy aging, dFC is indeed spatiotemporally organized, as reflected by high-order correlations between multiple regions. However, in people with aMCI or AD, dFC becomes less “entangled,” more random-like, and intermittently bursty. We speculate that this degraded spatiotemporal coordination may reflect dysfunctional information processing, thus ultimately leading to worsening of cognitive deficits.},

  abstract     = {Listening to music is an enjoyable behaviour that engages multiple networks of brain regions. As such, the act of music listening may offer a way to interrogate network activity, and to examine the reconfigurations of brain networks that have been observed in healthy aging. The present study is an exploratory examination of brain network dynamics during music listening in healthy older and younger adults. Network measures were extracted and analyzed together with behavioural data using a combination of hidden Markov modelling and partial least squares. We found age- and preference-related differences in fMRI data collected during music listening in healthy younger and older adults. Both age groups showed higher occupancy (the proportion of time a network was active) in a temporal-mesolimbic network while listening to self-selected music. Activity in this network was strongly positively correlated with liking and familiarity ratings in younger adults, but less so in older adults. Additionally, older adults showed a higher degree of correlation between liking and familiarity ratings consistent with past behavioural work on age-related dedifferentiation. We conclude that, while older adults do show network and behaviour patterns consistent with dedifferentiation, activity in the temporal-mesolimbic network is relatively robust to dedifferentiation. These findings may help explain how music listening remains meaningful and rewarding in old age. This article explores age-related differences in between-network dynamics during music listening using fMRI data collected from a sample of healthy younger and older adults. We estimated brain networks using hidden Markov modelling (HMM) and tested for age- and stimulus-related differences using partial least squares (PLS). HMM returned four functional connectivity networks, including a bilateral temporal network and a bilateral temporal-mesolimbic network. We found differences related to age and stimulus with both age groups spending more time in the temporal-mesolimbic network while listening to familiar, well-liked music. Younger adults&#39; activity in this network was positively correlated with liking and familiarity ratings, but this was not the case for older adults, consistent with past work on age-related dedifferentiation. We conclude that activity in the temporal-mesolimbic network is robust to dedifferentiation and discuss how these conclusions and analysis tools can be of use in future work with clinical populations.},

  abstract     = {Time-varying functional connectivity (FC) methods are used to map the spatiotemporal organization of brain activity. However, their estimation can be unstable, in the sense that different runs of the inference may yield different solutions. But to draw meaningful relations to behavior, estimates must be robust and reproducible. Here, we propose two solutions using the hidden Markov model (HMM) as a descriptive model of time-varying FC. The first, best ranked HMM, involves running the inference multiple times and selecting the best model based on a quantitative measure combining fitness and model complexity. The second, hierarchical-clustered HMM, generates stable cluster state time series by applying hierarchical clustering to the state time series obtained from multiple runs. Experimental results on fMRI and magnetoencephalography data demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve the stability of time-varying FC estimations. Overall, hierarchical-clustered HMM is preferred when the inference variability is high, while the best ranked HMM performs better otherwise. Functional connectivity (FC) is a widely used metric in neuroimaging and electrophysiology. Characterizing the temporal evolution of FC might help to better understand the multiregion, dynamic organization of the brain that subserves human cognition. Unfortunately, most current methods for assessing time-varying FC often lack reproducibility due to estimation noise, resulting in inconsistent results. In this study, we introduce two solutions based on the hidden Markov model to enhance the stability of time-varying FC estimations. These approaches represent an important step toward improving the reproducibility of FC analysis.},

  abstract     = {A central goal in neuroscience is the development of a comprehensive mapping between structural and functional brain features, which facilitates mechanistic interpretation of brain function. However, the interpretability of structure-function brain models remains limited by a lack of biological detail. Here, we characterize human structural brain networks weighted by multiple white matter microstructural features including total intra-axonal cross-sectional area and myelin content. We report edge-weight-dependent spatial distributions, variance, small-worldness, rich club, hubs, as well as relationships with function, edge length, and myelin. Contrasting networks weighted by the total intra-axonal cross-sectional area and myelin content of white matter tracts, we find opposite relationships with functional connectivity, an edge-length-independent inverse relationship with each other, and the lack of a canonical rich club in myelin-weighted networks. When controlling for edge length, networks weighted by either fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, or neurite density show no relationship with whole-brain functional connectivity. We conclude that the co-utilization of structural networks weighted by total intra-axonal cross-sectional area and myelin content could improve our understanding of the mechanisms mediating the structure-function brain relationship. For computational network models to provide mechanistic links between brain structure and function, they must be informed by networks in which edge weights quantify structural features relevant to brain function. Here, we characterized several weighted structural networks capturing multiscale features of white matter connectivity including total intra-axonal cross-sectional area and myelin density. We describe these networks in terms of edge weight distribution, variance, and network topology, as well as their relationships with each other, edge length, and function. Overall, these findings support the joint use of structural networks weighted by the total intra-axonal cross-sectional area and myelin content of white matter tracts in structure-function models. This thorough characterization serves as a benchmark for future investigations of weighted structural brain networks.},

  abstract     = {Extra temporal lobe epilepsy (eTLE) may involve heterogenous widespread cerebral networks. We investigated the structural network of an eTLE cohort, at the postulated epileptogenic zone later surgically removed, as a network node: the resection zone (RZ). We hypothesized patients with an abnormal connection to/from the RZ to have proportionally increased abnormalities based on topological proximity to the RZ, in addition to poorer post-operative seizure outcome. Structural and diffusion MRI were collected for 22 eTLE patients pre- and post-surgery, and for 29 healthy controls. The structural connectivity of the RZ prior to surgery, measured via generalized fractional anisotropy (gFA), was compared with healthy controls. Abnormal connections were identified as those with substantially reduced gFA ( z &lt; −1.96). For patients with one or more abnormal connections to/from the RZ, connections with closer topological distance to the RZ had higher proportion of abnormalities. The minority of the seizure-free patients (3/11) had one or more abnormal connections, while most non-seizure-free patients (8/11) had abnormal connections to the RZ. Our data suggest that eTLE patients with one or more abnormal structural connections to/from the RZ had more proportional abnormal connections based on topological distance to the RZ and associated with reduced chance of seizure freedom post-surgery. Focal epilepsy describes seizures that originate at one or more location. A significant proportion of cases, however, are unresponsive to drug treatment; therefore, surgery remains an important and effective treatment in stopping seizures. We wanted to further understand the nature of these networks associated with epilepsy and how they contribute to post-surgical outcome. Our research asked three questions: Does distance to the clinically suspected site of the epilepsy increase the likelihood of network abnormality? Can an upstream abnormal connection to a region increase the chance of abnormal connections downstream? Can the presence of abnormal connections explain post-operative outcome in terms of seizure freedom? We hope our work will shed light on epileptogenic networks and potentially stimulate new ideas and discussions to investigate brain networks in epilepsy.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a surge in the use of diffusion MRI to map connectomes in humans, paralleled by a similar increase in processing and analysis choices. Yet these different steps and their effects are rarely compared systematically. Here, in a healthy young adult population ( n = 294), we characterized the impact of a range of analysis pipelines on one widely studied property of the human connectome: its degree distribution. We evaluated the effects of 40 pipelines (comparing common choices of parcellation, streamline seeding, tractography algorithm, and streamline propagation constraint) and 44 group-representative connectome reconstruction schemes on highly connected hub regions. We found that hub location is highly variable between pipelines. The choice of parcellation has a major influence on hub architecture, and hub connectivity is highly correlated with regional surface area in most of the assessed pipelines ( ρ &gt; 0.70 in 69\% of the pipelines), particularly when using weighted networks. Overall, our results demonstrate the need for prudent decision-making when processing diffusion MRI data, and for carefully considering how different processing choices can influence connectome organization. The increasing use of diffusion MRI for mapping white matter connectivity has been matched by a similar increase in the number of ways to process the diffusion data. Here, we assess how diffusion processing affects hubs across 1,760 pipeline variations. Many processing pipelines do not show a high concentration of connectivity within hubs. When present, hub location and distribution vary based on processing choices. The choice of probabilistic or deterministic tractography has a major impact on hub location and strength. Finally, node strength in weighted networks can correlate highly with node size. Overall, our results illustrate the need for prudent decision-making when processing and interpreting diffusion MRI data.},

  abstract     = {Current knowledge of white matter changes in large-scale brain networks in adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is scarce. We collected diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data in 40 adults with ADHD and 36 neurotypical controls and used constrained spherical deconvolution–based tractography to reconstruct whole-brain structural connectivity networks. We used network-based statistic (NBS) and graph theoretical analysis to investigate differences in these networks between the ADHD and control groups, as well as associations between structural connectivity and ADHD symptoms assessed with the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale or performance in the Conners Continuous Performance Test 2 (CPT-2). NBS revealed decreased connectivity in the ADHD group compared to the neurotypical controls in widespread unilateral networks, which included subcortical and corticocortical structures and encompassed dorsal and ventral attention networks and visual and somatomotor systems. Furthermore, hypoconnectivity in a predominantly left-frontal network was associated with higher amount of commission errors in CPT-2. Graph theoretical analysis did not reveal topological differences between the groups or associations between topological properties and ADHD symptoms or task performance. Our results suggest that abnormal structural wiring of the brain in adult ADHD is manifested as widespread intrahemispheric hypoconnectivity in networks previously associated with ADHD in functional neuroimaging studies. Although it is well-established that widespread changes in large-scale brain networks underlie ADHD, little is known about the aberrancies in the complex structural brain networks that pertain at adulthood. Knowledge of structural changes in adult ADHD would be important as the symptom presentation of the disorder changes considerably across the life-span. We found that abnormal structural brain wiring in adults with ADHD is manifested as widespread hypoconnectivity in unilateral networks, and attention task performance is associated with a left-frontal network across all participants. White matter abnormalities in overlapping brain networks have been reported also in children with ADHD, but emerging evidence in adults proposes some changes in the neuropathology of ADHD from childhood to adulthood.},

Previous research suggests that dynamic FC explains variability in FC fluctuations and behavior beyond static FC. Our aim was to systematically compare methods on both dimensions. We compared five FC methods: Pearson’s/full correlation (static, bivariate), lagged correlation (dynamic, bivariate), partial correlation (static, multivariate), and multivariate AR model with and without self-connections (dynamic, multivariate). We compared these methods by (i) assessing similarities between FC matrices, (ii) by comparing node centrality measures, and (iii) by comparing the patterns of brain-behavior associations. Although FC estimates did not differ as a function of sensitivity to temporal order, we observed differences between the multivariate and bivariate FC methods. The dynamic FC estimates were highly correlated with the static FC estimates, especially when comparing group-level FC matrices. Similarly, there were high correlations between the patterns of brain-behavior associations obtained using the dynamic and static FC methods. We conclude that the dynamic FC estimates represent information largely similar to that of the static FC. Functional connectivity (FC) methods differ in their sensitivity to temporal order (static vs. dynamic) and the number of regions used to estimate a single edge (bivariate vs. multivariate). Dynamic connectivity measures are sensitive to temporal order, whereas static ones are not. We compared the FC methods with respect to both dimensions and showed that the dynamic and static FC estimates represent largely similar information. Using simulations, we have shown that the similarity between dynamic and static FC estimates may be due to the convolution of the neural signal with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) alone. On the other hand, bivariate FC estimates showed better generalizability in cross-validation compared with multivariate FC estimates in the study of brain-behavior associations.},

  abstract     = {Top-down processes such as expectations have a strong influence on pain perception. Predicted threat of impending pain can affect perceived pain even more than the actual intensity of a noxious event. This type of threat bias in pain perception is associated with fear of pain and low pain tolerance, and hence the extent of bias varies between individuals. Large-scale patterns of functional brain connectivity are important for integrating expectations with sensory data. Greater integration is necessary for sensory integration; therefore, here we investigate the association between system segregation and top-down threat bias in healthy individuals. We show that top-down threat bias is predicted by less functional connectivity between resting-state networks. This effect was significant at a wide range of network thresholds and specifically in predefined parcellations of resting-state networks. Greater system segregation in brain networks also predicted higher anxiety and pain catastrophizing. These findings highlight the role of integration in brain networks in mediating threat bias in pain perception. Some individuals are more sensitive to threats of receiving strong pain stimuli. In this study, we report that higher system segregation in brain networks is associated with a greater threat bias (a reliance on expected intensity of pain versus the actual sensory stimuli in the manipulated pain experiment). We verified the results with different predefined resting-state parcellations at different network sparsities, and also tested subject-driven parcellations. These findings demonstrate that higher integration between resting-state networks is conducive for integrating top-down expectation processes with changes in bottom-up noxious stimulus intensities. Network segregation in resting state is thus associated with poor sensory integration and also shows association with anxiety and fear of pain.},

  abstract     = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to investigate functional coupling (FC) disturbances in a range of clinical disorders. Most analyses performed to date have used group-based parcellations for defining regions of interest (ROIs), in which a single parcellation is applied to each brain. This approach neglects individual differences in brain functional organization and may inaccurately delineate the true borders of functional regions. These inaccuracies could inflate or underestimate group differences in case-control analyses. We investigated how individual differences in brain organization influence group comparisons of FC using psychosis as a case study, drawing on fMRI data in 121 early psychosis patients and 57 controls. We defined FC networks using either a group-based parcellation or an individually tailored variant of the same parcellation. Individualized parcellations yielded more functionally homogeneous ROIs than did group-based parcellations. At the level of individual connections, case-control FC differences were widespread, but the group-based parcellation identified approximately 7.7\% more connections as dysfunctional than the individualized parcellation. When considering differences at the level of functional networks, the results from both parcellations converged. Our results suggest that a substantial fraction of dysconnectivity previously observed in psychosis may be driven by the parcellation method, rather than by a pathophysiological process related to psychosis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is widely used to map how brain network dysfunction is affected by diverse diseases. A fundamental step in this work involved defining specific brain regions, which act as network nodes in the analysis. Most research to date has used a one-size-fits-all approach, defining such regions on a template brain that is then applied to individual people, which neglects the potential for variability in regional borders and brain organization. Here, we show that using an individualized approach to region definition results in more valid area definitions and more conservative estimates of brain network dysfunction in people with psychosis, indicating that at least some of the group differences reported in the extant literature may be due to differences in regional definitions rather than a consequence of the illness itself.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Systematic changes have been observed in the functional architecture of the human brain with advancing age. However, functional connectivity (FC) is also a powerful feature to detect unique “connectome fingerprints,” allowing identification of individuals among their peers. Although fingerprinting has been robustly observed in samples of young adults, the reliability of this approach has not been demonstrated across the lifespan. We applied the fingerprinting framework to the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience cohort (n = 483 aged 18 to 89 years). We found that individuals are “fingerprintable” (i.e., identifiable) across independent functional MRI scans throughout the lifespan. We observed a U-shape distribution in the strength of “self-identifiability” (within-individual correlation across modalities), and “others-identifiability” (between-individual correlation across modalities), with a decrease from early adulthood into middle age, before improving in older age. FC edges contributing to self-identifiability were not restricted to specific brain networks and were different between individuals across the lifespan sample. Self-identifiability was additionally associated with regional brain volume. These findings indicate that individual participant-level identification is preserved across the lifespan despite the fact that its components are changing nonlinearly.Author Summary. Important interindividual differences are increasingly identified in functional connectivity studies. However, most of the work to date has focused on samples of younger adults, ignoring older individuals in which brains undergo significant transformation. Here, we examine individual-level patterns of functional connectivity—that is, connectome fingerprints—across the adult lifespan. Our results suggest that connectome fingerprints can reliably predict individuals from independent brain scans across the lifespan. Additionally, regions contributing to fingerprints differed from person to person, emphasizing the extent of interindividual differences in the brain. Specific patterns of brain volume, associated with normative age-related atrophy, may impact the identification of individual-specific functional connectivity patterns. Our findings highlight the importance of interindividual variability in functional connectivity, regardless of participant age, when assessing individual differences in brain function.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many studies have shown that the human endocrine system modulates brain function, reporting associations between fluctuations in hormone concentrations and brain connectivity. However, how hormonal fluctuations impact fast changes in brain network organization over short timescales remains unknown. Here, we leverage a recently proposed framework for modeling co-fluctuations between the activity of pairs of brain regions at a framewise timescale. In previous studies we showed that time points corresponding to high-amplitude co-fluctuations disproportionately contributed to the time-averaged functional connectivity pattern and that these co-fluctuation patterns could be clustered into a low-dimensional set of recurring “states.” Here, we assessed the relationship between these network states and quotidian variation in hormone concentrations. Specifically, we were interested in whether the frequency with which network states occurred was related to hormone concentration. We addressed this question using a dense-sampling dataset (N = 1 brain). In this dataset, a single individual was sampled over the course of two endocrine states: a natural menstrual cycle and while the subject underwent selective progesterone suppression via oral hormonal contraceptives. During each cycle, the subject underwent 30 daily resting-state fMRI scans and blood draws. Our analysis of the imaging data revealed two repeating network states. We found that the frequency with which state 1 occurred in scan sessions was significantly correlated with follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormone concentrations. We also constructed representative networks for each scan session using only “event frames”—those time points when an event was determined to have occurred. We found that the weights of specific subsets of functional connections were robustly correlated with fluctuations in the concentration of not only luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones, but also progesterone and estradiol.Author Summary. We study a dense sampling dataset of one brain (N = 1) imaged across two complete menstrual cycles (60 scan sessions). We identify network states—high-amplitude patterns of time-varying connectivity that reoccur across scan sessions—and show that the frequency with which states occur is linked to endogenous fluctuations in follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones. We further show that the weights of scan-specific and whole-brain co-fluctuation patterns are broadly associated with hormone fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Hurst exponent (H) isolated in fractal analyses of neuroimaging time series is implicated broadly in cognition. Within this literature, H is associated with multiple mental disorders, suggesting that H is transdimensionally associated with psychopathology. Here, we unify these results and demonstrate a pattern of decreased H with increased general psychopathology and attention-deficit/hyperactivity factor scores during a working memory task in 1,839 children. This pattern predicts current and future cognitive performance in children and some psychopathology in 703 adults. This pattern also defines psychological and functional axes associating psychopathology with an imbalance in resource allocation between fronto-parietal and sensorimotor regions, driven by reduced resource allocation to fronto-parietal regions. This suggests the hypothesis that impaired working memory function in psychopathology follows from a reduced cognitive resource pool and a reduction in resources allocated to the task at hand.Author Summary. We study how the complexity of brain signals is associated with psychopathology. Using a measure of the fractalness of temporal brain dynamics, we find that psychopathology is associated with less fractal and less complex brain signals globally. In addition to this global pattern, we investigate spatial variations in the fractalness of brain signals. We find that disruptions in cognitive resources during a working memory task come from reductions in resources allocated to frontal regions alone. In addition, we find that these patterns of resource allocation are predictive of cognitive performance on multiple working memory tasks and a future working memory task. These findings suggest that future investigations of fractal brain dynamics in other contexts may help researchers better understand the mechanisms behind psychopathology-associated cognitive impairment.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Although practicing a task generally benefits later performance on that same task, there are individual differences in practice effects. One avenue to model such differences comes from research showing that brain networks extract functional advantages from operating in the vicinity of criticality, a state in which brain network activity is more scale-free. We hypothesized that higher scale-free signal from fMRI data, measured with the Hurst exponent (H), indicates closer proximity to critical states. We tested whether individuals with higher H during repeated task performance would show greater practice effects. In Study 1, participants performed a dual-n-back task (DNB) twice during MRI (n = 56). In Study 2, we used two runs of n-back task (NBK) data from the Human Connectome Project sample (n = 599). In Study 3, participants performed a word completion task (CAST) across six runs (n = 44). In all three studies, multivariate analysis was used to test whether higher H was related to greater practice-related performance improvement. Supporting our hypothesis, we found patterns of higher H that reliably correlated with greater performance improvement across participants in all three studies. However, the predictive brain regions were distinct, suggesting that the specific spatial H↑ patterns are not task-general.Author Summary. Individuals vary in the degree to which they improve on a task upon repeating it, referred to as practice effects. Research has shown a relationship between scale-free brain activity and advantageous functional properties for the brain networks. Therefore, we asked if practice effects are related to these scale-free brain dynamics. We hypothesized that individuals with more scale-free fMRI activity, measured with Hurst exponent (H), when repeating tasks would show larger practice effects. Across three datasets including different tasks and individuals, we found that higher fMRI H was associated with greater task performance improvement. We conclude that exhibiting more efficient information processing when performing a cognitive task may be indexed by higher fMRI scale-free activity and predict further improvement in task performance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Most Granger causality analysis (GCA) methods still remain a two-stage scheme guided by different mathematical theories; both can actually be viewed as the same generalized model selection issues. Adhering to Occam’s razor, we present a unified GCA (uGCA) based on the minimum description length principle. In this research, considering the common existence of nonlinearity in functional brain networks, we incorporated the nonlinear modeling procedure into the proposed uGCA method, in which an approximate representation of Taylor’s expansion was adopted. Through synthetic data experiments, we revealed that nonlinear uGCA was obviously superior to its linear representation and the conventional GCA. Meanwhile, the nonlinear characteristics of high-order terms and cross-terms would be successively drowned out as noise levels increased. Then, in real fMRI data involving mental arithmetic tasks, we further illustrated that these nonlinear characteristics in fMRI data may indeed be drowned out at a high noise level, and hence a linear causal analysis procedure may be sufficient. Next, involving autism spectrum disorder patients data, compared with conventional GCA, the network property of causal connections obtained by uGCA methods appeared to be more consistent with clinical symptoms.Author Summary. In previous studies on functional brain networks, we have proposed a linear unified Granger causality analysis (uGCA) method based on description length. Considering that functional brain image data is characterized by nonlinear nonstationary signals with complex long- and short-range correlations, we thus proposed a nonlinear uGCA method. Then, through simulated data experiments and logical self-consistent fMRI experiments, its causality identification performance was demonstrated to be superior to that of conventional GCA. At the same time, we further revealed the phenomenon that nonlinear high-order characteristics and nonlinear cross-characteristics were submerged successively at high noise levels, indicating that linear modeling procedures might be sufficient to cope with causality studies based on fMRI data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A rapidly emerging application of network neuroscience in neuroimaging studies has provided useful tools to understand individual differences in intrinsic brain function by mapping spontaneous brain activity, namely intrinsic functional network neuroscience (ifNN). However, the variability of methodologies applied across the ifNN studies—with respect to node definition, edge construction, and graph measurements—makes it difficult to directly compare findings and also challenging for end users to select the optimal strategies for mapping individual differences in brain networks. Here, we aim to provide a benchmark for best ifNN practices by systematically comparing the measurement reliability of individual differences under different ifNN analytical strategies using the test-retest design of the Human Connectome Project. The results uncovered four essential principles to guide ifNN studies: (1) use a whole brain parcellation to define network nodes, including subcortical and cerebellar regions; (2) construct functional networks using spontaneous brain activity in multiple slow bands; and (3) optimize topological economy of networks at individual level; and (4) characterize information flow with specific metrics of integration and segregation. We built an interactive online resource of reliability assessments for future ifNN (https://ibraindata.com/research/ifNN).Author Summary. It is an essential mission for neuroscience to understand the individual differences in brain function. Graph or network theory offer novel methods of network neuroscience to address such a challenge. This article documents optimal strategies on the test-retest reliability of measuring individual differences in intrinsic brain networks of spontaneous activity. The analytical pipelines are identified to optimize for highly reliable, individualized network measurements. These pipelines optimize network metrics for high interindividual variances and low inner-individual variances by defining network nodes with whole-brain parcellations, deriving the connectivity with spontaneous high-frequency slow-band oscillations, constructing brain graphs with topology-based methods for edge filtering, and favoring multilevel or multimodal metrics. These psychometric findings are critical for translating the functional network neuroscience into clinical or other personalized practices requiring neuroimaging markers.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Applications of graph theory to the connectome have inspired several models of how neural signaling unfolds atop its structure. Analytic measures derived from these communication models have mainly been used to extract global characteristics of brain networks, obscuring potentially informative inter-regional relationships. Here we develop a simple standardization method to investigate polysynaptic communication pathways between pairs of cortical regions. This procedure allows us to determine which pairs of nodes are topologically closer and which are further than expected on the basis of their degree. We find that communication pathways delineate canonical functional systems. Relating nodal communication capacity to meta-analytic probabilistic patterns of functional specialization, we also show that areas that are most closely integrated within the network are associated with higher order cognitive functions. We find that these regions’ proclivity towards functional integration could naturally arise from the brain’s anatomical configuration through evenly distributed connections among multiple specialized communities. Throughout, we consider two increasingly constrained null models to disentangle the effects of the network’s topology from those passively endowed by spatial embedding. Altogether, the present findings uncover relationships between polysynaptic communication pathways and the brain’s functional organization across multiple topological levels of analysis and demonstrate that network integration facilitates cognitive integration.Author Summary. Several mathematical models describe how neural signaling unfolds atop the structure of the brain. These communication models have mainly been used to characterize brain networks at a global scale. Here, using a simple standardization procedure, we benchmark inter-regional measures of communication capacity to determine which pairs of brain regions show a higher or lower propensity to communicate than expected by chance. We identify relationships between communication pathways and the brain’s functional organization across multiple network levels and show that network integration facilitates cognitive integration. Throughout, we consider the effect of spatial proximity on inter-regional communication relationships.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Assessment of functional connectivity (FC) has revealed a great deal of knowledge about the macroscale spatiotemporal organization of the brain network. Recent studies found task-versus-rest network reconfigurations were crucial for cognitive functioning. However, brain network reconfiguration remains unclear among different cognitive states, considering both aggregate and time-resolved FC profiles. The current study utilized static FC (sFC, i.e., long timescale aggregate FC) and sliding window–based dynamic FC (dFC, i.e., short timescale time-varying FC) approaches to investigate the similarity and alterations of edge weights and network topology at different cognitive loads, particularly their relationships with specific cognitive process. Both dFC/sFC networks showed subtle but significant reconfigurations that correlated with task performance. At higher cognitive load, brain network reconfiguration displayed increased functional integration in the sFC-based aggregate network, but faster and larger variability of modular reorganization in the dFC-based time-varying network, suggesting difficult tasks require more integrated and flexible network reconfigurations. Moreover, sFC-based network reconfigurations mainly linked with the sensorimotor and low-order cognitive processes, but dFC-based network reconfigurations mainly linked with the high-order cognitive process. Our findings suggest that reconfiguration profiles of sFC/dFC networks provide specific information about cognitive functioning, which could potentially be used to study brain function and disorders.Author Summary. A key question about functional brain connectome is whether a specific cognitive process depends on stronger or weaker network reconfiguration. A wide range of reconfiguration profiles based on both sFC and dFC should be taken into account to provide more detailed information. The current study first investigated static and dynamic network reconfigurations between three cognitive states and then linked them with behavioral parameters reflecting sensorimotor and cognitive processes. We further explored the relationship between sFC and dFC reconfiguration patterns. This work contributes to better understanding of relationships between cognitive functioning and network reconfiguration.},

Neuroimaging studies of functional connectivity, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have revealed individual differences in brain network organization associated with creative ability; however, much of the extant research is limited to laboratory-based divergent thinking measures. To overcome these limitations, we compare functional brain connectivity in a cohort of creative experts (n = 27) and controls (n = 26) and examine links with creative behavior. First, we replicate prior findings showing reduced connectivity in visual cortex related to higher creative performance. Second, we examine whether this result is driven by integrated or segregated connectivity. Third, we examine associations between functional connectivity and vivid distal simulation separately in creative experts and controls. In accordance with past work, our results show reduced connectivity to the primary visual cortex in creative experts at rest. Additionally, we observe a negative association between distal simulation vividness and connectivity to the lateral visual cortex in creative experts. Taken together, these results highlight connectivity profiles of highly creative people and suggest that creative thinking may be related to, though not fully redundant with, the ability to vividly imagine the future.Author Summary.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The brain is composed of several anatomically clearly separated structures. This parcellation is often extended into the isocortex, based on anatomical, physiological, or functional differences. Here, we derive a parcellation scheme based purely on the spatial structure of long-range synaptic connections within the cortex. To that end, we analyzed a publicly available dataset of average mouse brain connectivity, and split the isocortex into disjunct regions. Instead of clustering connectivity based on modularity, our scheme is inspired by methods that split sensory cortices into subregions where gradients of neuronal response properties, such as the location of the receptive field, reverse. We calculated comparable gradients from voxelized brain connectivity data and automatically detected reversals in them. This approach better respects the known presence of functional gradients within brain regions than clustering-based approaches. Placing borders at the reversals resulted in a parcellation into 41 subregions that differs significantly from an established scheme in nonrandom ways, but is comparable in terms of the modularity of connectivity between regions. It reveals unexpected trends of connectivity, such as a tripartite split of somatomotor regions along an anterior to posterior gradient. The method can be readily adapted to other organisms and data sources, such as human functional connectivity.Author Summary. We generalized a technique to find borders between brain regions based on functional data for use with voxelized connectivity data instead. Instead of maximizing a connectivity measurement, it draws borders where qualitative trends of connectivity reverse. The method does not adjust the borders between regions in established brain hierarchies, but instead creates a completely new hierarchy and associated parcellation. When we applied the technique to mouse isocortex connectivity, the results differed significantly from established parcellations, especially around primary sensory areas, yet they matched them in terms of modularity of connectivity. We conclude that it reveals and formalizes previously unappreciated trends of intracortical organization.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A promising idea in human cognitive neuroscience is that the default mode network (DMN) is responsible for coordinating the recruitment and scheduling of networks for computing and solving task-specific cognitive problems. This is supported by evidence showing that the physical and functional distance of DMN regions is maximally removed from sensorimotor regions containing environment-driven neural activity directly linked to perception and action, which would allow the DMN to orchestrate complex cognition from the top of the hierarchy. However, discovering the functional hierarchy of brain dynamics requires finding the best way to measure interactions between brain regions. In contrast to previous methods measuring the hierarchical flow of information using, for example, transfer entropy, here we used a thermodynamics-inspired, deep learning based Temporal Evolution NETwork (TENET) framework to assess the asymmetry in the flow of events, ‘arrow of time’, in human brain signals. This provides an alternative way of quantifying hierarchy, given that the arrow of time measures the directionality of information flow that leads to a breaking of the balance of the underlying hierarchy. In turn, the arrow of time is a measure of nonreversibility and thus nonequilibrium in brain dynamics. When applied to large-scale Human Connectome Project (HCP) neuroimaging data from close to a thousand participants, the TENET framework suggests that the DMN plays a significant role in orchestrating the hierarchy, that is, levels of nonreversibility, which changes between the resting state and when performing seven different cognitive tasks. Furthermore, this quantification of the hierarchy of the resting state is significantly different in health compared to neuropsychiatric disorders. Overall, the present thermodynamics-based machine-learning framework provides vital new insights into the fundamental tenets of brain dynamics for orchestrating the interactions between cognition and brain in complex environments.Author Summary. Here we used a thermodynamics-inspired, deep learning based Temporal Evolution NETwork (TENET) framework to assess the asymmetry in the flow of events, ‘arrow of time’, in human brain signals. This was applied to large-scale HCP neuroimaging data which showed significant changes between the hierarchy of orchestration for the resting state and seven different cognitive tasks. Similarly, the hierarchy of the resting state is significantly different in health compared to neuropsychiatric disorders. This framework provided new insights into the orchestrating of brain dynamics in different brain states.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Computational models are often used to assess how functional connectivity (FC) patterns emerge from neuronal population dynamics and anatomical brain connections. It remains unclear whether the commonly used group-averaged data can predict individual FC patterns. The Jansen and Rit neural mass model was employed, where masses were coupled using individual structural connectivity (SC). Simulated FC was correlated to individual magnetoencephalography-derived empirical FC. FC was estimated using phase-based (phase lag index (PLI), phase locking value (PLV)), and amplitude-based (amplitude envelope correlation (AEC)) metrics to analyze their goodness of fit for individual predictions. Individual FC predictions were compared against group-averaged FC predictions, and we tested whether SC of a different participant could equally well predict participants’ FC patterns. The AEC provided a better match between individually simulated and empirical FC than phase-based metrics. Correlations between simulated and empirical FC were higher using individual SC compared to group-averaged SC. Using SC from other participants resulted in similar correlations between simulated and empirical FC compared to using participants’ own SC. This work underlines the added value of FC simulations using individual instead of group-averaged SC for this particular computational model and could aid in a better understanding of mechanisms underlying individual functional network trajectories.Author Summary. Employing the Jansen and Rit neural mass model, we simulated individual FC by using individual SC. The AEC, one of the applied FC metrics, proved to give the highest correlations between simulated and empirical FC. Also, individual SC as compared to group-averaged SC provided higher correlations between simulated and empirical FC. However, using SC from other participants resulted in similar correlations between simulated and empirical FC compared to using participants’ own SC. Importantly, this work underlines the value of individual SC as compared to group-averaged SC to simulate FC. The insights obtained from this work might lead to a better understanding of mechanisms underlying individual functional network trajectories.},

At finer scales, however, each cluster is dissolved, giving way to increasingly refined patterns of co-fluctuations involving specific sets of brain systems. We also find an increase in global co-fluctuation magnitude with hierarchical scale. Finally, we comment on the amount of data needed to estimate co-fluctuation pattern clusters and implications for brain-behavior studies.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of abnormal isoforms of alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is proposed to act as a prion in Parkinson’s disease: In its misfolded pathologic state, it favors the misfolding of normal alpha-synuclein molecules, spreads trans-neuronally, and causes neuronal damage as it accumulates. This theory remains controversial. We have previously developed a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) computational model that simulates the templating, propagation, and toxicity of alpha-synuclein molecules in the brain. In this study, we test this model with longitudinal MRI collected over 4 years from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (1,068 T1 MRI scans, 790 Parkinson’s disease scans, and 278 matched control scans). We find that brain deformation progresses in subcortical and cortical regions. The SIR model recapitulates the spatiotemporal distribution of brain atrophy observed in Parkinson’s disease. We show that connectome topology and geometry significantly contribute to model fit. We also show that the spatial expression of two genes implicated in alpha-synuclein synthesis and clearance, SNCA and GBA, also influences the atrophy pattern. We conclude that the progression of atrophy in Parkinson’s disease is consistent with the prion-like hypothesis and that the SIR model is a promising tool to investigate multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases over time.Author Summary. It has been suggested that neurodegenerative diseases are caused by abnormal generation, propagation, and accumulation of neurotoxic protein isoforms. In the case of Parkinson’s disease, the culprit is alpha-synuclein, which has been shown in animal models to exhibit prion-like properties. We devised a Susceptible-Infected-Removed agent-based model of synucleinopathy, in which we simulate the fates of normal and misfolded alpha-synuclein molecules moving along a brain network. We show that the progression of brain atrophy in Parkinson’s disease over the first 2 years following diagnosis can be simulated by our model. We conclude that the pattern of brain atrophy in Parkinson’s disease is shaped by a combination of the connectome and regional expression of genes that control the clearance and synthesis of alpha-synuclein. Our work supports the prion-like model of neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease.},

Network neuroscience, at the level of macroscale organization of the brain, is beginning to confront the challenges associated with developing a taxonomy of its fundamental explanatory constructs.

The committee conducted a survey to catalog current practices in large-scale brain network nomenclature. A few well-known network names (e.g., default mode network) dominated responses to the survey, and a number of illuminating points of disagreement emerged. We summarize survey results and provide initial considerations and recommendations from the workgroup. This perspective piece includes a selective review of challenges to this enterprise, including (1) network scale, resolution, and hierarchies; (2) interindividual variability of networks; (3) dynamics and nonstationarity of networks; (4) consideration of network affiliations of subcortical structures; and (5) consideration of multimodal information.

  abstract     = {Abstract. A characteristic feature of human cognition is our ability to ‘multi-task’—performing two or more tasks in parallel—particularly when one task is well learned. How the brain supports this capacity remains poorly understood. Most past studies have focussed on identifying the areas of the brain—typically the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—that are required to navigate information-processing bottlenecks. In contrast, we take a systems neuroscience approach to test the hypothesis that the capacity to conduct effective parallel processing relies on a distributed architecture that interconnects the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum. The latter structure contains over half of the neurons in the adult human brain and is well suited to support the fast, effective, dynamic sequences required to perform tasks relatively automatically. By delegating stereotyped within-task computations to the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex can be freed up to focus on the more challenging aspects of performing the tasks in parallel. To test this hypothesis, we analysed task-based fMRI data from 50 participants who performed a task in which they either balanced an avatar on a screen (balance), performed serial-7 subtractions (calculation) or performed both in parallel (dual task). Using a set of approaches that include dimensionality reduction, structure-function coupling, and time-varying functional connectivity, we provide robust evidence in support of our hypothesis. We conclude that distributed interactions between the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are crucially involved in parallel processing in the human brain.Author Summary. How does the brain support the performance of multiple complex tasks, in parallel? The distributed architecture of the cerebellum is ideally placed to interact with the cerebral cortex, creating complex channels for segregated information processing that afford the execution of parallel tasks. Here, we apply time-resolved functional connectivity analyses to functional MRI data collected while individuals performed a dual task that required either balancing, calculating, or the two in tandem. We found robust evidence for distinct patterns of cortico-cerebellar connectivity as a function of task performance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Epilepsy surgery is the treatment of choice for drug-resistant epilepsy patients, but only leads to seizure freedom for roughly two in three patients. To address this problem, we designed a patient-specific epilepsy surgery model combining large-scale magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain networks with an epidemic spreading model. This simple model was enough to reproduce the stereo-tactical electroencephalography (SEEG) seizure propagation patterns of all patients (N = 15), when considering the resection areas (RA) as the epidemic seed. Moreover, the goodness of fit of the model predicted surgical outcome. Once adapted for each patient, the model can generate alternative hypothesis of the seizure onset zone and test different resection strategies in silico. Overall, our findings indicate that spreading models based on patient-specific MEG connectivity can be used to predict surgical outcomes, with better fit results and greater reduction on seizure propagation linked to higher likelihood of seizure freedom after surgery. Finally, we introduced a population model that can be individualized by considering only the patient-specific MEG network, and showed that it not only conserves but improves the group classification. Thus, it may pave the way to generalize this framework to patients without SEEG recordings, reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the stability of the analyses.Author Summary. In this study we showed that epidemic spreading models that utilise patient-specific data of brain connectivity capture the main aspects of seizure propagation as clinically observed via invasive electroencephalography recordings. Moreover, the goodness of fit of the model was associated with the outcome of epilepsy surgery. We used the model to generate alternative hypothesis of the seizure seed regions, and to simulate the effects of the resective surgery that each patient had undergone, and found indications that larger effects of virtual resections in the model may be associated with seizure freedom after the actual surgery. These findings illustrate how individualized computational models may aid epilepsy surgery planning by identifying alternative seed regions and/or resection strategies, with the ultimate goal of improving surgery outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Associations between connectivity networks and behavioral outcomes such as depression are typically examined by comparing average networks between known groups. However, neural heterogeneity within groups may limit the ability to make inferences at the individual level as qualitatively distinct processes across individuals may be obscured in group averages. This study characterizes the heterogeneity of effective connectivity reward networks among 103 early adolescents and examines associations between individualized features and multiple behavioral and clinical outcomes. To characterize network heterogeneity, we used extended unified structural equation modeling to identify effective connectivity networks for each individual and an aggregate network. We found that an aggregate reward network was a poor representation of individuals, with most individual-level networks sharing less than 50\% of the group-level network paths. We then used Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation to identify a group-level network, subgroups of individuals with similar networks, and individual-level networks. We identified three subgroups that appear to reflect differences in network maturity, but this solution had modest validity. Finally, we found numerous associations between individual-specific connectivity features and behavioral reward functioning and risk for substance use disorders. We suggest that accounting for heterogeneity is necessary to use connectivity networks for inferences precise to the individual.Author Summary. Associations between brain connectivity and behavioral phenotypes are typically examined by comparing group averages (e.g., clinical vs. control). This approach presumes that the group-average network reflects individuals. However, if individuals’ network structures are highly heterogenous, averaging across them will create a group-level network that does not generalize to individuals, preventing valid inferences of associations with behavioral differences. Here, we showed that a group-level reward network in early adolescents poorly reflected individuals. We then used GIMME to identify reward network features that were specific to individuals. These network features were associated with multiple reward-related outcomes, including familial risk for substance use disorder (R2 = 31\%). A focus on the individual, rather than groups, may be necessary for valid inferences of individual behavioral differences from fMRI connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Resting-state fMRI is an increasingly popular alternative to task-based fMRI. However, a formal quantification of the amount of information provided by resting-state fMRI as opposed to active task conditions about neural responses is lacking. We conducted a systematic comparison of the quality of inferences derived from a resting-state and a task fMRI paradigm by means of Bayesian Data Comparison. In this framework, data quality is formally quantified in information-theoretic terms as the precision and amount of information provided by the data on the parameters of interest. Parameters of effective connectivity, estimated from the cross-spectral densities of resting-state- and task time series by means of dynamic causal modelling (DCM), were subjected to the analysis. Data from 50 individuals undergoing resting-state and a Theory-of-Mind task were compared, both datasets provided by the Human Connectome Project. A threshold of very strong evidence was reached in favour of the Theory-of-Mind task (&amp;gt;10 bits or natural units) regarding information gain, which could be attributed to the active task condition eliciting stronger effective connectivity. Extending these analyses to other tasks and cognitive systems will reveal whether the superior informative value of task-based fMRI observed here is case specific or a more general trend.Author Summary. The ongoing replication crisis in neuroscience and the concurrent “paradigm shift” from task-based to resting-state fMRI raises a question about the relative quality of the data obtained from these imaging paradigms. We compared parameters of intrinsic effective connectivity estimated from resting-state and Theory-of-Mind datasets. The much weaker connectivity and consequent lower information gain of the resting condition was notable as the network was specified based on connectivity patterns observed under rest and consisted of regions associated with the default mode network, which is characterized by being active during rest. These results support the assumption that the resting connectivity of the default mode network may reflect physiological rather than neural processes, and that the neural system in question better lends itself to investigation under an active task condition.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sleep spindles are associated with the beginning of deep sleep and memory consolidation and are disrupted in schizophrenia and autism. In primates, distinct core and matrix thalamocortical (TC) circuits regulate sleep spindle activity through communications that are filtered by the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN); however, little is known about typical TC network interactions and the mechanisms that are disrupted in brain disorders. We developed a primate-specific, circuit-based TC computational model with distinct core and matrix loops that can simulate sleep spindles. We implemented novel multilevel cortical and thalamic mixing, and included local thalamic inhibitory interneurons, and direct layer 5 projections of variable density to TRN and thalamus to investigate the functional consequences of different ratios of core and matrix node connectivity contribution to spindle dynamics. Our simulations showed that spindle power in primates can be modulated based on the level of cortical feedback, thalamic inhibition, and engagement of model core versus matrix, with the latter having a greater role in spindle dynamics. The study of the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of core-, matrix-, and mix-generated sleep spindles establishes a framework to study disruption of TC circuit balance underlying deficits in sleep and attentional gating seen in autism and schizophrenia.Author Summary. Sleep spindles are slow brain oscillations that are associated with the beginning of deep sleep, learning, and memory storage and are disrupted in brain disorders. We developed a computational model that can simulate sleep spindles in humans, using novel data on the organization and connectivity of circuits that link the thalamus and cortex, and generate spindles. Our model sheds light on the role of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the network dynamics and the functional consequences of differential engagement and connectivity of thalamic and cortical areas involved in typical brain function. Our work also establishes a framework for the future study of the dynamics of variable types of sleep spindles and their disruption that can lead to deficits in sleep, memory, and attention.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Ensembles of neurons are thought to be coactive when participating in brain computations. However, it is unclear what principles determine whether an ensemble remains localised within a single brain region, or spans multiple brain regions. To address this, we analysed electrophysiological neural population data from hundreds of neurons recorded simultaneously across nine brain regions in awake mice. At fast subsecond timescales, spike count correlations between pairs of neurons in the same brain region were stronger than for pairs of neurons spread across different brain regions. In contrast at slower timescales, within- and between-region spike count correlations were similar. Correlations between high-firing-rate neuron pairs showed a stronger dependence on timescale than low-firing-rate neuron pairs. We applied an ensemble detection algorithm to the neural correlation data and found that at fast timescales each ensemble was mostly contained within a single brain region, whereas at slower timescales ensembles spanned multiple brain regions. These results suggest that the mouse brain may perform fast-local and slow-global computations in parallel.Author Summary. In this study we analysed publicly available neural population electrophysiology data from nine brain regions in awake mice. To discover neural ensembles, we applied community detection algorithms to the spike count correlation matrices estimated from the data. We repeated the analysis at different timescales, ranging from 10 milliseconds to 3 seconds. We found that at fast timescales &amp;lt; 1 s, neural ensembles tended to be localised within single brain regions. In contrast at slower timescales of &amp;gt; 1 s, ensembles tended to include neurons spread across multiple brain regions. Most of this effect was due to high-firing-rate neurons.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Parkinson’s disease (PD) can affect speech as well as emotion processing. We employ whole-brain graph-theoretical network analysis to determine how the speech-processing network (SPN) changes in PD, and assess its susceptibility to emotional distraction. Functional magnetic resonance images of 14 patients (aged 59.6 ± 10.1 years, 5 female) and 23 healthy controls (aged 64.1 ± 6.5 years, 12 female) were obtained during a picture-naming task. Pictures were supraliminally primed by face pictures showing either a neutral or an emotional expression. PD network metrics were significantly decreased (mean nodal degree, p &amp;lt; 0.0001; mean nodal strength, p &amp;lt; 0.0001; global network efficiency, p &amp;lt; 0.002; mean clustering coefficient, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), indicating an impairment of network integration and segregation. There was an absence of connector hubs in PD. Controls exhibited key network hubs located in the associative cortices, of which most were insusceptible to emotional distraction. The PD SPN had more key network hubs, which were more disorganized and shifted into auditory, sensory, and motor cortices after emotional distraction. The whole-brain SPN in PD undergoes changes that result in (a) decreased network integration and segregation, (b) a modularization of information flow within the network, and (c) the inclusion of primary and secondary cortical areas after emotional distraction.Author Summary. Parkinson’s disease (PD) features a variety of motor and nonmotor symptoms, which relate to changes in functional brain connectivity. This study investigated how the whole-brain speech production network (SPN) is affected by PD. The paradigm included an emotional distraction component to assess the SPN’s susceptibility to an emotional influence. The SPN was found to be less integrated and less segregated in PD than in healthy controls. Emotional distraction had a greater effect on the SPN in PD than in healthy controls. Key nodes for information flow (network pillars) were mainly located in associative cortices. They were robust against emotional distraction in healthy controls, but shifted to primary and secondary cortical areas in PD.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. While our understanding of the way single neurons process chromatic stimuli in the early visual pathway has advanced significantly in recent years, we do not yet know how these cells interact to form stable representations of hue. Drawing on physiological studies, we offer a dynamical model of how the primary visual cortex tunes for color, hinged on intracortical interactions and emergent network effects. After detailing the evolution of network activity through analytical and numerical approaches, we discuss the effects of the model’s cortical parameters on the selectivity of the tuning curves. In particular, we explore the role of the model’s thresholding nonlinearity in enhancing hue selectivity by expanding the region of stability, allowing for the precise encoding of chromatic stimuli in early vision. Finally, in the absence of a stimulus, the model is capable of explaining hallucinatory color perception via a Turing-like mechanism of biological pattern formation.Author Summary. We present a model of color processing in which intracortical neuronal dynamics within the visual cortex serve as the substrate for hue perception. Our analytical and numerical treatments of the emergent behavior seek to characterize the population dynamics underlying chromatic processing within the visual cortex, as well the roles of the various cortical parameters in determining the selectivity of the steady-state network response. We show that the system is self-organizing, capable of encoding stable representations of hue regardless of the stimulus strength, and generating spontaneous color hallucinations in the absence of any input.},

Computations are reflected by patterns of coactivity between neurons. Using pairwise spike time statistics, coactivity can be summarized as a functional network (FN). Here, we show that the structure of FNs constructed from an instructed-delay reach task in nonhuman primates is behaviorally specific: Low-dimensional embedding and graph alignment scores show that FNs constructed from closer target reach directions are also closer in network space. Using short intervals across a trial, we constructed temporal FNs and found that temporal FNs traverse a low-dimensional subspace in a reach-specific trajectory. Alignment scores show that FNs become separable and correspondingly decodable shortly after the Instruction cue. Finally, we observe that reciprocal connections in FNs transiently decrease following the Instruction cue, consistent with the hypothesis that information external to the recorded population temporarily alters the structure of the network at this moment.Author Summary. It remains unclear how motor cortical neurons flexibly perform the computations necessary to generate movement. We hypothesized that neuronal coactivity contains movement information, and its dynamics can reveal how the population switches computations during a task. We quantified coactivity as a functional network (FN) with single neurons as nodes and population coactivity as directed weighted edges. We also constructed FNs within short epochs across a trial to determine when coactivity begins to carry information and to investigate the dynamic structure of these interactions. Following the Instruction cue, reciprocal connections in FNs transiently decrease, and shortly after, FNs become maximally decodable for reach direction.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Large variability exists across brain regions in health and disease, considering their cellular and molecular composition, connectivity, and function. Large-scale whole-brain models comprising coupled brain regions provide insights into the underlying dynamics that shape complex patterns of spontaneous brain activity. In particular, biophysically grounded mean-field whole-brain models in the asynchronous regime were used to demonstrate the dynamical consequences of including regional variability. Nevertheless, the role of heterogeneities when brain dynamics are supported by synchronous oscillating state, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon in brain, remains poorly understood. Here, we implemented two models capable of presenting oscillatory behavior with different levels of abstraction: a phenomenological Stuart–Landau model and an exact mean-field model. The fit of these models informed by structural- to functional-weighted MRI signal (T1w/T2w) allowed us to explore the implication of the inclusion of heterogeneities for modeling resting-state fMRI recordings from healthy participants. We found that disease-specific regional functional heterogeneity imposed dynamical consequences within the oscillatory regime in fMRI recordings from neurodegeneration with specific impacts on brain atrophy/structure (Alzheimer’s patients). Overall, we found that models with oscillations perform better when structural and functional regional heterogeneities are considered, showing that phenomenological and biophysical models behave similarly at the brink of the Hopf bifurcation.Author Summary. Significant progress has been made in understanding the effects of regional heterogeneity on whole-brain dynamics. With imaging technologies, the number of high-resolution reference maps of brain structure and function has been increased, and whole-brain computational models have provided a suitable avenue to investigate the mechanisms supporting the relations between these maps and whole-brain dynamics. Here, we investigate the role of the heterogeneities when synchronous behavior is present in brain dynamics, which we could represent by models capable of oscillating in the presence of a Hopf bifurcation. We found that models with oscillations more faithfully reproduce empirical properties when structural and functional regional heterogeneities are considered, showing that both phenomenological and biophysical models behave similarly at the brink of the Hopf bifurcation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The human brain structural network is thought to be shaped by the optimal trade-off between cost and efficiency. However, most studies on this problem have focused on only the trade-off between cost and global efficiency (i.e., integration) and have overlooked the efficiency of segregated processing (i.e., segregation), which is essential for specialized information processing. Direct evidence on how trade-offs among cost, integration, and segregation shape the human brain network remains lacking. Here, adopting local efficiency and modularity as segregation factors, we used a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to investigate this problem. We defined three trade-off models, which represented trade-offs between cost and integration (Dual-factor model), and trade-offs among cost, integration, and segregation (local efficiency or modularity; Tri-factor model), respectively. Among these, synthetic networks with optimal trade-off among cost, integration, and modularity (Tri-factor model [Q]) showed the best performance. They had a high recovery rate of structural connections and optimal performance in most network features, especially in segregated processing capacity and network robustness. Morphospace of this trade-off model could further capture the variation of individual behavioral/demographic characteristics in a domain-specific manner. Overall, our results highlight the importance of modularity in the formation of the human brain structural network and provide new insights into the original cost-efficiency trade-off hypothesis.Author Summary.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Human learning is an active and complex process. However, the brain mechanisms underlying human skill learning and the effect of learning on the communication between brain regions, at different frequency bands, are still largely unknown. Here, we tracked changes in large-scale electrophysiological networks over a 6-week training period during which participants practiced a series of motor sequences during 30 home training sessions. Our findings showed that brain networks become more flexible with learning in all the frequency bands from theta to gamma ranges. We found consistent increase of flexibility in the prefrontal and limbic areas in the theta and alpha band, and over somatomotor and visual areas in the alpha band. Specific to the beta rhythm, we revealed that higher flexibility of prefrontal regions during the early stage of learning strongly correlated with better performance measured during home training sessions. Our findings provide novel evidence that prolonged motor skill practice results in higher, frequency-specific, temporal variability in brain network structure.Author Summary. We investigated the large-scale organization of electrophysiological brain networks of a cohort of 30 participants practicing a series of motor sequences during 6 weeks of training. With learning, we observed a progressive modulation of the dynamics of prefrontal and limbic regions from theta to alpha frequencies, and of centro-parietal and occipital regions within visuomotor networks in the alpha band. In addition, higher prefrontal regional flexibility during early practice correlated with learning occurring during the 6 weeks of training. This provides novel evidence of a frequency-specific reorganization of brain networks with prolonged motor skill learning and an important neural basis for noninvasive research into the role of cortical functional interactions in (visuo)motor learning.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The dynamic integration of sensory and bodily signals is central to adaptive behaviour. Although the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior insular cortex (AIC) play key roles in this process, their context-dependent dynamic interactions remain unclear. Here, we studied the spectral features and interplay of these two brain regions using high-fidelity intracranial-EEG recordings from five patients (ACC: 13 contacts, AIC: 14 contacts) acquired during movie viewing with validation analyses performed on an independent resting intracranial-EEG dataset. ACC and AIC both showed a power peak and positive functional connectivity in the gamma (30–35 Hz) frequency while this power peak was absent in the resting data. We then used a neurobiologically informed computational model investigating dynamic effective connectivity asking how it linked to the movie’s perceptual (visual, audio) features and the viewer’s heart rate variability (HRV). Exteroceptive features related to effective connectivity of ACC highlighting its crucial role in processing ongoing sensory information. AIC connectivity was related to HRV and audio emphasising its core role in dynamically linking sensory and bodily signals. Our findings provide new evidence for complementary, yet dissociable, roles of neural dynamics between the ACC and the AIC in supporting brain-body interactions during an emotional experience.Author Summary. Naturalistic stimulus such as movies provide an optimal platform to study time-resolved neural interactions supporting integration of sensory and bodily information. Here, we obtain intracranial recordings from anterior insular cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex while participants (undergoing clinical evaluation for epilepsy) viewed a short movie capable of eliciting robust physiological responses. We first characterise the spectral properties with subsequent model driven approach to probe moment-to-moment neural interactions between the anterior insular cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings highlight how this neural system plays a key role in linking the contextual integration of sensory information with that of internal body status.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Quantifying the relationship between the brain’s functional activity patterns and its structural backbone is crucial when relating the severity of brain pathology to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Network control theory (NCT) characterizes the brain’s energetic landscape using the structural connectome and patterns of brain activity over time. We applied NCT to investigate brain-state dynamics and energy landscapes in controls and people with MS (pwMS). We also computed entropy of brain activity and investigated its association with the dynamic landscape’s transition energy and lesion volume. Brain states were identified by clustering regional brain activity vectors, and NCT was applied to compute the energy required to transition between these brain states. We found that entropy was negatively correlated with lesion volume and transition energy, and that larger transition energies were associated with pwMS with disability. This work supports the notion that shifts in the pattern of brain activity in pwMS without disability results in decreased transition energies compared to controls, but, as this shift evolves over the disease, transition energies increase beyond controls and disability occurs. Our results provide the first evidence in pwMS that larger lesion volumes result in greater transition energy between brain states and decreased entropy of brain activity.Author Summary. We investigated the brain-state dynamic and energy landscapes in healthy individuals and people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). We also investigated the entropy of brain activity and its association with transition energy between brain states and lesion volume. We clustered regional brain activity time series to identify the brain states. Then, we applied network control theory using structural connectivity network to identify the minimum required energy to transition between brain states. We observed the pwMS without disability showed decreased transition energy, while pwMS with evidence of disability showed increased transition energy compared to healthy individuals. Lower entropy of brain activity was associated with greater lesion load and larger transition energy. This study provides a possible mechanism of how MS-related damage to the brain’s structural backbone can impact brain dynamics, entropy, and energetics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Graph matching algorithms attempt to find the best correspondence between the nodes of two networks. These techniques have been used to match individual neurons in nanoscale connectomes—in particular, to find pairings of neurons across hemispheres. However, since graph matching techniques deal with two isolated networks, they have only utilized the ipsilateral (same hemisphere) subgraphs when performing the matching. Here, we present a modification to a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm that allows it to solve what we call the bisected graph matching problem. This modification allows us to leverage the connections between the brain hemispheres when predicting neuron pairs. Via simulations and experiments on real connectome datasets, we show that this approach improves matching accuracy when sufficient edge correlation is present between the contralateral (between hemisphere) subgraphs. We also show how matching accuracy can be further improved by combining our approach with previously proposed extensions to graph matching, which utilize edge types and previously known neuron pairings. We expect that our proposed method will improve future endeavors to accurately match neurons across hemispheres in connectomes, and be useful in other applications where the bisected graph matching problem arises.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Loneliness is associated with differences in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within and between large-scale networks in early- and middle-aged adult cohorts. However, age-related changes in associations between sociality and brain function into late adulthood are not well understood. Here, we examined age differences in the association between two dimensions of sociality—loneliness and empathic responding—and RSFC of the cerebral cortex. Self-report measures of loneliness and empathy were inversely related across the entire sample of younger (mean age = 22.6y, n = 128) and older (mean age = 69.0y, n = 92) adults. Using multivariate analyses of multi-echo fMRI RSFC, we identified distinct functional connectivity patterns for individual and age group differences associated with loneliness and empathic responding. Loneliness in young and empathy in both age groups was related to greater visual network integration with association networks (e.g., default, fronto-parietal control). In contrast, loneliness was positively related to within- and between-network integration of association networks for older adults. These results extend our previous findings in early- and middle-aged cohorts, demonstrating that brain systems associated with loneliness, as well as empathy, differ in older age. Further, the findings suggest that these two aspects of social experience engage different neurocognitive processes across human life-span development.Author Summary. Feelings of loneliness emerge when a person’s desire or need for an interpersonal relationship is unmet. This state of perceived social isolation can influence social-cognitive processes that are critical for connecting with others, such as empathy. Neuroimaging studies have shown diverging functional connectivity patterns among functional brain networks between lonely younger and middle-aged adults. Here, we take a targeted approach to directly assess age-related differences in functional connectivity associated with loneliness and empathic responding in younger and older adults. We find evidence that individual differences in functional connectivity related to loneliness and empathic responding differ with age. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying these associations and their implications for brain and social functioning across the adult life-span.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Beyond the established effects of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in reducing motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease, recent evidence has highlighted the effect on non-motor symptoms. However, the impact of STN-DBS on disseminated networks remains unclear. This study aimed to perform a quantitative evaluation of network-specific modulation induced by STN-DBS using Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA). We calculated the occupancy of resting-state networks (RSNs) in functional MRI data from 10 patients with Parkinson’s disease implanted with STN-DBS and statistically compared between ON and OFF conditions. STN-DBS was found to specifically modulate the occupancy of networks overlapping with limbic RSNs. STN-DBS significantly increased the occupancy of an orbitofrontal limbic subsystem with respect to both DBS OFF (p = 0.0057) and 49 age-matched healthy controls (p = 0.0033). Occupancy of a diffuse limbic RSN was increased with STN-DBS OFF when compared with healthy controls (p = 0.021), but not when STN-DBS was ON, which indicates rebalancing of this network. These results highlight the modulatory effect of STN-DBS on components of the limbic system, particularly within the orbitofrontal cortex, a structure associated with reward processing. These results reinforce the value of quantitative biomarkers of RSN activity in evaluating the disseminated impact of brain stimulation techniques and the personalization of therapeutic strategies.Author Summary. This article addresses a burning question regarding stimulation strategies to rebalance brain network dynamics. Using a rare fMRI dataset of Parkinson’s disease patients implanted with deep brain stimulation, we report evidence of network-specific modulatory effects in the dynamics of resting-state networks. In summary, we found that Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA) successfully identified all seven reference resting-state networks in participants with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). In particular, STN-DBS increases resting-state orbitofrontal cortex activity. STN-DBS also normalizes wider resting-state limbic network activity, and this correlated with depressive symptoms in pre- and post-operative assessments. The work is limited by a low number of participants, and the retrospective nature of this work, but provides evidence that STN-DBS modulates limbic network occupancy in real time.},

Second, it presents a solution to promote accurate plots through its integration with TemplateFlow.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Characterizing large-scale dynamic organization of the brain relies on both data-driven and mechanistic modeling, which demands a low versus high level of prior knowledge and assumptions about how constituents of the brain interact. However, the conceptual translation between the two is not straightforward. The present work aims to provide a bridge between data-driven and mechanistic modeling. We conceptualize brain dynamics as a complex landscape that is continuously modulated by internal and external changes. The modulation can induce transitions between one stable brain state (attractor) to another. Here, we provide a novel method—Temporal Mapper—built upon established tools from the field of topological data analysis to retrieve the network of attractor transitions from time series data alone. For theoretical validation, we use a biophysical network model to induce transitions in a controlled manner, which provides simulated time series equipped with a ground-truth attractor transition network. Our approach reconstructs the ground-truth transition network from simulated time series data better than existing time-varying approaches. For empirical relevance, we apply our approach to fMRI data gathered during a continuous multitask experiment. We found that occupancy of the high-degree nodes and cycles of the transition network was significantly associated with subjects’ behavioral performance. Taken together, we provide an important first step toward integrating data-driven and mechanistic modeling of brain dynamics.Author Summary. Brain dynamics are often described by data-driven models or mechanistic dynamical systems models to understand how specific brain states persist or change (transition). However, there lacks a computational framework that explicitly connects states/transitions discovered by data-driven methods to those of mechanistic models, leading to a disconnection between data analysis and theoretical modeling. To begin bridging this gap, we develop a data-driven method, the Temporal Mapper, to extract dynamical systems features from time series and represent them as attractor transition networks. The Temporal Mapper can reconstruct ground-truth transition networks of mechanistic models. When applied to human fMRI data, the method helps predict behavioral performance from the topology of transition networks. Potential applications include characterizing brain dynamic organization in health and diseases and designing brain stimulation protocols.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. While correlations in the BOLD fMRI signal are widely used to capture functional connectivity (FC) and its changes across contexts, its interpretation is often ambiguous. The entanglement of multiple factors including local coupling of two neighbors and nonlocal inputs from the rest of the network (affecting one or both regions) limits the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn from correlation measures alone. Here we present a method of estimating the contribution of nonlocal network input to FC changes across different contexts. To disentangle the effect of task-induced coupling change from the network input change, we propose a new metric, “communication change,” utilizing BOLD signal correlation and variance. With a combination of simulation and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that (1) input from the rest of the network accounts for a moderate but significant amount of task-induced FC change and (2) the proposed “communication change” is a promising candidate for tracking the local coupling in task context-induced change. Additionally, when compared to FC change across three different tasks, communication change can better discriminate specific task types. Taken together, this novel index of local coupling may have many applications in improving our understanding of local and widespread interactions across large-scale functional networks.},

It is applicable whenever the goal is to compare two sets of unweighted graphs and to determine differences in the processes that generate them. We provide an extension of the method to dependent graph generating processes as they occur, for example, in within-subject experimental designs. Furthermore, we present an extensive investigation of the error-statistical properties of the method in simulation using Erdős-Rényi models and in empirical data in order to derive practical recommendations for the application of subgraph mining in neuroscience. In particular, we perform an empirical power analysis for transfer entropy networks inferred from resting-state MEG data comparing autism spectrum patients with neurotypical controls. Finally, we provide a Python implementation as part of the openly available IDTxl toolbox.Author Summary. A key objective of neuroscientifc research is to determine how different parts of the brain are connected. The end result of such investigations is always a graph consisting of nodes corresponding to brain regions or nerve cells and edges between the nodes indicating if they are connected or not. The connections may be structural (an actual anatomical connection) but can also be functional, meaning that there is a statistical dependency between the activity in one part of the brain and the activity in another. A prime example of the latter type of connection would be the information flow between brain areas. Differences in the patterns of connectivity are likely to be responsible for and indicative of various neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders. It is therefore important that efficient methods to detect such differences are available. The key problem in developing methods for comparing patterns of connectivity is that there is generally a vast number of different patterns (it can easily exceed the number of stars in the milky way). In this paper we describe how the recently developed method of significant subgraph mining accounts for this problem and how it can be usefully employed in neuroscientific research.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Despite great progress in uncovering the complex connectivity patterns of the human brain over the last two decades, the field of connectomics still experiences a bias in its viewpoint of the cerebral cortex. Due to a lack of information regarding exact end points of fiber tracts inside cortical gray matter, the cortex is commonly reduced to a single homogenous unit. Concurrently, substantial developments have been made over the past decade in the use of relaxometry and particularly inversion recovery imaging for exploring the laminar microstructure of cortical gray matter. In recent years, these developments have culminated in an automated framework for cortical laminar composition analysis and visualization, followed by studies of cortical dyslamination in epilepsy patients and age-related differences in laminar composition in healthy subjects. This perspective summarizes the developments and remaining challenges of multi-T1 weighted imaging of cortical laminar substructure, the current limitations in structural connectomics, and the recent progress in integrating these fields into a new model-based subfield termed ‘laminar connectomics’. In the coming years, we predict an increased use of similar generalizable, data-driven models in connectomics with the purpose of integrating multimodal MRI datasets and providing a more nuanced and detailed characterization of brain connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Aging is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, with considerable societal and economic implications. Healthy aging is accompanied by changes in functional connectivity between and within resting-state functional networks, which have been associated with cognitive decline. However, there is no consensus on the impact of sex on these age-related functional trajectories. Here, we show that multilayer measures provide crucial information on the interaction between sex and age on network topology, allowing for better assessment of cognitive, structural, and cardiovascular risk factors that have been shown to differ between men and women, as well as providing additional insights into the genetic influences on changes in functional connectivity that occur during aging. In a large cross-sectional sample of 37,543 individuals from the UK Biobank cohort, we demonstrate that such multilayer measures that capture the relationship between positive and negative connections are more sensitive to sex-related changes in the whole-brain connectivity patterns and their topological architecture throughout aging, when compared to standard connectivity and topological measures. Our findings indicate that multilayer measures contain previously unknown information on the relationship between sex and age, which opens up new avenues for research into functional brain connectivity in aging.Author Summary. Alterations in the resting-state functional connectivity patterns are a hallmark of the aging process. However, there is little agreement on how sex affects these age-related functional trajectories. Here, we propose novel multilayer measures that capture the relationship between positive and negative connections. We show that they are more sensitive to sex-related changes in the whole-brain connectivity patterns and their topology throughout aging, when compared to standard connectivity and topological measures. Our results suggest that multilayer measures provide information on the interaction between sex and age that has not been previously explored, which leads to a more accurate evaluation of cognitive, structural, and cardiovascular risk factors, and provides new insights into the genetic influences on changes in functional connectivity that occur throughout aging.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Characterizing a particular neurodegenerative condition against others possible diseases remains a challenge along clinical, biomarker, and neuroscientific levels. This is the particular case of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) variants, where their specific characterization requires high levels of expertise and multidisciplinary teams to subtly distinguish among similar physiopathological processes. Here, we used a computational approach of multimodal brain networks to address simultaneous multiclass classification of 298 subjects (one group against all others), including five FTD variants: behavioral variant FTD, corticobasal syndrome, nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, with healthy controls. Fourteen machine learning classifiers were trained with functional and structural connectivity metrics calculated through different methods. Due to the large number of variables, dimensionality was reduced, employing statistical comparisons and progressive elimination to assess feature stability under nested cross-validation. The machine learning performance was measured through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, reaching 0.81 on average, with a standard deviation of 0.09. Furthermore, the contributions of demographic and cognitive data were also assessed via multifeatured classifiers. An accurate simultaneous multiclass classification of each FTD variant against other variants and controls was obtained based on the selection of an optimum set of features. The classifiers incorporating the brain’s network and cognitive assessment increased performance metrics. Multimodal classifiers evidenced specific variants’ compromise, across modalities and methods through feature importance analysis. If replicated and validated, this approach may help to support clinical decision tools aimed to detect specific affectations in the context of overlapping diseases.Author Summary. The distinction of a neurodegenerative condition against multiple related diseases simultaneously, with overlapping features and high levels of heterogeneity in behavioral, clinical, and neuropathological markers, remains a challenge. Here, we combined structural and functional connectivity markers with diverse methods including graph theory and cognitive markers to perform a multiclass classification of five FTD variants. An optimum set of features was obtained through progressive feature elimination by removing redundant and uninformative variables. Our results for the simultaneous multiclass categorization of each FTD variant and healthy controls achieved a performance up to an area under the curve of 0.95. This approach can help develop clinical decision support tools to detect specific affectations in the context of overlapping neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Executive functioning (EF) is a higher order cognitive process that is thought to depend on a network organization facilitating integration across subnetworks, in the context of which the central role of the fronto-parietal network (FPN) has been described across imaging and neurophysiological modalities. However, the potentially complementary unimodal information on the relevance of the FPN for EF has not yet been integrated. We employ a multilayer framework to allow for integration of different modalities into one ‘network of networks.’ We used diffusion MRI, resting-state functional MRI, MEG, and neuropsychological data obtained from 33 healthy adults to construct modality-specific single-layer networks as well as a single multilayer network per participant. We computed single-layer and multilayer eigenvector centrality of the FPN as a measure of integration in this network and examined their associations with EF. We found that higher multilayer FPN centrality, but not single-layer FPN centrality, was related to better EF. We did not find a statistically significant change in explained variance in EF when using the multilayer approach as compared to the single-layer measures. Overall, our results show the importance of FPN integration for EF and underline the promise of the multilayer framework toward better understanding cognitive functioning.Author Summary. Until now, the relationship between brain network topology and cognition has mostly been studied using isolated modal information (e.g., functional MRI or magnetoencephalography). Such isolated analyses ignore potentially complementary information. Here, we use multimodal imaging and neuropsychological data collected from healthy adults to demonstrate that increased centrality of the fronto-parietal network in a multilayer network is related to better executive functioning. We find no such relation for single-layer networks. These results show the importance of fronto-parietal network integration for executive functioning, as well as the value of a multilayer framework in network analyses of the brain.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a functionally relevant, quantitative characterization of the neural circuitry of Drosophila melanogaster at the mesoscopic level of neuron types as classified exclusively based on potential network connectivity. Starting from a large neuron-to-neuron brain-wide connectome of the fruit fly, we use stochastic block modeling and spectral graph clustering to group neurons together into a common “cell class” if they connect to neurons of other classes according to the same probability distributions. We then characterize the connectivity-based cell classes with standard neuronal biomarkers, including neurotransmitters, developmental birthtimes, morphological features, spatial embedding, and functional anatomy. Mutual information indicates that connectivity-based classification reveals aspects of neurons that are not adequately captured by traditional classification schemes. Next, using graph theoretic and random walk analyses to identify neuron classes as hubs, sources, or destinations, we detect pathways and patterns of directional connectivity that potentially underpin specific functional interactions in the Drosophila brain. We uncover a core of highly interconnected dopaminergic cell classes functioning as the backbone communication pathway for multisensory integration. Additional predicted pathways pertain to the facilitation of circadian rhythmic activity, spatial orientation, fight-or-flight response, and olfactory learning. Our analysis provides experimentally testable hypotheses critically deconstructing complex brain function from organized connectomic architecture.Author Summary. The potential synaptic circuitry of a neural system constitutes the fundamental architectural underpinning of its in vivo dynamics, plasticity, and functions. The fruit fly neural circuit presented here captures the latent stochastic patterns of network connectivity and provides a fundamental parts list for reverse engineering brain computation. Mapping the interactions among connectivity-based neuronal classes to development, morphology, physiology, and transcriptomics result in testable hypotheses on the relationship between whole-brain neural architecture and behavior.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Neural systems are shaped by multiple constraints, balancing region communication with the cost of establishing and maintaining physical connections. It has been suggested that the lengths of neural projections be minimized, reducing their spatial and metabolic impact on the organism. However, long-range connections are prevalent in the connectomes across various species, and thus, rather than rewiring connections to reduce length, an alternative theory proposes that the brain minimizes total wiring length through a suitable positioning of regions, termed component placement optimization. Previous studies in nonhuman primates have refuted this idea by identifying a nonoptimal component placement, where a spatial rearrangement of brain regions in silico leads to a reduced total wiring length. Here, for the first time in humans, we test for component placement optimization. We show a nonoptimal component placement for all subjects in our sample from the Human Connectome Project (N = 280; aged 22–30 years; 138 females), suggesting the presence of constraints—such as the reduction of processing steps between regions—that compete with the elevated spatial and metabolic costs. Additionally, by simulating communication between brain regions, we argue that this suboptimal component placement supports dynamics that benefit cognition.Author Summary. The anatomical organization of the brain is shaped by competing constraints for improving brain function while reducing the costs for connectome wiring. Concerning this trade-off, we find that regions within the human brain are not positioned to minimize the total length of their connections. This nonoptimal organization is mainly attributed to frontal and occipital/parietal lobes, with connections between them acting as shortcuts allowing distant brain areas to communicate. By using a model of brain activity, we argue that this suboptimal spatial arrangement of the connectome promotes fluctuations in brain activity, enabling the brain to undertake flexible behavioral responses. Altogether, this highlights that brain structure, while spatially suboptimal, may offer dynamic advantages that support effective cognition.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The analysis of the resting-state functional connectome commonly relies on graph representations. However, the graph-based approach is restricted to pairwise interactions, not suitable to capture high-order interactions, that is, more than two regions. This work investigates the existence of cycles of synchronization emerging at the individual level in the resting-state fMRI dynamic. These cycles or loops correspond to more than three regions interacting in pairs surrounding a closed space in the resting dynamic. We devised a strategy for characterizing these loops on the fMRI resting state using persistent homology, a data analysis strategy based on topology aimed to characterize high-order connectivity features robustly. This approach describes the loops exhibited at the individual level on a population of 198 healthy controls. Results suggest that these synchronization cycles emerge robustly across different connectivity scales. In addition, these high-order features seem to be supported by a particular anatomical substrate. These topological loops constitute evidence of resting-state high-order arrangements of interaction hidden on classical pairwise models. These cycles may have implications for the synchronization mechanisms commonly described in the resting state.Author Summary. Functional connectivity describes relationships between brain regions that are based on graph representations. Graph-based approaches are limited to pairwise interactions, which are not suitable for describing higher order interactions and meaningful topological structures such as loops and voids. This work uses persistent homology to investigate the existence of synchronization loops arising at the individual level in resting-state fMRI. These loops correspond to more than three regions interacting in pairs surrounding a closed space. Our results indicate that these loops emerge across different scales of connectivity that appear to be supported by a particular anatomical substrate; moreover, they provide a kind of evidence for higher order arrangements of interactions that seem to have implications for the described synchronization mechanisms in the resting state.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The link between brain structural connectivity and schizotypy was explored in two healthy participant cohorts, collected at two different neuroimaging centres, comprising 140 and 115 participants, respectively. The participants completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), through which their schizotypy scores were calculated. Diffusion-MRI data were used to perform tractography and to generate the structural brain networks of the participants. The edges of the networks were weighted with the inverse radial diffusivity. Graph theoretical metrics of the default mode, sensorimotor, visual, and auditory subnetworks were derived and their correlation coefficients with the schizotypy scores were calculated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that graph theoretical measures of structural brain networks are investigated in relation to schizotypy. A positive correlation was found between the schizotypy score and the mean node degree and mean clustering coefficient of the sensorimotor and the default mode subnetworks. The nodes driving these correlations were the right postcentral gyrus, the left paracentral lobule, the right superior frontal gyrus, the left parahippocampal gyrus, and the bilateral precuneus, that is, nodes that exhibit compromised functional connectivity in schizophrenia. Implications for schizophrenia and schizotypy are discussed.Author Summary. We investigated the topological organisation of the structural brain networks, derived via tractography, of healthy participants with varying schizotypy scores, in two independent cohorts comprising 140 and 115 participants, respectively. In order to capture the possible impact of myelination or axonal density on the structural networks, we used the inverse radial diffusivity as the edge weight. We observed that participants with the higher schizotypy scores exhibited higher node degree and clustering coefficient in the sensorimotor and default mode networks. This provides evidence of stronger structural connectivity in participants with higher schizotypy, which could indicate a possible protective mechanism against schizophrenia, or imply that structural alterations observed in schizophrenia are a correlate or consequence of the disease rather than its cause.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. There is a paucity of graph theoretic methods applied to task-based data in schizophrenia (SCZ). Tasks are useful for modulating brain network dynamics, and topology. Understanding how changes in task conditions impact inter-group differences in topology can elucidate unstable network characteristics in SCZ. Here, in a group of patients and healthy controls (n = 59 total, 32 SCZ), we used an associative learning task with four distinct conditions (Memory Formation, Post-Encoding Consolidation, Memory Retrieval, and Post-Retrieval Consolidation) to induce network dynamics. From the acquired fMRI time series data, betweenness centrality (BC), a metric of a node’s integrative value was used to summarize network topology in each condition. Patients showed (a) differences in BC across multiple nodes and conditions; (b) decreased BC in more integrative nodes, but increased BC in less integrative nodes; (c) discordant node ranks in each of the conditions; and (d) complex patterns of stability and instability of node ranks across conditions. These analyses reveal that task conditions induce highly variegated patterns of network dys-organization in SCZ. We suggest that the dys-connection syndrome that is schizophrenia, is a contextually evoked process, and that the tools of network neuroscience should be oriented toward elucidating the limits of this dys-connection.Author Summary. This paper demonstrates disordered network repertoires in schizophrenia during learning and memory. Graph theoretic analysis was applied to fMRI data collected during four distinct phases of a learning paradigm, to capture network repertoires. We show that the network topology changes across conditions, and that brain nodes peripheral to learning assumed greater importance in schizophrenia. Moreover, nodes with highly stable contributions to network topology were aberrantly localized to early sensory cortex in schizophrenia, but distributed across the brain in healthy participants. These results highlight the dynamic nature of the dys-connection syndrome, emphasizing the value of studying task-induced network topology in schizophrenia in conjunction with graph theoretic metrics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Graph theoretical analysis of the structural connectome has been employed successfully to characterize brain network alterations in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, heterogeneity in neuropathology is a well-known issue in the TBI population, such that group comparisons of patients against controls are confounded by within-group variability. Recently, novel single-subject profiling approaches have been developed to capture inter-patient heterogeneity. We present a personalized connectomics approach that examines structural brain alterations in five chronic patients with moderate to severe TBI who underwent anatomical and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. We generated individualized profiles of lesion characteristics and network measures (including personalized graph metric GraphMe plots, and nodal and edge-based brain network alterations) and compared them against healthy reference cases (N = 12) to assess brain damage qualitatively and quantitatively at the individual level. Our findings revealed alterations of brain networks with high variability between patients. With validation and comparison to stratified, normative healthy control comparison cohorts, this approach could be used by clinicians to formulate a neuroscience-guided integrative rehabilitation program for TBI patients, and for designing personalized rehabilitation protocols based on their unique lesion load and connectome.Author Summary. Single-subject profiling captures heterogeneity of the structural connectome to characterize brain network alterations in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We profile individual patients based on their unique brain graphs in comparison to healthy controls, to provide insights into brain network disruption otherwise obscured by group-level approaches. Our implementation extends current methods by analyzing TBI structural profiles when automatic sub/cortical segmentation or parcellation of MRIs fail in the presence of lesions. Our approach highlights the translational potential for single-subject network analyses in the study of brain injury. Personalized connectome profiling provides a novel user-friendly framework for leveraging graph metrics to benefit the individual patient, by characterizing network-level brain alterations with potential prognostic relevance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disorder damaging structural connectivity. Natural remodeling processes of the nervous system can, to some extent, restore the damage caused. However, there is a lack of biomarkers to evaluate remodeling in MS. Our objective is to evaluate graph theory metrics (especially modularity) as a biomarker of remodeling and cognition in MS. We recruited 60 relapsing-remitting MS and 26 healthy controls. Structural and diffusion MRI, plus cognitive and disability evaluations, were done. We calculated modularity and global efficiency from the tractography-derived connectivity matrices. Association of graph metrics with T2 lesion load, cognition, and disability was evaluated using general linear models adjusting for age, gender, and disease duration wherever applicable. We showed that MS subjects had higher modularity and lower global efficiency compared with controls. In the MS group, modularity was inversely associated with cognitive performance but positively associated with T2 lesion load. Our results indicate that modularity increase is due to the disruption of intermodular connections in MS because of the lesions, with no improvement or preserving of cognitive functions.Author Summary. Network remodeling is an inherent property of the nervous system, diminishing the harm caused by lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS). Modularity has been proposed previously as a measure of network remodeling in several disorders. In this study, we studied modularity of structural networks in MS, and its associations with clinical and cognitive measures. We showed increased modularity in the patients that is associated with higher T2 lesion load and poor cognitive function; the latter became nonsignificant after covarying the lesion load. Our results indicate that modularity increase is due to the disruption of intermodular connections in MS because of the lesions, rather than a remodeling procedure resulting in a cognitive improvement.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Age-related cognitive decline varies greatly in healthy older adults, which may partly be explained by differences in the functional architecture of brain networks. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) derived network parameters as widely used markers describing this architecture have even been successfully used to support diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. The current study aimed at examining whether these parameters may also be useful in classifying and predicting cognitive performance differences in the normally aging brain by using machine learning (ML). Classifiability and predictability of global and domain-specific cognitive performance differences from nodal and network-level RSFC strength measures were examined in healthy older adults from the 1000BRAINS study (age range: 55–85 years). ML performance was systematically evaluated across different analytic choices in a robust cross-validation scheme. Across these analyses, classification performance did not exceed 60\% accuracy for global and domain-specific cognition. Prediction performance was equally low with high mean absolute errors (MAEs ≥ 0.75) and low to none explained variance (R2 ≤ 0.07) for different cognitive targets, feature sets, and pipeline configurations. Current results highlight limited potential of functional network parameters to serve as sole biomarker for cognitive aging and emphasize that predicting cognition from functional network patterns may be challenging.Author Summary. In recent years, new insights into brain network communication related to cognitive performance differences in older age have been gained. Simultaneously, an increasing number of studies has turned to machine learning (ML) approaches for the development of biomarkers in health and disease. Given the increasing aging population and the impact cognition has on the quality of life of older adults, automated markers for cognitive aging gain importance. This study addressed the classification and prediction power of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) strength measures for cognitive performance in healthy older adults using a battery of standard ML approaches. Classifiability and predictability of cognitive abilities was found to be low across analytic choices. Results emphasize limited potential of these metrics as sole biomarker for cognitive aging.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sleep inertia is the brief period of impaired alertness and performance experienced immediately after waking. Little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. A better understanding of the neural processes during sleep inertia may offer insight into the awakening process. We observed brain activity every 15 min for 1 hr following abrupt awakening from slow wave sleep during the biological night. Using 32-channel electroencephalography, a network science approach, and a within-subject design, we evaluated power, clustering coefficient, and path length across frequency bands under both a control and a polychromatic short-wavelength-enriched light intervention condition. We found that under control conditions, the awakening brain is typified by an immediate reduction in global theta, alpha, and beta power. Simultaneously, we observed a decrease in the clustering coefficient and an increase in path length within the delta band. Exposure to light immediately after awakening ameliorated changes in clustering. Our results suggest that long-range network communication within the brain is crucial to the awakening process and that the brain may prioritize these long-range connections during this transitional state. Our study highlights a novel neurophysiological signature of the awakening brain and provides a potential mechanism by which light improves performance after waking.Author Summary. Using a graphical framework approach, our findings suggest that following awakening from slow wave sleep: (a) a prioritization scheme may underlie recovery rates for different behaviors; (b) long-range neural connections orchestrating local-global operations are uniquely disrupted; and (c) light is able to minimize disruption to long-range connections, revealing the potential mechanism through which light acts as a countermeasure. This research (a) advances the knowledge of neural processes during the transition from sleep to wakefulness; (b) demonstrates a mechanism underlying a brain-behavior relationship that may serve as a target for future countermeasure research; and (c) applies a novel methodological approach to sleep-wake brain states. Further research is needed to apply this analytical method to alternative interventions and sleep-wake transition scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and altered brain structure are the most relevant neuroimaging biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, their spatial inconsistency was always confusing and misleading. Furthermore, the relationship between this spatial inconsistency and AD progression is unclear. The current study introduced a regional radiomics similarity network (R2SN) to map structural MRI and Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) images to study their cross-modal interregional coupling. A total of 790 participants (248 normal controls, 390 mild cognitive impaired patients, and 152 AD patients) with their structural MRI and PET images were studied. The results showed that global and regional R2SN coupling significantly decreased according to the severity of cognitive decline, from mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia. The global coupling patterns are discriminative between different APOE ε4, Aβ, and Tau subgroups. R2SN coupling was probed for relationships with neuropsychiatric measures and peripheral biomarkers. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that lower global coupling scores could reveal worse clinical progression of dementia. The R2SN coupling scores derived from the coupling between Aβ and atrophy over individual brain regions could reflect the specific pathway of AD progression, which would be a reliable biomarker for AD.Author Summary. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and altered brain structure are the most relevant neuroimaging biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We introduced a novel network coupling measure based on the regional radiomics similarity network (R2SN) to explore the potential association between the spatial distributions of brain structure and Aβ based on sMRI and Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In this study, we systematically demonstrated that the alteration of the coupling between brain networks of brain structure and Aβ accumulation could serve as a predictor for revealing the distinct progression of AD.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The functional organization of the brain is usually presented with a back-to-front gradient of timescales, reflecting regional specialization with sensory areas (back) processing information faster than associative areas (front), which perform information integration. However, cognitive processes require not only local information processing but also coordinated activity across regions. Using magnetoencephalography recordings, we find that the functional connectivity at the edge level (between two regions) is also characterized by a back-to-front gradient of timescales following that of the regional gradient. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate a reverse front-to-back gradient when nonlocal interactions are prominent. Thus, the timescales are dynamic and can switch between back-to-front and front-to-back patterns.Author Summary. Cortical gradients have been proposed as a general gauge of brain interareal variability. In line with the expected sensory-to-associative hierarchical organization, brain regions fall, on average, along a back-to-front axis of variance of both structural and functional features. However, brain activity is dynamic and nonlinear, with large-scale interactions constantly reconfiguring over time. Analyzing a large cohort of magnetoencephalographic recordings in humans at the single-trial level, we discover a much richer repertoire of cortical timescales. Notably, a front-to-back gradient of timescales is observed when interactions across regions give rise to an emergent state of information exchange, which we uniquely capture by using edge-wise connectivity measures.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We explore the stability and dynamic properties of a hierarchical, linearized, and analytic spectral graph model for neural oscillations that integrates the structural wiring of the brain. Previously, we have shown that this model can accurately capture the frequency spectra and the spatial patterns of the alpha and beta frequency bands obtained from magnetoencephalography recordings without regionally varying parameters. Here, we show that this macroscopic model based on long-range excitatory connections exhibits dynamic oscillations with a frequency in the alpha band even without any oscillations implemented at the mesoscopic level. We show that depending on the parameters, the model can exhibit combinations of damped oscillations, limit cycles, or unstable oscillations. We determined bounds on model parameters that ensure stability of the oscillations simulated by the model. Finally, we estimated time-varying model parameters to capture the temporal fluctuations in magnetoencephalography activity. We show that a dynamic spectral graph modeling framework with a parsimonious set of biophysically interpretable model parameters can thereby be employed to capture oscillatory fluctuations observed in electrophysiological data in various brain states and diseases.Author Summary. One of the open questions in the field of neuroscience is to understand how dynamic brain functional activity arises with the static brain structural wiring as a constraint. Here, we explore the properties of an analytic model that can accurately capture such a relationship, where the brain functional activity is captured by magnetoencephalography. We demonstrate the temporal and spectral richness of this model and how it is controlled by a small set of biophysically interpretable parameters. Finally, we show that these parameters can accurately capture the temporal fluctuations in magnetoencephalography activity—outlining a tractable strategy to capture oscillatory fluctuations observed in electrophysiological data in various brain states and diseases.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Representation learning is a core component in data-driven modeling of various complex phenomena. Learning a contextually informative representation can especially benefit the analysis of fMRI data because of the complexities and dynamic dependencies present in such datasets. In this work, we propose a framework based on transformer models to learn an embedding of the fMRI data by taking the spatiotemporal contextual information in the data into account. This approach takes the multivariate BOLD time series of the regions of the brain as well as their functional connectivity network simultaneously as the input to create a set of meaningful features that can in turn be used in various downstream tasks such as classification, feature extraction, and statistical analysis. The proposed spatiotemporal framework uses the attention mechanism as well as the graph convolution neural network to jointly inject the contextual information regarding the dynamics in time series data and their connectivity into the representation. We demonstrate the benefits of this framework by applying it to two resting-state fMRI datasets, and provide further discussion on various aspects and advantages of it over a number of other commonly adopted architectures.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Brain network analyses have exploded in recent years and hold great potential in helping us understand normal and abnormal brain function. Network science approaches have facilitated these analyses and our understanding of how the brain is structurally and functionally organized. However, the development of statistical methods that allow relating this organization to phenotypic traits has lagged behind. Our previous work developed a novel analytic framework to assess the relationship between brain network architecture and phenotypic differences while controlling for confounding variables. More specifically, this innovative regression framework related distances (or similarities) between brain network features from a single task to functions of absolute differences in continuous covariates and indicators of difference for categorical variables. Here we extend that work to the multitask and multisession context to allow for multiple brain networks per individual. We explore several similarity metrics for comparing distances between connection matrices and adapt several standard methods for estimation and inference within our framework: standard F test, F test with scan-level effects (SLE), and our proposed mixed model for multitask (and multisession) BrAin NeTwOrk Regression (3M_BANTOR). A novel strategy is implemented to simulate symmetric positive-definite (SPD) connection matrices, allowing for the testing of metrics on the Riemannian manifold. Via simulation studies, we assess all approaches for estimation and inference while comparing them with existing multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) methods. We then illustrate the utility of our framework by analyzing the relationship between fluid intelligence and brain network distances in Human Connectome Project (HCP) data.},
