The latter property is key in our subsequent development of a robust data assimilation methodology: We establish propagation of chaos for the associated interacting particle system, which in turn is suggestive of a numerical scheme that can be viewed as an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter to a rough-path framework. Finally, we discuss a data-driven method based on subsampling to construct suitable rough path lifts and demonstrate the robustness of our scheme in a number of numerical experiments related to parameter estimation problems in multiscale contexts.},

Under the further assumption that the order statistics of the in-degrees have a power-law behavior, we show that the extremal values of the stationary distribution also have a power-law behavior with the same index. In the same setting, we prove that these results extend to the PageRank scores of the random digraph, thus confirming a version of the so-called power-law hypothesis.

  abstract     = {We consider the algorithmic problem of finding a near-optimal solution for the number partitioning problem (NPP). This problem appears in many practical applications, including the design of randomized controlled trials, multiprocessor scheduling, and cryptography. It is also of theoretical significance. The NPP possesses a so-called statistical-to-computational gap: when its input X has distribution N(0,In), the optimal value of the NPP is Θ(n2−n) w.h.p., whereas the best-known polynomial-time algorithm achieves an objective value of only 2−Θ(log2n) w.h.p. In this paper we initiate the study of the nature of this gap. Inspired by insights from statistical physics, we study the landscape of the NPP and establish the presence of the overlap gap property (OGP), an intricate geometrical property which is known to be a rigorous evidence of an algorithmic hardness for large classes of algorithms. By leveraging the OGP, we establish that: (a) any sufficiently stable algorithm, appropriately defined, fails to find a near-optimal solution with energy below 2−ω(nlog−1/5n), and (b) a very natural Markov chain Monte Carlo dynamic fails to find near-optimal solutions. Our simulation results suggest that the state-of-the-art algorithm achieving the value of 2−Θ(log2n) is indeed stable, but formally verifying this is left as an open problem. OGP regards the overlap structure of m-tuples of solutions achieving a certain objective value. When m is constant, we prove the presence of OGP for the objective values of order 2−Θ(n) and the absence of it in the regime 2−o(n). Interestingly though, by considering overlaps with growing values of m, we prove the presence of the OGP up to the level 2−ω(nlogn). Our proof of the failure of stable algorithms at values 2−ω(nlog−1/5n) employs methods from Ramsey theory from the extremal combinatorics and is of independent interest.},

This common randomization is introduced for the purpose of exploration from a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. It also allows us to establish connections between both closed-loop and open-loop policies for MFC and Markov policies for the MFMDP. In particular, we show that there exists an optimal closed-loop policy for the original MFC and we prove dynamic programming principles for the state and state-action value functions. Building on this framework and the notion of state-action value function, we then propose RL methods for such problems, by adapting existing tabular and deep RL methods to the mean-field setting. The main difficulty is the treatment of the population state, which is an input of the policy and the value function. We provide convergence guarantees for the tabular Q-learning algorithm based on discretizations of the simplex. We also show that neural network based deep RL algorithms are more suitable for continuous spaces as they allow us to avoid discretizing the mean field state space. Numerical examples are provided.},

  abstract     = {This work develops a powerful and versatile framework for determining acceptance ratios in Metropolis–Hastings-type Markov kernels widely used in statistical sampling problems. Our approach allows us to derive new classes of kernels which unify random walk or diffusion-type sampling methods with more complicated “extended phase space” algorithms based around ideas from Hamiltonian dynamics. Our starting point is an abstract result developed in the generality of measurable state spaces that addresses proposal kernels that possess a certain involution structure. Note that, while this underlying proposal structure suggests a scope which includes Hamiltonian-type kernels, we demonstrate that our abstract result is, in an appropriate sense, equivalent to an earlier general state space setting developed in (Ann. Appl. Probab. 8 (1998) 1–9) where the connection to Hamiltonian methods was more obscure. On the basis of our abstract results we develop several new classes of extended phase space, HMC-like algorithms. First we tackle the classical finite-dimensional setting of a continuously distributed target measure. We then consider an infinite-dimensional framework for targets which are absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure with a trace-class covariance. Each of these algorithm classes can be viewed as “surrogate-trajectory” methods, providing a versatile methodology to bypass expensive gradient computations through skillful reduced order modeling and/or data driven approaches as we begin to explore in a forthcoming companion work (Glatt-Holtz et al. (2023)). On the other hand, along with the connection of our main abstract result to the framework in (Ann. Appl. Probab. 8 (1998) 1–9), these algorithm classes provide a unifying picture connecting together a number of popular existing algorithms which arise as special cases of our general frameworks under suitable parameter choices. In particular we show that, in the finite-dimensional setting, we can produce an algorithm class which includes the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and random walk Metropolis method (RWMC) alongside a number of variants of the HMC algorithm including the geometric approach introduced in (J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B. Stat. Methodol. 73 (2011) 123–214). In the infinite-dimensional situation, we show that the algorithm class we derive includes the preconditioned Crank–Nicolson (pCN), ∞MALA and ∞HMC methods considered in (Stoch. Dyn. 8 (2008) 319–350; Stochastic Process. Appl. 121 (2011) 2201–2230; Statist. Sci. 28 (2013) 424–446) as special cases.},

Vertices give birth at a constant rate (growth), each edge may be removed independently (fragmentation of the tree) and clusters (or trees) are frozen with a rate proportional to their sizes (isolation of connected component). A phase transition occurs when the isolation is able to stop the growth-fragmentation process and cause extinction. When the process survives, the number of clusters increases exponentially and we prove that the normalised empirical measure of clusters a.s. converges to a limit law on recursive trees. We exploit the branching structure associated to the size of clusters, which is inherited from the splitting property of random recursive trees. This work is motivated by the control of epidemics and contact tracing where clusters correspond to trees of infected individuals that can be identified and isolated. We complement this work by providing results on the Malthusian exponent to describe the effect of control policies on epidemics.},

A guesser guesses the top card, after which it is revealed and removed and the game continues. What is the expected number of correct guesses under the best and worst strategies? We establish sharp asymptotics for both strategies. For the worst case, this answers a recent question of Diaconis, Graham, He and Spiro, who found the correct order.

For all test functions f∈C5(R), we show that the convergence rate is either N−1/2+ε or N−1+ε, depending on the first Chebyshev coefficient of f and the third moment of the diagonal matrix entries. The condition that distinguishes these two rates is necessary and sufficient. For a general class of test functions, we further identify matching lower bounds for the convergence rates. In addition, we identify an explicit, nonuniversal contribution in the linear eigenvalue statistics, which is responsible for the slow rate N−1/2+ε for non-Gaussian ensembles. By removing this nonuniversal part, we show that the shifted linear eigenvalue statistics have the unified convergence rate N−1+ε for all test functions.},

The dynamic of these models is given by an autoregressive latent process which forms a Markov chain in random environments. Contrarily to existing contributions in the field of Markov chains in random environments, the state space is not discrete and we do not use small set type assumptions or uniform contraction conditions for the random Markov kernels. Our assumptions are quite general and allow us to deal with models that are not fully contractive, such as threshold autoregressive processes. Using a coupling approach, we study the existence of a limit, in Wasserstein metric, for the backward iterations of the chain. We also derive ergodic properties for the corresponding skew-product Markov chain. Our results are illustrated with many examples of autoregressive processes widely used in statistics or in econometrics, including GARCH type processes, count autoregressions and categorical time series.},

If k is close to 1 or close to N, that is, near the extreme edges of the spectrum, then with overwhelming probability, the distance between the kth largest particle and its classical position is of order O(N−23+ϵmin(k,N+1−k)−13).

We establish that for every q≥1, the random-cluster Glauber dynamics mixes in optimal Θ(nlogn) steps on n-vertex random graphs having a prescribed degree sequence with bounded average branching γ throughout the full high-temperature uniqueness regime p&lt;pu(q,γ). The family of random graph models we consider includes the Erdős–Rényi random graph G(n,γ/n), and so we provide the first polynomial-time sampling algorithm for the ferromagnetic Potts model on Erdős–Rényi random graphs for the full tree uniqueness regime. We accompany our results with mixing time lower bounds (exponential in the largest degree) for the Potts Glauber dynamics, in the same settings where our Θ(nlogn) bounds for the random-cluster Glauber dynamics apply. This reveals a novel and significant computational advantage of random-cluster based algorithms for sampling from the Potts model at high temperatures.},

In the present paper we study a Wright–Fisher diffusion in a Lévy environment that gives a selective advantage to sometimes one type, sometimes the other. Classical methods using the ancestral selection graph (ASG) fail in the study of this model because of the complexity, resulting from the two-sided selection, of the structure of the information contained in the ASG. We propose a new method that consists in encoding the relevant combinatorics of the ASG into a function. We show that the expectations of the coefficients of this function form a (nonstochastic) semigroup and deduce that they satisfy a linear system of differential equations. As a result we obtain a series representation for the fixation probability h(x) (where x is the initial proportion of individuals of type 0 in the population) as an infinite sum of polynomials whose coefficients satisfy explicit linear relations. Our approach then allows to derive Taylor expansions at every order for h(x) near x=0 and to obtain an explicit recursion formula for the coefficients.},

We call this process Speed Up Zig-Zag (SUZZ). We provide conditions that guarantee stability properties for the SUZZ process, including nonexplosivity, exponential ergodicity in heavy tailed targets and central limit theorem. Interestingly, we find that using speed functions that induce explosive deterministic dynamics may lead to stable algorithms that can even mix faster.

  abstract     = {For a continuous state branching process with two types of individuals which are subject to selection and density dependent competition, we characterize the joint evolution of population size, type configurations and genealogies as the unique strong solution of a system of SDEs. Our construction is achieved in the lookdown framework and provides a synthesis as well as a generalization of cases considered separately in two seminal papers by Donnelly and Kurtz (Ann. Appl. Probab. 9 (1999) 1091–1148; Ann. Probab. 27 (1999) 166–205), namely fluctuating population sizes under neutrality, and selection with constant population size. As a conceptual core in our approach we introduce the selective lookdown space which is obtained from its neutral counterpart through a state-dependent thinning of “potential” selection/competition events whose rates interact with the evolution of the type densities. The updates of the genealogical distance matrix at the “active” selection/competition events are obtained through an appropriate sampling from the selective lookdown space. The solution of the above mentioned system of SDEs is then mapped into the joint evolution of population size and symmetrized type configurations and genealogies, that is, marked distance matrix distributions. By means of Kurtz’ Markov mapping theorem, we characterize the latter process as the unique solution of a martingale problem. For the sake of transparency we restrict the main part of our presentation to a prototypical example with two types, which contains the essential features. In the final section we outline an extension to processes with multiple types including mutation.},

If we make the convexity and monotony assumption (only) on σ and if σ⪯θ with respect to the partial matrix order, the convex order for the initial random variable X0⪯cvY0 can be propagated to the whole path of process X and Y. That is, if we consider a convex functional F defined on the path space with polynomial growth, we have EF(X)≤EF(Y); for a convex functional G defined on the product space involving the path space and its marginal distribution space, we have EG(X,(μt)t∈[0,T])≤EG(Y,(νt)t∈[0,T]) under appropriate conditions. The symmetric setting is also valid, that is, if θ⪯σ and Y0≤X0 with respect to the convex order, then EF(Y)≤EF(X) and EG(Y,(νt)t∈[0,T])≤EG(X,(μt)t∈[0,T]). The proof is based on several forward and backward dynamic programming principles and the convergence of the Euler scheme of the McKean–Vlasov equation.

Our novel analysis is based on the extension of V-norm contraction methods, associated to functionally weighted Banach spaces for Markov semigroups, to positive semigroups. This methodology is applied to a general class of positive and possibly time-inhomogeneous bounded integral semigroups and their normalised versions. The spectral theorems that we develop are an extension of Perron–Frobenius and Krein–Rutman theorems for positive operators to a class of time-varying positive semigroups. In the context of time-homogeneous models, the regularity conditions discussed in the present article appear to be necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of leading eigenvalues. We review and illustrate the impact of these results in the context of positive semigroups arising in transport theory, physics, mathematical biology and signal processing.},

  abstract     = {Le Cam’s third/contiguity lemma is a fundamental probabilistic tool to compute the limiting distribution of a given statistic Tn under a nonnull sequence of probability measures {Qn}, provided its limiting distribution under a null sequence {Pn} is available, and the log likelihood ratio {log(dQn/dPn)} has a distributional limit. Despite its wide-spread applications to low-dimensional statistical problems, the stringent requirement of Le Cam’s third/contiguity lemma on the distributional limit of the log likelihood ratio makes it challenging, or even impossible to use in many modern high-dimensional statistical problems. This paper provides a nonasymptotic analogue of Le Cam’s third/contiguity lemma under high-dimensional normal populations. Our contiguity method is particularly compatible with sufficiently regular statistics Tn: the regularity of Tn effectively reduces both the problems of (i) obtaining a null (Gaussian) limit distribution and of (ii) verifying our new quantitative contiguity condition, to those of derivative calculations and moment bounding exercises. More important, our method bypasses the need to understand the precise behavior of the log likelihood ratio, and therefore possibly works even when it necessarily fails to stabilize—a regime beyond the reach of classical contiguity methods. As a demonstration of the scope of our new contiguity method, we obtain asymptotically exact power formulae for a number of widely used high-dimensional covariance tests, including the likelihood ratio tests and trace tests, that hold uniformly over all possible alternative covariance under mild growth conditions on the dimension-to-sample ratio. These new results go much beyond the scope of previous available case-specific techniques, and exhibit new phenomenon regarding the behavior of these important class of covariance tests.},

We go on to identify when such processes come down from infinity.

The limiting process can be viewed heuristically as a one-dimensional diffusion with an absolutely continuous speed measure and a discontinuous scale function, as given by a two-sided stable subordinator. Corresponding to intervals of low conductance in the discrete model, the discontinuities in the scale function act as barriers off which the limiting process reflects for some time before crossing. We also discuss how, by incorporating a Bouchaud trap model element into the setting, it is possible to combine this “blocking” mechanism with one of “trapping”. Our proof relies on a recently developed theory that relates the convergence of processes to that of associated resistance metric measure spaces.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that Glauber dynamics on spin systems typically suffer exponential slowdowns at low temperatures. This is due to the emergence of multiple metastable phases in the state space, separated by narrow bottlenecks that are hard for the dynamics to cross. It is a folklore belief that if the dynamics is initialized from an appropriate random mixture of ground states, one for each phase, then convergence to the Gibbs distribution should be much faster. However, such phenomena have largely evaded rigorous analysis, as most tools in the study of Markov chain mixing times are tailored to worst-case initializations. In this paper we develop a general framework towards establishing this conjectured behavior for the Ising model. In the classical setting of the Ising model on an N-vertex torus in Zd, our framework implies that the mixing time for the Glauber dynamics, initialized from a 12-12 mixture of the all-plus and all-minus configurations, is N1+o(1) in dimension d=2, and at most quasi-polynomial in all dimensions d≥3, at all temperatures below the critical one. The key innovation in our analysis is the introduction of the notion of “weak spatial mixing within a phase”, a low-temperature adaptation of the classical concept of weak spatial mixing. We show both that this new notion is strong enough to control the mixing time from the above random initialization (by relating it to the mixing time with plus boundary condition at O(logN) scales), and that it holds at all low temperatures in all dimensions. This framework naturally extends to more general families of graphs. To illustrate this, we use the same approach to establish optimal O(NlogN) mixing for the Ising Glauber dynamics on random regular graphs at sufficiently low temperatures, when initialized from the same random mixture.},

This novel mean-field SPDE is thus motivated by population models where things like overcrowding and isolation can affect growth. A two step approximation method is employed to show the existence for this SPDE under general conditions. Then, mild moment conditions are imposed to get uniqueness. Finally, smoothness of the SPDE solution is established under a further simplifying condition.},

In the present paper we provide an explicit construction of a triple of functions, on the graph of which the increasing supermartingale coupling concentrates. In particular, we show that the increasing supermartingale coupling can be identified with the left-curtain martingale coupling and the antitone coupling to the left and to the right of a uniquely determined regime-switching point, respectively. Our construction is based on the concept of the shadow measure. We show how to determine the potential of the shadow measure associated to a supermartingale, extending the recent results of Beiglböck et al. (Electron. Commun.

This enables us to derive scaling limits of such random walks conditioned by their terminal value at time n in various regimes. We believe both to be of independent interest. We then apply these results to obtain invariance principles for the Łukasiewicz path of Bienaymé–Galton–Watson trees conditioned on having a fixed number of leaves and of vertices at the same time, which constitutes a first step towards understanding their large scale geometry. We finally deduce from this scaling limit theorems for random bipartite planar maps under a new conditioning by fixing their number of vertices, edges, and faces at the same time. In the particular case of the uniform distribution, our results confirm a prediction of Fusy and Guitter on the growth of the typical distances and show furthermore that in all regimes, the scaling limit is the celebrated Brownian sphere.},

It models reaction dynamics between different molecular species and continuous movement of molecules in space. Reactions rates at a spatial location are proportional to the mass of different species present locally and to a location specific chemical rate, which may be a function of the local or global species mass as well. We obtain asymptotic limits for the process, with appropriate rescaling depending on the abundance of different molecular types. In particular, when the mass of some species in the scaling limit is discrete while the mass of the others is continuous, we obtain a new type of spatial random evolution process. This process can be shown, in some situations, to correspond to a measure-valued piecewise deterministic Markov process in which the discrete mass of the process evolves stochastically, and the continuous mass evolves in a deterministic way between consecutive jump times of the discrete part.},

  abstract     = {Consider the random Cayley graph of a finite Abelian group G with respect to k generators chosen uniformly at random, with 1≪logk≪log|G|. Draw a vertex U∼Unif(G). We show that the graph distance dist(id,U) from the identity to U concentrates at a particular value M, which is the minimal radius of a ball in Zk of cardinality at least |G|, under mild conditions. In other words, the distance from the identity for all but o(|G|) of the elements of G lies in the interval [M−o(M),M+o(M)]. In the regime k≳log|G|, we show that the diameter of the graph is also asymptotically M. In the spirit of a conjecture of Aldous and Diaconis (Technical Report 231 (1985)), this M depends only on k and |G|, not on the algebraic structure of G. Write d(G) for the minimal size of a generating subset of G. We prove that the order of the spectral gap is |G|−2/k when k−d(G)≍k and |G| lies in a density-1 subset of N or when k−2d(G)≍k. This extends, for Abelian groups, a celebrated result of Alon and Roichman (Random Structures Algorithms 5 (1994) 271–284). The aforementioned results all hold with high probability over the random Cayley graph.},

Our framework will make use of the notion of the Hukuhara difference between sets, in order to compensate the lack of “inverse” operation of the traditional Minkowski addition, whence the vector space structure in set-valued analysis. While proving the well-posedness of a class of set-valued BSDEs, we shall also address some fundamental issues regarding generalized Aumann–Itô integrals, especially when it is connected to the martingale representation theorem. In particular, we propose some necessary extensions of the integral that can be used to represent set-valued martingales with nonsingleton initial values. This extension turns out to be essential for the study of set-valued BSDEs.},

Such an exploration consists of one simple continuous path called the trunk of the exploration that discovers CLE4 loops along the way. The parameter μ appears in the Loewner chain description of the path that traces the trunk and all CLE4 loops encountered by the trunk in chronological order. These explorations can also be interpreted in terms of level lines of a Gaussian free field. It has been shown by Miller, Sheffield and Werner that the trunk of such an exploration is an SLE4(ρ,−2−ρ) process for some (unknown) value of ρ∈(−2,0). The main result of the present paper is to establish the relation between μ and ρ, more specifically to show that μ=−πcot(πρ/2).},

Both the analytical Boltzmann equation and the probabilistic interpretation initiated by Tanaka (Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 46 (1978/79) 67–105; J. Fac. Sci., Univ. Tokyo, Sect. IA, Math. 34 (1987) 351–369) have intensively been discussed in the literature for specific models related to the behavior of gas molecules. In this paper, we consider general abstract coefficients that may include mean field effects and then we discuss the link with specific models as well. In contrast with the usual approach in which integral equations are used in order to state the problem, we employ here a new formulation of the problem in terms of flows of self-maps on the space of probability measure endowed with the Wasserstein distance. This point of view already appeared in the framework of rough differential equations. Our results concern existence and uniqueness of the solution, in the formulation of flows, but we also prove that the “flow solution” is a solution of the classical integral weak equation and admits a probabilistic interpretation. Moreover, we obtain stability results and regularity with respect to the time for such solutions. Finally we prove the convergence of empirical measures based on particle systems to the solution of our problem, and we obtain the rate of convergence. We discuss as examples the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous Boltzmann (Enskog) equation with hard potentials.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic chains of unbounded memory (SCUMs) are generalization of Markov chains, also known in the literature as “chains with complete connections” or “g-measures”. We obtain Gaussian concentration bounds (GCB) in this large class of models, for general alphabets, under two different conditions on the kernel: (1) when the sum of its oscillations is less than one, or (2) when the sum of its variations is finite, that is, belongs to ℓ1(N). We also obtain explicit constants as functions of the parameters of the model. Our conditions are sharp in the sense that we exhibit examples of SCUMs that do not have GCB and for which the sum of oscillations is 1+ϵ, or the variation belongs to ℓ1+ϵ(N) for any ϵ&gt;0. These examples are based on the existence of phase transitions. We illustrate our results with four applications. First, we derive a Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz-type inequality which gives a uniform control on the fluctuations of the empirical measure. Second, in the finite-alphabet case, we obtain an upper bound on the d¯-distance between two stationary SCUMs and, as a by-product, we obtain new explicit bounds on the speed of Markovian approximation in d¯. Third, we derive new bounds on the fluctuations of the “plug-in” estimator for entropy. Fourth, we obtain new rate of convergence for the maximum likelihood estimator of conditional probability.},

Our main result is a large deviation principle (LDP) for the sample path of the empirical graphon observed until a fixed time horizon. The rate is ( n 2), the rate function is a specific action integral on the space of graphon trajectories. We apply the LDP to identify (i) the most likely path that starting from a constant graphon creates a graphon with an atypically large density of d-regular subgraphs, and (ii) the mostly likely path between two given graphons. It turns out that bifurcations may occur in the solutions of associated variational problems.},

For sufficiently large d, we show that if κ(θ−1)≤d−O( dκln(d)), then every vertex almost surely changes its color infinitely often, while if κθ≥d+O(κ dln(d)), then every vertex almost surely changes its color only finitely many times. Roughly, this implies that as d→∞, there is a phase transition where κθ/d=1.

  abstract     = {We prove bounds for the approximation and estimation of certain binary classification functions using ReLU neural networks. Our estimation bounds provide a priori performance guarantees for empirical risk minimization using networks of a suitable size, depending on the number of training samples available. The obtained approximation and estimation rates are independent of the dimension of the input, showing that the curse of dimensionality can be overcome in this setting; in fact, the input dimension only enters in the form of a polynomial factor. Regarding the regularity of the target classification function, we assume the interfaces between the different classes to be locally of Barron-type. We complement our results by studying the relations between various Barron-type spaces that have been proposed in the literature. These spaces differ substantially more from each other than the current literature suggests.},

  abstract     = {Consider the random matrix model A1/2UBU∗A1/2, where A and B are two N×N deterministic matrices and U is either an N×N Haar unitary or orthogonal random matrix. It is well known that on the macroscopic scale (Invent. Math. 104 (1991) 201–220), the limiting empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of the above model is given by the free multiplicative convolution of the limiting ESDs of A and B, denoted as μα⊠μβ, where μα and μβ are the limiting ESDs of A and B, respectively. In this paper, we study the asymptotic microscopic behavior of the edge eigenvalues and eigenvectors statistics. We prove that both the density of μA⊠μB, where μA and μB are the ESDs of A and B, respectively and the associated subordination functions have a regular behavior near the edges. Moreover, we establish the local laws near the edges on the optimal scale. In particular, we prove that the entries of the resolvent are close to some functionals depending only on the eigenvalues of A, B and the subordination functions with optimal convergence rates. Our proofs and calculations are based on the techniques developed for the additive model A+UBU∗ in (J. Funct. Anal. 271 (2016) 672–719; Comm. Math. Phys. 349 (2017) 947–990; Adv.

We explore the effect of a change point in the system; the dynamics are initially driven by a function f until the tree reaches size τ(n)∈(0,n), at which point the attachment function switches to another function, g, until the tree reaches size n. Two change point time scales are considered, namely the standard model where τ(n)=γn, and the quick big bang model where τ(n)=nγ, for some 0&lt;γ&lt;1. In the former case, we obtain deterministic approximations for the evolution of the empirical degree distribution (EDF) in sup-norm and use these to devise a provably consistent nonparametric estimator for the change point γ. In the latter case, we show that the effect of pre-change point dynamics asymptotically vanishes in the EDF, although this effect persists in functionals such as the maximal degree. Our proofs rely on embedding the discrete time tree dynamics in an associated (time) inhomogeneous continuous time branching process (CTBP). In the course of proving the above results, we develop novel mathematical techniques to analyze both homogeneous and inhomogeneous CTBPs and obtain rates of convergence for functionals of such processes, which are of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide convergence and existence results for mean field games of controls. Mean field games of controls are a class of mean field games where the mean field interactions are achieved through the joint (conditional) distribution of the controlled state and the control process. The framework we are considering allows to control the diffusion coefficient σ, and the controls/strategies are supposed to be of open loop type. Using (controlled) Fokker–Planck equations, we introduce a notion of measure-valued solution of mean field game of controls and prove a relation between these solutions on the one hand, and the approximate Nash equilibria on the other hand. First of all, in the N-player game associated to the mean field game of controls, given a sequence of approximate Nash equilibria, it is shown that, this sequence admits limits as N tends to infinity, and each limit is a measure-valued solution of the corresponding mean field game of controls. Conversely, any measure-valued solution can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of approximate Nash equilibria of the N-player game. In other words, the measure-valued solutions are the accumulation points of the approximate Nash equilibria. Then, by considering an approximate strong solution of mean field game of controls which is the classical strong solution where the optimality is obtained by admitting a small error ε, we prove that the measure-valued solutions are the accumulation points of this type of solutions when ε goes to zero. Finally, the existence of a measure-valued solution of mean field game of controls is proved in the case without common noise.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to systematically solve stochastic team optimization of a large-scale system, in a linear-quadratic-Gaussian framework. Concretely, the underlying large-scale system involves considerable weakly coupled cooperative agents for which the individual admissible controls: (i) enter the diffusion terms, (ii) are constrained in some closed-convex subsets and (iii) subject to a general partial decentralized information structure. A more important but serious feature: (iv) all agents are heterogenous with continuum instead of finite diversity. Combination of (i)–(iv) yields a quite general modeling of stochastic team-optimization, but on the other hand, also fails current existing techniques of team analysis. In particular, classical team consistency with continuum heterogeneity collapses because of (i). As the resolution, a novel unified approach is proposed under which the intractable continuum heterogeneity can be converted to a more tractable homogeneity. As a trade-off, the underlying randomness is augmented, and all agents become (quasi) weakly exchangeable. Such an approach essentially involves a subtle balance between homogeneity v.s. heterogeneity, and left (prior-sampling)- v.s. right (posterior-sampling) information filtration. Subsequently, the consistency condition (CC) system takes a new type of forward-backward stochastic system with double-projections (due to (ii), (iii)), along with spatial mean on continuum heterogenous index (due to (iv)). Such a system is new in team literature and its well-posedness is also challenging. We address this issue under mild conditions. Related asymptotic optimality is also established.},

This is formalized as a hypothesis testing problem, where under the null hypothesis, the two graphs are independently generated; under the alternative, the two graphs are edge-correlated under some latent node correspondence, but have the same marginal distributions as the null. For both Gaussian-weighted complete graphs and dense Erdős–Rényi graphs (with edge probability n−o(1)), we determine the sharp threshold at which the optimal testing error probability exhibits a phase transition from zero to one as n→∞. For sparse Erdős–Rényi graphs with edge probability n−Ω(1), we determine the threshold within a constant factor. The proof of the impossibility results is an application of the conditional second-moment method, where we bound the truncated second moment of the likelihood ratio by carefully conditioning on the typical behavior of the intersection graph (consisting of edges in both observed graphs) and taking into account the cycle structure of the induced random permutation on the edges. Notably, in the sparse regime, this is accomplished by leveraging the pseudoforest structure of subcritical Erdős–Rényi graphs and a careful enumeration of subpseudoforests that can be assembled from short orbits of the edge permutation.},

  abstract     = {We study the large scale behaviour of a population consisting of two types which evolve in dimension d=1,2 according to a spatial Lambda-Fleming–Viot process subject to random time-independent selection. If one of the two types is rare compared to the other, we prove that its evolution can be approximated by a super-Brownian motion in a random (and singular) environment. Without the sparsity assumption, a diffusion approximation leads to a Fisher–KPP equation in a random potential. The proofs build on two-scale Schauder estimates and semidiscrete approximations of the Anderson Hamiltonian.},

In the case of bounded Xi’s, the implied bound for the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of the scaled average and the Gaussian vector takes the form C(Bn2log3d/n)1/2logn, where d is the dimension of the vectors and Bn is a uniform envelope constant on components of Xi’s. This bound is sharp in terms of d and Bn, and is nearly (up to logn) sharp in terms of the sample size n. In addition, we show that similar bounds hold for the multiplier and empirical bootstrap approximations. Moreover, we establish bounds that allow for unbounded Xi’s, formulated solely in terms of moments of Xi’s. Finally, we demonstrate that the bounds can be further improved in some special smooth and moment-constrained cases.},

  abstract     = {In 2003, Varadhan (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 56 (2003) 1222–1245) developed a robust method for proving quenched and averaged large deviations for random walks in a uniformly elliptic and i.i.d. environment (RWRE) on Zd. One fundamental question which remained open was to determine when the quenched and averaged large deviation rate functions agree, and when they do not. In this article we show that for RWRE in uniformly elliptic and i.i.d. environment in d≥4, the two rate functions agree on any compact set contained in the interior of their domain which does not contain the origin, provided that the disorder of the environment is sufficiently low. Our result provides a new formulation which encompasses a set of sufficient conditions under which these rate functions agree without assuming that the RWRE is ballistic (see (Probab. Theory Related Fields 149 (2011) 463–491)), satisfies a CLT or even a law of large numbers (Electron. Commun. Probab. 7 (2002)191–197; Ann. Probab. 36 (2008) 728–738). Also, the equality of rate functions is not restricted to neighborhoods around given points, as long as the disorder of the environment is kept low. One of the novelties of our approach is the introduction of an auxiliary random walk in a deterministic environment which is itself ballistic (regardless of the actual RWRE behavior) and whose large deviation properties approximate those of the original RWRE in a robust manner, even if the original RWRE is not ballistic itself.},

The reason is that the topology of weak convergence does not account for the growth of information over time that is captured in the filtration of an adapted stochastic process. To address such discontinuities, Aldous introduced the extended weak topology, and subsequently, Hoover and Keisler showed that both, weak topology and extended weak topology, are just the first two topologies in a sequence of topologies that get increasingly finer. We introduce higher rank expected signatures to embed adapted processes into graded linear spaces and show that these embeddings induce the adapted topologies of Hoover–Keisler.},

A phase transition for the emergence of a giant strongly connected component is known to occur at p=1/n, with critical window p=1/n+λn−4/3 for λ∈R. We show that, within this critical window, the strongly connected components of G→(n,p), ranked in decreasing order of size and rescaled by n−1/3, converge in distribution to a sequence (C1,C2,…) of finite strongly connected directed multigraphs with edge lengths which are either 3-regular or loops. The convergence occurs in the sense of an ℓ1 sequence metric for which two directed multigraphs are close if there are compatible isomorphisms between their vertex and edge sets which roughly preserve the edge lengths. Our proofs rely on a depth-first exploration of the graph which enables us to relate the strongly connected components to a particular spanning forest of the undirected Erdős–Rényi random graph G(n,p), whose scaling limit is well understood. We show that the limiting sequence (C1,C2,…) contains only finitely many components which are not loops. If we ignore the edge lengths, any fixed finite sequence of 3-regular strongly connected directed multigraphs occurs with positive probability.},

In particular, due to the lack of compactness of the iterated conditional laws, the existing arguments of Schauder’s fixed point theorem do not seem to apply in this situation, and the heavy nonlinearity on the conditional laws caused by change of probability measure adds more technical subtleties. Under some structural assumptions on the coefficients of the observation equation, we prove the well-posedness of the solutions in a weak sense along a more direct approach.

In particular, if GN satisfies a “spectral gap” condition, we show that whenever dN≫ N, the fluctuations are universal and the same as that of the Curie–Weiss model in the entire ferromagnetic parameter regime. We give a counterexample to demonstrate that the condition dN≫ N is tight, in the sense that the limiting distribution changes if dN∼ N except in the high temperature regime. By refining our argument, we extend universality in the high temperature regime up to dN≫N1/3. Our results include universal fluctuations of the average magnetization in Ising models on regular graphs, Erdős–Rényi graphs (directed and undirected), stochastic block models, and sparse regular graphons. In fact, our results apply to general matrices with nonnegative entries, including Ising models on a Wigner matrix, and the block spin Ising model. As a by-product of our proof technique, we obtain Berry–Esseen bounds for these fluctuations, exponential concentration for the average of spins, tight error bounds for the mean-field approximation of the partition function, and tail bounds for various statistics of interest.},

It is proved that the method has the first order of weak convergence. Together with the Monte Carlo technique, it can be used to numerically solve linear parabolic and elliptic PDEs with Robin boundary condition. One of the key results of this paper is the use of the proposed method for computing ergodic limits, that is, expectations with respect to the invariant law of RSDEs, both inside a domain in Rd and on its boundary. This allows to efficiently sample from distributions with compact support. Both time-averaging and ensemble-averaging estimators are considered and analysed. A number of extensions are considered including a second-order weak approximation, the case of arbitrary oblique direction of reflection, and a new adaptive weak scheme to solve a Poisson PDE with Neumann boundary condition. The presented theoretical results are supported by several numerical experiments.},

We prove an upper bound with a rate function of the type which has previously been found for kinetic large deviation problems, and a matching lower bound restricted to a class of sufficiently good paths. However, we are able to show by an explicit counterexample that the predicted rate function does not extend to a global lower bound: even though the particle system almost surely conserves energy, large deviation behaviour includes solutions to the Boltzmann equation which do not conserve energy, as found by Lu and Wennberg, and these occur strictly more rarely than predicted by the proposed rate function. At the level of the particle system, this occurs because a macroscopic proportion of energy can concentrate in o(N) particles with probability e−O(N).},

Denoting by T(0,∂B(n)) the first-passage time from 0 to {x:‖x‖∞=n}, we show existence of a “time constant” and find its exact value to be limn→∞ T(0,∂B(n)) logn=I 2 3πalmost surely, where I=inf{x&gt;0:F(x)&gt;1/2} and F is any critical distribution for tv. This result shows that this time constant is universal and depends only on the value of I.

The proof method also shows an analogous universality on other two-dimensional lattices, assuming the time constant exists.},

Supposing general Polish state and action spaces, and using the martingale characterization, we state a risk-aware dynamic optimal control problem of minimizing risk of costs described by a generic risk function. From this, we construct an alternative formulation of the optimization problem that takes the form of a nonlinear programming problem, constrained by the dynamic, that is, time-dependent and linear Kolmogorov forward equation describing the time-dependent distribution of the state and running costs. This formulation is similar to the convex analytic method, in that the control problem is recast into a form where the objective is optimized over distributions representing the state space visitation frequencies. However, in our approach, the distributions are dynamic and also encode the cost distribution. As our main results, we prove the equivalence of the original martingale and dynamic analytic problems, in the sense that both have the same optimal values, and that the solution of either problem yields a solution of the other. Moreover, we find an optimal control process can be taken to be Markov in the controlled process state, running costs, and time. We further show that under additional assumptions the optimal value is attained. An example numeric problem is presented and solved.},

  abstract     = {One of the fundamental assumptions in stochastic control of continuous time processes is that the dynamics of the underlying (diffusion) process is known. This is, however, usually obviously not fulfilled in practice. On the other hand, over the last decades, a rich theory for nonparametric estimation of the drift (and volatility) for continuous time processes has been developed. The aim of this paper is bringing together techniques from stochastic control with methods from statistics for stochastic processes to find a way to both learn the dynamics of the underlying process and control in a reasonable way at the same time. More precisely, we study a long-term average impulse control problem, a stochastic version of the classical Faustmann timber harvesting problem. One of the problems that immediately arises is an exploration-exploitation dilemma as is well known for problems in machine learning. We propose a way to deal with this issue by combining exploration and exploitation periods in a suitable way. Our main finding is that this construction can be based on the rates of convergence of estimators for the invariant density. Using this, we obtain that the average cumulated regret is of uniform order O(T−1/3).},

In the special case where π is k-homogeneous, our results imply the celebrated concentration inequality for Lipschitz functions due to Pemantle and Peres (Combin. Probab. Comput. 23 (2014) 140–160). As another application, we deduce that the natural Monte-Carlo Markov chain used to sample from π has mixing time at most knloglog1π(x) when initialized in state x.

The subsets are called the “large sets”, and are chosen to rule out some “bad” states which have poor drift property when the dimension of the state space gets large. Using the “large sets” together with a “fitted family of drift functions”, a quantitative bound can be obtained which can be translated into a tight complexity bound. As a demonstration, we analyze several Gibbs samplers and obtain complexity upper bounds for the mixing time. In particular, for one example of Gibbs sampler which is related to the James–Stein estimator, we show that the number of iterations required for the Gibbs sampler to converge is constant under certain conditions on the observed data and the initial state. It is our hope that this modified drift-and-minorization approach can be employed in many other specific examples to obtain complexity bounds for high-dimensional Markov chains.},

We adopt a game-theoretic approach to study such problems, meaning that we seek for subgame perfect Nash equilibrium points. As a first novelty of this work, we introduce and motivate a refinement of the definition of equilibrium that allows us to establish a direct and rigorous proof of an extended dynamic programming principle, in the same spirit as in the classical theory. This in turn allows us to introduce a system consisting of an infinite family of backward stochastic differential equations analogous to the classical HJB equation. We prove that this system is fundamental, in the sense that its well-posedness is both necessary and sufficient to characterise the value function and equilibria. As a final step, we provide an existence and uniqueness result. Some examples and extensions of our results are also presented.},

In this work, we focus on the convergence of the thermodynamic limit, establishing convergence of the finite-volume distributions with Dirichlet boundary conditions to translation-covariant (gradient) Gibbs measures. Specifically, it is shown that, when the law of the random field has finite second moment and is symmetric, the distribution of the gradient of the surface converges in dimensions d≥4 while the distribution of the surface itself converges in dimensions d≥5.

  abstract     = {Despite the widespread usage of discrete generation ensemble Kalman particle filtering methodology to solve nonlinear and high-dimensional filtering and inverse problems, little is known about their mathematical foundations. As genetic-type particle filters (a.k.a. sequential Monte Carlo), this ensemble-type methodology can also be interpreted as mean-field particle approximations of the Kalman–Bucy filtering equation. In contrast with conventional mean-field type interacting particle methods equipped with a globally Lipschitz interacting drift-type function, Ensemble Kalman filters depend on a nonlinear and quadratic-type interaction function defined in terms of the sample covariance of the particles. Most of the literature in applied mathematics and computer science on these sophisticated interacting particle methods amounts to designing different classes of useable observer-type particle methods. These methods are based on a variety of inconsistent but judicious ensemble auxiliary transformations or include additional inflation/localisation-type algorithmic innovations, in order to avoid the inherent time-degeneracy of an insufficient particle ensemble size when solving a filtering problem with an unstable signal. To the best of our knowledge, the first and the only rigorous mathematical analysis of these sophisticated discrete generation particle filters is developed in the pioneering articles by Le Gland–Monbet–Tran and by Mandel–Cobb–Beezley, which were published in the early 2010s. Nevertheless, besides the fact that these studies prove the asymptotic consistency of the ensemble Kalman filter, they provide exceedingly pessimistic mean-error estimates that grow exponentially fast with respect to the time horizon, even for linear Gaussian filtering problems with stable one-dimensional signals. In the present article we develop a novel self-contained and complete stochastic perturbation analysis of the fluctuations, the stability, and the long-time performance of these discrete generation ensemble Kalman particle filters, including time-uniform and nonasymptotic mean-error estimates that apply to possibly unstable signals. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this type in the literature on discrete generation particle filters, including the class of genetic-type particle filters and discrete generation ensemble Kalman filters. The stochastic Riccati difference equations considered in this work are also of interest in their own right, as a prototype of a new class of stochastic rational difference equation.},

  abstract     = {Consider a multitype branching process in a random environment, whose reproduction law of generation n depends on the random environment at time n, unlike a constant distribution assumed in the Galton–Watson process. The famous Kesten–Stigum theorem for a supercritical multitype Galton–Watson process gives a precise description of the exponential increasing rate of the population size via a criterion for the nondegeneracy of the fundamental martingale. Finding the corresponding result in the random environment case is a longstanding problem. For the single-type case the problem has been solved by Athreya and Karlin for the sufficiency (Ann. Math. Stat. 42 (1971) 1499–1520) and Tanny for the necessity (Stochastic Process. Appl. 28 (1988) 123–139), but for the multitype case it has been open for 50 years. Here we solve this problem in the typical case, by constructing a suitable martingale which reduces to the fundamental one in the constat environment case, and by establishing a criterion for the nondegeneracy of its limit. The convergence in law of the direction of the branching process is also considered. Our results open ways in establishing other limit theorems, such as law of large numbers, central limit theorems, Berry–Essen bound, and large deviation results.},

We consider different regimes depending on the entering and exiting rates as well as on the rates in the bulk, and show that the process exhibits pre-cutoff and in some cases cutoff. Our main contribution is to study mixing times for the asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries. We show that the order of the mixing time can be linear or exponential in the size of the segment depending on the choice of the boundary parameters, proving a strikingly different (and richer) behavior for the simple exclusion process with open boundaries than for the process on the closed segment. Our arguments combine coupling, second class particle and censoring techniques with current estimates. A novel idea is the use of multi-species particle arguments, where the particles only obey a partial ordering.},

The process takes place on a growing sequence of graphs which we assume to be finite-dimensional, in the sense that the random walk on those geometries satisfies a family of Nash inequalities. As a byproduct of our analysis, we provide a complete picture of the total variation mixing of a discrete dual of the averaging process, which we call binomial splitting process. A single particle of this process is essentially the random walk on the underlying graph. When several particles evolve together, they interact by synchronizing their jumps when placed on neighboring sites. We show that, given k the number of particles and n the (growing) size of the underlying graph, the system exhibits cutoff in total variation if k→∞ and k=O(n2). Finally, we exploit the duality between the two processes to show that the binomial splitting process satisfies a version of Aldous’ spectral gap identity, namely, the relaxation time of the process is independent of the number of particles.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, an intensive study of strong approximation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a drift coefficient that has discontinuities in space has begun. In the majority of these results it is assumed that the drift coefficient satisfies piecewise regularity conditions and that the diffusion coefficient is globally Lipschitz continuous and nondegenerate at the discontinuities of the drift coefficient. Under this type of assumptions the best Lp-error rate obtained so far for approximation of scalar SDEs at the final time is 3/4 in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving Brownian motion. In the present article, we prove for the first time in the literature sharp lower error bounds for such SDEs. We show that for a huge class of additive noise driven SDEs of this type the Lp-error rate 3/4 can not be improved. For the proof of this result we employ a novel technique by studying equations with coupled noise: we reduce the analysis of the Lp-error of an arbitrary approximation based on evaluation of the driving Brownian motion at finitely many times to the analysis of the Lp-distance of two solutions of the same equation that are driven by Brownian motions that are coupled at the given time-points and independent, conditioned on their values at these points. To obtain lower bounds for the latter quantity, we prove a new quantitative version of positive association for bivariate normal random variables (Y,Z) by providing explicit lower bounds for the covariance Cov(f(Y),g(Z)) in case of piecewise Lipschitz continuous functions f and g. In addition it turns out that our proof technique also leads to lower error bounds for estimating occupation time functionals ∫01f(Wt)dt of a Brownian motion W, which substantially extends known results for the case of f being an indicator function.},

Recently, Damron, Gravner, Junge, Lyu, and Sivakoff ((2019) Ann. Appl. Probab. 29 2089–2113) introduced a model in which cars are both placed and move at random. Independently at each point of a Cayley graph G, we place a car with probability p, and otherwise an empty parking space. Each car independently executes a random walk until it finds an empty space in which to park. In this paper we introduce three new techniques for studying the model, namely the space-based parking model, and the strategies for parking and for car removal. These allow us to study the original model by coupling it with models where parking behaviour is easier to control. Applying our methods to the one-dimensional parking problem in Z, we improve on previous work, showing that for p&lt;1/2 the expected journey length of a car is finite, and for p=1/2 the expected journey length by time t grows like t3/4 up to a polylogarithmic factor.},

In the classical setting, the number of players is large but fixed throughout the game. However, in various applications, such as population dynamics or economic growth, the number of players can vary across time and this may lead to different Nash equilibria. In order to account for this evolution, we introduce a branching mechanism in the population of agents and obtain a variant of the original mean field game problem. As a first step, we study a simple model using a PDE approach to illustrate the main differences with the classical setting. We prove existence of a solution and show that it provides an approximate Nash-equilibrium for large population games. We also present a numerical example for a linear–quadratic model. Then we study the problem in a general setting by a probabilistic approach. It is based upon the relaxed formulation of stochastic control problems which allows us to obtain a general existence result.},

With size n on each side and for 1 2&gt;λ&gt;0, a λ-dense bipartite graph has all degrees greater than (λ+1 2)n. Second, practical applications of the algorithm requires many calls to matching algorithms. A novel preprocessing step is provided which makes significant improvements. Third, three applications are provided. The first is for counting Latin squares, the second is a practical way of computing the greedy algorithm for a card guessing game with feedback and the third is for stochastic block models. In all three examples, sequential importance sampling allows treating practical problems of reasonably large sizes.},

To encode sparsity we work in the framework of local weak convergence of marked (random) graphs. We show that the joint law of the particle system varies continuously with respect to local weak convergence of the underlying graph marked with the initial conditions. In addition, we show that the global empirical measure converges to a nonrandom limit for a large class of graph sequences including sparse Erdős–Rényi graphs and configuration models, whereas the empirical measure of the connected component of a uniformly random vertex converges to a random limit. Along the way, we develop some related results on the time-propagation of ergodicity and empirical field convergence, as well as some general results on local weak convergence of Gibbs measures in the uniqueness regime which appear to be new. The results obtained here are also useful for obtaining autonomous descriptions of marginal dynamics of interacting diffusions and Markov chains on sparse graphs. While limits of interacting particle systems on dense graphs have been extensively studied, there are relatively few works that have studied the sparse regime in generality.},

Under broad conditions, it is shown that a suitably scaled sequence of the iterates has a differential inclusion limit. In addition, it is shown for the first time that a centered and scaled sequence of the iterates converges weakly to a stochastic differential inclusion limit. The results are then used to treat several application examples including Markov decision processes, Lasso algorithms, Pegasos algorithms, support vector machine classification, and learning.

More precisely, the objective of this paper is to control the distance of the standard Euler scheme with decreasing step (usually called unadjusted Langevin algorithm in the Monte Carlo literature) to the invariant distribution of such an ergodic diffusion. In an appropriate Lyapunov setting and under uniform ellipticity assumptions on the diffusion coefficient, we establish (or improve) such bounds for total variation and L1-Wasserstein distances in both multiplicative and additive and frameworks.

The k-PM RW selects k pairs uniformly at random, disassociates the corresponding 2k objects, then chooses a new pairing on these 2k objects uniformly at random. The equilibrium distribution is uniform over all n-PMs. The 2-PM RW was first introduced by Diaconis and Holmes (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 (1998) 14600–14602; Electron. J. Probab. 7 (2002) no. 6), seen as a RW on phylogenetic trees. They established cutoff in this case. We establish cutoff for the k-PM RW whenever 2≤k≪n.

  abstract     = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are a class of repulsive point processes, popular for their relative simplicity. They are traditionally defined via their marginal distributions, but a subset of DPPs called “L-ensembles” have tractable likelihoods and are thus particularly easy to work with. Indeed, in many applications, DPPs are more naturally defined based on the L-ensemble formulation rather than through the marginal kernel. The fact that not all DPPs are L-ensembles is unfortunate, but there is a unifying description. We introduce here extended L-ensembles, and show that all DPPs are extended L-ensembles (and vice versa). Extended L-ensembles have very simple likelihood functions, contain L-ensembles and projection DPPs as special cases. From a theoretical standpoint, they fix some pathologies in the usual formalism of DPPs, for instance, the fact that projection DPPs are not L-ensembles. From a practical standpoint, they extend the set of kernel functions that may be used to define DPPs: we show that conditional positive definite kernels are good candidates for defining DPPs, including DPPs that need no spatial scale parameter. Finally, extended L-ensembles are based on so-called “saddle-point matrices”, and we prove an extension of the Cauchy–Binet theorem for such matrices that may be of independent interest.},

We distinguish between different types of transfer matrices and analyze completely the hyperbolic part of the recurrence. As a result, we obtain a new coupling between φN and a Gaussian analytic function with an error which is uniform away from the support of the semicircle law. We use this as input to give the almost sure scaling limit of the characteristic polynomial at the edge in (Lambert and Paquette (2020)). This is also required to obtain analogous strong approximations inside of the bulk of the semicircle law.

The rates are for the d2-, d3-, and dconvex-distances and are in general unimprovable. When we compare with a centered Gaussian random vector, whose covariance matrix is given by the asymptotic covariances, the rates are governed by the rate of convergence of s−1Cov(Hs(i),Hs(j)), i,j∈{1,…,m}, to the limiting covariance, shown to be at most of order s−1/d.

This case has not yet been studied in the context of directed polymers and presents key differences with the simple symmetric random walk case and the cases where the increments belong to the domain of attraction of an α-stable law, where α∈(0,2]. We establish the absence of a very strong disorder regime—that is, the free energy equals zero at every temperature—for every disorder distribution. We also prove that a strong disorder regime (partition function converging to zero at low temperature) may exist or not depending on finer properties of the random walk: we establish nonmatching necessary and sufficient conditions for having a phase transition from weak to strong disorder. In particular our results imply that for this directed polymer model, very strong disorder is not equivalent to strong disorder, shedding a new light on a long standing conjecture concerning the original nearest-neighbor DPRE.},

Going beyond the well-studied tracial mode, Trf(W), which is equivalent to the customary linear statistics of eigenvalues, we show that Trf(W)A is asymptotically normal for any nontrivial bounded deterministic matrix A. We identify three different and asymptotically independent modes of this fluctuation, corresponding to the tracial part, the traceless diagonal part and the off-diagonal part of f(W) in the entire mesoscopic regime, where we find that the off-diagonal modes fluctuate on a much smaller scale than the tracial mode. As a main motivation to study CLT in such generality on small mesoscopic scales, we determine the fluctuations in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (Phys. Rev. A 43 (1991) 2046–2049), that is, prove that the eigenfunction overlaps with any deterministic matrix are asymptotically Gaussian after a small spectral averaging. Finally, in the macroscopic regime our result also generalizes (Zh. Mat. Fiz. Anal. Geom. 9 (2013) 536–581, 611, 615) to complex W and to all crossover ensembles in between. The main technical inputs are the recent multiresolvent local laws with traceless deterministic matrices from the companion paper (Comm. Math. Phys. 388 (2021) 1005–1048).},

Such a blow-up can result in a discontinuity of the liquid-solid boundary. In this paper, we prove that the natural Euler time-stepping scheme applied to a probabilistic formulation of the supercooled Stefan problem converges to the liquid-solid boundary of its physical solution globally in time, in the Skorokhod M1 topology. In the course of the proof, we give an explicit bound on the rate of local convergence for the time-stepping scheme.

We consider classic and randomized stopping times represented by linear and nonlinear functionals of the rough path signature X&lt;∞ associated to X, and prove that maximizing over these classes of signature stopping times, in fact, solves the original optimal stopping problem. Using the algebraic properties of the signature, we can then recast the problem as a (deterministic) optimization problem depending only on the (truncated) expected signature E[X0,T≤N]. By applying a deep neural network approach to approximate the nonlinear signature functionals, we can efficiently solve the optimal stopping problem numerically. The only assumption on the process X is that it is a continuous (geometric) random rough path. Hence, the theory encompasses processes such as fractional Brownian motion, which fail to be either semimartingales or Markov processes, and can be used, in particular, for American-type option pricing in fractional models, for example, on financial or electricity markets.},

  abstract     = {With the recent developments on nonlinear SPDEs, where smoothing of rough noises is needed, one is naturally led to study interacting particle systems whose macroscopic evolution is described by these equations and which possess an in-built smoothing. In this article, our main results are to derive regularized versions of the ill-posed one-dimensional SPDE ∂tρ=1 2ΔΦ(ρ)−2∇(W′Φ(ρ)), where the spatial white noise W′ is replaced by a regularization Wε′, as quenched and annealed hydrodynamic limits of zero-range interacting particle systems in ε-regularized Sinai-type random environments. Some computations are also made about annealed mean hydrodynamic limits in unregularized Sinai-type random environments with respect to independent particles.},

  abstract     = {Given a sequence of i.i.d. random functions Ψn:R→R, n∈N, we consider the iterated function system and Markov chain, which is recursively defined by X0x:=x and Xnx:=Ψn−1(Xn−1x) for x∈R and n∈N. Under the two basic assumptions that the Ψn are a.s. continuous at any point in R and asymptotically linear at the “endpoints” ±∞, we study the tail behavior of the stationary laws of such Markov chains by means of Markov renewal theory. Our approach provides an extension of Goldie’s implicit renewal theory (Ann. Appl. Probab. (1991) 1 126–166) and can also be viewed as an adaptation of Kesten’s work on products of random matrices (Acta Math. (1973) 131 207–248) to one-dimensional function systems as described. Our results have applications in quite different areas of applied probability like queuing theory, econometrics, mathematical finance and population dynamics, for example, ARCH models and random logistic transforms.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and study a new percolation model, inspired by recent works on jigsaw percolation, graph bootstrap percolation, and percolation in polluted environments. Start with an oriented graph G0 of initially occupied edges on n vertices, and iteratively occupy additional (oriented) edges by transitivity, with the constraint that only open edges in a certain random set can ever be occupied. All other edges are closed, creating a set of obstacles for the spread of occupied edges. When G0 is an unoriented linear graph, and leftward and rightward edges are open independently with possibly different probabilities, we identify three regimes in which the set of eventually occupied edges is either all open edges, the majority of open edges in one direction, or only a very small proportion of all open edges. In the more general setting where G0 is a connected unoriented graph of bounded degree, we show that the transition between sparse and full occupation of open edges occurs when the probability of open edges is (logn)−1/2+o(1). We conclude with several conjectures and open problems.},

We show that this converges weakly to a gamma distribution after dividing by n. As a consequence, we find that the size of the t-core is of the order of n in expectation. We then apply this result to show that the probability that t divides the hook length of a uniformly random cell in a uniformly random partition equals 1/t in the limit. Finally, we extend this result to all modulo classes of t using abacus representations for cores and quotients.},

  abstract     = {This work studies approximation based on single-hidden-layer feedforward and recurrent neural networks with randomly generated internal weights. These methods, in which only the last layer of weights and a few hyperparameters are optimized, have been successfully applied in a wide range of static and dynamic learning problems. Despite the popularity of this approach in empirical tasks, important theoretical questions regarding the relation between the unknown function, the weight distribution, and the approximation rate have remained open. In this work it is proved that, as long as the unknown function, functional, or dynamical system is sufficiently regular, it is possible to draw the internal weights of the random (recurrent) neural network from a generic distribution (not depending on the unknown object) and quantify the error in terms of the number of neurons and the hyperparameters. In particular, this proves that echo state networks with randomly generated weights are capable of approximating a wide class of dynamical systems arbitrarily well and thus provides the first mathematical explanation for their empirically observed success at learning dynamical systems.},

Specifically, we study the rescaled block size spectrum of Π(t) and of its restriction Πn(t) to {1,…,n}. Our main result is a law of large numbers type of result if Π comes down from infinity. In the case of Kingman’s coalescent the derivation of this so-called hydrodynamic limit has been known since the work of Smoluchowski (Z. Phys. 17 (1916) 557–585). We extend Smoluchowski’s result to beta coalescents and show that if Π comes down from infinity both rescaled spectra n−1(c1Π(tτn),…,cnΠ(tτn)),andn−1(c1Πn(tτn),…,cnΠn(tτn)), converge to (different) deterministic limits that we compute explicitly in terms of partial Bell polynomials. Here ciπ counts the number of blocks of size i in a partition π, and (τn) is a sequence such that τn∼n−(1−a) as n→∞. Along the way we study the nontrivial limits of the rescaled block counting processes {nα#Πn(tτn),t≥0}, and {nα#Π(tτn),t≥0}, where α∈[−1,−2/(3−a)), and τn∼nα(1−a) if Π comes down from infinity.},
