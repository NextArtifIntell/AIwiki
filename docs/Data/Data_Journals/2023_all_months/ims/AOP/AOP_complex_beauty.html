For a Poisson system over a group belonging to a slightly more restrictive class than above, we further prove it splits into two Poisson systems whose intensities sum to the intensity of the original, generalizing the same result for Poisson systems over Euclidean space proved by Holroyd, Lyons and Soo.},

The outcome of the process is a forest consisting of k(n) trees, each containing exactly one source. Let Mn be the size of the largest tree in this forest. Logan, Molloy and Pralat (2018) proved that if k(n)/n1/3→0 then Mn/n→1 in probability. In this paper, we prove a complementary result: if k(n)/n1/3→∞, then Mn/n→0 in probability. This establishes the existence of a phase transition in the structure of the invasion percolation forest around k(n)≍n1/3. Our arguments rely on the connection between invasion percolation and critical percolation, and on a coupling between multisource invasion percolation with differently-sized source sets. A substantial part of the proof is devoted to showing that, with high probability, a certain fragmentation process on large random binary trees leaves no components of macroscopic size.},

For example, if neither B1 nor B2 is identically equal to zero, then the set of points disconnected from ∞ by the Loewner hull has nonempty interior at each time. We also show that our model exhibits three phases analogous to the phases of SLE: a phase where the hulls have zero Lebesgue measure, a phase where points are swallowed but not hit by the hulls and a phase where the hulls are space-filling. The phase boundaries are expressed in terms of the signs of explicit integrals. These boundaries have a simple closed form when the correlation of the two Brownian motions is zero.},

In addition, we study a parameter-dependent version of the SDE and prove smoothness of the stationary density, jointly in the parameter and the spatial coordinate. With this, we revisit the fractional averaging principle of Li and Sieber (Ann. Appl. Probab. 32 (2022) 3964–4003) and remove an ad hoc assumption on the limiting coefficients.

A 142 (2016) 1–28) established a phase transition for this process when m≈n2. In this work, we couple this model with a variant of the classical Erdős–Rényi random graph process. This enables us to describe the phase transition for the size of the components of parked cars using a modification of the multiplicative coalescent which we name the frozen multiplicative coalescent. The geometry of critical parked clusters is also studied. Those trees are very different from Bienaymé–Galton–Watson trees and should converge towards the growth-fragmentation trees canonically associated to the 3/2-stable process that already appeared in the study of random planar maps.},

More precisely, we consider a smooth stationary centred planar Gaussian field f and, given a level ℓ∈R, we study the connectivity properties of the excursion set {f≥−ℓ}. We prove the existence of a phase transition at the critical level ℓcrit=0 under only symmetry and (very mild) correlation decay assumptions, which are satisfied by the random plane wave for instance. As a consequence, all nonzero level lines are bounded almost surely, although our result does not settle the boundedness of zero level lines (‘no percolation at criticality’). To show our main result: (i) we prove a general sharp threshold criterion, inspired by works of Chatterjee, that states that ‘sharp thresholds are equivalent to the delocalisation of the threshold location’; (ii) we prove threshold delocalisation for crossing events at large scales—at this step we obtain a sharp threshold result but without being able to locate the threshold—and (iii) to identify the threshold, we adapt Tassion’s RSW theory replacing the FKG inequality by a sprinkling procedure. Although some arguments are specific to the Gaussian setting, many steps are very general and we hope that our techniques may be adapted to analyse other models without FKG.},

The generator of the process is assumed to contain two parts: the main part that degenerates on the boundary in a direction orthogonal to the boundary and a small nondegenerate perturbation. The behavior of such processes determines the stabilization of solutions to the corresponding parabolic equations with a small parameter. Metastability effects arise in this case: the asymptotics of solutions, as the size of the perturbation tends to zero, depends on the time scale. Initial-boundary value problems with both the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions are considered. We also consider periodic homogenization for operators with degeneration.},

Tóth in 1996, together with techniques developed for excited random walks as main tools for establishing positive and negative results concerning convergence of some classes of diffusively scaled self-interacting random walks (SIRW) to Brownian motions perturbed at extrema (BMPE). Tóth’s work studied two classes of SIRWs: asymptotically free and polynomially self-repelling walks. For both classes Tóth has shown, in particular, that the distribution function of a scaled SIRW observed at independent geometric times converges to that of a BMPE indicated by the generalized Ray–Knight theorem for this SIRW. The question of weak convergence of one-dimensional distributions of scaled SIRW remained open. In this paper, on the one hand, we prove a full functional limit theorem for a large class of asymptotically free SIRWs, which includes the asymptotically free walks considered by Tóth. On the other hand, we show that rescaled polynomially self-repelling SIRWs do not converge to the BMPE predicted by the corresponding generalized Ray–Knight theorems and hence do not converge to any BMPE.},

  abstract     = {Approximate Message Passing (AMP) is a class of iterative algorithms that have found applications in many problems in high-dimensional statistics and machine learning. In its general form, AMP can be formulated as an iterative procedure driven by a matrix M. Theoretical analyses of AMP typically assume strong distributional properties on M, such as M has i.i.d. sub-Gaussian entries or is drawn from a rotational invariant ensemble. However, numerical experiments suggest that the behavior of AMP is universal as long as the eigenvectors of M are generic. In this paper we take the first step in rigorously understanding this universality phenomenon. In particular, we investigate a class of memory-free AMP algorithms (proposed by Çakmak and Opper for mean-field Ising spin glasses) and show that their asymptotic dynamics is universal on a broad class of semirandom matrices. In addition to having the standard rotational invariant ensemble as a special case, the class of semirandom matrices that we define in this work also includes matrices constructed with very limited randomness. One such example is a randomly signed version of the sine model, introduced by Marinari, Parisi, Potters, and Ritort for spin glasses with fully deterministic couplings.},

We also study the tail behavior of negatively associated Gaussian and Gaussian threshold processes. We show that these processes are tail trivial though, in general, they do not satisfy the summable covariances property. Furthermore, we construct negatively associated Gaussian threshold vectors that are not strongly Rayleigh.

As n tends to infinity, decreasing subsequences in the permutation will appear as curves in the plane, and by interpreting these as level curves, a union of decreasing subsequences give rise to a surface. We show that, under the correct scaling, for any r≥0, the largest union of ⌊rn⌋ decreasing subsequences approaches a limit surface as n tends to infinity, and the limit surface is a solution to a specific variational problem. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a limit shape for the Young diagram associated to the random permutation under the Robinson–Schensted correspondence. In the special case where ρ is the uniform distribution on the diamond |x|+|y|&lt;1, we conjecture that the limit shape is triangular, and assuming the conjecture is true, we find an explicit formula for the limit surfaces of a uniformly random permutation and recover the famous limit shape of Vershik, Kerov and Logan, Shepp.},

On the other hand, surprisingly, as soon as the noise has a finite moment of order 2d, where d is the spatial dimension, the largest peaks will be of the same order for both additive and multiplicative noise, which is in sharp contrast to the behavior of the solution under Gaussian noise. However, in this case a closer inspection reveals a second layer of peaks, beneath the largest peaks, that is exclusive to multiplicative noise and that can be observed by sampling the solution on the lattice. Finally, we compute the macroscopic Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions of the intermittency islands of the solution. Under both additive and multiplicative noise, if it is not too heavy-tailed, the largest peaks will be self-similar in terms of their large-scale multifractal behavior.

The digraph has a bow-tie structure, with all but a vanishing fraction of nodes lying either in the unique strongly connected giant and its fan-in and fan-out or in sets with small fan-in and small fan-out. All local quantities are expressed in terms of percolation on the limiting rooted graph, without any structural assumptions on the limit, allowing, in particular, for nontree-like graphs. In the course of establishing these results, we generalize previous results on the locality of the size of the giant to expanders of bounded average degree with possibly nontree-like limits. We also show that, regardless of the local convergence of a sequence, the uniqueness of the giant and convergence of its relative size for unoriented percolation imply the bow-tie structure for directed percolation. An application of our methods shows that the critical threshold for bond percolation and random digraphs on preferential attachment graphs is pc=0 with an infinite order phase transition at pc.},

We obtain estimates on the order of magnitude of the secular coefficients for all β&gt;0, and we prove these estimates are sharp when β≥2 and N is sufficiently large with respect to n. These insights motivated us to introduce a new stochastic object associated with the secular coefficients, which we call Holomorphic Multiplicative Chaos (HMC). Viewing the HMC as a random distribution, we prove a sharp result about its regularity in an appropriate Sobolev space. Our proofs expose and exploit several novel connections with other areas, including random permutations, Tauberian theorems and combinatorics.},

We study a “height function,” which, for the special choice V(x)=e−x, coincides with the partition function of a stationary semidiscrete polymer, also known as the (stationary) O’Connell–Yor polymer. For a general class of smooth convex potentials (generalizing the O’Connell–Yor case), we obtain the order of fluctuations of the height function by proving matching upper and lower bounds for the variance of order N2/3, the expected scaling for models lying in the KPZ universality class. The models we study are not expected to be integrable, and our methods are analytic and nonperturbative, making no use of explicit formulas or any results for the O’Connell–Yor polymer.},

We also find several examples of surprising behaviour in the dependence of the distance to stationarity on the rates.

  abstract     = {We consider the Cole–Hopf solution of the (1+1)-dimensional KPZ equation started from the narrow wedge initial condition. In this article we ask how the peaks and valleys of the KPZ height function (centered by time/24) at any spatial point grow as time increases. Our first main result is about the law of iterated logarithms for the KPZ equation. As time variable t goes to ∞, we show that the limsup of the KPZ height function with the scaling by t1/3(loglogt)2/3 is almost surely equal to (3/4 2)2/3, whereas the liminf of the height function with the scaling by t1/3(loglogt)1/3 is almost surely equal to −61/3. Our second main result concerns with the macroscopic fractal properties of the KPZ equation. Under exponential transformation of the time variable, we show that the peaks of KPZ height function mutate from being monofractal to multifractal, a property reminiscent of a similar phenomenon in Brownian motion (Theorem 1.4 in Ann. Probab. 45 (2017) 3697–3751). The proofs of our main results hinge on the following three key tools: (1) a multipoint composition law of the KPZ equation which can be regarded as a generalization of the two point composition law from (Proposition 2.9 in Ann. Probab. 49 (2021) 832–876), (2) the Gibbsian line ensemble techniques from (Invent. Math. 195 (2014) 441–508; Probab. Theory Related Fields 166 (2016) 67–185; Ann. Probab. 49 (2021) 832–876), and (3) the tail probabilities of the KPZ height function in short time and its spatiotemporal modulus of continuity. We advocate this last tool as one of our new and important contributions which might garner independent interest.},

These results, together with techniques developed to obtain them, are sufficient to extend to isoradial graphs, the convergence results for multipoint spin correlations in bounded planar domains which were previously known only on the square grid. We also give a simple proof of the fact that the infinite-volume magnetization in a subcritical Z-invariant Ising model is independent of the site and of the lattice.

Then we investigate the high part of the spectrum of the Anderson Hamiltonian HL:=−∂t2+dB on the segment [0,L] with white noise potential dB, when L→∞. We show that the operator HL, recentred around energy levels E∼L/τ and unitarily transformed, converges in law as L→∞ to CSτ in an appropriate sense. This allows us to answer a conjecture of Rifkind and Virág on the behavior of the eigenvectors of HL. Our approach also explains how such an operator arises in the limit of HL. Finally we show that, at higher energy levels, the Anderson Hamiltonian matches (asymptotically in L) with the unperturbed Laplacian −∂t2. In a companion paper, it is shown that, at energy levels much smaller than L, the spectrum is localized with Poisson statistics: the present paper, therefore, identifies the delocalized phase of the Anderson Hamiltonian.},

As it often happens, Gaussianity can be relaxed, and this results holds when E[a11]=0, E[a112]=1 and the tail of a11 decays sufficiently fast: limx→∞x4P(|a11|&gt;x)=0, whereas when the law of a11 is regularly varying with index α∈(0,4), ca(n)n1/2−2/αλ1(A) converges to a Fréchet distribution for ca:(0,∞)→(0,∞), slowly varying and depending solely on the law of a11. This paper considers a family of edge cases, limx→∞x4P(|a11|&gt;x)=c∈(0,∞), and unveils a new type of limiting behavior for λ1(A): a continuous function of a Fréchet distribution in which 2, the almost sure limit of λ1(A) in the light-tailed case, plays a pivotal role: f(x)=2,0&lt;x&lt;1,x+1 x,x≥1.},

In the last 50 years, much research has been done to adapt and strengthen this method to a variety of different settings and other limiting distributions. However, it has not been yet extended to study conditional convergences. In this article we develop a novel approach, using Stein’s method for exchangeable pairs, to find a rate of convergence in the conditional central limit theorem of the form (Xn∣Yn=k), where (Xn,Yn) are asymptotically jointly Gaussian, and extend this result to a multivariate version. We apply our general result to several concrete examples, including pattern count in a random binary sequence and subgraph count in Erdős–Rényi random graph.},

Our main technical result provides sufficient conditions on the maximum degrees of a uniform hypergraph H that guarantee that the logarithmic lower tail probabilities for the number of edges, induced by a binomial random subset of the vertices of H, can be well approximated by considering only product distributions. This may be interpreted as a weak, probabilistic version of the hypergraph container lemma that is applicable to all sparser-than-average (and not only independent) sets.},

  abstract     = {We consider percolation on Zd and on the d-dimensional discrete torus, in dimensions d≥11 for the nearest-neighbour model and in dimensions d&gt;6 for spread-out models. For Zd we employ a wide range of techniques and previous results to prove that there exist positive constants c and C such that the slightly subcritical two-point function and one-arm probabilities satisfy Ppc−ε(0↔x)≤C‖x‖d−2e−cε1/2‖x‖,cr2e−Cε1/2r≤Ppc−ε(0↔∂[−r,r]d)≤Cr2e−cε1/2r. Using this, we prove that throughout the critical window the torus two-point function has a “plateau,” meaning that it decays for small x as ‖x‖−(d−2) but for large x is essentially constant and of order V−2/3 where V is the volume of the torus. The plateau for the two-point function leads immediately to a proof of the torus triangle condition, which is known to have many implications for the critical behaviour on the torus, and also leads to a proof that the critical values on the torus and on Zd are separated by a multiple of V−1/3. The torus triangle condition and the size of the separation of critical points have been proved previously, but our proofs are different and are direct consequences of the bound on the Zd two-point function. In particular, we use results derived from the lace expansion on Zd, but in contrast to previous work on high-dimensional torus percolation, we do not need or use a separate torus lace expansion.},

We illustrate this by providing explicit cutoffs on discrete lattices of arbitrary dimensions and boundary conditions which substantially generalize recent one-dimensional results. We also obtain cutoff phenomena in relative entropy, Hilbert norm, separation distance, and supremum norm. Our proof exploits negative dependence in a novel, simple way to reduce the understanding of the whole process to that of single-site marginals.

The novelty is the introduction of an ϵ2 term in the variation allowing greater control. We also construct a family of cut-off stochastic processes adapted to an exhaustion by compact subsets with smooth boundaries, each process is constructed path by path and differentiable in time. Furthermore, the differentials have locally uniformly bounded moments with respect to the Brownian motion measures, allowing to bypass the lack of continuity of the exit time of the Brownian motions on its initial position.},

This approach is based on properties of the resolvent equations and can be applied to metastable dynamics, which do not satisfy the mixing conditions required in (J. Stat. Phys. 140 (2010) 1065–1114; J. Stat. Phys. 149 (2012) 598–618) or in Landim, Marcondes and Seo (2020). As an application, we study the metastable behavior of critical zero-range processes. Let r:S×S→R+ be the jump rates of an irreducible random walk on a finite set S, reversible with respect to the uniform measure. For α&gt;0, let g:N→R+ be given by g(0)=0, g(1)=1, g(k)=[k/(k−1)]α, k≥2. Consider a zero-range process on S in which a particle jumps from a site x, occupied by k particles, to a site y at rate g(k)r(x,y). For α≥1, in the stationary state, as the total number of particles, represented by N, tends to infinity, all particles but a negligible number accumulate at one single site. This phenomenon is called condensation. Since condensation occurs if and only if α≥1, we call the case α=1 critical. By applying the general method established in the first part of the article to the critical case, we show that the site, which concentrates almost all particles, evolves in the time-scale N2logN as a random walk on S whose transition rates are proportional to the capacities of the underlying random walk.},

We consider FPP on Zd for d≥2 and analyze the geometric properties of geodesics, which are optimizing paths for the metric. Specifically, we address the question of existence of bigeodesics, which are doubly-infinite paths whose subpaths are geodesics. It is a famous conjecture originating from a question of Furstenberg and most strongly supported for d=2 that, for continuously distributed i.i.d. weights, there a.s. are no bigeodesics. We provide the first progress on this question in general dimensions under no unproven assumptions. Our main result is that geodesic graphs, introduced in a previous paper of two of the authors, constructed in any deterministic direction a.s. do not contain doubly-infinite paths. As a consequence, one can construct random graphs of subsequential limits of point-to-hyperplane geodesics, which contain no bigeodesics. This gives evidence that bigeodesics, if they exist, cannot be constructed in a translation-invariant manner as limits of point-to-hyperplane geodesics.},

  abstract     = {We prove a metric space scaling limit for a critical random graph with independent and identically distributed degrees having power-law tail behaviour with exponent α+1, where α∈(1,2). The limiting components are constructed from random R-trees encoded by the excursions above its running infimum of a process whose law is locally absolutely continuous with respect to that of a spectrally positive α-stable Lévy process. These spanning R-trees are measure-changed α-stable trees. In each such R-tree, we make a random number of vertex identifications, whose locations are determined by an auxiliary Poisson process. This generalises results, which were already known in the case where the degree distribution has a finite third moment (a model which lies in the same universality class as the Erdős–Rényi random graph) and where the role of the α-stable Lévy process is played by a Brownian motion.},
