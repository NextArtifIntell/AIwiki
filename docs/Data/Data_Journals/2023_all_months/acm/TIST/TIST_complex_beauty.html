  abstract     = {Intelligent systems support human operators’ decision-making processes, many of which are dynamic and involve temporal changes in the decision-related parameters. As we increasingly depend on automation, it becomes imperative to understand and quantify its influence on the operator’s decisions and to evaluate its implications for the human’s causal responsibility for outcomes. Past studies proposed a model for human responsibility in static decision-making processes involving intelligent systems. We present a model for dynamic, non-stationary decision-making events based on the concept of causation strength. We apply it to a test case of a dynamic binary categorization decision. The results show that for automation to influence humans significantly, it must have high detection sensitivity. However, this condition is insufficient since it is unlikely that automation, irrespective of its sensitivity, will sway humans with high detection sensitivity away from their original position. Specific combinations of automation and human detection sensitivities are required for automation to have a major influence. Moreover, the automation influence and the human causal responsibility that can be derived from it are sensitive to possible changes in the human’s detection capabilities due to fatigue or other factors, creating a “Responsibility Cliff.” This should be considered during system design and when policies and regulations are defined. This model constitutes a basis for further analyses of complex events in which human and automation sensitivity levels change over time and for evaluating human involvement in such events.},

  abstract     = {Time series data are ubiquitous in a variety of disciplines. Early classification of time series, which aims to predict the class label of a time series as early and accurately as possible, is a significant but challenging task in many time-sensitive applications. Existing approaches mainly utilize heuristic stopping rules to capture stopping signals from the prediction results of time series classifiers. However, heuristic stopping rules can only capture obvious stopping signals, which makes these approaches give either correct but late predictions or early but incorrect predictions. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel second-order confidence network for early classification of time series, which can automatically learn to capture implicit stopping signals in early time series in a unified framework. The proposed model leverages deep neural models to capture temporal patterns and outputs second-order confidence to reflect the implicit stopping signals. Specifically, our model exploits the data not only from a time step but also from the probability sequence to capture stopping signals. By combining stopping signals from the classifier output and the second-order confidence, we design a more robust trigger to decide whether or not to request more observations from future time steps. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve superior results in early classification compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

Although many intelligent systems require MFSM, MFSM is challenging compared to frequent subgraph mining (FSM), as maximal frequent subgraphs lie in the middle of graph lattice, and FSM algorithms must explore an exponential space and an NP-hard subroutine of frequency counting. Different from prior research, which primarily focused on optimal solutions, we introduce pmMine, a progressive graph neural framework designed for MFSM in a single large graph to attain an approximate solution. The framework combines isomorphic graph embedding, non-parametric partitioning, and an efficiently top-down pattern searching strategy. The critical insight that makes pmMine work is to define the concepts of rooted subgraph and isomorphic graph embedding, in which the costly isomorphism subroutine can be efficiently performed using similarity estimation in embedding space. In addition, pmMine returns the patterns identified during the mining process in a progressive manner. We validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our technique through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets spanning various domains.},

This task is referred to as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We consider the novel problem of OOD detection for the time-series domain. We discuss the unique challenges posed by time-series data and explain why prior methods from the image domain will perform poorly. Motivated by these challenges, this article proposes a novel Seasonal Ratio Scoring (SRS) approach. SRS consists of three key algorithmic steps. First, each input is decomposed into class-wise semantic component and remainder. Second, this decomposition is employed to estimate the class-wise conditional likelihoods of the input and remainder using deep generative models. The seasonal ratio score is computed from these estimates. Third, a threshold interval is identified from the in-distribution data to detect OOD examples. Experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the SRS method is well-suited for time-series OOD detection when compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {An Industrial Cyber-physical System (ICPS) provides a digital foundation for data-driven decision-making by artificial intelligence (AI) models. However, the poor data quality (e.g., inconsistent distribution, imbalanced classes) of high-speed, large-volume data streams poses significant challenges to the online deployment of offline-trained AI models. As an alternative, updating AI models online based on streaming data enables continuous improvement and resilient modeling performance. However, for a supervised learning model (i.e., a base learner), it is labor-intensive to annotate all streaming samples to update the model. Hence, a data acquisition method is needed to select the data for annotation to ensure data quality while saving annotation efforts. In the literature, active learning methods have been proposed to acquire informative samples. Different acquisition criteria were developed for exploration of under-represented regions in the input variable space or exploitation of the well-represented regions for optimal estimation of base learners. However, it remains a challenge to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off under different online annotation scenarios. On the other hand, an acquisition criterion learned by AI adapts itself to a scenario dynamically, but the ambiguous consideration of the trade-off limits its performance in frequently changing manufacturing contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ensemble active learning method by contextual bandits ( CbeAL ). CbeAL incorporates a set of active learning agents (i.e., acquisition criteria) explicitly designed for exploration or exploitation by a weighted combination of their acquisition decisions. The weight of each agent will be dynamically adjusted based on the usefulness of its decisions to improve the performance of the base learner. With adaptive and explicit consideration of both objectives, CbeAL efficiently guides the data acquisition process by selecting informative samples to reduce the human annotation efforts. Furthermore, we characterize the exploration and exploitation capability of the proposed agents theoretically. The evaluation results in a numerical simulation study and a real case study demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of CbeAL in manufacturing process modeling of the ICPS.},

Downstream methods perform this clustering sequentially: estimation of individual or consistent similarity matrices, spectral embedding, and clustering. In this article, we present an approach that can address some of the shortcomings of previous multiview clustering methods. We propose a single objective function whose optimization can jointly provide the consistent graph matrix for all views, the unified spectral data representation, the cluster assignments, and the view weights. We propose a new constraint term that sets the cluster index matrix to the convolution of the consistent spectral projection matrix over the consistent graph. Our proposed scheme has two interesting properties that the recent works do not have simultaneously. First, the cluster assignments can be estimated directly without the need for an additional clustering phase, which depends heavily on initialization. Second, the soft cluster assignments are directly linked to the kernel representation of the features of the views. Moreover, our method automatically computes the weights of each view, requiring fewer hyperparameters. We have conducted a series of experiments on real datasets. These demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which compares favorably to many competing multi-view clustering methods.},

Application of homomorphic encryption (HE) in a secure FL framework prevents the central server from accessing plaintext models. Thus, it is no longer feasible to embed the watermark at the central server using existing watermarking schemes. In this article, we propose a novel client-side FL watermarking scheme to tackle the copyright protection issue in secure FL with HE. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme to embed the watermark to models under a secure FL environment. We design a black-box watermarking scheme based on client-side backdooring to embed a pre-designed trigger set into an FL model by a gradient-enhanced embedding method. Additionally, we propose a trigger set construction mechanism to ensure that the watermark cannot be forged. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme delivers outstanding protection performance and robustness against various watermark removal attacks and ambiguity attack.},

  abstract     = {Sample inefficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods is a major obstacle for their use in real-world tasks as they naturally feature sparse rewards. In fact, this from-scratch approach is often impractical in environments where extreme negative outcomes are possible. Recent advances in imitation learning have improved sample efficiency by leveraging expert demonstrations. Most work along this line of research employs neural network-based approaches to recover an expert cost function. However, the complexity and lack of transparency make neural networks difficult to trust and deploy in the real world. In contrast, we present a method for extracting interpretable symbolic reward functions from expert data, which offers several advantages. First, the learned reward function can be parsed by a human to understand, verify and predict the behavior of the agent. Second, the reward function can be improved and modified by an expert. Finally, the structure of the reward function can be leveraged to extract explanations that encode richer domain knowledge than standard scalar rewards. To this end, we use an autoregressive recurrent neural network that generates hierarchical symbolic rewards represented by simple symbolic trees. The recurrent neural network is trained via risk-seeking policy gradients. We test our method in MuJoCo environments as well as a chemical plant simulator. We show that the discovered rewards can significantly accelerate the training process and achieve similar or better performance than neural network-based algorithms.},

Given a pair of images containing the source and target person, DFC-Net extracts pose and static information from the source and target respectively, then synthesizes an image of the target person with the desired pose from the source. Moreover, DFC-Net leverages disentangled feature consistency losses in the adversarial training to strengthen the transfer coherence and integrates a keypoint amplifier to enhance the pose feature extraction. With the help of the disentangled feature consistency losses, we further propose a novel data augmentation scheme that introduces unpaired support data with the augmented consistency constraints to improve the generality and robustness of DFC-Net. Extensive experimental results on Mixamo-Pose and EDN-10k have demonstrated DFC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on pose transfer.},

  abstract     = {The pedestrian attribute recognition aims to generate a structured description of pedestrians, which serves an important role in surveillance. Current works usually assume that the images and the specific pedestrian states, including pedestrian occlusion and pedestrian orientation, are given. However, we argue that the current works ignore the guidance of the pedestrian state and cannot achieve the appropriate performance since the appearance feature will become unreliable due to the variance of the pedestrian state, which is common in practice. Therefore, this paper proposes the Explicit State Representation (ExSR) Guided Pedestrian Attribute Recognition to improve the accuracy through state learning and attribute fusion among frames. Firstly, the pedestrian state is explicitly represented by concatenating the pedestrian orientation and occlusion, which can be accurately determined via analyzing the pose. Secondly, the state-aware pedestrian attribute fusion method is proposed and divided into two cases, namely the inter-state case and the intra-state case. In the intra-state case, the appearance feature will remain stable and the attribute relations are propagated to refine. The method of exploiting attribute relations within a single frame is the Graph Neural Network. In the inter-state case, the state changes, the attribute relationship propagation is prevented, and the advantages of attribute recognition in each frame are complemented to make a reliable judgment on the invisible region. The experimental results demonstrate that the ExSR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two public databases, benefiting from the explicit introduction of the state into the attribute recognition.},
