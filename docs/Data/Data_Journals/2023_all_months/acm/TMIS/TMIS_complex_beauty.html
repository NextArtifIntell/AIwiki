  abstract     = {With the uncertain trajectory of COVID-19 conditions worldwide, there lies the potential for emergencies to arise, abruptly yielding mass social and economic disruption. Gaining insight into how digital technologies may be leveraged for effective emergency response is therefore pertinent. Emergency-induced needs may prompt citizens to organize mutual aid initiatives where people give what they can and get what they need in response. An increasingly prominent technology used for emergency response, online collaboration tools (OCTs), enables the appropriate match between the supply of aid and its relevant demand in mutual aid initiatives by mediating information and interactions between participants. Through analysis of mutual aid cases during the 2022 Shanghai COVID-19 lockdown, this study elucidates the benefits OCTs provide through the lens of affordance theory and identifies five key affordances of OCTs for emergency mutual aid: persistent accessibility, iterative modifiability, structured consolidation and retrieval, multisynchronous participation, and multichannel broadcasting. We illustrate how such affordances are actualized and how their enabling features work across information flow processes, specifically highlighting benefits of software minimalism with implications for practitioners and future software design in emergency situations. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on OCTs and affordances by disentangling its role in emergency responses.},

  abstract     = {Orienteering or itinerary planning algorithms in tourism are used to optimize travel routes by considering user preference and other constraints, such as time budget or traffic conditions. For these algorithms, it is essential to explore the user preference to predict potential points of interest (POIs) or tourist routes. However, nowadays, user preference has been significantly affected by COVID-19, since health concern plays a key tradeoff role. For example, people may try to avoid crowdedness, even if there is a strong desire for social interaction. Thus, the orienteering or itinerary planning algorithms should optimize routes beyond user preference. Therefore, this article proposes a social sensing system that considers the tradeoff between user preference and various factors, such as crowdedness, personality, knowledge of COVID-19, POI features, and desire for socialization. The experiments are conducted on profiling user interests with a properly trained fastText neural network and a set of specialized Naïve Bayesian Classifiers based on the “Yelp!” dataset. Also, we demonstrate how to approach and integrate COVID-related factors via conversational agents. Furthermore, the proposed system is in a modular design and evaluated in a user study; thus, it can be efficiently adapted to different algorithms for COVID-19-aware itinerary planning.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic instigated the rapid shift to remote work and virtual interactions, constituting a new normal of professional interaction over information and communication technologies (ICT), such as videoconferencing platforms, email, and mobile devices. While ICT may provide many benefits for remote work, such as flexibility, reductions in travel time, and geographical interaction, ICT may also contribute to increases in job strain, reductions in social interactions, and the decline of mental health. While reliance on ICT for remote work interactions is becoming the new normal of organizational activity, scholarly appreciation of the stages in which employees, particularly educators, enact interactions over ICT is limited. Further, the intensity of the pandemic is unlike anything management scholars have studied before, and previous research into ICT use offers little insight into how ICT behaviors evolve over time. Our research explores how educators enact ICT interactions with students throughout the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 24 open-ended interviews with educators to learn about their experiences shifting to ICT for virtual classes. We found that ICT interactions between educators and students are enacted through two sequential, interrelated stages: divergent interaction behaviors and convergent interaction behaviors , with each stage corresponding to the first and second waves of the pandemic. We delineate the phases within each enacting stage of ICT interaction and conjecture that future use of ICT may include iterative cycles of divergent and convergent interaction behaviors, particularly if educators explore how to leverage ICT in more creative ways. Our research presents a theorization of ICT interaction as an increasingly prevalent form of IT-enabled educational interactions and communication. We provide insight into how educators successfully shifted to ICT use for remote work, and we offer implications for the facilitation of hybrid work arrangements in educational settings using ICT.},

  abstract     = {Emergency room (ER) admissions are the front door for the utilization of a community&#39;s health resources and serve as a valuable proxy for a community health system&#39;s capacity. While recent research suggests that social determinants of health (SDOH) are important predictors of patient health outcomes, their impact on ER utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic is not well understood. Further, the role of hospital information integration in moderating the impact of SDOH on ER utilization has not received adequate attention. Utilizing longitudinal claims data from a regional health information exchange spanning 6 years including the COVID-19 period, we study how SDOH affects ER utilization and whether effective integration of patient health information across hospitals can moderate its impact. Our results suggest that a patient&#39;s economic well-being significantly reduces future ER utilization. The magnitude of this relationship is significant when patients are treated at hospitals with high information integration but is weaker when patients receive care at hospitals with lower levels of information integration. Instead, patients&#39; family and social support can reduce ER utilization when they are treated at hospitals with low information integration. In other words, different dimensions of SDOH are important in low versus high information integration conditions. Furthermore, predictive modeling shows that patient visit type and prior visit history can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of ER utilization. Our research implications support efforts to develop national standards for the collection and sharing of SDOH data and their use and interpretation for clinical decision making by healthcare providers and policy makers.},

  abstract     = {Environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations play an increasingly important role due to the growing focus on sustainability globally. Entities, such as banks and investors, utilize ESG ratings of companies issued by specialized rating agencies to evaluate ESG risks of companies. The process of assigning ESG ratings by human analysts is however laborious and time intensive. Developing methods to predict ESG ratings could alleviate such challenges, allow ESG ratings to be generated in a more timely manner, cover more companies, and be more accessible. Most works study the effects of ESG ratings on target variables such as stock prices or financial fundamentals of companies, but few works study how different types of company information can be utilized to predict ESG ratings. Previous works also largely focus on using only the financial information of individual companies to predict ESG ratings, leaving out the different types of inter-company relationship networks. Such inter-company relationship networks are typically dynamic, i.e., they evolve across time. In this paper, we focus on utilizing dynamic inter-company relationships for ESG ratings prediction, and examine the relative importance of different financial and dynamic network information in this prediction task. Our analysis shows that utilizing dynamic inter-company network information, based on common director, common investor and news event-based knowledge graph relationships, can significantly improve ESG rating prediction performance. Robustness checks over different time-periods and different number of time-steps in the future further validate these insights.},

Although existing research has provided some intuitive understanding of the connection between personality traits and employees’ work behaviors, it still lacks effective quantitative tools for modeling personality traits, job position characteristics, and employee work behaviors simultaneously. To this end, in this article, we introduce a data-driven joint Bayesian learning approach, Joint-PJB, to discover explainable joint patterns from massive personality and job-position-related behavioral data. Specifically, Joint-PJB is designed with the knowledgeable guidance of the four-quadrant behavioral model, namely, DISC (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness). Based on the real-world data collected from a high-tech company, Joint-PJB aims to highlight personality-job-behavior joint patterns from personality traits, job responsibilities, and work behaviors. The model can measure the matching degree between employees and their work behaviors given their personality and job position characteristics. We find a significant negative correlation between this matching degree and employee turnover intention. Moreover, we also showcase how the identified patterns can be utilized to support real-world talent management decisions. Both case studies and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness of Joint-PJB for understanding people’s personality traits in different job contexts and their impact on work behaviors.},

Due to the anonymity on such social lending platforms, determining the creditworthiness of borrowers is of high importance. Beyond the disclosure of traditional financial variables that enable risk assessment, peer-to-peer lending platforms offer the opportunity to reveal additional information on the loan purpose. We investigate whether this self-disclosed information is used to show reliability and to outline creditworthiness of platform participants. We analyze more than 70,000 loans funded at a leading social lending platform. We show that linguistic and content-based factors help to explain a loan&#39;s probability of default and that content-based factors are more important than linguistic variables. Surprisingly, not every information provided by borrowers underlines creditworthiness. Instead, certain aspects rather indicate a higher probability of default. Our study provides important insights on information disclosure in the context of peer-to-peer lending, shows how to increase performance in credit scoring and is highly relevant for the stakeholders on social lending platforms.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) designers frequently must determine whether action-oriented decisions should be made by edge computers or whether they should be made only by central servers combining input from all edge computers. An important example of this design problem occurs in fire protection IoT, where individual edge computers attached to sensors might be empowered to make decisions (have decision rights) about how to manage the fire. Alternatively, decision rights could be held exclusively by a central server isolated from the fire, because the designer is concerned damage to edge computers could cause them to act unreliably. This research models this allocation of decision rights to identify the relative influence of various decision factors. We first model the allocation of decision rights under the following assumptions: (1) The central server cannot make an error the edge computer cannot make; (2) the central server cannot update the edge computer with its information in a timely manner; and (3) the central server cannot reverse an action initiated by the edge computer to explore the factors impacting decision rights conferral. We then relax each of these three assumptions. We show how relaxing each assumption radically changes the factors impacting decision rights conferral. We also show that allowing the central server to update information on the edge computer or reverse the edge computer&#39;s decision making can result in overall lower system performance. We then perform a series of numerical experiments to understand how changing various parameters affect the problem. We show for the general real-world scenario, the key factor influencing the decision is the ability of the edge computer to detect false alarms. We also show magnitude of loss and ratio of real to false incidents have a linear and logarithmic relationship to the reliability of the edge computer.},

However, little is known about the design principles of such hybrid models leveraging external lexical knowledge. To fill this gap, we define anterior, parallel, and posterior knowledge integration and propose incorporating multiple lexical knowledge sources strategically into the fine-tuning process of pre-trained transformer models for TABFSA. Experiments on the Financial Opinion mining and Question Answering challenge (FiQA) Task 1 and SemEval 2017 Task 5 datasets show that the knowledge-enabled models systematically improve upon their plain deep learning counterparts, and some outperform state-of-the-art results reported in terms of aspect sentiment analysis error.

Utilizing Toulmin&#39;s argumentation-model, we investigate the influence of advice-justification statements in overcoming these difficulties.

Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models that support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. However, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

Instead of integrating customer data, in this article we propose to integrate several domain-specific partial customer views into one consolidated or composite customer profile using a Deep Learning-based method that is theoretically grounded in Kolmogorov’s Mapping Neural Network Existence Theorem. Furthermore, our method needs to securely access domain-specific or siloed customer data only once for building the initial customer embeddings. We conduct extensive studies on two industrial applications to demonstrate that our method effectively reconstructs stable composite customer embeddings that constitute strong approximations of the ground-truth composite embeddings obtained from integrating the siloed raw customer data. Moreover, we show that these data-security preserving reconstructed composite embeddings not only perform as well as the original ground-truth embeddings but significantly outperform partial embeddings and state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation and consumer preference prediction tasks.},

  abstract     = {Medical image annotation aims to automatically describe the content of medical images. It helps doctors to understand the content of medical images and make better informed decisions like diagnoses. Existing methods mainly follow the approach for natural images and fail to emphasize the object abnormalities, which is the essence of medical images annotation. In light of this, we propose to transform the medical image annotation to a multi-label classification problem, where object abnormalities are focused directly. However, extant multi-label classification studies rely on arduous feature engineering, or do not solve label correlation issues well in medical images. To solve these problems, we propose a novel deep learning model where a frequent pattern mining component and an adversarial-based denoising autoencoder component are introduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real retinal image dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Results indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms image captioning baselines and multi-label classification baselines.},

Higher-order associations between pairs of variables is common in wearables data. Representing higher-order association curves as piecewise linear segments in a regression model makes them more interpretable. However, existing methods for identifying the change points for segmented modeling either overfit or have low external validity for wearables data containing repeated measures. Therefore, we propose a human-in-the-loop method for segmented modeling of higher-order pairwise associations between variables in wearables data. Our method uses the smooth function estimated by a generalized additive mixed model to allow the analyst to annotate change point estimates for a segmented mixed-effects model, and thereafter employs Brent&#39;s constrained optimization procedure to fine-tune the manually provided estimates. We validate our method using three real-world wearables datasets. Our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art modeling methods in terms of prediction performance but also provides more interpretable results. Our study contributes to health data science in terms of developing a new method for interpretable modeling of wearables data.

Disease multimorbidity or simultaneous occurrence of multiple diseases is a growing global public health challenge as populations age and long-term conditions become more prevalent. We propose a graph analytics framework for analyzing disease multimorbidity in hospital visits. Within the framework, we propose a graph model to explain multimorbidity as a function of prevalence, category, and chronic nature of the underlying disease. We apply our model to examine and compare multimorbidity patterns in public hospitals in Arizona, U.S., during five six-month time periods before and during the pandemic. We observe that while multimorbidity increased by 34.26\% and 41.04\% during peak pandemic for mental disorders and respiratory disorders respectively, the gradients for endocrine diseases and circulatory disorders were not significant. Multimorbidity for acute conditions is observed to be decreasing during the pandemic while multimorbidity for chronic conditions remains unchanged. Our graph analytics framework provides guidelines for empirical analysis of disease multimorbidity using electronic health records. The patterns identified using our proposed graph model informs future research and healthcare policy makers for pre-emptive decision making.},

  abstract     = {Patients living with neurogenic bladder dysfunction can lose the sensation of their bladder filling. To avoid over-distension of the urinary bladder and prevent long-term damage to the urinary tract, the gold standard treatment is clean intermittent catheterization at predefined time intervals. However, the emptying schedule does not consider actual bladder volume, meaning that catheterization is performed more often than necessary, which can lead to complications such as urinary tract infections. Time-consuming catheterization also interferes with patients&#39; daily routines and, in the case of an empty bladder, uses human and material resources unnecessarily. To enable individually tailored and volume-responsive bladder management, we design a model for the continuous monitoring of bladder volume. During our design science research process, we evaluate the model&#39;s applicability and usefulness through interviews with affected patients, prototyping, and application to a real-world in vivo dataset. The developed prototype predicts bladder volume based on relevant sensor data (i.e., near-infrared spectroscopy and acceleration) and the time elapsed since the previous micturition. Our comparison of several supervised state-of-the-art machine and deep learning models reveals that a long short-term memory network architecture achieves a mean absolute error of 116.7 ml that can improve bladder management for patients.},

  abstract     = {For the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, it is particularly important to map the course of infection, in terms of patients who have currently tested SARS-CoV-2 positive, as accurately as possible. In hospitals, this is even more important because resources have become scarce. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and point of care (POC) antigen testing capacities have been massively expanded, they are often very time-consuming and cost-intensive and, in some cases, lack appropriate performance. To meet these challenges, we propose the COVIDAL classifier for AI-based diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 subjects in hospitals based on laboratory parameters. We evaluate the algorithm&#39;s performance by unique multicenter data with approximately 4,000 patients and an extraordinary high ratio of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. We analyze the influence of data preparation, flexibility in optimization targets, as well as the selection of the test set on the COVIDAL outcome. The algorithm is compared with standard AI, PCR, POC antigen testing and manual classifications of seven physicians by a decision theoretic scoring model including performance metrics, turnaround times and cost. Thereby, we define health care settings in which a certain classifier for COVID-19 diagnosis is to be applied. We find sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies of the COVIDAL algorithm of up to 90 percent. Our scoring model suggests using PCR testing for a focus on performance metrics. For turnaround times, POC antigen testing should be used. If balancing performance, turnaround times, and cost is of interest, as, for example, in the emergency department, COVIDAL is superior based on the scoring model.},

However, the traditional approaches overlooked the heterogeneity of the tasks and the dynamic arrival of energy in wirelessly powered MEC-enabled IIOT systems. In this article, we formulate the problem of maximizing the product of the computing rate and the task execution success rate for heterogeneous tasks. To manage energy harvesting adaptively and select appropriate computing modes, we devise an online resource allocation and computation offloading approach based on deep reinforcement learning. We decompose this approach into two stages: an offloading decision stage and a stopping decision stage. The purpose of the offloading decision stage is to select the computing mode and dynamically allocate the computation round length for each task after learning from the channel state information and the task experience. This stage allows the system to support heterogeneous computing tasks. Subsequently, in the second stage, we adaptively adjust the number of fading slots devoted to energy harvesting in each round in accordance with the status of each fading slot. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can better allocate resources for heterogeneous tasks and reduce the ratio of failed tasks and energy consumption when compared with several existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Data collection under local differential privacy (LDP) has been gradually on the stage. Compared with the implementation of LDP on the single attribute data collection, that on multi-dimensional data faces great challenges as follows: (1) Communication cost . Multivariate data collection needs to retain the correlations between attributes, which means that more complex privatization mechanisms will result in more communication costs. (2) Noise scale . More attributes have to share the privacy budget limited by data utility and privacy-preserving level, which means that less privacy budget can be allocated to each of them, resulting in more noise added to the data. In this work, we innovatively reverse the complex multi-dimensional attributes, i.e., the major negative factor that leads to the above difficulties, to act as a beneficial factor to improve the efficiency of privacy budget allocation, so as to realize a multi-dimensional data collection under LDP with high comprehensive performance. Specifically, we first present a Multivariate k-ary Randomized Response (kRR) mechanism, called Multi-kRR . It applies the RR directly to each attribute to reduce the communication cost. To deal with the impact of a large amount of noise, we propose a Markov-based dynamic privacy budget allocation mechanism Markov-kRR, which determines the present privacy budget (flipping probability) of an attribute related to the state of the previous attributes. Then, we fix the threshold of flipping times in Markov-kRR and propose an improved mechanism called MarkFixed-kRR, which can obtain more optimized utility by choosing the suitable threshold. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In the United States and around the world, gun violence has become a long-standing public safety concern and a security threat, due to violent gun-related crimes, injuries, and fatalities. Although legislators and lawmakers have attempted to mitigate its threats through legislation, research on gun violence confirms the need for a comprehensive approach to gun violence prevention. This entails addressing the problem in as many ways as possible, such as through legislation, new technological advancements, re-engineering supply, and administrative protocols, among others. The research focuses on the technological, supply, and administrative aspects, in which we propose a manner of managing gun-related data efficiently from the point of manufacture/sale, as well as at points of transfers between secondary sellers for the improvement of criminal investigation processes. Making data more readily available with greater integrity will facilitate successful investigations and prosecutions of gun crimes. Currently, there is no single and uniform platform for firearm manufacturers, dealers, and other stakeholders involved in firearm sales, dissemination, management, and investigation. With the help of Blockchain technology, gun registry, ownership, transfers, and, most importantly, investigations, when crimes occur, can all be managed efficiently, breaking the cycle of gun violence. The identification of guns, gun tracing, and identification of gun owners/possessors rely on accuracy, integrity, and consistency in related systems to influence gun crime investigation processes. Blockchain technology, which uses a consensus-based approach to improve processes and transactions, is demonstrated in this study as a way to enhance these procedures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore and demonstrate the utility of Blockchain for gun-related criminal investigations using a design science approach.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning models fuel many modern decision support systems, because they typically provide high predictive performance. Among other domains, deep learning is used in real-estate appraisal, where it allows extending the analysis from hard facts only (e.g., size, age) to also consider more implicit information about the location or appearance of houses in the form of image data. However, one downside of deep learning models is their intransparent mechanic of decision making, which leads to a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. This limits their applicability for tasks where a justification of the decision is necessary. Therefore, in this article, we first combine different perspectives on interpretability into a multi-dimensional framework for a socio-technical perspective on explainable artificial intelligence. Second, we measure the performance gains of using multi-view deep learning, which leverages additional image data (satellite images) for real estate appraisal. Third, we propose and test a novel post hoc explainability method called Grad-Ram. This modified version of Grad-Cam mitigates the intransparency of convolutional neural networks for predicting continuous outcome variables. With this, we try to reduce the accuracy-interpretability trade-off of multi-view deep learning models. Our proposed network architecture outperforms traditional hedonic regression models by 34\% in terms of MAE. Furthermore, we find that the used satellite images are the second most important predictor after square feet in our model and that the network learns interpretable patterns about the neighborhood structure and density.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a rise in employing deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detection of COVID-19 cases using chest CT scans. Most of the state-of-the-art models demand a huge amount of parameters which often suffer from overfitting in the presence of limited training samples such as chest CT data and thereby, reducing the detection performance. To handle these issues, in this paper, a lightweight multi-scale CNN called LiMS-Net is proposed. The LiMS-Net contains two feature learning blocks where, in each block, filters of different sizes are applied in parallel to derive multi-scale features from the suspicious regions and an additional filter is subsequently employed to capture discriminant features. The model has only 2.53M parameters and therefore, requires low computational cost and memory space when compared to pretrained CNN architectures. Comprehensive experiments are carried out using a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and the results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher performance than many pretrained CNN models and state-of-the-art methods even in the presence of limited CT data. Our model achieves an accuracy of 92.11\% and an F1-score of 92.59\% for detection of COVID-19 from CT scans. Further, the results on a relatively larger CT dataset indicate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Frequent feature changes of OT devices interfere with this need, posing a great risk to customers. One effective way to address this challenge is via a semi-automated cyber-physical security assurance approach, which enables verification and validation of the OT device cybersecurity claims against actual capabilities, both pre- and post-deployment. To realize this approach, this article presents new methodology and algorithms to automatically identify cybersecurity-related claims expressed in natural language form in ICS device documents. We developed an identification process that employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques with the goal of semi-automated vetting of detected claims against their device implementation. We also present our novel NLP components for verifying feature claims against relevant cybersecurity requirements. The verification pipeline includes components such as automated vendor identification, device document curation, feature claim identification utilizing sentiment analysis for conflict resolution, and reporting of features that are claimed to be supported or indicated as unsupported. Our novel matching engine represents the first automated information system available in the cybersecurity domain that directly aids the generation of ICS compliance reports.},

  abstract     = {Traditional machine learning methods face unique challenges when applied to healthcare predictive analytics. The high-dimensional nature of healthcare data necessitates labor-intensive and time-consuming processes when selecting an appropriate set of features for each new task. Furthermore, machine learning methods depend heavily on feature engineering to capture the sequential nature of patient data, oftentimes failing to adequately leverage the temporal patterns of medical events and their dependencies. In contrast, recent deep learning (DL) methods have shown promising performance for various healthcare prediction tasks by specifically addressing the high-dimensional and temporal challenges of medical data. DL techniques excel at learning useful representations of medical concepts and patient clinical data as well as their nonlinear interactions from high-dimensional raw or minimally processed healthcare data. In this article, we systematically reviewed research works that focused on advancing deep neural networks to leverage patient structured time series data for healthcare prediction tasks. To identify relevant studies, we searched MEDLINE, IEEE, Scopus, and ACM Digital Library for relevant publications through November 4, 2021. Overall, we found that researchers have contributed to deep time series prediction literature in 10 identifiable research streams: DL models, missing value handling, addressing temporal irregularity, patient representation, static data inclusion, attention mechanisms, interpretation, incorporation of medical ontologies, learning strategies, and scalability. This study summarizes research insights from these literature streams, identifies several critical research gaps, and suggests future research opportunities for DL applications using patient time series data.},

  abstract     = {For Internet of Vehicles applications, reliable autonomous driving systems usually perform the majority of their computations on the cloud due to the limited computing power of edge devices. The communication delay between cloud platforms and edge devices, however, can cause dangerous consequences, particularly for latency-sensitive object detection tasks. Object detection tasks are also vulnerable to significantly degraded model performance caused by unknown objects, which creates unsafe driving conditions. To address these problems, this study develops an orchestrated system that allows real-time object detection and incrementally learns unknown objects in a complex and dynamic environment. A you-only-look-once–based object detection model in edge computing mode uses thermal images to detect objects accurately in poor lighting conditions. In addition, an attention mechanism improves the system’s performance without significantly increasing model complexity. An unknown object detector automatically classifies and labels unknown objects without direct supervision on edge devices, while a roadside unit (RSU)-based mechanism is developed to update classes and ensure a secure driving experience for autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the interactions between edge devices, RSU servers, and the cloud are designed to allow efficient collaboration. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system learns uncategorized objects dynamically and detects instances accurately.},

In the second experiment, a convolutional neural network is used to identify false defects that were overinspected during automatic optical inspection. This improves the manufacturing process by enhancing the yield rate and reducing cost. The contributions of the study built in circuit board production. Smart manufacturing, with the application of a Bayesian network to an Internet of Things setup, has addressed the problem of residue and redundant conductors on the edge of the ceramic circuit board pattern, and has improved and prevented leakage and high-frequency interference.

The massive data processing platform is like the brain of the entire factory, receiving all data from production line sensors via edge computing, processing, and analyzing, and finally making feedback decisions. With the innovation of production technology, the data that the platform needs to process has become diverse and complex, and the amount has become increasingly large.

In addition to the accuracy and availability of data processing, there is emphasis on the real-time nature of data processing. After the sensor receives the data, the platform must provide feedback within a short period of time. This article proposes a massive data processing platform based on the Lambda architecture, which has the coexistence of stream processing and batch processing to meet real-time feedback needs of high-precision manufacturing.
