  abstract     = {Developing effective multi-agent systems (MASs) is critical for many applications requiring collaboration and coordination with humans. Despite the rapid advance of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) in cooperative MASs, one of the major challenges that remain is the simultaneous learning and interaction of independent agents in dynamic environments in the presence of stochastic rewards. State-of-the-art MADRL models struggle to perform well in Coordinated Multi-agent Object Transportation Problems (CMOTPs) wherein agents must coordinate with each other and learn from stochastic rewards. In contrast, humans often learn rapidly to adapt to non-stationary environments that require coordination among people. In this article, motivated by the demonstrated ability of cognitive models based on Instance-based Learning Theory (IBLT) to capture human decisions in many dynamic decision-making tasks, we propose three variants of multi-agent IBL models (MAIBLs). The idea of these MAIBL algorithms is to combine the cognitive mechanisms of IBLT and the techniques of MADRL models to deal with coordination MASs in stochastic environments from the perspective of independent learners. We demonstrate that the MAIBL models exhibit faster learning and achieve better coordination in a dynamic CMOTP task with various settings of stochastic rewards compared to current MADRL models. We discuss the benefits of integrating cognitive insights into MADRL models.},

  abstract     = {Data Stream Processing (DSP) applications analyze data flows in near real-time by means of operators, which process and transform incoming data. Operators handle high data rates running parallel replicas across multiple processors and hosts. To guarantee consistent performance without wasting resources in the face of variable workloads, auto-scaling techniques have been studied to adapt operator parallelism at run-time. However, most of the effort has been spent under the assumption of homogeneous computing infrastructures, neglecting the complexity of modern environments. We consider the problem of deciding both how many operator replicas should be executed and which types of computing nodes should be acquired. We devise heterogeneity-aware policies by means of a two-layered hierarchy of controllers. While application-level components steer the adaptation process for whole applications, aiming to guarantee user-specified requirements, lower-layer components control auto-scaling of single operators. We tackle the fundamental challenge of performance and workload uncertainty, exploiting Bayesian optimization (BO) and reinforcement learning (RL) to devise policies. The evaluation shows that our approach is able to meet users’ requirements in terms of response time and adaptation overhead, while minimizing the cost due to resource usage, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. We also demonstrate how partial model information is exploited to reduce training time for learning-based controllers.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of 5G+ services, it has become increasingly convenient for mobile users to enjoy high-quality multimedia content from CDN driven streaming and catch-up TV services (Netflix, iPlayer) in the (post-) COVID over-the-top (OTT) content rush. To relieve ISP owned fixed-line networks from CDN streamed multimedia traffic, system ideas (e.g., Wi-Stitch in [ 45 ]) have been proposed to (a) leverage 5G services and enable consumers to share cached multimedia content at the edge, and (b) consequently, and more importantly, reduce IP traffic at the core network. Unfortunately, given that contemporary multimedia content might be a monetized asset, these ideas do not take this important fact into account for shared content. We present EdgeMart —a content provider (CP) federated, and computationally sustainable networked (graphical) market economy for paid-sharing of cached licensed (OTT) content with autonomous users of a wireless edge network (WEN). EdgeMart is a unique oligopoly multimedia market (economy) that comprises competing networked sub-markets of non-cooperative content sellers/buyers—each sub-market consisting of a single buyer connected (networked) to only a subset of sellers. We prove that for any WEN-supported supply-demand topology , a pure strategy EdgeMart equilibrium exists that is (a) nearly efficient (in a microeconomic sense) indicating economy sustainability, (b) robust to edge user entry/exit, and (c) can be reached in poly-time (indicating computational sustainability). In addition, we experimentally show that for physical WENs of varying densities, a rationally selfish EdgeMart economy induces similar orders of multimedia IP traffic savings when compared to the ideal (relatively less practical), altruistic , and non-monetized “economy” implemented atop the recently introduced Wi-Stitch WEN-based content trading architecture. Moreover, the EdgeMart concept helps envision a regulated edge economy of opportunistic (pay per licensed file) client services for commercial OTT platforms.},

Providing comprehensive evidence of their dependability under change represents a major open challenge. In this article, we exploit the notion of equilibrium, that is, the ability of the system to maintain an acceptable behavior within its multidimensional viability zone and propose RUNE 2 (RUNtime Equilibrium verification and Enforcement), an approach able to verify at runtime the equilibrium condition and to enforce the system to stay in its viability zone. RUNE 2 includes (i) a system specification that takes into account the uncertainties related to partial knowledge and possible changes; (ii) the computation of the equilibrium condition to define the boundaries of the viability zone; (iii) a runtime equilibrium verification method that leverages Bayesian inference to reason about the ability of the system to remain viable; and (iv) a resilience enforcement mechanism that exploits the posterior knowledge to steer the execution of the system inside the viability zone. We demonstrate both benefits and costs of the proposed approach by conducting an empirical evaluation using two case studies and 24 systems synthetically generated from pseudo-random models with increasing structural complexity.},

  abstract     = {Smart homes are Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) where multiple devices and controllers cooperate to achieve high-level goals. Causal knowledge on relations between system entities is essential for enabling system self-adaption to dynamic changes. As house configurations are diverse, this knowledge is difficult to obtain. In previous work, we proposed to generate Causal Bayesian Networks (CBN) as follows. Starting with considering all possible relations, we progressively discarded non-correlated variables. Next, we identified causal relations from the remaining correlations by employing “ do-operations .” The obtained CBN could then be employed for causal inference. The main challenges of this approach included “non-doable variables” and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose three extensions: (i) early pruning weakly correlated relations to reduce the number of required do-operations, (ii) introducing aggregate variables that summarize relations between weakly coupled sub-systems, and (iii) applying the method a second time to perform indirect do interventions and handle non-doable relations. We illustrate and evaluate the efficiency of these contributions via examples from the smart home and power grid domain. Our proposal leads to a decrease in the number of operations required to learn the CBN and in an increased accuracy of the learned CBN, paving the way toward applications in large CPS.},

To operate properly in such dynamic environments, software systems must adapt to these changes, which has led to the research area of Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS). Platooning is one example of adaptive systems in Intelligent Transportation Systems, which is the ability of vehicles to travel with close inter-vehicle distances. This technology leads to an increase in road throughput and safety, which directly addresses the increased infrastructure needs due to increased traffic on the roads. However, the No-Free-Lunch theorem states that the performance of one adaptation planning strategy is not necessarily transferable to other problems. Moreover, especially in the field of SAS, the selection of the most appropriate strategy depends on the current situation of the system. In this article, we address the problem of self-aware optimization of adaptation planning strategies by designing a framework that includes situation detection, strategy selection, and parameter optimization of the selected strategies. We apply our approach on the case study platooning coordination and evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {The concept of pulse-coupled oscillators for self-organized synchronization has been applied to wireless systems. Putting theory into practice, however, faces certain obstacles, particularly in radio technologies that cannot implement pulses but use common messages for interactions between nodes. This raises the question of how to deal with interference between messages. We show that interference can disturb the synchronization process and propose low-complex, randomization-based techniques to address this issue. First, we demonstrate that randomly switching between two transmit power levels (without increasing the average power) can expedite synchronization. The high-power transmissions temporarily boost network connectivity with negligible impact on the average interference. Second, we reduce interference by blindly distributing the messages over the entire oscillator cycle. Instead of using a fixed oscillator phase at which the pulses are sent, each node chooses its own, randomly selected phase to send a synchronization message. This node-specific “fire phase” is contained in the message to permit others to compute the timing. Third, we suggest that such interference management can also be beneficial for other synchronization techniques and validate this claim using Glossy as an example. Our insights may contribute to feasible solutions for self-organized wireless synchronization. Further work is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of randomization and to develop algorithms for the adaptability of local parameters.},

The choice of the persistent duration for agent actions usually has notable effects on the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. Aiming at the research gap of global dynamic optimal action persistence and its application in multi-agent systems, we propose a novel framework: global dynamic action persistence (GLDAP), which achieves global action persistence adaptation for deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a closed-loop method that is used to learn the estimated value and the corresponding policy of each candidate action persistence. Our experiment shows that GLDAP achieves an average of 2.5\%~90.7\% performance improvement and 3~20 times higher sampling efficiency over several baselines across various single-agent and multi-agent domains. We also validate the ability of GLDAP to determine the optimal action persistence through multiple experiments.},

Designing multi-agent systems is challenging, and doing this in an automated way is even more so. To address this, we propose a new framework, Evolved Gossip Contracts (EGC). It builds on Gossip Contracts (GC), a decentralised cooperation protocol that is used as the communication mechanism to facilitate self-organisation in a cooperative MAS. GC has several methods that are implemented uniquely, depending on the goal the MAS aims to achieve. The EGC framework uses evolutionary computing to search for the best implementation of these methods. To evaluate EGC, it was used to solve a classical NP-hard optimisation problem, the Bin Packing Problem (BPP). The experimental results show that EGC successfully discovered a decentralised strategy to solve the BPP, which is better than two classical heuristics on test cases similar to those on which it was trained; the improvement is statistically significant. EGC is the first framework that leverages evolutionary computing to semi-automate the discovery of a communication protocol for a MAS that has been shown to be effective at solving an NP-hard problem.},

Self-adaptation equips a software-intensive system with a feedback loop that either automates tasks that otherwise need to be performed by human operators or deals with uncertain conditions. Such feedback loops have found their way to a variety of practical applications; typical examples are an elastic cloud to adapt computing resources and automated server management to respond quickly to business needs. To gain insight into the motivations for applying self-adaptation in practice, the problems solved using self-adaptation and how these problems are solved, and the difficulties and risks that industry faces in adopting self-adaptation, we performed a large-scale survey. We received 184 valid responses from practitioners spread over 21 countries. Based on the analysis of the survey data, we provide an empirically grounded overview the of state of the practice in the application of self-adaptation. From that, we derive insights for researchers to check their current research with industrial needs, and for practitioners to compare their current practice in applying self-adaptation. These insights also provide opportunities for applying self-adaptation in practice and pave the way for future industry-research collaborations.},

  abstract     = {Given the popular presupposition of human reasoning as the standard for learning and decision making, there have been significant efforts and a growing trend in research to replicate these innate human abilities in artificial systems. As such, topics including Game Theory, Theory of Mind, and Machine Learning, among others, integrate concepts that are assumed components of human reasoning. These serve as techniques to replicate and understand the behaviors of humans. In addition, next-generation autonomous and adaptive systems will largely include AI agents and humans working together as teams. To make this possible, autonomous agents will require the ability to embed practical models of human behavior, allowing them not only to replicate human models as a technique to “learn” but also to understand the actions of users and anticipate their behavior, so as to truly operate in symbiosis with them. The main objective of this article is to provide a succinct yet systematic review of important approaches in two areas dealing with quantitative models of human behaviors. Specifically, we focus on (i) techniques that learn a model or policy of behavior through exploration and feedback, such as Reinforcement Learning, and (ii) directly model mechanisms of human reasoning, such as beliefs and bias, without necessarily learning via trial and error.},

To this end, we pursue three goals based on the Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) and Systematic Literature Review (SLR) research methodologies. We first present a SMS to structure the research area of CM4AA ( goal 1 ). We complement the SMS with an SLR to gather and synthesise evidence about context information and its modelling for adaptive authentication systems ( goal 2 ). From the knowledge gained from goal 2, we determine the desired properties of the context information model and its use for adaptive authentication systems ( goal 3 ). Motivated to find out how to model context information for adaptive authentication, we provide a structured survey of the literature to date on CM4AA and a classification of existing proposals according to several analysis metrics. We demonstrate the ability of capturing a common set of contextual features that are relevant for adaptive authentication systems independent from the application domain. We emphasise that despite the possibility of a unified framework, no standard for CM4AA exists.},

  abstract     = {Since emerging edge applications such as Internet of Things (IoT) analytics and augmented reality have tight latency constraints, hardware AI accelerators have been recently proposed to speed up deep neural network (DNN) inference run by these applications. Resource-constrained edge servers and accelerators tend to be multiplexed across multiple IoT applications, introducing the potential for performance interference between latency-sensitive workloads. In this article, we design analytic models to capture the performance of DNN inference workloads on shared edge accelerators, such as GPU and edgeTPU, under different multiplexing and concurrency behaviors. After validating our models using extensive experiments, we use them to design various cluster resource management algorithms to intelligently manage multiple applications on edge accelerators while respecting their latency constraints. We implement a prototype of our system in Kubernetes and show that our system can host 2.3× more DNN applications in heterogeneous multi-tenant edge clusters with no latency violations when compared to traditional knapsack hosting algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Modular robots are defined as autonomous kinematic machines with variable morphology. They are composed of several thousands or even millions of modules that are able to coordinate to behave intelligently. Clustering the modules in modular robots has many benefits, including scalability, energy-efficiency, reducing communication delay, and improving the self-reconfiguration process that focuses on finding a sequence of reconfiguration actions to convert robots from an initial shape to a goal one. The main idea of clustering is to divide the modules in an initial shape into a number of groups based on the final goal shape to enhance the self-reconfiguration process by allowing clusters to reconfigure in parallel. In this work, we prove that the size-constrained clustering problem is NP-complete, and we propose a new tree-based size-constrained clustering algorithm called “SC-Clust.” To show the efficiency of our approach, we implement and demonstrate our algorithm in simulation on networks of up to 30000 modules and on the Blinky Blocks hardware with up to 144 modules.},
