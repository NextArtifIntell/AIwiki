We show that it is satisfied by every complete Pick space in the following strong form: each sequence of multipliers that induces a contractive column multiplication operator also induces a contractive row multiplication operator. In combination with known results, this yields a number of consequences. Firstly, we obtain multiple applications to the theory of weak product spaces, including factorization, multipliers and invariant subspaces. Secondly, there is a short proof of the characterization of interpolating sequences in terms of separation and Carleson measure conditions, independent of the solution of the Kadison‚ÄìSinger problem. Thirdly, we find that in the theory of de¬†Branges‚ÄìRovnyak spaces on the ball, the column-extreme multipliers of Jury and Martin are precisely the extreme points of the unit ball of the multiplier algebra.},

Away from finitely many dimensions, this settles longstanding questions of C.T.C. Wall, determines all Stein fillable homotopy spheres, and proves a conjecture of Galatius and Randal‚ÄìWilliams. Implications are drawn for both the classification of highly connected manifolds and, via work of Kreck and Krannich, the calculation of their mapping class groups. Our technique is to recast the Galatius and Randal‚ÄìWilliams conjecture in terms of the vanishing of a certain Toda bracket, and then to analyze this Toda bracket by bounding its $\mathrm{H}\mathbb{F}_p$-Adams filtrations for all primes $p$. We additionally prove new vanishing lines in the $\mathrm{H}\mathbb{F}_p$-Adams spectral sequences of spheres and Moore spectra, which are likely to be of independent interest. Several of these vanishing lines rely on an Appendix by Robert Burklund, which answers a question of Mathew about vanishing curves in $\mathrm{BP}{\langle n \rangle}$-based Adams spectral sequences.},

  abstract     = {The Alexandrov‚ÄìFenchel inequality, a far-reaching generalization of the classical isoperimetric inequality to arbitrary mixed volumes, lies at the heart of convex geometry. The characterization of its extremal bodies is a long-standing open problem that dates back to Alexandrov‚Äôs original 1937 paper. The known extremals already form a very rich family, and even the fundamental conjectures on their general structure, due to Schneider, are incomplete. In this paper, we completely settle the extremals of the Alexandrov‚ÄìFenchel inequality for convex polytopes. In particular, we show that the extremals arise from the combination of three distinct mechanisms: translation, support, and dimensionality. The characterization of these mechanisms requires the development of a diverse range of techniques that shed new light on the geometry of mixed volumes of non-smooth convex bodies. Our main result extends further beyond polytopes in a number of ways, including to the setting of quermassintegrals of arbitrary convex bodies. As an application of our main result, we settle a question of Stanley on the extremal behavior of certain $\log$-concave sequences that arise in the combinatorics of partially ordered sets.},

Our main result is a convergence Khintchine type theorem for arbitrary non-degenerate submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$, which resolves a longstanding problem in the theory of Diophantine approximation. Furthermore, we refine this result using Hausdorff $s$-measures and consequently obtain the exact value of the Hausdorff dimension of $\tau$-well approximable points lying on any non-degenerate submanifold for a range of Diophantine exponents $\tau$ close to $1/n$. Our approach uses geometric and dynamical ideas together with a new technique of ‚Äògeneric and special parts‚Äô. In particular, we establish sharp upper bounds for the number of rational points of bounded height lying near the generic part of a non-degenerate manifold. In turn, we give an explicit exponentially small bound for the measure of the special part of the manifold. The latter uses a result of Bernik, Kleinbock and Margulis.},

We also assume that the associated linearized operator satisfies a suitable spectral condition, which is needed to prove linear inviscid damping. Under these assumptions, we show that if $u$ is a solution which is a small and Gevrey smooth perturbation of such a shear flow $(b(y), 0)$ at time $t=0$, then the velocity field $u$ converges strongly to a nearby shear flow as the time goes to infinity. This is the first non-linear asymptotic stability result for Euler equations around general steady solutions for which the linearized flow cannot be explicitly solved.},

  abstract     = {Let $A=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ be a vector of integers with $d=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$. By partial resolution of the classical Abel‚ÄìJacobi map, we construct a universal twisted double ramification cycle $\mathsf{DR}^{{\sf op}}_{g,A}$ as an operational Chow class on the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ of $n$-pointed genus-$g$ curves carrying a degree $d$ line bundle. The method of construction follows the $\log$ (and b-Chow) approach to the standard double ramification cycle with canonical twists on the moduli space of curves [ 37 ], [ 38 ], [ 56 ]. Our main result is a calculation of $\mathsf{DR}^{{\sf op}}_{g,A}$ on the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ via an appropriate interpretation of Pixton‚Äôs formula in the tautological ring. The basic new tool used in the proof is the theory of double ramification cycles for target varieties [ 42 ]. The formula on the Picard stack is obtained from [ 42 ] for target varieties $\mathbb{CP}^n$ in the limit $n\to \infty$. The result may be viewed as a universal calculation in Abel‚ÄìJacobi theory. As a consequence of the calculation of $\mathsf{DR}^{{\sf op}}_{g,A}$ on the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$, we prove that the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of twisted meromorphic differentials in $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ are exactly given by Pixton‚Äôs formula (as conjectured in [ 28 , Appendix] and [ 72 ]). The comparison result of fundamental classes proven in [ 40 ] plays a crucial role in our argument. We also prove the set of relations in the tautological ring of the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ associated with Pixton‚Äôs formula.},

Under the Cardy embedding, the planar map induces a metric and an area measure on $\Delta$ and a boundary measure on $\partial \Delta$. We prove that for uniformly sampled triangulations, the metric and the measures converge jointly in the scaling limit to the Brownian disk conformally embedded into $\Delta$ (i.e., to the $\sqrt{\frac{8}{3}}$-Liouville quantum gravity disk). As part of our proof, we prove scaling limit results for critical site percolation on the uniform triangulations, in a quenched sense. In particular, we establish the scaling limit of the percolation crossing probability for a uniformly sampled triangulation with four boundary marked points.},

The equation has a non-zero radial stationary solution $W$, which is unique up to scaling and sign change. In this paper we prove that any radial, bounded in the energy norm solution of the equation behaves asymptotically as a sum of modulated $W$‚Äôs, decoupled by the scaling, and a radiation term. The proof essentially boils down to the fact that the equation does not have purely non-radiative multi-soliton solutions. The proof overcomes the fundamental obstruction for the extension of the 3D case (treated in [ 21 ]) by reducing the study of a multisoliton solution to a finite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations on the modulation parameters. The key ingredient of the proof is to show that this system of equations creates some radiation, contradicting the existence of pure multi-solitons.},
