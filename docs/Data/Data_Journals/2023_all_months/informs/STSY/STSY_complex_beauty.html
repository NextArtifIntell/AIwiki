  abstract     = {In an effort to reduce power system-caused wildfires, utilities carry out public safety power shutoffs (PSPSs), in which portions of the grid are deenergized to mitigate the risk of ignition. The decision to call a PSPS must balance reducing ignition risks and the negative impact of service interruptions. In this work, we consider three PSPS scheduling scenarios, which we model as dynamic programs. In the first two scenarios, we assume that N PSPSs are budgeted as part of the investment strategy. In the first scenario, a penalty is incurred for each PSPS declared past the N th event. In the second, we assume that some costs can be recovered if the number of PSPSs is below N while still being subject to a penalty if above N . In the third, the system operator wants to minimize the number of PSPSs such that the total expected cost is below a threshold. We provide optimal or asymptotically optimal policies for each case, the first two of which have closed-form expressions. Lastly, we establish the applicability of the first PSPS model’s policy to critical peak pricing and obtain an optimal scheduling policy to reduce the peak demand based on weather observations.

  abstract     = {In the field of distributed consensus and blockchains, the synchronous communication model assumes that all messages between honest parties are delayed by at most a known constant Δ. Recent literature establishes that the longest-chain blockchain protocol is secure under synchronous communication. However, these security guarantees degrade with Δ. In real-world networks, communication delays may occasionally be far more than their typical value. In such a scenario, the security guarantees based on the synchronous model may be overly pessimistic, because they are based on the worst-case delay. This work analyzes the longest-chain protocol under a new network model that assumes the communication delays are random, independent, and identically distributed. The model allows for delay distributions with unbounded support. The main result of this paper is a security guarantee for the longest-chain protocol operating under this model. Our security results depend on the probability that delays exceed the interblock time period, rather than on the worst-case delay. We provide simple, explicit bounds on the security-violation probability that decays exponentially with the security parameter. Under network conditions where delays are sporadically large, our results can provide better security guarantees than prior work.

We study queueing networks that operate under the max-weight scheduling policy for the case in which some queues receive heavy-tailed and some receive light-tailed traffic. Queues with light-tailed arrivals are often delay stable (that is, expected queue sizes are uniformly bounded over time) but can also become delay unstable because of resource sharing with other queues that receive heavy-tailed arrivals. Within this context and for any given “tail exponents” of the input traffic, we develop a necessary and sufficient condition under which a queue is robustly delay stable, in terms of jumping fluid models—an extension of traditional fluid models that allows for jumps along coordinates associated with heavy-tailed flows. Our result elucidates the precise mechanism that leads to delay instability through a coordination of multiple abnormally large arrivals at possibly different times and queues and settles an earlier open question on the sufficiency of a particular fluid-based criterion. Finally, we explore the power of Lyapunov functions in the study of delay stability.},

Loosely, our guarantees show that we can exchange the importance of choosing a good approximation architecture a priori (as required by existing approaches) with sampling effort. We also present a simple active set algorithm for solving the resulting quadratic program, and prove the correctness of this method. Via a computational study on a controlled queueing network, we show that our approach is capable of outperforming parametric linear programming approaches to ADP, as well as non-trivial, tailored heuristics for the same network, even when employing generic, polynomial kernels.},

Each particle “jumps forward” at some time points, with the instantaneous rate of jumps given by a decreasing function of the particle’s location quantile within the current state (empirical distribution). Previous work on this model established, under certain conditions, the convergence, as n → ∞ , of the system random dynamics to that of a deterministic mean-field model (MFM), which is a solution to an integro-differential equation. Another line of previous work established the existence of MFMs that are traveling waves, as well as the attraction of MFM trajectories to traveling waves. The main results of this paper are: (a) We prove that, as n → ∞ , the stationary distributions of (recentered) states concentrate on a (recentered) traveling wave; (b) we obtain a uniform across n moment bound on the stationary distributions of (recentered) states; and (c) we prove a convergence-to-MFM result, which is substantially more general than that in previous work.

  abstract     = {Distributed ledger technologies provide a mechanism to achieve ordering among transactions that are scattered on multiple participants with no prerequisite trust relations. This mechanism is essentially based on the idea of new transactions referencing older ones in a chain structure. Recently, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-type distributed ledgers that are based on DAGs were proposed to increase the system scalability through sacrificing the total order of transactions. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to study the process that governs the addition of new transactions to the DAG-type distributed ledger. We propose a simple model for DAG-type distributed ledgers that are obtained from a recursive young-age preferential attachment scheme (i.e., new connections are made preferably to transactions that have not been in the system for very long). We determine the asymptotic degree structure of the resulting graph and show that a forward component of linear size arises if the edge density is chosen sufficiently large in relation to the “young-age preference” that tunes how quickly old transactions become unattractive.

Based on this information, they decide to wait for service or leave the system. Specifically, every customer has a patience threshold, and they balk if the observed delay is above the threshold. The main objective is to estimate the parameters of the customers’ patience-level distribution and the corresponding potential arrival rate, using knowledge of the actual queue-length process only. The main complication and distinguishing feature of our setup lies in the fact that customers who decide not to join are not observed, and remarkably, we manage to devise a procedure to estimate the underlying patience and arrival rate parameters. The model is a multiserver queue with a Poisson stream of customers, enabling evaluation of the corresponding likelihood function of the state-dependent effective arrival process. We establish strong consistency of the MLE and derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimation error. Several applications and extensions of the method are discussed. The performance is further assessed through a series of numerical experiments. By fitting parameters of hyperexponential and generalized hyperexponential distributions, our method provides a robust estimation framework for any continuous patience-level distribution.

The naive implementation of the Boston algorithm beats its adaptive implementation on both utilitarian welfare and order bias, and both apparently beat SD on both criteria.

The environment is constructed in a way to encompass various models from the recent Operations Research literature, where a queue is coupled with an inventory or with reliability issues. With a Markovian joint queueing-environment process, we prove separability for a large class of such interactive systems; that is, the steady state distribution is of product form and explicitly given. The queue and the environment processes decouple asymptotically and in steady state. For nonseparable systems, we develop ergodicity and exponential ergodicity criteria via Lyapunov functions.

We suppose that the design points are determined sequentially using an epsilon-greedy algorithm, that is, by sampling uniformly on the design space with a certain probability and otherwise sampling in a local neighborhood of the current estimate of the best solution. We study the rate at which the estimate converges to the global optimum and derive two types of bounds: an asymptotic pathwise rate and a concentration inequality measuring the likelihood that the asymptotic rate has not yet gone into effect. The order of the rate becomes faster when the width of the local search neighborhood is made to shrink over time at a suitably chosen speed.},

  abstract     = {We study in this paper large-time asymptotics of the empirical vector associated with a family of finite-state mean-field systems with multiclasses. The empirical vector is composed of local empirical measures characterizing the different classes within the system. As the number of particles in the system goes to infinity, the empirical vector process converges toward the solution to a McKean-Vlasov system. First, we investigate the large deviations principles of the invariant distribution from the limiting McKean-Vlasov system. Then, we examine the metastable phenomena arising at a large scale and large time. Finally, we estimate the rate of convergence of the empirical vector process to its invariant measure. Given the local homogeneity in the system, our results are established in a product space.

  abstract     = {We consider assemble-to-order (ATO) inventory systems with a general bill of materials and general deterministic lead times. Unsatisfied demands are always backlogged. We apply a four-step asymptotic framework to develop inventory policies for minimizing the long-run average expected total inventory cost. Our approach features a multistage stochastic program (SP) to establish a lower bound on the inventory cost and determine parameter values for inventory control. Our replenishment policy deviates from the conventional constant base stock policies to accommodate nonidentical lead times. Our component allocation policy differentiates demands based on backlog costs, bill of materials, and component availabilities. We prove that our policy is asymptotically optimal on the diffusion scale, that is, as the longest lead time grows, the percentage difference between the average cost under our policy and its lower bound converges to zero. In developing these results, we formulate a broad stochastic tracking model and prove general convergence results from which the asymptotic optimality of our policy follows as specialized corollaries.
