  abstract = {We apply mathematical and computational techniques to the development of an approach for optimizing the waste collection system of the Argentine city of Berazategui, 26 km south of Buenos Aires. Taking full account of the city’s particular characteristics, our objective is to not only improve the system’s efficiency but also ensure equitable workloads for waste collection truck crews, including both drivers and collectors. The optimization problem is partitioned into three stages. In the first stage, a heuristic constructs structurally simple collection zones that are balanced in terms of collectors’ walking distances. In the second stage, a mixed-integer linear programming model designs a collection truck route for each zone and minimizes its length. In the third and final stage, each truck is assigned to two zones in such a way as to equalize to the extent possible the length of drivers’ working day. Because working-day length is influenced by multiple factors, we formulate this objective as a biobjective optimization problem and solve it by integer linear programming coupled with an iterative algorithm. The city implemented the approach in early 2020, resulting in a markedly more equitable workload distribution and significant fuel savings and maintenance expense for the city.

  abstract = {Analytics can help identify strategies to improve the equity and capacity of health services for populations. However, many government agencies experience challenges with heavy workloads, limited time for continued analytic education, and employee turnover among contracted staff. Therefore, streamlining analytical workflows has the potential to (1) improve labor cost-efficiencies and (2) identify strategies to improve health among enrollees. We describe an analytic framework design that automates several empirical methods and provides recommendations for increasing healthcare access for Alabama Medicaid Agency (AMA) enrollees. The described framework, which includes descriptive and prescriptive elements, has been successfully used to inform various day-to-day analyses conducted by AMA’s Analytics Department and comprehensively analyze AMA-enrolled youths’ accessibility to licensed dentists. Specifically, in the dental context, the framework assisted in identifying (1) dental procedures that were ideal candidates for increased reimbursement payments and (2) geographical locations that AMA should target for interventions to improve physical access to care for AMA’s youth enrollees. The insights offered by the framework for dental care impact more than 0.5 million underserved youth and roughly $90 million of annual revenue for licensed dentists through reimbursements.

  abstract = {Transit monitoring is a preventive approach used to identify possible cases of human trafficking before exploitation while an individual is in transit or before crossing a border. Transit monitoring is often conducted by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that train staff to identify and intercept suspicious activity. Love Justice International (LJI) is a well-established NGO that has been conducting transit monitoring for years along the Nepal-India border at multiple monitoring stations. In partnership with LJI, we developed a system that uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to help LJI decision makers evaluate the performance of these stations at intercepting potential human trafficking victims given the amount of resources (staff, etc.) available and make specific operational improvement recommendations. Our model consists of 91 decision-making units from seven stations over 13 quarters and considers three inputs, four outputs, and three homogeneity criteria. Using this model, we identified efficient stations, compared rankings of station performance, and recommended strategies to improve efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of DEA in the anti-human trafficking domain. History: This paper was refereed.

  abstract = {Intermittent demand patterns are commonly present in business aircraft spare parts supply chains. Because of the infrequent arrivals and large variations in demand, aircraft aftermarket demand is difficult to forecast, which often leads to shortages or overstocking of spare parts. In this paper, we present the development and implementation of an advanced analytics framework at Bombardier Aerospace, which is carried out by the Bombardier inventory planning team and IVADO Labs to improve the aftermarket demand forecasting process. This integrated predictive analytics pipeline leverages machine-learning (ML) models and traditional time series models in a single framework in a systematic fashion. We also make use of a tree-based machine-learning method with a large set of input features to estimate two components of intermittent demand, namely demand sizes and interdemand intervals. Through the ML models, we incorporate different features, including those derived from flight data. Outputs of different forecasting models are combined using an ensemble technique that enhances the robustness and accuracy of the forecasts for different groups of aftermarket spare parts categorized by demand patterns. The validation results show an improvement in forecast accuracy of approximately 7\% and in unbiased forecast of 5\%. The ML-based Bombardier Aftermarket forecasting system has been successfully deployed and used to forecast the aftermarket demand at Bombardier of more than 1 billion Canadian dollars on a regular basis.

  abstract = {We describe a novel optimization-based approach—generalized synthetic control (GSC)—in which we learn from experiments conducted in a physical retail environment. GSC solves a long-standing problem of learning from experiments conducted in this environment when treatment effects are small, the environment is extremely noisy and nonstationary, and interference and adherence problems are commonplace. The utilization of GSC has demonstrated a remarkable increase in statistical power, approximately one hundredfold (100×) higher than conventional inferential methods. This innovative approach forms the basis of TestOps, a pioneering large-scale experimentation platform designed specifically for physical retailers. TestOps was developed and has been broadly implemented as part of a collaboration between Anheuser Busch Inbev (ABI) and a team of operations researchers and data engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. TestOps currently runs physical experiments impacting approximately 135 million USD in revenue every month and routinely identifies innovations that result in a 1\%–2\% increase in sales volume. The vast majority of these innovations would have remained unidentified had we not developed our novel approach to inference. Prior to our implementation, statistically significant conclusions could be drawn on only ∼6\% of all experiments, a fraction that has now increased by 10-fold. Given its success, TestOps is being rolled out globally at ABI, driving significant revenue growth and enabling the extraction of valuable insights from large-scale physical experiments.

Wagner Prize for Excellence in the Practice of Advanced Analytics and Operations Research.},

The goal was to develop a point system that would prioritize candidates on the waiting list in a way that would yield more efficient and equitable outcomes. Our joint Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)/UNOS team joined forces with the OPTN Lung Transplantation Committee in these policy design efforts. We discuss how our team applied a novel analytical framework, which was developed at MIT and utilizes optimization, regression, and simulation techniques, to illuminate salient trade-offs among outcomes and guide the choice of how to weigh different point attributes in the allocation formula. The committee selected for the allocation formula weights that were highlighted in the team’s analysis. The team’s proposal was implemented as the national lung allocation policy on March 9, 2023 across the United States.

  abstract = {Features such as estimated delivery time windows and live tracking of shipments play a key role in improving the customer experience in last-mile delivery. The building blocks for enabling these features are reliable knowledge about the expected order of deliveries in a tour and precise delivery time window predictions. For Deutsche Post’s parcel delivery service in Germany, we developed a courier-centric routing algorithm and a corresponding state-of-the-art machine learning model for delivery time window predictions. The routing algorithm combines operations research with statistics and machine learning to implicitly gather and use the tacit knowledge of our experienced couriers within the tour generation. This is achieved by deducing and selecting appropriate precedence constraints from historical delivery data. This novel combination of optimization with data-driven constraints enabled us to provide custom routes to the individual couriers. It proved to be a main driver allowing us to provide accurate delivery time window predictions and live tracking of shipments. Our solution is used by Deutsche Post to plan the daily routes of couriers to the approximately 13,000 parcel delivery districts in Germany as well as to provide live tracking and estimated delivery time windows for 1.6 million parcels each day.

  abstract = {Inventory management is one of the most important components of Alibaba’s business. Traditionally, human buyers make replenishment decisions: although artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms make recommendations, human buyers can choose to ignore these recommendations and make their own decisions. The company has been exploring a new replenishment system in which algorithmic recommendations are final. The algorithms combine state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques with the framework of fictitious play. By learning the supplier’s behavior, we are able to address the important issues of lead time and fill rate on order quantity, which have been ignored in the extant literature of stochastic inventory control. We present evidence that our algorithms outperform human buyers in terms of reducing out-of-stock rates and inventory levels. More interestingly, we have seen additional benefits amid the pandemic. Over the last two years, cities in China partially and intermittently locked down to mitigate COVID-19 outbreaks. We have observed panic buying from human buyers during lockdowns, leading to the bullwhip effect. By contrast, panic buying and the bullwhip effect can be mitigated using our algorithms due to their ability to recognize changes in the supplier’s behavior during lockdowns.

  abstract = {Location decisions are strategic and usually multicriteria. In decision making, companies need to anticipate future developments at potential locations. Company-driven and municipal development measures change location conditions over time. For location-seeking companies, the realization of municipal measures is fraught with uncertainty. They are planned by several municipal actors, and their long-term implications are hard to predict. Thus, the early-systematic consideration of company-internal and -external development measures is vital for decision makers (DMs) in a future-oriented location assessment. In our paper, we develop a robust decision support framework for companies to solve the regional facility location and development planning problem (RFLDP). Our framework includes a quantitative planning approach based on established operations research (OR) optimization models and a practical guideline for a structured acquisition of relevant data. The chief executive officer (CEO) (or DM) of a small- or medium-sized enterprise (SME) asked us to solve his acute RFLDP. For this, we proposed a systematic workflow and accompanied the SME’s regional facility location and development planning. In doing so, we structured the CEO’s decision-making process effectively and created an objective-transparent basis for his strategic decisions. The core feature of our work is the inclusion of the human factor of DMs, as we interacted with the CEO along his decision-making process to gradually develop decision recommendations. As a result, the SME benefited from a better-informed and transparent planning process. We recommended a decision option that was structurally superior to other options, which emerged from the CEO’s intuition and conventional facility location problem solution approaches. Other stakeholders also benefited from the results of our work.},

The use of our software at three departments has already enabled annual savings of nearly 20,000 euros in personnel costs, which corresponds to a reduction of around 500 person-hours per year. Apart from important technical aspects of our work, the reported savings potential provides valuable information for making decisions on future similar software projects.},

  abstract = {During the year 2020, Indian Railways undertook an extensive timetabling exercise for its entire network. The timetable for its six principal routes known as the golden quadrilateral + diagonals (GQD) was generated using a rail traffic simulation tool. The simulation tool and the methodology had to be customized to handle the complex technical requirements of the GQD network, which spans more than 9,000 km. Challenges related to using and integrating data into the simulator also had to be addressed. This was the first time that a simulation software tool of this kind was used for timetabling in Indian Railways, and hence, there were uncertainties regarding the timely delivery, which gave rise to additional challenges to the overall effort. This paper focuses on these challenges and the managerial and human aspects of this massive timetabling exercise. It also explains how this project leverages the benefits of combining top-down and bottom-up approaches in timetabling and how it sets a new paradigm for network-wide timetabling in Indian Railways.},

  abstract = {Supply chains in the construction industry are less efficient than in other industries (e.g., retail or automotive). The reason for the less optimized supply chains is often the lack of accurate, up-to-date information. For a leading supplier of building materials and construction systems, we perform a value of information analysis to guide future investments in costly sensors for silo fill-level monitoring. Silo inventory is vendor-managed as construction sites withdraw material from silos as they need it. Ensuring continuous availability of material requires proactive replenishment across products and customers. We establish the optimal purchase level of (partial) information for different hardware costs and service levels. Based on the current ensured service level regime, the minimum total costs are achieved with approximately 50\% sensor-equipped silos for medium and high annual sensor costs. The findings on the appropriate use of information technology to improve decision making with partial information are generally relevant for suppliers looking to stand out with service guarantees and short delivery times.},

  abstract = {This paper describes how Amazon redesigned the robotic picking algorithm used in Amazon Robotics (AR) fulfillment centers (FCs) to enable humans and robots to work together effectively. In AR FCs, robotic drives fetch storage pods filled with inventory for associates to pick. The picking algorithm needs to decide which specific units of inventory on which pods should be picked to fulfill customer order shipments. We want to do so in a way that is most efficient and distance traveled by drives per unit picked is the key performance metric. This new algorithm reduced the distance traveled by drives per unit picked by 62\% without negative operational impact and has since been implemented in all AR FCs. This improvement reduced the number of drives required in AR FCs by 31\%, which amounted to half a billion dollars in savings. The redesigned algorithm enabled seamless collaboration between associates and robots, and its effectiveness in scaling up convinced Amazon to make AR FCs the standard for new FCs, allowing Amazon to reduce the storage footprint by about 29\% compared with non-AR FCs.},

  abstract = {Conservation planning for large ecosystems has multiple benefits but is often challenging to implement because of the multiple jurisdictions, species, and habitats involved. In addition, decision making at large spatial scales can be hampered because many approaches do not explicitly incorporate potentially competing values and concerns of stakeholders. After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, establishing baselines was challenging because of (1) variation in study designs, (2) inconsistent use of explicit objectives and hypotheses, (3) inconsistent use of standardized monitoring protocols, and (4) variation in spatial and temporal scope associated with avian monitoring projects before the spill. Herein, we show how the Gulf of Mexico Avian Monitoring Network members used structured decision making to identify bird monitoring priorities. We used multiple tools and techniques to clearly define the problem and stakeholder objectives and to identify bird monitoring priorities at the scale of the entire northern Gulf of Mexico region. Although our example is specific to the northern Gulf of Mexico, this approach provides an example of how stakeholder values can be incorporated into the coordination process of broad-scale monitoring programs to address management, restoration, and scientific questions in other ecosystems and for other taxa.},

Delays in turning rooms around between patients can impair hospital capacity and capability to speed up patient treatment. Inefficient assignment of rooms to the cleaning staff also can lead to higher incidence of infection transmission. We systematically developed and piloted an efficient room assignment logic for this critical process through an integer-programming staff optimization model at McLeod Health, a leading hospital system in South Carolina. We identified an opportunity for a 20\% reduction in staffing level to handle the prevalent demand and annual staffing cost savings of about $575,000 or to handle a 30\% greater demand in dirty rooms using the current staffing levels. McLeod Health integrated our recommendations into their staffing strategy immediately.},

  abstract = {Merck Animal Health offers veterinarians, farmers, pet owners, and governments a wide range of veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, health management solutions and services, and an extensive suite of connected technology that includes identification, traceability, and monitoring products. Biomanufacturing uses living organisms (i.e., viruses and bacteria) to grow the active ingredients in vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and therapeutics. This high-tech manufacturing process generates unique challenges not found in many other industries. For example, biomanufacturing operations include high levels of uncertainty and batch-to-batch variability in production yield, lead times, and costs. Additionally, the high cost of equipment and labor-intensive nature of operations preclude the ability to flexibly add capacity. Facing these challenges, we decided that harnessing the power of operations research and advanced analytics to complement our rich life sciences and biomanufacturing expertise was critical. After four years of collaboration with the Eindhoven University of Technology, we developed a portfolio of optimization models and decision support applications that substantially improved our biomanufacturing effectiveness. The implementation of the developed models had a significant impact by generating $200 million of additional revenue without the need for additional raw materials, energy resources, or new equipment. The developed models are widely adopted across the firm, thus enhancing its core function.},

One crucial part of vaccine development is the phase III clinical trial that assesses the vaccine for safety and efficacy in the prevention of COVID-19. In this work, we enumerate the first successful implementation of using machine learning models to accelerate phase III vaccine trials, working with the single-dose Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to predictively select trial sites with naturally high incidence rates (“hotspots”). We develop DELPHI, a novel, accurate, policy-driven machine learning model that serves as the basis of our predictions. During the second half of 2020, the DELPHI-driven site selection identified hotspots with more than 90\% accuracy, shortened trial duration by six to eight weeks (approximately 33\%), and reduced enrollment by 15,000 (approximately 25\%). In turn, this accelerated time to market enabled Janssen’s vaccine to receive its emergency use authorization and realize its public health impact earlier than expected. Several geographies identified by DELPHI have since been the first areas to report variants of concern (e.g., Omicron in South Africa), and thus DELPHI’s choice of these areas also produced early data on how the vaccine responds to new threats. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson has also implemented a similar approach across its business including supporting trial site selection for other vaccine programs, modeling surgical procedure demand for its Medical Device unit, and providing guidance on return-to-work programs for its 130,000 employees. Continued application of this methodology can help shorten clinical development and change the economics of drug development by reducing the level of risk and cost associated with investing in novel therapies. This will allow Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and others to enable more effective delivery of medicines to patients.},

For the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau equipped enumerators with paper maps and notebooks filled with questionnaires and required enumerators to go door to door and collect decennial census data. The enumerators met daily with their supervisors to return completed questionnaires and update payroll information. For the 2020 Census, an advanced analytics solution, utilizing machine learning and optimization techniques, drove a reengineering of the entire field operations process, leading to substantially reduced costs and improved productivity. These reengineering efforts included business processes and technology centered around the development of this solution, the MOJO Optimizer, and resulted in an 80\% increase in the number of cases completed per hour (from 1.05 to 1.92) and a 27\% decrease in the number of miles reimbursed per case (from 5.05 to 3.68) compared with the 2010 Census NRFU.

  abstract = {During the COVID-19 crisis, the Chilean Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Sciences, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation partnered with the Instituto Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería (ISCI) and the telecommunications company ENTEL, to develop innovative methodologies and tools that placed operations research (OR) and analytics at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic. These innovations have been used in key decision aspects that helped shape a comprehensive strategy against the virus, including tools that (1) provided data on the actual effects of lockdowns in different municipalities and over time; (2) helped allocate limited intensive care unit (ICU) capacity; (3) significantly increased the testing capacity and provided on-the-ground strategies for active screening of asymptomatic cases; and (4) implemented a nationwide serology surveillance program that significantly influenced Chile’s decisions regarding vaccine booster doses and that also provided information of global relevance. Significant challenges during the execution of the project included the coordination of large teams of engineers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals in the field; the effective communication of information to the population; and the handling and use of sensitive data.
