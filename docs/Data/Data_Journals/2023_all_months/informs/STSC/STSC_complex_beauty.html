  abstract     = {Firms can choose to make investments while retaining the option to terminate them prior to completion. This flexibility can mitigate uncertainty about the investment that is present at the time of its initial funding. However, this flexibility can also detrimentally alter actions within the firm that are necessary for the investment’s success, such as whether scarce firm resources are allocated to the investment. This paper develops a set of hypotheses which predicts flexibility may not improve investment performance when the investment generates limited early-stage learning and requires certain types of resources. These hypotheses are empirically tested in a data set of new U.S. television programs, comparing programs that receive commitment in the form of a straight-to-series order with programs that are flexibly developed through a piloting process. This paper contributes to the literatures on innovation, entrepreneurship and real options by identifying which investment types will benefit most from flexibility.

  abstract     = {Although we know that product names influence audience evaluations of producers and their offerings, mechanisms behind the effect remain undertheorized. We propose that a classic psychological stimulus-and-response process is at play. Emotional contagion suggests that emotions conveyed by product names will influence consumer evaluations. Although the process is psychological, social context shapes the strength and valence in the stimulus-and-response relationship. We predict that the antimass production ideology and oppositional identity of contemporary craft markets produce reverse emotional contagion: Positively charged product names lead to negative evaluations of products and negatively charged ones lead to positive evaluations. We also predict that product names shape audience attributions of authenticity: Positive emotionality decreases authenticity perceptions and negative emotionality elevates them. We find empirical support for most of our conjectures in regression analyses of the U.S. craft beer industry between 1996 and 2012.

  abstract     = {Acceleration allows firms to lock in early success upon entering a nascent market, but whether it enables firms to sustain competitive advantage after the entry is unclear. Using a granular data set on the U.S. LED lightbulb market 2010–2017, we apply an abductive approach to examine the relationship between postentry product acceleration and market acceptance. We find that, although acceleration is slightly more beneficial for firms that have accumulated greater pioneering experience, incumbents with more recognizable brands are able to achieve even greater market acceptance by slowing down their product iterations. Meanwhile, deceleration seems to be a better strategy among firms striving to build legitimacy via regulatory engagement, whereas acceleration could be more beneficial for firms competing in subproduct markets with greater technological uncertainties. We contribute to the nascent market literature by showing that the extent to which firms gain market acceptance through postentry product acceleration hinges on their abilities to assess, learn from, and shape both market and nonmarket stakeholders.

Yet, we know little about how it relates to strategy and specifically, how strategic actions reinforce or undermine purpose in organizations. This study explores this question in the context of acquisitions. We examine 831 transactions using data from approximately 1.7 million employees to construct our measure of purpose. We find that, on average, employees’ sense of purpose drops after acquisitions. This drop is particularly pronounced among firms that undertake unique acquisitions: those involving unusual industry combinations. This relationship suggests a possible tension between strategic and motivational consequences of boundary changes. Firms may benefit strategically from these changes, particularly those that enable expansion into unique areas. These same actions, however, may also erode the purpose of the organization, with consequences for downstream performance.

  abstract     = {The institutionalized status of markets is undoubtedly due to their presumed ability to aggregate individual bids into a single unbiased estimate of value. While not denying this emergent property of market processes, we propose and test an alternative perspective that explains how market processes can also generate the propagation of individual valuation errors that aggregate into price bubbles. Theoretically, we advance a microinstitutional perspective that draws from social and evolutionary psychology linking market processes to a more general process of institutionalization, whereby individuals seeking the adaptive benefits of conformity may—due to bounded and socially biased rationality—instead generate maladaptive individual and collective outcomes. Empirically, we craft an efficient experimental market and find three sets of evidence consistent with our microinstitutionalization perspective. We first show—at the individual level—that market participants exhibit a social bias toward conformity with the market’s collective valuation, even when the emergent market valuation is demonstrably incorrect. We then show—at the market level—that the range of valuations over time also decreases in a conforming direction, again independent of valuation accuracy. Last, we provide the first experimental test of the long-assumed effect of social ambiguity on institutionalization, finding that market participants’ over-attention to the collective valuation is indeed sensitive to variation in social ambiguity. We conclude by highlighting the relevance of our theoretical perspective, method, and findings for future research on institutions and institutionalization processes, as well as future studies on social influence and conformity-based errors.

  abstract     = {An important consequence of an alliance is that partnering firms combine their reputations by associating them to jointly implemented projects. However, an often-overlooked aspect is that those reputations may themselves change due to both the announcement of the firms’ decision to form the alliance and the performance of joint projects. We develop a formal model that provides an integrated perspective of these reputational effects, while allowing us to isolate and characterize each of them. We find that the way in which the firms’ competence levels affect their decision to form an alliance determines how the firms’ reputations evolve following the announcement of the alliance and the performance of joint projects. This indicates that the analysis of the reputational effects of an alliance requires understanding the firms’ alliance formation decision in the first place. We show, for instance, that a firm’s reputation may decrease following the decision to form an alliance, and that the impact of project performance on the reputations of alliance partners can be very asymmetric. Among other things, our analysis implies that a firm’s desirability as an alliance partner does not necessarily increase with its reputation and level of competence. Funding: A. Almeida Costa and L.

  abstract     = {Extant scholarship typically assumes that VC firms prefer to pick winners. I offer an alternative perspective: that specialist VC firms can select less attractive start-ups—with innovative potential but in need of help—and then contribute to the start-ups’ innovative processes so they can achieve their potential. The analogy is buying a fixer-upper house, which, with the right help, can be brought to the level of one that is move-in ready. I argue that specialist (versus generalist) VC firms in the syndicate have superior commercialization knowledge and specialized resource networks, and they can choose to follow a move-in-ready strategy (select winners) or a fixer-upper strategy (build winners). This choice is contingent on the research environment and how unique the help from the specialist VC firm is: in well-developed research environments, a specialist adds less value and may follow a move-in-ready strategy; in less-developed research environments, a specialist adds more value and may follow a fixer-upper strategy. I leverage an ideal empirical context, global biotechnology VC-backed start-ups, over the period 1996–2006, when the biotech industry was established in the United States and developing in 25 other countries, and highlight qualitative insights from 20 interviews with investors in seven countries.

  abstract     = {Backward compatibility is a governance strategy that can be adopted by platform owners to build indirect network effects and encourage owners of older compatible software to update to newer hardware models. Previous research shows backward compatibility has a positive effect on hardware sales. However, there is limited evidence concerning the other associated costs and benefits. In particular, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of backward compatibility on software sales despite its importance in understanding the full range of possible network and sales displacement effects associated with the strategy. Using weekly software-level sales data from the U.S. video gaming industry, we find that backward-compatible hardware associates with increased sales of software released for the previous hardware generation. However, we find that the introduction of backward compatibility may not increase the sales of new hardware if the feature is not available immediately at launch. Further, we show that the increased sales of software for the old hardware platform may cannibalize software sales for the new platform. Overall, our results suggest that backward compatibility is time-sensitive and involves several important trade-offs. We, therefore, conclude that the use of backward compatibility needs to be carefully considered by platform owners prior to implementation.},

This special issue presents diverse viewpoints on these two distinct yet interrelated topics. In this introduction, we present the various contributions and build on their insights to develop our independent sensemaking of what corporate purpose entails. Thus, we define corporate purpose, at both the organizational and societal levels, as an institutionalized ideal, a historical, value-based aspiration guiding strategic decision making and practices. We interpret the current societal movement on corporate purpose as one rejecting the logic of shareholder capitalism and proposing sustainable capitalism in its place: an ideal for corporate purpose based on sustainable prosperity for society and its population. At the organizational level, corporate purpose can thus be articulated as a distinctive and meaningful intent to enhance the lives of people. We identify four strategic issues to consider in reconstituting a corporation’s purpose: corporate governance, strategic leadership, stakeholder engagement, and implementation. We conclude by highlighting the centrality of purpose to corporate strategy, an emphasis that was present in the field during its origins but one that got displaced under a logic of shareholder primacy.

Inside-out purpose is a channeling of the passion and commitment employees feel toward fulfilling stakeholder needs; outside-in purpose is society and external stakeholders urgently calling on the organization to live up to its responsibilities. I devote special attention to theories that best explain the present moment’s unique awareness of corporate purpose. Among them is the work of Philip Selznick, emphasizing values, and the literature on the new institutionalism and institutional logics. I conclude with a section on how leaders can leverage the benefits of both perspectives while mitigating their risks. I also make recommendations for future research.

  abstract     = {Broadening the organizational purpose of a firm beyond narrow short-term profit maximization may enhance long-term shareholder value. This result obtains when firms generate unpriced externalities and face difficulties in achieving ex ante incentive alignment with stakeholders through contract or have the ex post possibility of altering stakeholders’ perceptions through virtue signaling (i.e., cheap talk or greenwash). As each of these conditions is ubiquitous in practice, discussion of organizational purpose (beyond narrow short-term profit maximization to encompass stakeholder’s harmonious pursuit of a common higher goal or meaning) should shift from why management might pursue it to how managers obtain and maintain it as well as the value creation and distribution implications of doing so. Drawing on a value-based stakeholder theory of strategic management, I argue that attentiveness to the most salient issues of a firm’s most powerful stakeholders related to the attainment of this higher goal more closely aligns stakeholder and shareholder value in the long term, thereby building and sustaining relational contracts with stakeholders. A firm with strong relational contracts across its nexus of stakeholder relationships increases the likelihood of harmony among its stakeholders, including shareholders. An important challenge to realizing this outcome is that of measurement. As a result, research on organizational purpose should turn its attention from legal and moral foundations to empirical research on externalities, stakeholder opinions, and managers’ self-representations of their organization’s purpose. The availability of such data lowers the transaction costs associated with a nexus of relational contracts and enhances societal welfare.

  abstract     = {In contrast to the prevalent outside-in perspectives on corporate purpose as a response to competing normative demands of stakeholders, we introduce an inside-out perspective on purpose as based in firm-specific, agentic commitments to specific values, ideals, and societal goals. Drawing on moral philosophy, we propose how strategists can develop a strategic purpose through moral imagination that involves developing shaping intentions based in values and ideals, empathetic relating, and imaginativeness in stakeholder contexts. These processes support the generation of an emergent theory of value, which we term “the collective desirable.” This theory of value—a creative synthesis of the shaping intentions of the firm, and the interests and perspectives of stakeholders—provides the foundation of purpose, which is strategic, dynamic, and generative for the firm and its stakeholders. Such a strategic purpose becomes an organizational logic of action enacted through designated processes for articulation, maintenance, and evolvability, and through blueprints for credible commitments and resource allocations. By theorizing the microfoundations of an agentic, inside-out view of purpose, our theoretical framework articulates a set of mechanisms through which strategists can develop a strategic purpose that is tightly linked to the firm’s future-oriented strategy and the exercise of moral leadership. Our conception of moral imagination as a form of prosocial prospective cognition contributes a novel perspective to the socio-cognitive and subjectivist perspectives on strategy and extends the microfoundations of strategy.

  abstract     = {The recent rediscovery of corporate purpose has illuminated how much more we still need to understand about purpose and its role in organizations. After tracing the historical roots of purpose and conceptualizing its unique value in bridging the mundane and the moral in organizational life, we propose links among purpose and organizational identity, image and reputation, as well as with meaningful work. These linkages suggest two core functions of purpose: a vehicle for accountability (internal and external) and a source of accounts and justifications. These functions serve as mechanisms connecting purpose to different levels of analysis both within and outside of the organization. We also highlight potential impediments to maximizing the benefits of purpose: stakeholder cynicism and employee disillusionment. We conclude by suggesting new areas of research to overcome these impediments and to better establish purpose as a root construct in organizational scholarship.

  abstract     = {Corporate purpose has become a central part of doing business as usual and in the social movement to involve corporations in solving complex societal and environmental challenges. In this essay, I first deconstruct what corporate purpose means from a sociological perspective, and I submit that it is important to identify to whom that purpose is targeted. Second, I seek to make the point that corporate purpose is not universal in that there is not a one-rule-fits-all template on how to develop corporate purpose. I draw on comparative corporate governance, stakeholder management, and institutional theory arguments to illustrate how corporate purpose means different things in different societies and that the departure point of the emanation of corporate purpose varies across countries. This differential meaning is explained in part by the institutional setting as well as very different societal expectations of corporations. Finally, building on insights from existing corporate governance research, I argue that stakeholder engagement can be a useful tool toward effectively deploying corporate purpose.

Our historical analysis suggests that the debate about corporate purpose is not new and that it tends to arise during periods of growing economic inequality. Our analysis also suggests that the discursive shift from shareholder to stakeholder capitalism will trigger a new standard of social evaluation of corporations in which we no longer judge corporate behavior based on standards of legitimacy but rather on standards of authenticity. We explore what this change in social evaluation will mean for corporate competition. History: This paper has been accepted for the Strategy Science Special Issue on Corporate Purpose.},

I explain how and why the symbolic management system, including the various forms of decoupling that have compromised CSR, could be readily extended to corporate purpose. I further suggest why (i) the symbolic management of purpose would extend a historical pattern of decoupling that has penetrated into ever more fundamental arenas of corporate governance, and (ii) at least some characteristics of corporate purpose may render it even more vulnerable to symbolic management and decoupling than CSR. I conclude that although the corporate purpose movement carries a substantial, downside risk of symbolic management and decoupling, it nonetheless has upside potential to improve corporate social performance, and that academic researchers have a key role to play in realizing that potential. I suggest several research strategies for detecting the presence and extent of symbolic decoupling of corporate purpose.

To capture this variation and analyze its implications for enacting purpose, we leverage three existing bodies of research in organization and management theory: Early organization theory illuminates uses of purpose to convey an organization’s overarching reason for being, organizational hybridity sheds light on purpose as an alternative organizational objective to profit maximization, and systems perspectives offer tools for explaining purpose as a catalyst of systemic change beyond the boundaries of the firm. The typology that we develop based on these three bodies of research provides analytical clarity about distinct facets of the corporate purpose phenomenon and surfaces complementary insights into challenges and opportunities associated with purpose enactment. In doing so, it illuminates the value of drawing on existing organization and management theories for advancing corporate purpose scholarship and provides a springboard for future research.

  abstract     = {The new stakeholder theory (NST) grapples with two canonical questions: Which stakeholders are enfranchised in organizations? How is the value created through stakeholder collaboration distributed and experienced by stakeholders? This paper first describes how the NST builds on original stakeholder theory to ask these two specific questions. The defining features of the NST are (i) a broad range of dependent variables, (ii) descriptiveness, (iii) formalized analysis, (iv) boundaries on stakeholder enfranchisement, and (v) analytic links to other established theories. The paper then assesses the assumptions and implications of this theory for understanding organizational purpose. A primary idea is that the NST conceptualizes purpose as originating in the goals, needs, and interests of stakeholders as complex, nuanced actors. Under the NST, the organization is conceived of as a tool—a functionalized construction—through which enfranchised stakeholders pursue a shared purpose that leads to experiences of stakeholder value in terms that are defined by the relevant stakeholders themselves. The survival and profitability of an organization depends on its effectiveness and efficiency as a tool for accomplishing mutual stakeholder aims, which are what define organizational purpose.

This study explores this question, measuring the strength of purpose based on the perceptions of nearly 1 million employees across 635 U.S. public companies within 14 industry categories. Two main findings emerge. First, the relationship between purpose and profits varies widely across companies and industries. Second, companies with higher levels of innovation intensity, intangible capital, or long-term investors tend to pursue both purpose and profits, whereas companies with lower levels of these factors tend to prioritize one over the other. This evidence suggests that purpose and profits are compatible in settings that rely on innovation and long temporal horizons for value creation and opposed in settings that do not.

  abstract     = {As part of institutional changes toward more responsible capitalism, firms increasingly articulate a purpose beyond simply profit as a central tenet of their governance. Management scholarship has noted the potential advantages of such purpose-focus for stakeholder trust. However, some consumers, employees, and shareholders have expressed skepticism about the veracity of firms’ purpose claims and raised concerns about purpose-washing. We propose two distinct influence pathways—one cognitive, one affect-based—by which corporate purpose can influence stakeholder trust. First, purpose constitutes a signal of firm intent and quality that expresses a firm’s public, enduring commitments. It fosters cognitive trust by providing clarity and assurance regarding the firm’s future conduct, allowing stakeholders to better calculate relational and reputational risk and the instrumental value of exchange—even when they do not share the firm’s prosocial mission, principles for stakeholder relations, or its conception of virtues. Second, purpose presents a moral appeal to stakeholders. This appeal can stimulate positive affective responses, activate stakeholders’ hedonic and eudaemonic motives tied to their moral identity, and thus provide intuitive cues to trust the firm. By sharply delineating the pathways by which purpose can shape interorganizational trust, we not only illuminate how purpose can yield trust benefits but also when it is ineffectual and causes stakeholder backlash. This clarifies the role of purpose in shaping relational governance and multistakeholder cooperation and contributes to research on strategic and moral commitments as foundations of interorganizational trust.

  abstract     = {Corporate purpose is taking off as a concept within both the corporate world and management academia. Despite many bold pronouncements by companies about pursuing purpose and not just profits, evidence suggests that these are often decoupled from real action on social and environmental issues. In this essay, I grapple with a number of questions that arise for scholars and practitioners given the state of the field. Is the lack of progress intentional such that corporate purpose is just a power grab for firms to protect their influence and profits? Is making the business case for corporate purpose just part of this power grab? Stepping back, what is corporate purpose anyway? Additionally, how does it relate to trade-offs across stakeholders? Who counts as a stakeholder? How can we account for value distribution along with value creation? How can we conceptualize the firm if we take purpose seriously? What would it mean to decenter the firm (and center the stakeholders) in the practice of corporate purpose? What governance structures are needed to enact corporate purpose? Additionally, what are the implications for a new model of decentered leadership? There are not a lot of answers yet, but this review of recent research in the domain spots many excellent clues and paths for future progress.

Yet knowledge of how a large company can walk that purpose-talk is still in its infancy. In this essay, we zoom in on the development of new sustainable products that embody a renewed responsibility to people and the planet. We conceptualize sustainable product development in a large company as an instance of divergent change and explore: How can sustainable products develop inside a large company in the face of the intense resistance that such a divergent change is likely to trigger? Building on our qualitative study from 2010 to 2019 of four products in a large fast-moving consumer goods company, we unpack two key leadership practices: (1) relaxing metrics for a product team, which (structurally) enables experimenting with a sustainable product separate from the mainstream business, and (2) advocating with gatekeepers, which (discursively) enables anchoring a sustainable product within the mainstream business. Overall, our findings suggest that sustainable product development will not do much to transform a large company if sustainable products remain merely tolerated exceptions.

Our panel data analysis of 219 firms in the prepackaged software industry reveals that, when a CEO is risk-prone, the CEO’s ability to drive exploration increases with the CEO’s power in the firm, which manifests in tenure, duality, and insider origin. Counter to expectations, however, the firm’s accumulated exploration experience does not reinforce, but rather attenuates the effect of the CEO’s risk propensity on exploration. We attribute this to firms’ quest for balance between exploration and exploitation and the need to counter the CEO’s risk propensity when exploration becomes excessive. Finally, we find that competitive pressure in the firm’s product market reinforces the ability of a CEO who is more risk-prone to garner support for further exploration. Our study advances a dynamic perspective that relates the heterogeneity in firms’ exploration tendencies to the behavioral inclinations of their CEOs.

  abstract     = {Establishing causality beyond association, influence, or correlation is key to informed managerial decisions and interventions. What-if questions such as “What will happen to firm performance if managers intervene by doing this?” and “What if managers had not done this?” can now be formulated and answered by using the tools of structural causal modeling (SCM). SCM tools contribute a systematic methodology for designing and evaluating managerial interventions. Powered by SCM, researchers can increase the precision in theorizing mechanisms and develop the research designs that facilitate causal identification. As a demonstration of how to apply SCM for advancing theory and research design in strategic management, we study why and how the effect of governance mode on firm performance is transmitted through a reduction in the deviation of managerial decision from theory-based prescription. For example, managers may switch to a governance mode that is consistent with the governance mode prescribed according to transaction cost economics (TCE). The insights arising from SCM inform whether switching governance mode for the purpose of aligning with TCE prescription will improve performance, and, if yes, by how much. Beyond TCE, we point to theory-based prescriptions in strategic management that could benefit from using SCM to probe what-if questions. Funding: G. K.

  abstract     = {This study examines whether the benefits of diversification vary across different value chain activities. The returns to diversification in product development and distribution activities are analyzed using a framework grounded in the intraindustry diversification literature and the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. The study uses data from cocreation arrangements in the motion picture industry in which value chain activities are nearly decomposable—that is, split across producers and distributors—as a natural field study. Results based on 779 movies linked to 57 different production studios and distributed via 30 unaffiliated distributors or vertically integrated distribution branches show that greater focus in film production has a positive effect on profitability, whereas the level of focus/diversification in distribution is unrelated to profitability. This result holds regardless of whether the two functions are carried out within an integrated organization or across independent firms. Moreover, there is significant heterogeneity in the extent to which production studios benefit from increased focus which is tied to the composition of their product portfolios.

  abstract     = {This study investigates the gender gap in entrepreneurship in the technology industry. Digitization has created vast economic opportunities in the technology sector and has lowered many barriers to entry, thus reducing traditional frictions regarding entrepreneurship and potentially increasing opportunities for female founders. However, anecdotal evidence has suggested that female technology founders are rare and that women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics roles. Based on individual career histories collected from more than 42 million U.S.-based LinkedIn profiles, including more than 1.3 million founders, we explore whether there are higher rates of female founders in technology companies relative to other industries. Our analysis revealed the following: (1) Females were only half as likely as males to found businesses in the technology industry. (2) Females were less likely to found successive businesses (i.e., serial founders), which was even more pronounced in the technology industry. (3) When we used the gender gap in labor force participation as a baseline, the gender gap in technology entrepreneurship was particularly large, even compared with other male-dominated industries (e.g., construction). (4) The gender gap in technology entrepreneurship was driven by lower rates of entrepreneurship by females in lower positions in the organizational hierarchy. In contrast, females who reached the C-suite in technology sectors were 16\% more likely to found firms compared with their female C-suite counterparts in nontechnology industries. Combined, the results provide a nuanced view of the gender gap in entrepreneurship.

  abstract     = {Past studies of multipoint competition have mainly focused on the effect of multipoint contact in product markets on firm competitive behaviors in those markets only. Our study advances this literature by examining how multipoint contact in product markets affects a firm’s expansion into a rival’s technological areas. We further investigate the factors that moderate the proposed effect. Our analyses suggest that the degree of multipoint contact between a firm and a rival in product markets has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the degree of the firm’s expansion into the rival’s technological areas (patent classes). Furthermore, the firm’s capacity (market share) and capability (status in terms of technological development) relative to the rival’s have different moderating effects on the relationship between multipoint contact in product markets and the firm’s expansion into the rival’s technological areas. Our findings contribute to the literatures on multipoint contact, competitive dynamics, and firm technology strategies.},

  abstract     = {Many published papers in the management field have used statistical methods that, according to the latest insights in econometrics, can lead to elevated rates of false positives: results that appear “significant,” whereas they are not. The question is how problematic these less robust econometric analyses are in practice for management research. This paper presents simulations and an empirical replication to investigate two widespread but now largely discredited practices in panel data analysis: nonclustered standard errors and random effects (RE). The simulations indicate that these two practices can lead to strongly elevated rates of false positives in typical empirical settings studied in management research. The often-advocated Hausman test does not always prevent false positives in RE regressions. Replication of a published regression that used RE and classic standard errors yields that many of the coefficients reported as significant in the original analysis become insignificant when using fixed effects and clustered standard errors, on a slightly different sample. Based on the findings in this paper, published results using nonclustered standard errors or RE estimates for panel data should be interpreted with great care, because the probability that they are false positives can be much larger than reported. Going forward, empirical researchers should cluster standard errors to account for serial correlation and use fixed rather than random effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity. Funding: X.
