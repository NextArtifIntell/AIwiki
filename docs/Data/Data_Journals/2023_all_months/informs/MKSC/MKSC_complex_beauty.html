  abstract     = {Are competing firms better off with more targeting? We examine this question in the context of targeting advertising spending and price in the Hotelling model. By “more targeting,” we mean expanding the scope of targeting from one of these variables to both. When the incremental cost of such expansion is small, the question boils down to whether the firms are better off targeting both advertising spending and price (“full targeting”) or just one of them (“partial targeting”). We show that it is individually rational for the firms to expand the scope of targeting in such circumstances. However, their profits may or may not be higher in the resulting full targeting equilibrium. The paper identifies the conditions under which each type of targeting is collectively optimal. Targeting advertising spending only is optimal when the products are highly differentiated; however, when product differentiation is small, full targeting is optimal when the cost of advertising is small, and targeting price only is optimal when the cost of advertising is large. These results provide managerial guidance on how firms should respond to any restrictions on the scope of targeting imposed by regulators or online retail platforms. On the theoretical front, our results show that expanding the scope of targeting has benefits and costs for the firms. The benefits come from being able to align local advertising levels to local prices—what Dorfman and Steiner’s theorem says firms should do. The costs come in the form of more intensified price competition, which takes different forms depending on which type of targeting is added. When price targeting is added to advertising spending targeting, it has the effect of replacing product differentiation by informational differentiation; when advertising spending targeting is added to price targeting, it has the effect of delegating control of the local price equilibrium to the weaker firm. Comparing our results with previous results suggests that targeting on preferences may be fundamentally different from targeting on loyalty and switching behaviors .

  abstract     = {We investigate a firm’s optimal product portfolio design on a Hotelling line that can affect consumers’ search decisions. Consumers form their perceptions of a brand from interactions with all products in the portfolio. We conceptualize the average location of the products as the brand position that represents the aggregate information about characteristics common to the product portfolio. Then, we propose a mechanism for why and how brand positioning induced by a firm’s product portfolio design can deliver credible information that guides consumer search. We show that niche positioning naturally conveys more information than mainstream positioning. A mainstream brand has incentives to opportunistically dilute its brand by offering a wide range of products. Even in a monopolistic market, a niche brand positioning may arise as an equilibrium because it serves as a commitment device that prevents brand dilution.

  abstract     = {Profile pictures are a key component of many freelancing platforms, a design choice that can impact hiring and matching outcomes. In this paper, we examine how appearance-based perceptions of a freelancer’s fit for the job (i.e., whether a freelancer “looks the part” for the job), as inferred from profile pictures, can impact hiring outcomes on such platforms. Leveraging computer vision techniques and choice models, we analyze six-month data from Freelancer.com (63,014 completed jobs that received 2,042,198 applications from 160,014 freelancers) and find that, above and beyond demographics and beauty, freelancers who “look the part” are more likely to be hired. Interestingly, we do not find a strong correlation between “looking the part” and job performance. Supplementing our large-scale observational study with two choice experiments, we find that (i) the effect of perceived job fit is stronger when reputation systems are not sufficiently diagnostic to differentiate candidates and (ii) that by considering perceptions of job fit, participants are more likely to choose freelancers with fewer reviews, lower ratings, and/or without certifications. Last, we find that “platform recommendations” can only partially mitigate the unintended consequences of profile pictures, and recommending multiple freelancers can further increase the role of “looking the part.” History: Puneet Manchanda served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {Aesthetics are critically important to market acceptance. In the automotive industry, an improved aesthetic design can boost sales by 30\% or more. Firms invest heavily in designing and testing aesthetics. A single automotive “theme clinic” can cost more than $100,000, and hundreds are conducted annually. We propose a model to augment the commonly used aesthetic design process by predicting aesthetic scores and automatically generating innovative and appealing product designs. The model combines a probabilistic variational autoencoder (VAE) with adversarial components from generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a supervised learning component. We train and evaluate the model with data from an automotive partner—images of 203 SUVs evaluated by targeted consumers and 180,000 high-quality unrated images. Our model predicts well the appeal of new aesthetic designs—43.5\% improvement relative to a uniform baseline and substantial improvement over conventional machine learning models and pretrained deep neural networks. New automotive designs are generated in a controllable manner for use by design teams. We empirically verify that automatically generated designs are (1) appealing to consumers and (2) resemble designs that were introduced to the market five years after our data were collected. We provide an additional proof-of-concept application using open-source images of dining room chairs. History: Puneet Manchanda served as the senior editor. Funding: A.

  abstract     = {In a static quality context, online reviews and ratings help consumers separate high- and low-quality firms. In a dynamic quality context, however, reviews can inform and incentivize low-rated firms to improve their quality and lower the quality gap with high-rated firms. In this paper, we empirically test this hypothesis by analyzing the U.S. hotel industry using data from two major online consumer review platforms: Tripadvisor and Expedia. Using a combination of econometric and natural language processing tools, we present the following findings. First, hotels that are more likely to pay attention to reviews increase their ratings more than hotels that are less likely to pay attention to reviews. Second, these hotels increase their ratings by improving on issues frequently mentioned in their reviews. Third, we find that low-rated hotels experience larger gains in ratings as they have more margin for improvement than high-rated hotels. Overall, our results suggest that online reviews are a valuable source of information for firms and may improve consumer welfare. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {In online channels, products are returned at high rates. Shipping, processing, and refurbishing are so costly that a retailer’s profit is extremely sensitive to return rates. Using a large data set from a European apparel retailer, we observe that return rates for fashion items bought online range from 13\% to 96\%, with an average of 53\%; many items are not profitable. Because fashion seasons are over before sufficient data on return rates are observed, retailers need to anticipate each item’s return rate prior to launch. We use product images and traditional measures available prelaunch to predict individual item return rates and decide whether to include the item in the retailer’s assortment. We complement machine-based prediction with automatically extracted image-based interpretable features. Insights suggest how to select and design fashion items that are less likely to be returned. Our illustrative machine-learning models predict well and provide face-valid interpretations; the focal retailer can improve profit by 8.3\% and identify items with features less likely to be returned. We demonstrate that other machine-learning models do almost as well, reinforcing the value of using prelaunch images to manage returns. History: K. Sudhir served as the senior editor.

Our method enables analysis of events that span the target population being analyzed, where there is no contemporaneous “control group” and/or it is not possible to measure treatment status, by comparing the purchasing behavior of cohorts acquired at different times. Our method applies nonparametric age-period-cohort models, commonly used in sociology but with limited adoption in marketing, in conjunction with a predictive model of the counterfactual no-event baseline (i.e., an event study model). We use this method to infer how the COVID-19 pandemic affected 12 online and offline consumption categories. Our results suggest that the pandemic initially drove significant spending lifts at e-commerce businesses at the expense of brick-and-mortar alternatives. After two years, however, these changes have largely reverted. We observe significant heterogeneity across categories, with more persistent changes in subscription-based categories and more transient changes in categories based on discretionary purchases, especially those of durable goods.

This can cause the reputation system to miss important information about seller quality. We study the extent to which a platform can improve market outcomes by attempting to increase the amount and quality of information collected by its reputation system. We do so by analyzing a randomized experiment conducted by Airbnb. In the treatment, buyers were offered a coupon to review listings that had no prior reviews. In the control, buyers were not offered any incentive to review. We find that, although the treatment induced additional reviews that were more negative on average, these reviews did not affect the number of nights sold or total revenue. Furthermore, we find that, contrary to the treatment’s intended effect, Airbnb’s incentivized program caused transaction quality for treated sellers to fall. We examine how the quality of the induced reviews, market conditions, and the design of Airbnb’s reputation system can explain our findings. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {This paper considers an experiment-based approach to the optimal design and targeting of compliance promotions. Compliance promotions involve optional participation on the behalf of customers. For example, physicians must consent to see detailers, and consumers must redeem coupons to obtain discounts. Individual compliance decisions affect the mix of customers participating in the promotion and, therefore, how the promotion affects sales. Optional compliance is an especially acute problem in the context of field experiments as policy optimization often necessitates extrapolation beyond the observed cells of the experiment to a different mix of complying customers. Our approach to optimizing the design and targeting of compliance promotions involves (i) an experiment to exogenously vary promotion features; (ii) a means to identify which promotion features can be causally extrapolated; (iii) an approach to extrapolate those causal effects; and (iv) an optimization over the promotion features, conditioned on the extrapolation. The approach is easy to estimate, accommodates two-sided noncompliance due to unobserved heterogeneity, and establishes partial identification bounds of causal effects. When applying the approach to a hotel loyalty promotion, wherein customers must visit enough hotels to earn bonus loyalty points, we find profits are improved considerably.

  abstract     = {Consumers who intend to buy a product may forget to do so because they suffer from limited attention. Therefore, they may value being reminded by an advertisement. This reminder effect of advertising could be important in many markets but is usually difficult to document. We study it in the context of buying a product that has existed for almost 300 years: a ticket for the Dutch State Lottery. This context is particularly suitable for our analysis because the product is simple, it is very well known, and there are multiple fixed and known purchase cycles per year. Moreover, radio and TV advertisements are designed explicitly to remind consumers to buy a lottery ticket before the draw. This can conveniently be done online. We develop an approach to distinguish reminder effects of advertising from other effects, such as conveying information about the size of the jackpot. The key idea is that reminder effects are short lived. We use minute-level advertising and online sales data and find that the reminder effect of advertising is strong. Reaching 1\% of the population by a radio advertisement leads to an increase in online sales of 1.55\% in the four hours after the advertisement is aired. For TV advertisements, the increase is 0.78\%. We show that the effects generally last longer for radio advertisements. We also provide direct evidence that reminding consumers not only affects the timing of purchases but also leads to market expansion. Finally, we estimate a model of consumer behavior under limited attention to quantify the effect on total sales. We find that total sales would be 16.7\% lower without the reminder effect of advertising and that shifting advertising to the week of the draw would lead to a 9.2\% increase in sales.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a unified dynamic framework for adaptive ad sequencing that optimizes user engagement with ads. Our framework comprises three components: (1) a Markov decision process that incorporates intertemporal tradeoffs in ad interventions, (2) an empirical framework that combines machine learning methods with insights from causal inference to achieve personalization, counterfactual validity, and scalability, and (3) a robust policy evaluation method. We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad network of an Asian country. We find that the dynamic policy generated by our framework improves the current practice in the industry by 5.76\%. This improvement almost entirely comes from the increased average ad response to each impression instead of the increased usage by each user.

  abstract     = {We analyze structural state dependence in brand choice using variation from brand switching during stockouts caused by hurricanes. We derive a simple test for structural state dependence based on the time series of choice persistence for households affected by the stockouts. Using data from the bottled water category, we show that demand increases substantially before hurricanes, causing households to purchase different brands. We find that purchase behavior reverts back to its pre-hurricane trajectory immediately after a hurricane, and we are not able to reject the null hypothesis of no structural state dependence. By contrast, the common approach of estimating structural state dependence based on temporal price variation via a discrete choice model yields a positive effect using data for the same category. We argue that our approach is better suited to identify the causal impact of past choices because it requires fewer assumptions and is based on more plausibly exogenous variation in brand switching resulting from stockouts.

  abstract     = {We study dealer compensation in the indirect auto lending market, where most lenders give dealers the discretion to mark up interest rates and the markup constitutes a dealer’s compensation. To protect consumers from potential discrimination by this dealer discretion, several banks adopted a policy that removes dealer discretion and compensates dealers by a fixed percentage of the loan amount. We document that this policy decreased (increased) the interest rates for low-credit (high-credit) consumers; however, the market share of these banks also decreased (increased) in low-credit (high-credit) segments—a reversal of the usual demand curve. This reversal highlights a significant influence of auto dealers on consumer choices. Accordingly, we develop an empirical model that features dealer-consumer bargaining. Our estimation results show systematically different levels of bargaining power across consumer groups. We use the model to explore alternative compensation schemes that remove dealer discretion. We find that a lump-sum compensation scheme obtains the most market share. In addition, the optimized lump-sum scheme improves consumer welfare compared with the adopted policy. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for the incentives and bargaining power of middlepersons. History: Puneet Manchanda served as the senior editor.

We estimate our model using data from a leading data science competition platform and recover the heterogeneous preferences and abilities of participants that determine whether and with whom they form teams. Overall, teamwork enhances performance and competition fosters collaboration, whereas incomplete information about potential coworkers’ ability hinders collaboration. Using the estimation results, we conduct counterfactuals to investigate how the information on potential collaborators’ ability and competitive pressure affect collaboration and performance outcome. Our results suggest that the platform could further improve collaboration and yield better outcomes by providing more informative signals of ability and further concentrating the allocation of rewards to top performers.

  abstract     = {We present an empirical framework for creating dynamic coupon targeting strategies for high-dimensional and high-frequency settings, and we test its performance using a large-scale field experiment. The framework captures consumers’ intertemporal tradeoffs associated with dynamic pricing and does not rely on functional form assumptions about consumers’ decision-making processes. The model is estimated using batch deep reinforcement learning (BDRL), which relies on Q-learning, a model-free solution that can mitigate model bias. It leverages deep neural networks to represent the high-dimensional state space and alleviate the curse of dimensionality. The empirical application is in a multibillion-dollar livestream shopping context. Our BDRL solution increases the platform’s revenue by twice as much as static targeting policies and by 20\% more than the model-based solution. The comparative advantage of BDRL comes from more effective and automatic targeting of consumers based on both heterogeneity and dynamics, using exceptionally rich, nuanced differences among consumers and across time. We find that price skimming, reducing discounts for attractive hosts, and increasing the coupon discount level at a faster rate for low spenders are effective strategies based on dynamics, consumer heterogeneity, and the two combined, respectively.

  abstract     = {Information sharing becomes increasingly important in recent years as online platforms gather massive consumer information that is typically invisible by upstream manufacturers and competing sellers/retailers. We study an online platform’s demand information sharing strategy in a distribution channel where a manufacturer distributes products through both platform and seller channels. We consider two different selling structures: the conventional reselling model (in which the platform acts as a reseller) and the agency/marketplace model (in which the platform acts as an agency). We find that for both selling formats, the platform always has incentives to share information with at least one party (either manufacturer or seller or both). The marketplace selling format gives the platform stronger incentives to share information with the seller. With low competition in the reselling model, the platform may not share information with the manufacturer, whereas it always does in the marketplace model. Interestingly, the forecasting accuracy does not structurally change optimal information sharing in the reselling model but induces the platform to share information with both the manufacturer and the retailer when it is high or low in the marketplace model. Our findings provide useful guidelines for an online platform on when and whom to share demand information with.

In our data set with 162,360 terminating employees covered by 28 retirement plans, 41.4\% of employees leaked by cashing out 401(k) savings at job separation, most draining their entire accounts. We investigate the impact of employer matching contributions on leakage at job termination. The “composition” of funds in one’s 401(k) balance matters: leakage increases with employer contribution proportion. Micropatterns in our data align more with behavioral than with economic explanations of this effect. We estimate that a 50\% increase in employer/employee match rate increases leakage probability by 6.3\% at job termination. However, there could be a 35.3\% reduction in leakage probability if employees ignore the perceived incentive generated by the account composition effect. Approximately 60\% of accumulated assets from a 50\% increase in match rate leak out of the system due to the account composition effect attributable to the percentage of assets contributed by the employer. Employers with more generous matches care about their employees’ well-being in retirement, but unintentionally nudge employees to cash out when they change jobs. We highlight proposals to help employers curb avoidable leakage. History: K. Sudhir served as the senior editor and Tat Chan served as associate editor for this article.

To do so, we synthesize and extend recent advances in causal machine learning techniques to capture heterogeneity in the content of the email subject line itself as well as heterogeneous consumer responses to the promotional offers and semantic choices contained therein. We find that content and framing are important for driving performance. We identify precise causal estimates of the effects of individual deal components, personalized content, and various semantic choices on consumer outcomes all the way down the conversion funnel. The decompositional nature of our methodology allows us to show how different combinations of key words and promotional inducements produce significantly different outcomes, both within a given stage and across all stages of the funnel. Notably, discounts framed as clearance events sharply outperform those tied to particular products. We also find components that drive engagement at the top of the funnel don’t always lead to conversion at the bottom: their efficacy, across the funnel, is significantly moderated by the engagement levels of the consumers who receive them. Finally, leveraging both aspects of heterogeneity, we use off-policy evaluation to demonstrate the potential for significant gains from improved targeting. History: K.

On top of digital advertising revenue, digital subscriptions provide news organizations with an additional revenue stream. At the same time, though, this creates a conflict with the news organizations’ societal obligation to keep the public informed. Using individual-level clickstream data from a major news organization and temporary paywall suspensions during events of public interest, we investigate how paywall suspensions affect subsequent subscription decisions. Although paywall suspensions enable news organizations to inform the public, does this hinder or contribute to their commercial interests? Adopting various identification strategies to analyze both unplanned and planned events, our analyses reveal that temporary paywall suspensions not only increase the amount of traffic during the suspension period, but also increase the likelihood that visitors become subscribers. We further examine how the patterns of content consumption moderate the effect of the suspension on subscription behavior. Our results suggest that the variety of content consumed during the suspension period is associated with an increased likelihood that website visitors choose to subscribe. History: K.

  abstract     = {Marketing scientists often estimate causal effects using data from pre/post test/control quasi-experimental settings. We propose a new, easy-to-implement augmented difference-in-differences (ADID) method that complements existing approaches to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) from such data. Its advantage over the difference-in-differences method is that it can better handle heterogeneity between treatment and control units and, hence, requires a less stringent causal identification assumption. Its advantages over more flexible approaches like the synthetic control method are that it is easy to implement, provides easy-to-compute confidence intervals, and can be applied to data where the synthetic control and related methods cannot be applied or may not be well suited. Examples are data with short pre- and posttreatment periods or with a large number of treatment and control units. Using analytical proofs, simulations, and nine empirical applications, we document the attractive properties of ADID and provide guidance on what method(s) to use when. With the addition of ADID in their toolkit, marketers are better equipped to address important causal research questions in a wider range of data structures.

However, Facebook and other ad platforms use complex and evolving processes to select ads for users. Therefore, successful non-experimental approaches need to “undo” this selection. We analyze 663 large-scale experiments at Facebook to investigate whether this is possible with the data typically logged at large ad platforms. With access to over 5,000 user-level features, these data are richer than what most advertisers or their measurement partners can access. We investigate how accurately two non-experimental methods—double/debiased machine learning (DML) and stratified propensity score matching (SPSM)—can recover the experimental effects. Although DML performs better than SPSM, neither method performs well, even using flexible deep learning models to implement the propensity and outcome models. The median RCT lifts are 29\%, 18\%, and 5\% for the upper, middle, and lower funnel outcomes, respectively. Using DML (SPSM), the median lift by funnel is 83\% (173\%), 58\% (176\%), and 24\% (64\%), respectively, indicating significant relative measurement errors. We further characterize the circumstances under which each method performs comparatively better. Overall, despite having access to large-scale experiments and rich user-level data, we are unable to reliably estimate an ad campaign’s causal effect.

  abstract     = {Past research shows that loyalty programs can generate switching costs for consumers and increase their purchase frequency. Theoretical work suggests that if switching costs are significant, firms should charge lower prices in the early periods of a program to boost market share, and increase prices in later periods, to take advantage of the “lock-in” effect. However, it is not clear whether these costs soften or exacerbate price competition. Using a large database of gas stations’ prices in the Italian market, we study fuel prices in early and late periods of loyalty programs: the sharp price changes adopted by gas stations affiliated with the program during the introduction and termination dates of the program allow us to establish the causal relationship between the program and the pricing behavior of gas stations. We find evidence that gas stations affiliated with the program increase prices in later periods of the program, as predicted by theory. The higher prices of affiliated stations lead to an increase in prices, on average, across all other stations competing in the local market. We also find that affiliated stations reduce their prices in early periods of the program; however, this evidence is less conclusive, as our data cannot exclude other factors explaining the price reduction. We discuss implications for managers and policy makers. History: Avi Goldfarb served as the senior editor and Tat Chan served as associate editor for this article.

  abstract     = {We provide new evidence that short-term rental (STR) platforms like Airbnb incentivize residential real estate investment. We exploit two complementary identification strategies. First, we use variation in the timing of STR regulations to estimate the effect of regulation on both Airbnb listings and residential permits. We find that over the first 12 months following the start of the regulation, STR regulations reduce Airbnb listings by 9.0\% and residential permits by 11.0\%. Second, we show that residential permits decline discontinuously across jurisdictional boundaries in which one side of the boundary has an STR regulation and the other side does not. The effect is especially striking for accessory dwelling units, which decline by 16.5\% across regulatory boundaries. Our results imply that STRs incentivize residential investment and especially so for housing units that are well suited for short-term renting.

We design and run a field experiment on a large review platform across 18,294 firms in the restaurant industry to understand which types of businesses gain more from digital advertising. We randomly assign 7,209 restaurants to freely receive the platform’s standard ads package for three months. The scale of the experiment gives us a unique opportunity to assess the heterogeneity in advertising effectiveness across a variety of business attributes. We find that restaurants that receive advertising observe on average a 7\%–19\% increase in a wide range of purchase intention outcomes, as well as a 5\% increase in customer reviews. We find that gains are heterogeneous across firms, with independent and higher-rated businesses observing larger gains, as well as those with more reviews and higher pre-experiment organic traffic.

  abstract     = {In 2020, as the novel coronavirus spread globally, face masks were recommended in public settings to protect against and slow down viral transmission. People complied to varying extents, and their reactions may have been driven by a variety of psychological factors. Based on the literature on social influence and on mask-wearing, we define three customer segments: Fully-Compliant customers wear masks, and they seem motivated primarily by concerns about their own health risk. Partially-Compliant customers also wear masks, but with improper and ineffective coverage; our empirical analysis suggests that they are motivated primarily by a desire to comply with social norms. Finally, Unmasked customers do not wear masks. We examine changes in shopping behaviors with the onset of the pandemic to corroborate the conjectured mask-wearing motives. We find that the three groups made significantly different behavior changes: Fully-Compliant customers shopped significantly faster and practiced stricter social distancing with the onset of the pandemic, whereas the other two groups did not adjust their shopping duration or social distancing.

  abstract     = {We study the impact of the emergence of private exchanges (PX) on the display advertising market. Unlike open exchanges (OX), the original exchange types that are open to all publishers and advertisers, the newly emerged PX is only available to a smaller set of prescreened advertisers and publishers through an invite-only process. The OX exposes advertisers to ad fraud and brand safety risks, whereas the PX ensures that advertisers purchase high-quality impressions from reputable publishers. Although the assurance of higher quality increases advertisers’ valuation for the PX impressions, we find that selling through both the OX and PX can hurt publishers by creating an information asymmetry among advertisers. In equilibrium, the publisher may sell through the OX, PX, or both depending on the baseline fraud intensity and the advertisers’ average valuations. Finally, our model sheds light on the OX’s incentive to fight fraud. In the absence of the PX, the OX has low incentive to combat fraud because it earns commission from fraudulent transactions. However, the introduction of the PX may create competitive pressure such that the OX screens fake impressions (i.e., the PX may induce the market to self-regulate).

To compare pricing policies, we propose an inverse probability-weighted estimator of profits, discuss how to handle nonrandom price variation, and show how to apply it in a typical consumer-packaged good market with supermarket scanner data. We generate pricing policies from Bayesian hierarchical choice models, regularized regressions, neural networks, and nonparametric classifiers using different sets of data inputs. We find that the performance of machine learning methods is highly varied, ranging from a 30.7\% loss to a 14.9\% gain relative to a blanket couponing strategy, whereas hierarchical models generate profit gains in the range of 13−16.7\%. Across all models, information on consumers’ purchase histories leads to large improvements in profits, whereas demographic information has only a small impact. We find that out-of-sample fit statistics are uncorrelated with profit estimates and provide poor guidance toward model selection.

  abstract     = {Reputation systems play a central role in the elimination of information asymmetry between sellers and consumers in a variety of marketplaces. Despite their crucial role, the design of reputation systems remains a complicated issue. Some platforms disclose as much product information as possible by encouraging consumers to leave reviews or ratings through the reputation system, whereas others disclose only partial product information to the public. Platforms, as the designers of such reputation systems, are thus an additional player in the seller-consumer game. This paper studies the amount of information disclosure in a reputation system that optimizes the platform’s profit. In a three-player game, sellers of products with different base qualities decide whether to invest in quality improvement; the platform decides how many ratings to disclose to prospective consumers; and prospective consumers make purchase decisions after observing the available ratings as indicators of product quality. We model consumers as Bayesian learners and specify conditions under which withholding some information (i.e., partial disclosure instead of complete disclosure) can maximize the platform’s profit. Two main effects favor partial disclosure: First, a quality-improving effect makes sellers more willing to invest in quality. Although complete disclosure can eliminate information asymmetry, it can decrease the seller’s incentive to invest in quality, which ultimately hurts the platform’s profit. Second, a sales-increasing effect leads to more transactions and thus higher profit for the platform.

The U.S. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children gives food vouchers to young children and their mothers. Using household-level scanner data, I study the reform of the program that introduced vouchers for healthier products. The difference-in-differences analysis shows that the reform makes purchases healthier during the program participation in the product categories most targeted by the reform (bread and milk). However, the effect is not always persistent. For bread, the effect decreases significantly within a couple of years after participants exit the program. Demand model estimates imply that price differences between healthy and unhealthy products play a large role in decreasing the program’s impact. Therefore, some differences in the persistence can be explained by the relatively higher prices of healthy foods. Counterfactual analysis shows that a modest postprogram subsidy might be a sustainable way to lengthen the program’s impact and lead to long-term healthier purchases.

Specifically, we examine when the manufacturer should restrict the retailer’s stockpiling ability and when it should issue trade promotions. Our analysis suggests the following. First, the manufacturer should restrict the retailer’s stockpiling ability when the storage cost is low; such restriction also benefits the retailer, resulting in a win-win outcome. Second, the manufacturer should offer trade promotions when the retailer cannot stockpile products and the storage cost is low but raise the wholesale price when the retailer can stockpile products. Third, stockpiling improves channel coordination and increases the manufacturer’s profit; therefore, the manufacturer should design products to be more storable.

  abstract     = {Signs of the gender gap are ubiquitous in society. Psychological theory suggests that, when gender stereotypes are associated with competition, men exert greater effort against women (dominance effect) and women exert less effort against men (submissive effect), which implies that women are at a disadvantage when competing against men. Although multiple factors contribute to the gender gap, attempts to identify these factors are hampered because gender, as a personal trait, is difficult to manipulate. Herein, the authors investigate submissive and dominance effects in the context of an online video game. They exploit a unique feature of the data: players have two-dimensional gender identities, one birth and one virtual. The results provide support for the dominance but not the submissive effect: when men perceive their opponent as female, they exert increased effort in competition, but women seem unaffected by their opponent’s gender, which leads to poorer performance for women when competing against men unless women conceal their gender. The findings provide important insights for how firms and regulators can help maintain gender equality in online environments. This paper also provides an example of how to assess social disparity with observational data by using a unique feature of the digital world. History: K.

  abstract     = {The extant literature has shown that when a firm increases its price because of increased demand, some consumers may have fairness concerns and experience psychological disutility when buying the firm’s product. This paper provides a two-period model to study the effects of consumers’ fairness concerns on firms’ dynamic pricing strategies and profits in a channel. Our analysis reveals a strategic link between the two periods—the retailer has a cost-reduction incentive of lowering its first-period price to induce the manufacturer to reduce the wholesale price in the second period. When the retailer’s cost-reduction incentive prevails, in equilibrium, the retail price stays unchanged, whereas the wholesale price decreases over time. Hence, our results provide an alternative explanation for the empirical observation that retail prices typically do not decrease when wholesale prices do. Further, we find that a higher demand increase in the second period can lead to a decrease in both wholesale and retail prices. Importantly, we show that consumer fairness concerns can result in a win-win outcome for the manufacturer and the retailer, which suggests that firms may prefer not using tactics such as price framing to alleviate fairness concerns.

  abstract     = {A common element of market structure analysis is the spatial representation of firms’ competitive positions on maps. Such maps typically capture static snapshots in time. Yet, competitive positions tend to change. Embedded in such changes are firms’ trajectories, that is, the series of changes in firms’ positions over time relative to all other firms in a market. Identifying these trajectories contributes to market structure analysis by providing a forward-looking perspective on competition, revealing firms’ (re)positioning strategies and indicating strategy effectiveness. To unlock these insights, we propose EvoMap, a novel dynamic mapping framework that identifies firms’ trajectories from high-frequency and potentially noisy data. We validate EvoMap via extensive simulations and apply it empirically to study the trajectories of more than 1,000 publicly listed firms over 20 years. We find substantial changes in several firms’ positioning strategies, including Apple, Walmart, and Capital One. Because EvoMap accommodates a wide range of mapping methods, analysts can easily apply it in other empirical settings and to data from various sources.

  abstract     = {It is prevalent in many markets that customers are provided menus of tariffs with usage-dependent marginal prices. One instance of such a nonlinear pricing scheme is additional payments on excess consumptions (e.g., overage charge, late fee, and add-on charge for ancillary features or services). Conversely, firms may offer loyalty credit for repeated purchases or consumptions (e.g., quantity discount contracts and redemption points or mileage in reward programs). Interestingly, both increasing and diminishing marginal prices may exist across and within markets but not concurrently on a menu. In this paper, we present a new perspective on whether and when firms should penalize or reward extra consumptions. We consider the standard problem of how a monopoly firm may design a menu of tariffs to sequentially screen consumers with multiple-period consumptions who are heterogenous in consumption value distribution and demand frequency. To relinquish less information rent to the high-type consumers, the optimal design should involve a tariff with increasing (diminishing) marginal price when the demand frequency of the high-value consumers is above or sufficiently lower (slightly lower) than that of the low-value consumers. This general pattern continues to hold under alternative settings on consumer heterogeneity and on uncertainty resolution about multiple-unit demand. History: K.

  abstract     = {There are two general challenges for social planners in combating a pandemic: how to increase antipandemic consumptions that exhibit widespread externality, and how to trade-off between efficiency and equality. We show that these conventional concerns need not always be valid. We consider a market for antipandemic resources, where two groups of people can be either high or low in their (diminishing) marginal private returns and the suppliers are price takers with increasing marginal costs. Our basic result is that the socially efficient consumption is higher for the low type but can be lower for the high type, relative to the competitive equilibrium. This is because the high type’s consumption is crowded out by that of low type who turns out to be marginally more productive in generating social benefits. Therefore, more equal consumptions can be efficient. Discriminatory subsidies in favor of the low type can maximize social welfare while yielding more equal consumptions. Quantity forcing or rationing can increase both social welfare and equality. In addition, policy portfolios combining uniform subsidy with quantity forcing or rationing can achieve full efficiency. Moreover, the main results are robust to alternative demand-side specifications, as long as the groups are sufficiently heterogenous in their overall consumption incentives.

  abstract     = {The United States recently mandated disclosure labels on all foods that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs), despite longstanding, widespread use of voluntary third-party non-GMO labeling. We leverage the earlier passage and implementation of a mandatory GMO labeling law in Vermont as a quasi-natural experiment to show that adding this mandatory labeling into a market with pre-existing voluntary non-GMO labels had no effect on demand. Instead, the legislative process made consumers aware of GMO topics and increased non-GMO product sales before the GMO labeling mandate went into effect. The GMO-related legislative processes also increased non-GMO product demand in other states that considered, but did not implement, GMO labeling mandates. We find that 36\% of new non-GMO product adoption can be explained by differences in consumer awareness tied to legislative activity. Our findings suggest that voluntary non-GMO labels may have provided an efficient disclosure mechanism without mandatory GMO labels.

It also leads shallow stores, where showroomers buy, to face a larger fraction of consumers who are insensitive to price. The overall effect of more showrooming can be to raise or lower prices.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, websites use a variety of recommendation systems to decide the content to display to their visitors. In this work, we use a multiarmed bandit approach to dynamically select the combination of house ads to exhibit to a heterogeneous set of customers visiting the website of a large retailer. House ads correspond to promotional information displayed on the website to highlight some specific products and are an important marketing tool for online retailers. As the number of clicks they receive not only depends on their own attractiveness but also on how attractive are other products displayed around them, we decide about complete collections of ads that capture those interactions. Moreover, as ads can wear out, in our recommendations we allow for nonstationary rewards. Furthermore, considering the sparsity of customer-level information, we embed a deep neural network to provide personalized recommendations within a bandit scheme. We tested our methods in controlled experiments where we compared them against decisions made by an experienced team of managers and the recommendations of a variety of other bandit policies. Our results show a more active exploration of the decision space and a significant increment in click-through and add-to-cart rates.

  abstract     = {This study develops a model of platform search design that incorporates the product-buyer match precision and the price weighting to study how the platform’s search design interacts with its revenue models. The analysis shows that the effect of precision on price is determined by the interplay between competition and incentives to search. When precision is low, increasing precision decreases prices by intensifying competition. However, when precision exceeds a threshold, it leads to higher prices because consumers are discouraged from active search as products become more homogeneous. The result has important implications for the platform’s search design under commonly observed revenue models: commission and ad slots. If the platform improves the match precision in a surplus-based search design, its revenue may decrease because it ignores sellers’ strategic responses to the search environment. An optimal search design that fully accounts for such responses features an increase in the price weighting at the threshold precision. Apart from the threshold, the optimal designs vary depending on the platform’s revenue models. In the commission model, the optimal price weighting can increase or decrease in precision. In the ad slot model, the optimal price weighting first decreases then increases in precision.

  abstract     = {When an item is temporarily out of stock, it is common practice for a retailer to inform customers that the item can be ordered but shipping is delayed. This is referred to as a backorder. Measuring the impact of backorder delays on future customer purchase behavior is critical for customer relationship management but challenging because of endogeneity: the best customers are most likely to experience backorders. In this paper, we develop a quasi-experimental approach to measure the effect of a backorder delay that generalizes to most online, durable goods retailers. We show that, on average, a backorder delay leads to a 2.1\% decrease in customer orders the subsequent year and is moderated by shipping delay. Among customers who experience a shipping delay beyond 10 days, there is a 6.1\% reduction in orders the subsequent year and a 4.6\% loss in cumulative orders over four years. In our study, this results in as much as 25 million dollars per year in lost profit. Attempts to mitigate the negative effect of backorders by varying the quoted shipping date had little measurable impact. But our analysis uncovers moderators of the negative impact, which allows managers to prioritize customer outreach among buyers who experience a backorder delay.

We consider a model where both these types of gaining information are possible. The information gained when owning the product may affect future product purchases. We characterize when the consumer chooses to purchase the product if the consumer does not own it, the expected interval of time between purchases, and the expected number of product purchases over time. We find that keeping product duration fixed, the optimal fixed price is independent of the initial product valuation if that valuation is sufficiently low such that a consumer not owning the product does not purchase it immediately and characterize how the price charged affects the consumer information gathering strategy. We also find that an increase in the information gained while using the product leads to an earlier purchase but less frequent repurchases thereafter. On the other hand, an increase in the information gained prior to purchase leads to later purchases but more frequent repurchases thereafter. When the firm can also choose product duration and there are no costs of production, we find that the firm chooses an expected product duration that is infinitely small and charges a flow price for the consumer to use the product. We also characterize how the extent of learning when owning and when not owning the product, the duration of the product, and the discount rate affect the optimal consumer and firm strategies.

  abstract     = {We study how an online marketplace’s personalized product recommendations and its consumer profiling accuracy affect third-party sellers’ competition and the market outcomes. Sellers strategically adjust prices to compete for the marketplace’s recommendations. As the marketplace more accurately predicts consumers’ preferences, the equilibrium price first decreases and then increases, and both the marketplace’s and the sellers’ profits may decrease despite the improved recommendation accuracy. Moreover, recommending the most profitable product for each recommendation may reduce profits of the marketplace and the sellers, and the marketplace can benefit from excluding pricing information in its recommendation decisions to prevent sellers’ recommendation competition. Counterintuitively, regulations that bar recommendations from considering profit margin information can lead to higher prices and thus harm consumers. These results are driven by competing sellers’ three distinctive incentives: competing for recommendations, exploiting targeted consumers, and undercutting rivals’ prices. We also find that our key insights remain qualitatively unchanged if the marketplace recommends products based on consumer surplus, and the equilibrium price will be lower in comparison. Finally, various extensions demonstrate the robustness of these results. History: Yuxin Chen served as the senior editor and Jiwoong Shin served as associate editor for this article.

  abstract     = {Speculative reselling has long existed in many markets. Speculators purchase products that are in limited supply to resell at inflated prices later. A somewhat puzzling observation is that although firms often impose restrictions on speculation, we rarely observe actions that completely eliminate it. This paper explains why and how an intermediate level of restrictions on speculative resale may be optimal for the firm purely from the perspective of the firm’s most desired amount of such resale, that is, without reliance on the decision space constraints. We consider a firm with limited capacity and consumers deciding whether to buy the product in advance (before their individual valuation uncertainty is resolved) or to wait at the risk of an increased price or sold-out product. We find that consumer willingness to pay in advance and the firm’s profit may indeed be maximal at an intermediate level of restrictions on speculative reselling. Extending the model to allow consumer-to-consumer resale, we obtain that in our model, whenever an intermediate level of speculative reselling is optimal without the consumer ability to resell, this ability would hurt the firm. This may further explain why resale restrictions may be formulated in such a way that only knowledgeable resellers (speculators) are able to circumvent them.

The mechanism relies on consumers having heterogeneous search cost and applies even if they have identical demand.

Relative to uniform pricing retailers who receive the trade promotion sell to a disproportionately larger share of low search cost consumers who are more price sensitive, making these retailers compete stronger. Retailers that do not receive the trade promotion lower their margins, serve a smaller customer base, and are keen to prevent more consumers from leaving.

  abstract     = {This report summarizes the finalists of the INFORMS Society for Marketing Science (ISMS) Gary Lilien Marketing Science Practice Prize Competition, designed to identify, encourage, recognize, and reward the application of impactful marketing science to industry and noncommercial settings. These applications aim to showcase innovative and impactful examples of applications demonstrating the best of rigor and relevance that our profession produces. The 2020 winner described an application of corporate valuation with a customer-driven approach, whereas the 2022 winner reported a large-scale randomized controlled trial of the effect of front-of-pack labels on the nutritional quality of supermarket food purchases. The other four finalists include studies of dynamic structural analysis of salesforce management (2020), promotional campaign duration and word-of-mouth in solar panel adoption (2022), personalization in email marketing (2022), and reducing product returns through green nudges (2022). As the ISMS Vice Presidents of Practice, we draw several conclusions on how to further marketing science applications above and beyond the typical academic settings.

  abstract     = {Brands increasingly face pressure from consumers to take a stance on political issues, but there is limited empirical evidence on the effect of political consumerism on sales. In this paper, we quantify the consequences of a brand taking a political stance. In July 2020, the chief executive officer of Goya, a large Latin food brand, praised then president Donald Trump, triggering a boycott and a counter “buycott” movement supporting the brand. Using consumer-level purchase data, we measure the net effect of the boycott/buycott movements on sales. Boycott-related social media posts and media coverage dominated buycott ones, but the sales impact was the opposite: Goya sales temporarily increased by 22\%. However, this net sales boost fully dissipated within three weeks. We then explore heterogeneity in the sales response with the goal of understanding which households are most likely to engage in political consumerism and what factors serve as frictions to participation. We document large sales increases (56.4\%) in heavily Republican counties but do not find a strong countervailing boycott effect in heavily Democratic counties or among Goya’s core customer base—Latino consumers. Finally, we show that brand loyalty and switching costs are potential explanations for the limited evidence of boycotting among experienced Goya customers.

The authors use detailed consumer-level shopping panel data to document two surprising and striking findings. First, social media calls to boycott had almost no effects, especially among the core Goya consumer group: democratic-leaning Latinos. Second, the authors document an unintended consequence: Goya’s supporters reacted by initiating a call for a “buycott.” The boycott and buycott combination ultimately increased Goya sales, especially among nontraditional Republican-leaning buyers, albeit only for a few weeks. We hope this paper will stimulate more work to determine which aspects of these findings generalizes to other instances of political consumerism. In our discussion, we offer thoughts on some of the potentially exceptional circumstances of the Goya case study and some directions for deeper testing of the underlying mechanisms driving the consumer responses.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates a newly observed pricing practice by which a seller frames a price increase as a discount by simultaneously increasing the price and introducing a list price, a scheme we call “price-increase and list-price synchronization” (PILPS). To investigate this potentially deceptive practice, we tracked multiple product categories on Amazon over a 13-month period. We find that PILPS (1) is a prevalent practice adopted by a broad range of categories and sellers, (2) allows sellers to simultaneously achieve higher profit margins and a larger sales volume at consumers’ expense, and (3) is most effective for and more likely to be deployed by products with advantages in consumer reviews. Current regulations of deceptive pricing focus on the legitimacy of the value of a reference price by, for instance, deterring the use of fake or inflated list prices. PILPS, which misleads consumers by synchronizing the timing of a price increase with list-price introduction, has so far managed to fly under the regulatory radar. Our research provides the first empirical evidence of the existence, prevalence, and impact of this new manipulation of reference price. These results provide helpful insights for consumers, consumer advocates, and policy makers. History: K. Sudhir served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {In light of the widely discussed political divide and increasing societal polarization, we investigate in this paper whether the polarization of political ideology extends to consumers’ preferences, intentions, and purchases. Using three different data sets—the publicly available social media data of over three million brand followerships of Twitter users, a YouGov brand-preference survey data set, and Nielsen scanner panel data—we assess the evolution of brand-preference polarization . We find that the apparent polarization in political ideologies after the election of Donald Trump in 2016 stretches further to the daily lives of consumers. We observe increased polarization in preferences, behavioral intentions, and actual purchase decisions for consumer brands. Consistent with compensatory consumption theory, we find that the increase in polarization following the election of Donald Trump was stronger for liberals relative to conservatives, and that this asymmetric polarization is driven by consumers’ demand for “Democratic brands” rather than the supply of such brands. From a brand perspective, there is evidence that brands that took a political stance observed a shift in their customer base in terms of their customers’ political affiliation. We provide publicly available ( http://www.social-listening.org ) access to the unique Twitter-based brand political affiliation scores. History: K.

  abstract     = {In many durable good contexts, firms price-discriminate by charging higher prices for the latest functionality. By contrast, the software market sees little such price discrimination despite new versions being introduced over time. I propose that the software firm’s ability to price-discriminate is restricted by (1) the extent to which consumers value the innovation and (2) the cost associated with legacy software maintenance. To analyze this question, I use a unique data set of subscriptions to a Fortune 500 firm’s software products. In my data, consumers frequently choose to forgo the free upgrade, electing to renew legacy versions of the product instead. To distinguish among the different factors driving this pattern, I develop a dynamic model of consumer choice of product versions, renewal opportunities, and upgrades. The model estimates reveal that, although the majority of consumers value new versions, the high-value, price-insensitive consumers do not, causing it to be unprofitable for the firm to price the latest functionality at a premium. Even so, I find that this preference heterogeneity favors a shift to a product with automatic upgrades to the latest functionality, thus providing both a cost and a demand justification for this observed industry trend.

  abstract     = {Customers must often decide on the quantity to purchase in addition to whether to purchase. The current research introduces and compares the quantity-sequential selling format, in which shoppers resolve the purchase and quantity decisions separately, with the quantity-integrated selling format, where shoppers simultaneously consider whether and how many to buy. Although retailers often use the sequential format, we demonstrate that the integrated format can increase purchase rates. A field experiment conducted with a large technology firm found that quantity integration yielded considerably higher sales, amounting to an increase of more than $1 million in annual revenue. To demonstrate robustness and explore various contributing mechanisms, a series of laboratory experiments test and control for different elements of the selling formats. The results suggest that quantity integration can change the psychology of making a purchase: the integrated format anchors customers later in the decision-making funnel than the sequential format and additional implementation elements (e.g., the specific call-to-action used) may contribute to an increased effect. More broadly, this work sheds light on mechanisms underlying the influence of selling formats and the importance of how everyday choices are structured. History: K.

  abstract     = {In the canonical sequential search model, consumers inspect options consecutively until they decide to stop searching, a decision that occurs only once before consumers determine whether and what to purchase. However, using data on consumers’ online browsing histories, we document that consumers frequently take breaks during their search (“search gaps”); that is, they obtain information on a number of options, pause, and later resume their search. Furthermore, we provide model-free evidence that consumers take breaks from searching because of fatigue. To describe search processes that include gaps because of fatigue, we extend the Weitzman (1979) framework and develop a sequential search model that rationalizes search gaps by allowing consumers to additionally decide when to search an option: now or after a break. Fatigue enters the model through increasing search costs: the more a consumer searches, the higher the search costs per option; taking a break reduces these costs to a baseline and enables the consumer to resume searching at a later time. We estimate the proposed model using our data and quantify the effect of fatigue on consumer search and purchase decisions. We find the effect of fatigue to be larger than that of baseline search costs. Lastly, we illustrate the impact of search gaps and consumer fatigue on market outcomes via counterfactuals.

  abstract     = {Microentrepreneurs represent the most common type of business in the world, and marketing is a primary means by which they earn their livelihoods. They are especially numerous in emerging markets, and many live precarious lives characterized by poverty and potentially devastating exogenous shocks. This paper examines the marketing practices of microentrepreneurs by studying grocery retailers in a large slum in Cairo, Egypt. Employing detailed data on the marketing practices of these retailers, the paper examines why some microentrepreneurs engage in innovation in their marketing practices (and perform better), whereas others fail to do so. We highlight the causal effect of an important, but rarely studied, factor—informal property rights—on innovation in marketing practices among microentrepreneurs. Because few microentrepreneurs in the context we study have access to formal property rights, the threat of expropriation looms large in their lives. We show that those microentrepreneurs who possess their stores (without actually owning them) are substantially less likely to innovate in their marketing practices than those who lease their stores. We make use of an exogenous shock to property-rights laws to assess the causal impact of informal property rights on innovation in marketing practices. History: K.

  abstract     = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing marketplaces enable sharing of idle resources. When a renter requests an owner’s resource, the owner needs to decide whether to accept the request: accepting it helps the owner fill up the idle periods of the resource and generate a payoff but reduces the flexibility to serve a future request for a longer duration. This paper develops a framework to uncover the tradeoffs faced by owners on these platforms when making acceptance decisions, which can be used by owners to optimize their decisions and by platforms to improve their operations. The model explicitly accommodates two types of owners: some are attentive to the availability states of their cars and forward-looking, whereas others myopically make the acceptance decisions. Applying the model to unique data from a leading peer-to-peer car sharing platform in China, we obtain similar sizes of both types of owners and find that female, experienced, and younger owners are more likely to be strategic. The results also reveal the differentiated preferences of the two types of owners toward their renters. Building on model estimates, we calibrate the option value of each day in the future (i.e., the value of having the day available) for strategic owners and find it to first increase, then decrease. Two counterfactual analyses are conducted. The first analysis shows that if the platform imposes a minimum rental duration, strategic owners may become more reluctant to accept requests, even if the current availability state entails a higher expected payoff. The second analysis shows that with better understanding of its owners, the platform can greatly improve the matching efficiency by optimal (re)allocation of rental requests, a move that benefits almost all participants in the business.

  abstract     = {Customer privacy is increasingly important to marketers. High-profile breaches of databases containing sensitive customer information, and the growing need to build the infrastructure required to support analysis of big data present nontrivial obstacles to researchers seeking individual-level customer data from firms. In this paper, we show that recent developments in machine learning may enable firms to transfer a generative model instead of data , thus potentially obviating the process of anonymizing and sampling customer data for release for use in a variety of analytic use cases. We demonstrate the efficacy of a specific deep learning model, generative adversarial networks (GANs), in preserving desired characteristics of original data. We validate in real-world settings and find that GANs outperform benchmarks on the accuracy-privacy tradeoff. We also demonstrate that GANs can be used to solve marketing problems of price markups for optimal profits and customer targeting. Finally, we demonstrate that GANs have volume and velocity advantages, as the size of informational transfer grows according to model complexity, and it can readily handle real-time data streams.
