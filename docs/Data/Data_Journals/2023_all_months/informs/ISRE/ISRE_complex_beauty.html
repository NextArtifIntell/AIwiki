This study investigates the antecedents and consequences of relational learning between clients and vendors in outsourcing projects. Drawing on the collaboration framework in interfirm relationships research, this study examines the interdependence of coordination and cooperation. The two antecedents of relational learning (i.e., shared domain knowledge and motivational elements) represent coordination and cooperation mechanisms. We investigate the independent (main) and interdependent (moderation) effects of these mechanisms on relational learning from both the client and vendor perspectives. The findings show that the interdependent model is better in explaining the impact of coordination and cooperation mechanisms in outsourcing projects. This finding enables partners to understand relationship dynamics more comprehensively and develop collaboration mechanisms that can bring synergy between coordination and cooperation. Our study also shows that the perceptions of motivational elements are not symmetric between clients and vendors. History: Yulin Fang, Senior Editor; Ning Su, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Urban anomalies bring uncertainties to society, urban transportation systems, and businesses. Some urban anomalies, such as no-notice and/or unpredictable terrorist attacks or other urban strikes, if not handled in timely ways may result in loss of life or property and pose tremendous risks to public safety overall. Previous studies have focused on developing emergency-management technology but without in-depth analysis exploring how technology-mediated digital systems perform in reality. Besides, the recent literature has demonstrated significant interest in analyzing and comparing the traditional on-demand service (i.e., taxies) and ridesharing platforms (e.g., Uber). The majority of prior studies have focused on their complementary roles in determining environmental conditions. Little is known, however, regarding how and why the two types of platforms perform in contexts of uncertainty (e.g., under emergency situations). This paper aims to bridge this literature gap. Specifically, we consider different types of unexpected urban anomalies (including terrorist attacks, car crashes, and subway shutdowns) and collect large-scale trip data on taxi and ridesharing services. Empirically, we employ a difference-in-differences econometric model to compare the platform-level performances (measured by the number of fulfilled trips) of a traditional taxi system and a ridesharing platform after urban anomaly shocks. We observe that the ridesharing platform significantly outperforms the traditional taxi platform in coping with the uncertainties brought about by unexpected anomalies. We conduct a set of robustness checks to verify our findings and propose multiple possibilities to explain them. We conclude, conservatively, that the technological effect and the technology-enabled supply elasticity of the digital platforms are the main factors determining the differences between the platforms during an urban anomaly. This work offers important insights into the design of platform strategies, especially for the stimulation of the labor supply and incentivization of the adoption and use of technology in urban transportation systems in response to anomalous urban upheavals.

  abstract     = {External reference prices (ERPs) are recognized to influence consumers’ payment for physical goods. We examine the role of ERPs in a digital goods context, emphasizing the importance of disentangling the effects of two components of ERPs: the magnitude and the source. We first examine the impact of the price magnitude and then investigate how the impact of ERP magnitude is moderated by its source―the specific context in which the reference price is set—and by its perceived fairness. Using a laboratory experiment with 471 participants, we first establish that as an ERP increases, payment for digital songs also increases. Furthermore, the source of the ERP motivates payment differently. Indeed, consumers’ willingness to pay is more strongly influenced by a price recommended by the site than by information on the price paid by others. Last, we show that the perceived fairness of the ERP matters. Results indicate that when the ERP is perceived to be high, the marginal effect of an increase in ERP on payment is smaller than when it is perceived to be fair. We contribute to the understanding of the effect of ERPs in digital context, where the source of an ERP can be varied, and perception of fairness can be heterogenous across consumers. This has implications for the design of digital platforms seeking to sell digital goods using a flexible pricing scheme. History: Anandasivam Gopal, Senior Editor; Sunil Wattal, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Heuristics are mental shortcuts that have ubiquitous influences on decision making. We investigate whether and how different heuristics have distinct effects in the context of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. Drawing on theories on the roles that heuristics play in decision making, we conjecture that when borrowers use different heuristics based on distinct motives to set their loan amounts, their funding success and repayment performance also differ. Using detailed P2P lending data from a Chinese P2P lending platform, we examine two important numerological heuristics, the round-number heuristic and the lucky-number heuristic, which are observable in over 80\% of the submitted loan amounts. We find that round-number loans are less likely to get funded and exhibit poor repayment performance after being funded, whereas lucky-number loans exhibit the opposite pattern. These findings, which we attribute to the different motives behind the borrowers’ heuristic choices, challenge the conventional understanding that generally treats all heuristics as behavioral biases. Our results are robust to various identification strategies, including coarsened exact matching and instrumental variable estimation. Our paper sheds new light on the heterogeneity of heuristics and their distinctive implications for the credit market. History: Sam Ransbotham, Senior Editor; Tianshu Sun, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Software is instrumental to the accelerated pace of digital innovation, and our ability to rapidly develop and deliver digital products and services is largely based on the reuse of existing software. In recent years, packaged software reuse has emerged as an important phenomenon driving the creation of new software, both proprietary and open source, as well as the emergence and evolution of entire software ecosystems. Arguing that our theoretical understanding of the nature and the magnitude of current packaged software reuse practice remains limited, our objective with this research commentary is twofold. First, we draw attention to the importance of packaged software reuse and its relevance as a promising phenomenon of interest for information systems (IS) researchers. Second, we mobilize the concept of generativity to conceptualize packaged software as a form of technological innovation that fosters large-scale (re)combination and propose complex adaptive systems (CAS) as a theoretical foundation to help us engage with the current nature of the phenomenon. Using key principles of CAS as the generative foundation for our conceptual scaffolding, we offer a research framework for packaged software reuse and develop an agenda for IS research organized across three main axes. For each axis, we outline relevant research themes and research questions leveraging the nature of software as objects constituted of other pieces of software developed and maintained by heterogeneous groups of software developers. Shedding light on the renewed role of software reuse, our work contributes to ongoing conversations on generativity and software ecosystems as well as the design of digital products and services.

  abstract     = {Software piracy is a challenging issue faced by software firms and governments all over the world. To control software piracy, firms exert considerable effort in antipiracy measures. This paper uses game theoretical models to study how software firms should determine their antipiracy efforts and product prices. There are two unique aspects of our model. First, antipiracy efforts have both a direct effect and a cross effect on software piracy. Second, we capture two types of competitions when piracy exists: one between a legitimate product and its pirated counterpart, and the other between two pirated products. We find several interesting results. We show that due to pirated products’ buffer effect not studied before, eliminating piracy does not necessarily mean higher profit for firms. This reveals an unexplored advantage of desktop software comparing with Software as a Service (SaaS) that can totally eliminate piracy. Direct and cross effects have different impacts on firms’ decisions and profits. Opposite to what one might expect, when a firm’s antipiracy effort becomes more effective in increasing the cost of pirating its own product but not its competitor’s product, the firm becomes worse off under certain conditions. By contrast, if the antipiracy effort’s cross effect is higher, therefore increasing the cost of pirating its competitor’s product, a firm will always be better off. The managerial implication is that if a firm ignores the cross effect, it could underinvest in antipiracy effort, causing its profit to suffer.

  abstract     = {The assumption that generativity engenders unbounded growth has acquired an almost taken-for-granted position in information systems and management literature. Against this premise, we examine the relationship between generativity and user base growth in the context of a digital platform. To do this, we synthesize the literature on generativity into two views, social interaction (expansion of ecosystem boundaries) and product view (expansion of product boundaries), that jointly and individually relate to user base growth. Both views help us explain how opening a platform relates to the emergence and resolution of conflicting expectations in a platform ecosystem that result in new functions and expanded use. We adopt a panel vector autoregressive approach combining data from six large transaction platforms that engaged with open-source developer communities. We found that the dominant narrative of generativity engendering growth, although generally supported by our analysis, obscures the fact that the inverse is also true; that is, growth can lead to expansion of product boundaries (inverse generativity) and that generativity can be bounded; that is, growth can stabilize ecosystem boundaries (bounded generativity) . Against this background, we propose an extended generativity theory that presents generativity and growth in an integrative view and raises awareness about the limitations of the “unbounded growth” claim. We conclude that there is value in separating the two views of generativity conceptually and analytically, along with their relationship to user base growth, and we call for research on the pathways through which generativity produces growth.

  abstract     = {Energy costs represent a significant share of the total cost of ownership in high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Using a unique data set collected by massive sensor networks in a petascale national supercomputing center, we first present an explanatory model to identify key factors that affect energy consumption in supercomputing. Our analytic results show that, not only does computing node utilization significantly affect energy consumption, workload distribution among the nodes also has significant effects and could effectively be leveraged to improve energy efficiency. Next, we establish the high model performance using in-sample and out-of-sample analyses. We then develop prescriptive models for energy-optimal runtime workload management and extend the models to consider energy consumption and job performance tradeoffs. Specifically, we present four dynamic resource management methodologies ( packing , load balancing , threshold-based switching, and energy optimization ), model their application at two levels (purely within-rack and jointly cross-rack resource allocation), and explore runtime resource redistribution policies for jobs under the emergent principle of computational steering and comparatively evaluate strategies that use computational steering with those that do not. Our experimental studies show that packing is preferred when the total workload of a rack is higher than a threshold and load balancing is preferred when it is lower. These results lead to a threshold strategy that yields near-optimal energy efficiency under all workload conditions. We further calibrate the energy-optimal resource allocations over the full range of workloads and present a bicriteria evaluation to consider energy consumption and job performance tradeoffs. We demonstrate significant energy savings of our proposed strategies under various workload conditions. We conclude with implementation guidelines and policy insights into energy-efficient computing resource management in large supercomputing data centers.

  abstract     = {Customer-generated images (CGIs) on e-commerce platforms have been widely adopted as a promotional tool to persuade customers into purchases. Despite their prevalent applications, the effect of CGIs on customer postpurchase satisfaction has not been extensively examined. This study postulates that CGIs could cause expectation disconfirmation and reduce product uncertainty for customers, therefore making their effect on subsequent product ratings complex. We leverage multiple methods and data sets to gain a better understanding of this problem and underlying mechanisms. We employ a difference-in-differences model to empirically test our hypotheses and find that CGIs lead to a decline in subsequent ratings compared with product ratings not exposed to CGIs. Further heterogeneity analyses demonstrate that high CGI review rating and high aesthetic quality exacerbate the negative effect, whereas reviewer face disclosure could alleviate the negative effect. Through cross-product analyses, we find that the negative effect is more prominent for experience goods (e.g., women’s dresses) than for search goods (e.g., lightning cables). Finally, the underlying mechanism is further validated through a laboratory experiment that shows participants experience significantly higher expectation and more negative disconfirmation in the CGI group with high review ratings, whereas uncertainty reduction effect is insignificant, which collectively explains the decline of subsequent product ratings. These findings suggest that platforms and retailers should be aware of the potential negative effect of CGIs on the rating dynamics and take appropriate measures to circumvent it.

  abstract     = {This work addresses the problem of “user disambiguation”—estimating the likelihood of each member of a small group using a shared account or device. The main focus is on television set-top box (STB) viewership data in multiperson households, in which it is impossible to tell with certainty which household members watch what. The first main contribution is formulating user disambiguation as a predictive problem. The second contribution is a solution for estimating the likelihood that each individual in a multiperson household watches each TV segment. Kernel theories from the marketing, economics, and sociology literature inform the design of our method. This method learns priors for viewership in single-person households and then adapts them to the specifics of each multiperson household’s viewership history. Finally, we formalize two ad hoc heuristics that are currently used in industry (and research) for estimating audience composition of STB data and conduct a comparative analysis using simulated data, real large-scale viewership data, and a fully labeled panel-based data source. We find that our method has superior performance and practical value. The proposed solution has implications for advertisers, researchers who seek better understanding of TV viewership, and anyone using data generated by shared devices or accounts. A major TV provider has deployed this new method for use in its TV ad-targeting system. No personally identifiable information was gathered or used in conducting this study.

  abstract     = {Online matching platforms lack common informational mechanisms such as ratings and reviews that serve to reduce information asymmetry in transactional platforms. The lack of verified information about participants further exacerbates issues of information asymmetry in such markets. This study focuses on a novel role of verification in such matching markets—its ability to serve as a credible signal for a user when such verification is made optional and visible to other users. In collaboration with a leading online dating platform with no reputation mechanisms and where most of the information is self-disclosed, we design and conduct a randomized field experiment to examine not only who chooses to verify but also, the effectiveness of such optional verification for different types of users. Interestingly, we find that users on the two sides use the same signal very differently. Males act consistent with the conventional prediction of signaling, with high-type males being more likely to opt in to verification. As for females, we find that medium-type females are the most likely to opt in to verification as compared with high-type females. We also find that such differential opt-in decisions are related to the differences in the credibility of the existing key attribute of each side (viz., income for males and beauty for females). In examining the outcomes of verification, we find that verified users receive more contacts from higher-type users, with the high-type males and medium-type females benefitting the most. More interestingly, we find that verified users become more proactive and reach out to more and better potential partners. Further, the introduction of this voluntary verification facilitates desirable matching outcomes and benefits the platform as a whole. These findings have useful implications for research as well as practice. History: Ravi Bapna, senior editor.

  abstract     = {Because of a growing number of initiatives and regulations, predictions of modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly come with explanations about why they behave the way they do. In this paper, we explore the impact of feature-based explanations on users’ information processing. We designed two complementary empirical studies where participants either made incentivized decisions on their own, with the aid of opaque predictions, or with explained predictions. In Study 1, laypeople engaged in the deliberately abstract investment game task. In Study 2, experts from the real estate industry estimated listing prices for real German apartments. Our results indicate that the provision of feature-based explanations paves the way for AI systems to reshape users’ sense making of information and understanding of the world around them. Specifically, explanations change users’ situational weighting of available information and evoke mental model adjustments. Crucially, mental model adjustments are subject to the confirmation bias so that misconceptions can persist and even accumulate, possibly leading to suboptimal or biased decisions. Additionally, mental model adjustments create spillover effects that alter user behavior in related yet disparate domains. Overall, this paper provides important insights into potential downstream consequences of the broad employment of modern explainable AI methods. In particular, side effects of mental model adjustments present a potential risk of manipulating user behavior, promoting discriminatory inclinations, and increasing noise in decision making. Our findings may inform the refinement of current efforts of companies building AI systems and regulators that aim to mitigate problems associated with the black-box nature of many modern AI systems.

  abstract     = {The Internet and online channels have immensely transformed retailing, which has traditionally relied on brick-and-mortar and physical channels. In recent years, a hybrid and special omnichannel structure referred to as New Retail promising to tightly integrate online and physical channels has emerged within the industry; some industry experts tout New Retail as the future of retailing. For instance, in the New Retail model, retailers use physical stores not only as front ends for physical channel consumers but also as small local warehouses to serve online consumers. In this paper, we provide insights into competing firms’ retail channel choices among online channel, physical channel, and omnichannel under the New Retail model. The online and physical channels could differ in terms of geographical market coverage, consumer shopping cost, and consumer valuation: An online channel can serve both city and remote (suburban) consumers, whereas a physical channel may only be able to serve city consumers, and consumers could have a lower shopping cost in the online channel than in the physical channel but a lower valuation for the online channel than for the physical channel. We find that an equilibrium in which at least one firm operates the omnichannel emerges only when consumers have a higher valuation for the physical channel. Moreover, neither firm would operate only the online channel in this case. In contrast, when consumers have a higher valuation for the online channel than the physical channel, neither firm is likely to operate the omnichannel. The market and channel characteristics have nonuniform and counterintuitive impacts on firms’ profits under different equilibria. For instance, firms might not benefit from either increasing the differentiation between the channels within a firm or increasing the differentiation between channels across firms. Furthermore, an increase in the number of city consumers relative to suburban consumers can hurt the firm that serves only city consumers. The tradeoffs among interfirm competition, market expansion, consumer segmentation, and intrafirm cannibalization effects of firms’ channel choices drive our findings.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore the decoy effect in recommendation systems. Including a decoy item in a set of alternatives can influence the attractiveness of the other items by facilitating decision making. Prior research literature has indeed shown the decoy effect to be robust in traditional choice settings, with consistent reporting of an overall positive impact. Practitioners often use decoys to help drive demand for specific items. Recommendation systems too are increasingly being used to present item choice sets to customers and users. Both recommendation systems and the decoy effect can be used as strategies to help facilitate decision making. However, previous work has not examined the decoy effect in the context of recommendations. The decoy effect may facilitate consumer decision making and positively impact user behavior when used with recommendation systems. However, in the recommendation context, customers often have different expectations for the reliability and quality of the presented information. Hence, a decoy as a recommendation could signal issues in system reliability, resulting in a negative effect. We perform a randomized, controlled laboratory experiment and use persuasion theory as the theoretical lens to demonstrate that the decoy effect works differently in the context of recommendation systems. Specifically, we show that depending on the recommendation context, the decoy effect can or cannot drive demand for target items. We find that including a decoy minimizes the demand for the target option when personalized recommendations are presented, which deviates from the traditional decoy effect. However, a decoy increases the target’s demand when nonpersonalized recommendations are shown, following the conventional decoy effect. We explore the mechanism behind these findings and show the robustness of our results by conducting multiple analyses and additional experiments. The findings of our paper have important implications for the design of recommendation systems and our understanding of consumer decision making.

  abstract     = {Online healthcare platforms provide users with various intervention programs to promote personal wellness. Given the many options available, it’s often difficult for individuals to decide in which intervention to participate, especially when they lack the experience or knowledge to evaluate the interventions. This may discourage individuals’ continuous engagement in online health management. In this study, we are motivated to develop a personalized healthcare recommendation framework to help individuals better discover the interventions that fit their needs. Considering the challenges in intervention adaptation and diversification in a highly dynamic online healthcare environment, we propose an innovative online learning framework that synthesizes deep representation learning and a theory-guided diversity promotion scheme. We evaluate our approach through a real-world data set on users’ intervention participation in an online weight-loss community. Our results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of our proposed recommendation framework and each of its design components. Our study contributes to the emerging information systems research on prescriptive analytics and the application of business intelligence. The proposed modeling framework and evaluation results offer important implications for multiple stakeholders, including online healthcare platforms, policymakers, and users.

We conduct a large-scale randomized field experiment on a leading medical crowdfunding platform, showing friends’ donation information to donors in the treatment group and not showing such information in the control group, and examine how the likelihood to donate differs. In addition, we conduct a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate the informational value of different case attributes in conveying the patients’ need for help to donors. We find that for cases containing attributes with high informational value (e.g., minor patient, severe conditions), social influence is insignificant. In contrast, for cases lacking attributes with high informational value, social influence significantly increases donors’ likelihood to donate. Overall, our results show that the impact of social influence depends on the informational value of other information sources, suggesting that the social influence in our context is primarily informational. Our findings indicate that rather than generating an entrenchment effect, where cases with attributes of high informational value attract disproportionate benefits, social influence can increase donation likelihood to cases that lack such attributes, promoting more equal access to resources overall.

  abstract     = {Faced with uncertainty when choosing among a wide range of similar competing technologies, users often take a herding in technology adoption (HTA) strategy to make heuristic adoption decisions. The HTA strategy brings users cost and time savings and casts doubt on user staying power. The extant adoption research has long focused on user satisfaction with the performance of the chosen technology (also known as the expectation-disconfirmation theory perspective) but does not sufficiently account for the consideration of the decision process across competing alternatives. To fill this void, this research uses a holistic post-adoptive evaluation by introducing a regret perspective in relation to competing technologies. Specifically, we theorize and operationalize a new multidimensional construct of post-adoption regret and construct a research model to examine how HTA leads to post-adoption regret and how such regret influences user staying power. The results suggest that post-adoption regret is formed primarily through two routes, outcome and process, and it is found to be more related to user switching, whereas satisfaction is related to user retention. The research model is supported by two longitudinal field studies of users in Asia and Europe who chose between competing technologies in both forms of free software and paid hardware.

  abstract     = {The confluence of digital transactions, growing cybersecurity threats, and the internet of the future (e.g., web 3.0 and the metaverse) have made information privacy increasingly important to consumers and companies that rely on consumers willingly sharing their personal information. Although information privacy has been of interest to researchers for decades and much has been learned, one thing that perplexes scholars is the privacy paradox, which we define as a mismatch between stated privacy concerns and actual disclosure behaviors. In this paper, we shed light on this phenomenon and show that low-effort information processing triggered by cognitive depletion (Experiment 1), positive mood (Experiment 2), or both (Experiment 3) significantly attenuates the association between stated privacy concerns and disclosure behaviors. These findings do not indicate that individuals do not care about privacy because we find consistent evidence in the three experiments for a significant negative association between stated privacy concerns and disclosure behaviors when individuals have sufficient cognitive capacity (Experiment 1), experience a negative (or neutral) mood (Experiment 2), or have sufficient cognitive capacity coupled with a negative mood state (Experiment 3). Our findings reveal that the paradox is neither an absolute phenomenon nor a myth, but its existence is conditional on contextual factors, including psychological factors related to information processing. We discuss our contribution to privacy theory and provide implications for consumers, companies, and policymakers. History: Alessandro Acquisti, Senior Editor; Idris Adjerid, Associate Editor.

Existing link recommendation methods tend to recommend similar friends to a user but overlook the user’s diversity preference, although social psychology theories suggest the criticality of diversity preference to link recommendation performance. In recommender systems, a field related to link recommendation, a number of diversification methods have been proposed to improve the diversity of recommended items. Nevertheless, diversity preference is distinct from diversity studied by diversification methods. To address these research gaps, we define and operationalize the concept of diversity preference for link recommendation and propose a new link recommendation problem: the diversity preference-aware link recommendation problem. We then analyze key properties of the new link recommendation problem and develop a novel link recommendation method to solve the problem. Using two large-scale online social network data sets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over representative diversification methods adapted for link recommendation and state-of-the-art link recommendation methods.

  abstract     = {Widespread abuse of internet users’ privacy online has prompted user advocacy groups to implore governments to intervene and protect consumer rights. To study such interventions’ effects, we examine data-protection policies that policy makers and governments can enforce on websites, including consent-based user information sharing and subsidizing competing websites. We use a stylized analytical model to examine such policies’ impact on the decisions and outcomes of websites, users, and third-parties. Interestingly, we find that even though a consent-based policy may improve user surplus, in the absence of market entry and exit (static market), it has the unintended consequence of increasing the number of third-parties and, thus, sharing of user information. We also determine that both consent-based and website subsidization policies may reduce competition by driving websites out of the market—to the detriment of user surplus and social welfare. To validate our analytical model’s findings, we empirically investigated the impact of a consent-based policy on third-parties in a natural experiment of the California Consumer Privacy Act. These findings raise significant implications for policy making surrounding online privacy. History: Giri Kumar Tayi, Senior Editor; Nachiketa Sahoo, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Software components, such as application programming interfaces (APIs), provided by both the platform owner and external developers in a platform ecosystem are vital to online digital platforms. These APIs are associated with functionality provided by the platform. A larger number of APIs used is generally associated with an increase in the platform ecosystem’s variety of products. However, the precise nature of the relationship between the use of APIs and product variety in a platform ecosystem is not yet known because of the lack of appropriate methodologies to analyze the complex data generated in such platform ecosystems. Drawing on a recombinatorial design perspective, we use a dynamic network model to create metrics for product variety in a digital ecosystem and study how the use of different types of APIs affects product variety. In particular, we theorize that, contrary to existing models, the structure of APIs in a large platform ecosystem is not limited to a core–periphery structure, but includes an additional third layer that we refer to as the regular core. We further hypothesize that external APIs in the regular core play a crucial role in increasing product variety in the ecosystem. To test our hypothesis, we conduct an empirical study using longitudinal data of all available digital product (i.e., plug-in) source codes on WordPress.org, the world’s largest content management system and one of the most extensive digital platform ecosystems. By analyzing all of the plug-ins on WordPress over 10 years from its inception, we find the support of our three-layer structure of APIs in a platform ecosystem: complete core, regular core, and periphery.

  abstract     = {An extensive literature studies the benefits for a firm to be the first to invest in innovative technologies such as information technologies (ITs). However, IT investment often faces the risk of implementation failure. How would such risk affect an early adopter’s incentive to invest? Do late adopters benefit from information about the early adopter’s investment? In this paper, we investigate these questions in a context in which two firms, a leader and a follower, invest in a cost-reducing IT sequentially. This paper differs from prior literature in two aspects: First, IT adoption is nonexclusive and available to all client firms. Second, IT implementation can fail. In this case, the follower may have information about the leader’s IT investment level or implementation outcome before making an investment decision. We use a Hotelling model of duopoly competition to examine how IT implementation failure risks and the follower’s knowledge about the leader’s IT investment may affect the firms’ incentive to sequentially invest in IT. Our results show that the risk of IT implementation failure impacts the firms’ investment incentives and profits through three distinct effects: the first mover advantage mitigation; competition mitigation; and uncertainty-driven, cost-based differentiation effects, and these three effects may drive the firms’ investment and profits in opposite directions. The follower’s knowledge about the leader’s IT investment level before making an IT investment decision gives the leader a first mover advantage and the follower a disadvantage. In contrast, the follower’s knowledge about the leader’s IT implementation outcome can benefit both the leader and the follower. Finally, we find that a spaced-out sequential IT investment schedule, in which the follower makes the investment decision after the leader’s IT investment level and implementation outcome are both known, leads to the highest industry-wide IT investment and social surplus.

  abstract     = {With the ongoing digitalization of human society, regular employees (e.g., noninformation technology experts) become increasingly autonomous and proactive in using organizational data and information technologies to facilitate data-driven actions and insights. This growing autonomy of regular employees (dubbed here, empowered users ) in using information technologies creates new challenges. As most empowered users lack sophisticated information technology skills, they struggle to find and access relevant data, understand their meaning, and extract and adapt them to meet their needs. We propose a powerful way to support empowered users with a combination of conceptual models and narratives. A data narrative is a descriptive and textual representation of one or more aspects of data in a domain that is organized and presented as a connected sequence of sentences in a natural language. We assess the efficacy of narrative representations for conceptual modeling cardinality constraints, which are an essential part of understanding data. We conducted two laboratory experiments and found a positive and strong effect for narratives: cardinality constraints that were described in the narratives were better understood than constraints only represented in the model (i.e., script). This effect was robust across cardinalities, measures, script complexities, and familiarity levels with the conceptual modeling grammar.

  abstract     = {Mixed or inconsistent opinions are commonplace in online reviews. Prior research shows that review inconsistency has different effects: its product-level manifestation in the form of inconsistent product ratings is associated with poorer sales, but its review-level manifestation in the form of two-sided arguments is associated with greater helpfulness and credibility evaluations of the review. In practice, consumers rarely consult all reviews or just a single review before they make purchase decisions. Instead, they often read a set of featured reviews (i.e., a review set) and some additional reviews if needed. Focusing on inconsistency in a review set, we introduce a new type of inconsistency across reviews that does not exist within a single review or at the level of product ratings: cross-review incoherence, which refers to disagreement among reviewers about specific product features. Based on cognitive dissonance theory, we explore how and when cross-review incoherence influences helpfulness and credibility judgments of the review set, revealing that consumers’ reactions to such incoherence might operate differently beyond an individual review. In addition, we examine how and why consumers’ judgments of a review set influence their purchase deferral—that is, the likelihood of making a buy-or-not-buy decision immediately after consulting the top reviews or deferring it until after obtaining more information. Two laboratory experiments demonstrate that cross-review incoherence increases purchase deferral via more negative evaluations of the review set that, in turn, reduce attitude certainty. In addition, the negative effect of cross-review incoherence on review set evaluations is weaker when the reviewers provide more contextual information behind their opinions. These findings deepen our understanding of inconsistency across multiple pieces of information; reveal the consequences of review evaluations during an understudied stage of consumers’ decision-making process; and provide critical implications for review platforms, companies, and reviewers.

  abstract     = {At the core of reward-based crowdfunding (RBC) is the reward menu. Carefully constructed reward menus can impact fundraising success significantly. For example, an oft-discussed approach to influencing purchasing decisions is introducing an irrelevant option into a consumer’s choice set—a decoy option—making another, often more valuable, option more attractive. This phenomenon is also known as the attraction effect. Prior research, however, has found mixed evidence for its occurrence in applied settings because it has largely employed simplified attribute presentation—with only numeric attributes such as ratings—and hypothetical choices, which had no economic consequences. Hence, researchers questioned the practical significance of the attraction effect. In this paper, we examine whether the attraction effect will manifest in an applied setting such as the crowdfunding context, where product attributes are both numerical (e.g., price) and nonnumerical (e.g., content of a product), choices have economic consequences, and organizations offer several menu options to consumers. We draw upon the salience theory and propose four hypotheses, suggesting that introducing an irrelevant decoy option in choice sets, created digitally in reward menus, may lead backers to choose higher-priced options. We conducted seven online experiments and a field study on Kickstarter (in total, n = 3,998 participants), with increasing levels of similarity with RBC. We found that the attraction effect significantly shifted backers’ preferences from a low-priced to a high-priced reward by 18.8\% to 28.2\% in different settings, highlighting the substantial potential of properly designed digital reward menus to influence funders’ choices. Given that researchers have expressed skepticism about the attraction effect in applied settings, our results are particularly significant, suggesting that information systems design can influence choice behavior. This research makes targeted contributions to the literature on crowdfunding, the attraction effect, and digital design.

  abstract     = {Crowdfunding platforms are characterized by an uneven distribution of quality and resources. Some projects achieve outstanding and exceptional performance. Those projects, which we call “blockbuster projects,” are believed to have a considerable impact on crowdfunding platforms, especially on other concurrent projects. There are two plausible yet opposing predictions: they may exhibit both a negative effect by monopolizing backer attention and resources and a positive effect by increasing the activeness of backer side. This tension could be further complicated, considering that blockbusters are inherently heterogeneous, which could result in different interrelations with other concurrent projects. To fully understand this tension, this study examines the effects of blockbuster projects on the overall performance of concurrent projects on the platform and the nuances of such effects for different interrelations between blockbusters and other projects. Drawing on the cross-side network effects literature and integrating insights from the unique features of crowdfunding, we develop a theoretical framework that highlights the multidimensional view of blockbuster effects: we propose that blockbuster projects have an overall positive effect on the performance of concurrent projects ( overall effect ), and such positive effect is stronger for related blockbusters ( local effect ) and blockbusters emerging before the focal project ( temporal effect ). Using data from a leading reward-based crowdfunding platform, the proposed hypotheses are tested and largely supported. Additional analyses, based on off-platform data and backer data, verify the mechanism driving the blockbuster effects: blockbusters increase the popularity of the platform, whereby backers participating in the blockbusters tend to develop positive impressions and heightened expectations, so that they are likely to participate in other concurrent projects. This study contributes to the crowdfunding literature on interactions among projects, the literature on distinctive agents in online markets, and the cross-side network effects literature. We also discuss practical implications for project creators and platform operators. History: Anandasivam Gopal, Senior Editor; Sunil Wattal, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Many mobile applications use push notifications and reminders to explicitly educate, remind, and motivate users to perform healthy behaviors. However, users do not always act according to these explicit digital interventions. Our study investigates whether users’ self-regulation can be implicitly facilitated with a proper mobile interaction design. Specifically, we investigate the impacts of two touch modes that are supported by force-based interaction technology, that is, pressing and tapping. Drawing on the theory of embodied cognition, which suggests that people automatically infer meanings from their bodily actions, we conjecture that pressing, compared with tapping, enhances self-regulation because the action of pressing on the touchscreen embodies resolute approach motivation toward goals. We test our hypotheses in three experiments. The first experiment investigates beverage choices on a mobile app; the second experiment examines goal setting on a fitness app; and the third experiment focuses on personal hygiene learning on a mobile education app. The results from the three experiments show that pressing actions can improve users’ self-regulation in selecting a healthier but less tasty beverage (Study 1), setting higher exercise goals and performing more physical exercise (Study 2), and reducing lapses in maintaining personal hygiene (Study 3). In addition, such effects were more salient among users with a higher level of health knowledge and a promotion-focused health orientation. This study contributes to healthcare IT research by showing that mobile interaction can be leveraged to nudge users toward enhanced self-regulation.

We examine personalization in a hitherto unaddressed context: that of mobile app distribution. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive framework for the personalized ranking of app impressions, leveraging revealed preferences embedded in consumer clickstream data. To improve platform revenues, the framework jointly accounts for consumer utility and cost per action (CPA) margin, which is the revenue earned by the platform per app installation. To this end, we specify a structural model of click and installation choices, jointly estimated as a function of a comprehensive set of numerical (screen rank, quality, and popularity) and textual (titles, descriptions, and reviews) covariates. Our novel data set is at the granular user-impression level and uniquely includes app CPA margins paid to the platform. We conduct a series of policy experiments to quantify the value of personalization. Specifically, we show that a personalized hybrid margin and utility margin ranking scheme outperforms other personalized methods, including those based on utilities alone or a combination of utilities and margins. Overall, our analysis demonstrates how platforms can leverage routine consumer clickstream data to personalize the ranking of app impressions, thereby more effectively monetizing mobile app distribution.

  abstract     = {Online health question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) platforms (OHQPs), where patients post health-related questions, evaluate advice from multiple doctors, and direct a bounty (monetary reward) to their most preferred answer, have become a prominent channel for patients to receive medical advice in China. To explore the quality of medical advice on these platforms, we analyzed data on patients’ evaluation of ∼497,000 answers to ∼114,000 questions on one of the most popular OHQPs, 120ask.com, over a three-month period. We assembled a panel of independent physicians and instructed them to evaluate the quality of ∼13,000 answers. We found that the quality of medical advice offered on the platform was high on average, and that low-quality answers were rare (6\%). However, our results also indicate that patients lacked the ability to discriminate advice quality. They were as likely to choose the best answer as the worst. The medical accuracy of patient evaluation was worse in critical categories (cancer, internal medicine) and for vulnerable subpopulations (pediatrics). Given that millions of patients seek medical advice from OHQPs in China annually, the social and economic implications of this finding are troubling. To understand how patients evaluate advice, we trained deep neural networks to think like patients, allowing us to identify patients’ positive and negative responses to different heurist cues. Although our results indicate that OHQPs perform well, we identified several concerns that should be addressed through platform design and policy changes. Because the Q&amp;A process lacks peer review mechanisms, signals of advice quality are not conveyed to patients, forcing them to rely on heuristic cues, which cannot effectively guide them toward the best advice. We also found that the platform reputation metric was not correlated with the quality of the advice giver’s advice, may effectively encourage patients to select lesser quality medical advice, and increased the risk of moral hazard for malicious players to intentionally provide less accurate but more agreeable advice for personal gain. Our analysis revealed bad actors on the platform, including drug promoters and spammers. Finally, we found that OHQPs exacerbated care avoidance . We discuss several potential policy changes to address these shortcomings. History: Param Singh, Senior Editor; Idris Adjerid, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Content providers in online social media platforms, particularly livestreaming, often switch content categories. Despite its uniqueness and importance, there is a dearth of academic research examining the unintended effects of providers’ content switching. We study the direct and indirect spillover effects of content switching for livestreamers—individuals who broadcast content through livestreaming platforms. We propose a framework based on theories related to viewer flow and network effects to conceptualize the direct and indirect spillover effects of entrant streamers’ content switching on the incumbent streamers. Contrary to conventional wisdom, which concerns the negative effects on the incumbent’s viewership, we propose two positive spillover effects that are unique to the social media platform setting: (a) the entrant streamers do not just increase competition among streamers, but they also bring their own viewers to the new category, which benefits the incumbent streamers because of a streaming flow effect (direct spillover), and (b) the entrant streamers influence incumbent streamers’ viewer size by boosting category visibility through indirect network effects (indirect spillover). We also propose that the two spillover effects are contingent on the size of the entrant streamers’ follower base. Based on a unique observational data set from the leading livestreaming platform (Twitch.tv), particularly with viewer flow data at the streamer–session level, we first estimate that average content switching is associated with a 1.3\% net increase in direct net viewer flow from the entrant to an incumbent. And this direct spillover effect is attenuated by the size of the entrant streamers’ follower base. We also estimate that average content switching is associated with a 2.6\% net increase in (indirect) net viewer flow from outside categories to an incumbent streamer. And this indirect spillover effect is reinforced by the entrant streamers’ follower base size. This study contributes to the emerging literature on the dynamics of content creation on social media platforms in the emerging context of livestreaming. We discuss the managerial implications of this study for streaming strategies and platform management. History: Yulin Fang, Senior Editor; Xitong Li, Associate Editor.},

  abstract     = {Cyberbullying on social networking sites (SNSs) escalates when bystanders join in the bullying. Although researchers have recognized the harmful consequences of joining in cyberbullying behaviors, little is known about the role of information technology (IT) and its underlying mechanisms in fueling such negative group behavior on SNSs. To address this research gap, we develop and test an integrative model that explains bystanders’ joining-in cyberbullying behaviors on SNSs . Based on the theoretical premises of the social identity model of deindividuation effects (the SIDE model), we derive two deindividuation experiences enabled by SNSs, namely experienced anonymity and experienced social identity . We further use the social network research framework to gain insights into how IT features (i.e., digital profile, search and privacy, relational ties, and network transparency) enable these two deindividuation experiences. Considering the socially undesirable nature of joining-in behaviors, we integrate the SIDE model with moral disengagement theory to explain how deindividuation experiences allow bystanders to bypass their psychological discomfort when engaging in such behaviors through the practice of moral disengagement mechanisms. Our research model is tested using a scenario survey, with two samples recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and Facebook. Our results support the influences of IT-enabled deindividuation experiences on bystanders joining in cyberbullying and demonstrate the mediating effects of moral disengagement mechanisms in bridging the effects of deindividuation experiences on joining-in behaviors. For researchers, the integrative view offers a conceptual bridge connecting IT features, deindividuation, moral disengagement, and negative online group behaviors on SNSs.

  abstract     = {This study examines whether and how an online service marketplace can leverage refund options endorsed by different parties (i.e., the platform or sellers) to address the “lemons” problem that is caused by the intangibility, variability, and unreturnable nature of the services sought. Through developing a signaling mechanism and a corresponding demand estimation model, we show that both platform refund insurance and a seller-guaranteed refund increase service demand, with platform refund insurance as the more effective option and hence having a more effective signaling mechanism. A reduced-form analysis suggests that sellers with a better reputation or less popularity might benefit less from refund options. An investigation on further use of the more effective refund option, a “having platform refund insurance or being cast out” policy (i.e., retaining platform refund-insured sellers but expelling uninsured ones), using counterfactual simulations and supply-side single interrupted time series designs, reveals the effectiveness of this policy in filtering out low-quality sellers, shown as an improved quality of sellers on the platform due to the change in sellers (i.e., new sellers’ replacing those who were expelled) both immediately after the policy and in the (near) equilibrium, yet a cost (i.e., a loss in demand and consumer welfare) for the platform in the (near) equilibrium due to the changes in characteristics (e.g., price) of sellers. This cost, however, is lower than the benefit from the improved quality of the sellers, so that the platform’s overall performance improves. The study also quantifies the consumer welfare of the online service marketplace and provides practical insight for consumers, sellers, and online service marketplace operators.

We theorize—inductively from decision making in medicine, energy pricing, auditing, and financial analytics—how judgment networks can exacerbate financial and nonfinancial judgment costs that compress information. Information compression occurs when a process intended to inform decision making generates information that has little variation. This can reduce decision quality and market efficiency. We offer potential remedies to mitigate its adverse societal consequences. We use complementary theoretical perspectives to nomologically contextualize how information compression arises. We introduce an information compression measure based on information entropy. TIC’s theoretical crux is that the expansion of a judgment network’s publicness exacerbates information compression by increasing judgment costs for some entities in a judgment network. We close with future research ideas on TIC’s core propositions and its broader theoretical implications for information systems research.

  abstract     = {As platform owners interact with end users and complementors, their demand-side characteristics and performance affect the overall value creation of ecosystems. This research investigated how the emergence of popular complements on a mobile communication platform impacts the usage of other complementary products by the platform’s end users and how platform owners can benefit from such demand spillovers. We identified two different forms of demand spillovers (i.e., backward and forward) and conceptualized how each subsequently affects platform expansion. On the basis of individual user-level app usage data, we empirically demonstrated how the presence of a popular app alters the demand structure of a platform through changes in the usage of other apps operating within it. The findings reveal that popular app adoption by users increases the number of apps used and the duration of app usage, excluding the usage of popular apps, only within the platform offering a popular app. These results support the existence of positive spillovers from popular complement adoption on a platform. Such positive within-platform spillovers are derived from both backward spillovers onto existing apps adopted before popular app adoption and forward spillovers onto new apps to be adopted after the uptake of favored apps. These patterns suggest that positive spillovers of popular app adoption occur through both the increased retrieval of existing apps and reduced uncertainty about newly released apps. Furthermore, forward spillover is considerably stronger than backward spillover, implying that platform owners can reap benefits by coordinating the launch of new complements and the promotion of less-known counterparts to end users with the emergence of a popular app. These results shed light on how platform owners can manage their complements and create value beyond direct contributions from popular complements.

  abstract     = {Transportation is a backbone of modern globalized societies. It also causes approximately one third of all European Union and U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, represents a major health hazard for global populations, and poses significant economic costs (e.g., due to traffic congestion). However, rapid innovation in vehicle technology, mobile connectivity, computing hardware, and artificial intelligence–powered information systems heralds a deep socio-technical transformation of the sector. The emergence of connected, autonomous, shared, and electric vehicle technology has created a digital layer that resides on top of the traditional physical mobility system. The resulting layered modular architecture is similar to that seen in other cyber-physical systems. Yet, it also comes with several characteristics and challenges that are unique to the domain of mobility and require entirely new solution approaches. Although other management and domain-specific research disciplines have started to embrace the new opportunities for research resulting from this deep structural change, the information systems (IS) community’s involvement in smart mobility research has been marginal. Yet, we argue that our field’s uniquely multidisciplinary, data-driven, and socio-technical research lens puts it in a strong position to address many of the large-scale societal challenges encountered in the mobility sector. Therefore, we make the case for IS research to play an active role in delivering a smart sustainable mobility ecosystem that is beneficial to users, mobility providers and the environment. We contribute a research framework to direct IS research efforts while providing a shared understanding of the smart sustainable mobility domain. We also present seven IS research opportunities along the dimensions of this framework and propose concrete angles of attack which we hope will spur an impactful and structured research agenda in the area.

  abstract     = {We consider the risk of reidentification of panelists in marketing research data that are widely used to obtain insights into buyer behavior and to develop marketing strategy. We find that 17\%–94\% of the panelists in 15 frequently bought consumer goods categories are subject to high risk of reidentification through a potential record linkage attack based on their unique purchasing histories even when their identities are anonymized. We first demonstrate that the risk of reidentification is vastly understated by unicity, the conventional measure. Instead, we propose a new measure of reidentification risk, termed sno-unicity, which accounts for the longitudinal nature of panel data, and show that it is much larger than unicity. To protect the privacy of panelists, we consider the well-known privacy notion of k -anonymity and develop a new approach called graph-based minimum movement k-anonymization ( k- MM) that is designed especially for panel data. The proposed k -MM approach can be formulated as an optimization problem in which the objective is to minimally distort variables in the original data based on weights that users prespecify corresponding to their use case. We further show how our approach can be extended to achieve l -diversity. We apply the k -MM approach to two different panel data sets that are widely used in marketing research. To achieve a given privacy level, compared with several benchmark protection methods, the protected data from our method result in the least distortion in inferences about key marketing metrics, such as brand market shares, share of category requirements, brand switching rates, and marketing-mix parameters estimated from a hierarchical Bayesian brand choice model.

  abstract     = {As the information technology (IT) services landscape matures, clients are increasingly adopting multisourcing arrangements that involve multiple vendors. Although a large body of information systems (IS) literature addresses issues of whether to outsource (to a single vendor), what types of contracts to use, and how to achieve optimal relational governance, little is known about the antecedents and consequents of the single versus multisourcing decision. Moreover, while conceptual and analytical models of single-sourcing versus multisourcing have been developed, there is no empirical IS research using a large-scale data set with rigorous econometric analysis that examines the antecedents and consequents of multisourcing in the IT context. This paper fills this void, using the transaction cost economic lens and a data set of 49,057 large IT outsourcing arrangements that spans multiple industries and dates back 25 years. We find that there is a curvilinear relationship between number of IT services in an IT outsourcing arrangement and the likelihood of multisourcing. This relationship increases as the number of IT services increases to up to five services and then decreases. For managers who plan to multisource IT outsourcing arrangements, this research provides guidance to minimize exchange hazards through a better understanding of the relationship between sourcing choice, client IT outsourcing capabilities, the competitiveness of the vendor landscape, and the number of IT services in an IT outsourcing arrangement. We provide empirical evidence that the choice between single-sourcing and multisourcing is material to the performance of outsourcing contracts as an incorrect sourcing choice is likely to result in negative contract outcomes.

  abstract     = {Sales on the e-commerce platform in the United States have experienced explosive growth and are projected to surpass $740 billion in 2023. The expansion of the platform’s traditional role as a reseller into an online marketplace and the introduction of its own brand products have stoked a huge fear among the incumbent sellers. The platform’s unfair anticompetitive practice further aggravates the situation. Consequently, politicians and regulators have proposed prohibiting platforms from introducing own brand products to protect the incumbent sellers. This study addresses two questions of critical interest to both the policymakers and the incumbent sellers. First, how does the platform’s introducing its own brand product affect the incumbent sellers? Second, how effective is the proposed policy in terms of protecting the incumbent sellers? We examine the impact of the platform’s own brand introduction on the incumbent sellers under two prevailing sell-on and sell-to pricing contracts. We find that the proposed legislation “that prohibits platforms from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace” does not have the desired outcome of helping the incumbent sellers. Instead, it forces the platform to adopt only the sell-to contract with the own brand introduction that hurts the sellers under most market conditions. Interestingly, when the own brand introduction is banned under the sell-to contract, the incumbent sellers can be better off because the platform’s strategic reaction to the enforcement can lead to the best scenario for the incumbent sellers. If the ban is imposed on both the sell-on and sell-to contracts, the platform’s best response is to add another new brand competing with the incumbent sellers, which can also help the incumbent sellers, however, not as much as in the case of the enforcement only under the sell-to contract.

  abstract     = {In online labor markets, contractors’ ability to charge for their services largely depends on their skills. To keep up with shifting labor market needs, contractors often expand their skills with new skills. When the new skills are similar to the contractors’ current skills, they often increase skillset cohesion (i.e., the average similarity of skills in a skillset). However, when the new skills have little similarity with contractors’ current skills, skillset cohesion decreases. Despite the recent surge in research that studies remote contractor behavior, little is known on how such adjustments of skillset cohesion affect contractor value in digital workplaces for short-term work. To investigate, I argue that skillset adjustments affect market value through changes in the contractor’s perceived reputation on the new skills and the additional job opportunities that new skills create. Building on prior work on individual-level exploration-exploitation, I hypothesize that compared with skills that decrease cohesion, skills that increase cohesion result in reputation gains and opportunity losses. If reputation gains are greater than opportunity losses, increasing skillset cohesion will result in higher market value than decreasing skillset cohesion. However, if the opposite is true, increasing skillset cohesion will result in lower market value than decreasing skillset cohesion. Empirically, I measure a contractor’s market value through hourly wages and hiring rates and skillset cohesion through word embeddings. Analysis of a panel data set of 47,638 tasks illustrates these tradeoffs of increasing skillset cohesion: for hourly wages, reputation gains are smaller than opportunity losses; hence, all else being equal, increasing skillset cohesion has a relatively negative effect on wages. However, for hiring rates, the opposite is true: increasing skillset cohesion increases contractor hireability. As the first study to explain the effects of adjusting skillset cohesion in digital workplaces, the work allows contractors to make better-informed decisions and guides managerial interventions.

The rise and maturity of artificial intelligence (AI)–powered conversational agents, also known as chatbots, beg the question: should AI agents be equipped with the ability to express positive emotion during customer service interactions? This research explores how, when, and why an AI agent’s expression of positive emotion affects customers’ service evaluations. We argue that AI-expressed positive emotion can influence customers via dual pathways: an affective pathway of emotional contagion and a cognitive pathway of expectation–disconfirmation. We propose that positive emotion expressed by an AI agent (versus a human employee) is less effective in facilitating service evaluations because of a heightened level of expectation–disconfirmation. We further introduce a novel individual difference variable, customers’ relationship norm orientation, which affects their expectations toward the AI agent and moderates the cognitive pathway. Results from three laboratory experiments substantiate our claims. By revealing a distinctive impact of positive emotion expressed by an AI agent compared with a human employee, these findings deepen our understanding of customers’ reactions to emotional AIs, and they offer valuable insights for the deployment of AIs in customer service.

  abstract     = {A ride-hailing platform is an app-based, two-sided platform that matches riders with vehicles via information technology (IT). In 2015, the Shanghai government introduced a policy to restrict taxi drivers’ access to and acceptance of ride requests via ride-hailing apps during certain hours. We conceptualize this policy shock as the restricting of information sharing enabled by IT and collect comprehensive data on various uses of transportation to gauge the economic benefits of this information sharing for existing capacity and its subsequent externalities on other transportation. Through a time series analysis, we identify significant decreases in the ridership of an affected taxi fleet during times of enforcement but significant increases at some times of nonenforcement postlaunch. Furthermore, the traffic on public transportation, via the city’s transportation cards, and the congestion on the surface streets and expressways significantly increase after launching the policy during both enforcement and most nonenforcement times. These suggest that information sharing via ride-hailing apps can improve the utilization of existing taxi capacity, which further alleviates traffic during alternative times and the burden placed on alternative transportation modes. Interestingly, our mechanism analysis shows decreased profitability after the restriction, which supports the notion that information sharing via ride-hailing apps reduces drivers’ search cost and thus enables them to match not only with more orders but also with those of higher marginal profit. This study contributes to the literature on ride-hailing platforms’ impact and the economic value of information sharing and IT by dissecting the compound ride-hailing’s impact to extract the value of information sharing enabled by IT and to reveal the underlying mechanism. Practically, we evaluate the policy studied, make postrevision suggestions for general contexts, and provide managerial insights on precise policymaking that best extracts the economic value of information sharing in ride-hailing and general forms of online two-sided platforms.

  abstract     = {Should hospitals source electronic health records (EHR) systems from a single vendor or multiple vendors to deliver high-value care? We study hospitals’ EHR sourcing strategies based on their degree of integration with physician practices and its impact on the value of healthcare delivered. We propose a novel framework to define healthcare value as the extent to which a hospital effectively expends clinical resources to deliver services that improve patient outcomes. Drawing on modular systems and transaction cost economics theories, we propose a moderated-mediation model that explores the pathways through which EHR sourcing strategies can create value in healthcare. We test our research hypotheses on a large, longitudinal sample of U.S. hospitals and observe that hospitals with EHR configurations closer to single sourcing strategies exhibit greater health information sharing compared with hospitals with multisourced EHR systems. Furthermore, we find that hospital-physician practice integration moderates the impact of single sourcing on health information sharing, which in turn, improves value. Specifically, tighter integration between hospitals and physician practices can create greater value if it is aligned with hospitals’ EHR sourcing strategies. As the healthcare industry moves toward value-based payment reform, our findings provide a useful roadmap to practitioners and policy makers to improve the performance of hospitals and healthcare providers.

  abstract     = {It is well acknowledged in the information systems (IS) literature that information technology (IT) plays an important role in firm innovation. A small but growing body of empirical evidence points to the importance of IT employees as an important complementary resource, particularly for IT-related innovation. However, there is an open question as to whether investment in such resources is complementary across a range of innovation types. This research note aims to provide theoretical and empirical clarity by emphasizing the complementary nature of firm investment in IT and in IT human resources (HR) in affecting firm innovation performance across four types of innovation: incremental, radical, non-IT related and IT related. Drawing on the theory of complementarities and theorizing about the operand and operant nature of resources, we argue that firm investment in IT HR enables firms to gain additional innovation value from their IT investments and vice versa. Using a sample involving 36,812 firm-year observations, we find that firms with robust investments in IT and in IT human resources produce more patents with greater value. Furthermore, we find that such firms produce more patents that emphasize new knowledge and those that build on existing knowledge. Finally, we find that this complementarity promotes IT-related and non–IT-related innovation. A series of analyses demonstrate the robustness of these results. We discuss implications for theory and practice. History: Yulin Fang, Senior Editor; Monideepa Tarafdar, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the sales trajectory of a product in its life cycle is critically important for firms’ medium- and long-term planning. Because classic product-diffusion models such as the Bass model consider only initial product purchases, they are ill-fitted for sales prediction for today’s technology products with a shorter life cycle and frequent repeat purchases or subscription renewals. Despite the long tradition of product diffusion research, there exists no viable model option when repeat purchases constitute a large proportion of product sales. The present study introduces a new sales growth model, termed the generalized diffusion model with repeat purchases (GDMR), to fill this void. The GDMR formulates the growth rate of sales using a noninteger-order integral equation rather than the integer-order differential equation typically adopted in existing diffusion models. The GDMR is parsimonious and easy to implement. Empirical results show that the GDMR fits sales data with varying proportions of repeat purchases quite well, making it suitable for predicting sales of a wide variety of products. In addition, the GDMR can be extended to incorporate marketing mix variables, thus enhancing its applicability in business decision making. Furthermore, using both real and simulated data, we show that the GDMR can reliably recover a product’s adoption trend using only sales data, thus cementing its theoretical validity and empirical effectiveness. Finally, we show that the GDMR is superior to generic time series and machine learning models in predicting future product sales. History: Ram Gopal, Senior Editor; Wenjing Duan, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {The presentation of online content is routinely adapted to the smaller screens of mobile devices by implementing an information architecture (IA) that hierarchically restructures the information being presented to users, in conjunction with layout and size adaptations. Despite the understanding that users of mobile devices are likely to experience lower usability and higher load without such adaptations, a recent trend is to offer these users the ability to opt out of content adaptation and revert to a desktop view. The prevailing justification for this trend is the existence of websites that fail to provide an optimal mobile experience. In this work, we show that a desktop view may benefit mobile users by increasing the accuracy of their decisions. Focusing on the difference between a desktop IA, where information is presented on a single page, and a mobile IA, where information is hierarchically distributed across pages, we hypothesize that mobile users exhibit lower decision accuracy when a mobile IA is implemented. We theoretically anchor this hypothesis in the effort-accuracy framework, which views decision behavior as contingent on the trade-off between effort and accuracy. This hypothesis is supported in two laboratory experiments in which participants are faced with the multiattribute choice task of making an online hotel reservation. The experiments also highlight a boundary condition for the negative effect of the mobile IA on decision accuracy, depending on whether the mobile IA is congruent with user preferences. The findings suggest that content adaptation on mobile devices deserves greater research attention, particularly from the perspective of adaptive decision behavior.

Despite the opportunities social media offers to brands to connect and engage with customers, it is still unclear how a brand crisis can change a brand’s social CRM efforts. Social media platforms can amplify the negative consequences of a brand crisis. However, the unique and public nature of social media platforms can offer new means for brands to handle a brand crisis and publicly manage their customer relationships. Compared with traditional CRM, social media enables brands to communicate with their customers publicly, which can strengthen their relationships with customers and maintain higher levels of customer engagement. Leveraging a natural experiment setting, we investigate the impact of the United Airlines crisis on three dimensions of social CRM efforts: informativeness, timeliness, and attentiveness. Contrary to traditional CRM efforts and recommendations, we find that the brand crisis increases informativeness efforts but reduces timeliness and attentiveness efforts.

  abstract     = {As of late, the use of “digital” as a qualifier to established research concepts is increasing. However, we have yet to clearly establish what makes a “digital x” concept distinct from an “IT x” concept when “x” stands for well-established concepts such as strategy, infrastructure, innovation, or transformation, among others. In this paper, we review the need for, and merit of, labeling focal concepts in our field as “digital x” in contrast to using the dominant, incumbent label of “IT x.” We position the shift as a call to attend to new salient features that characterize contemporary settings of information technology use and its effects. Recognizing this need, we develop guidelines for future research by arguing what novel phenomena the label of “digital x” foregrounds and how insights gained through such foregrounding contribute to scholarship in ways that the term “IT x” does not. By doing so, this paper promotes clarity for the use of the digital x concepts and introduces explicit guidelines to delineate between the nascent stream of digital x research and established modes of IT x research. We hope that the essay helps information systems scholars and scholars in neighboring disciplines attending to digital phenomena identify novel research opportunities grounded on sound conceptual foundations that will foster cumulative generation of knowledge around digital x.

  abstract     = {Social media platforms are facing increasing numbers of cyber-adversaries seeking to manipulate online discourse by using social bots (i.e., social media software robots) to help automate and scale their attacks. Likewise, some social media users can identify social bot activity at varying degrees of confidence. In this research, human reactions to social bot messages are used to augment existing social bot detection capabilities. Speech act theory is used to inspire a framework for assessing the credibility of instances where users identify potential bot activity, as not all user responses are of equal credibility for assisting with the bot detection task. The framework is then operationalized through deep learning methodologies to develop a computational system for identifying social bots. Real-world performance and practicality of the developed framework is demonstrated on a live, crowd-sourced data set collected from a real-world social media platform. Results show that consideration of crowd reactions to suspected bots can significantly improve bot detection performance. Furthermore, consideration of speech acts to evaluate crowd reactions can even further augment the system’s performance, although speech acts themselves are not necessary to observe performance boost through crowd intelligence. This study serves as a grounding point for future work that can explore an augmented model for detecting other forms of algorithmically generated content within social media platforms.

  abstract     = {Many of today’s software systems are created by leveraging ecosystems consisting of heterogeneous “complementors” and “hub” firms. In fact, the reliance on ecosystems is prevalent in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) domain, where larger ERP vendors form collaborative relationships with smaller industry-specific vendors to co-create value for themselves and their customers. However, value creation and destruction processes are often intertwined. A key motivation for this study is to shed light on the behavioral contingencies and underlying mechanisms that might lead to value destruction over time instead of the initially intended value co-creation. Furthermore, although value co-creation in collaborative relationships associated with ecosystems is often highlighted, research has been scarce on offering an in-depth analysis of the challenges in these relationships that can destroy value. This study attempts to address this issue by uncovering the underlying mechanisms that lead a hub firm and its complementors toward value destruction. Our mixed-methods approach involves the use of a combination of interpretive case study and analytical modeling to highlight nuances and develop conceptual propositions about the conditions that can potentially lead to value destruction. Our context is a globally reputed information technology (IT) firm known for providing business solutions (SOFTCo, a pseudonym) and numerous relatively small, less powerful customer-facing service firms (PartnerCos, a pseudonym). Our findings show that opportunism, unjust appropriation of rents, shirking, exploitation of asymmetric power, and undue dependence can initiate a value destruction process. Furthermore, our study revealed an unexpected emergence of a “pack of wolves,” where resentful PartnerCos formed a collective to tackle the opportunistic behaviors of SOFTCo by starting to align with its competitor, further destroying value for SOFTCo’s ecosystem. Overall, this study contributes to the literature on value co-creation/destruction in IT ecosystems. It also offers an illustration of a mixed-methods study where seemingly incommensurable approaches are harnessed to develop a theoretical understanding.

  abstract     = {Brushing —online merchants placing fake orders of their own products—has been a widespread phenomenon on major e-commerce platforms. One key reason why merchants brush is that it boosts their rankings in search results. Products with higher sales volume are more likely to rank higher. Additionally, rankings matter because consumers face search frictions and narrow their attention to only the few products that show up at the top. Thus, fake orders can affect consumer choice. We focus on this search-ranking aspect of brushing and build a stylized model to understand merchants’ strategic brushing behavior as well as how it affects consumers. We consider a high-type merchant (who sells a more popular product) and a low-type merchant (who sells a less popular product) competing on an e-commerce platform where product rankings evolve over time. We find that if brushing gets more costly for merchants (e.g., due to stricter platform policies), it may sometimes surprisingly harm consumers as it may only blunt brushing by the high-type merchant but intensify brushing by the low-type merchant. If search is less costly for consumers (e.g., due to improved search technologies), it may not always benefit consumers, either. Moreover, the design of the ranking algorithm is critical: placing more weight on sales-volume-related factors may trigger a nonmonotone change in consumer welfare; tracking recent sales only as opposed to cumulative sales does not always dial down brushing and, in fact, may sometimes cause the low-type merchant to brush more.

  abstract     = {We examine how social sharing of consumers’ brand purchases affects brand competition in a market where different types of consumers, characterized by their distinct personal characteristics (i.e., personalities, hobbies, and lifestyles) and brand preferences (i.e., being loyal to one of two horizontally differentiated brands or neither), all desire accurate public perception of their true type. Social sharing of a consumer’s brand purchase allows the public to infer the consumer’s type, but such inference can be mistaken if a brand is purchased by multiple types of consumers. A consumer receives a higher public-perception utility from purchasing a brand if social sharing of the consumer’s purchase leads to a higher chance of accurate public perception. Our analysis shows that social sharing enhances the profit of the advantaged brand that attracts a larger size of loyal consumers but can hurt the profit of the disadvantaged brand that attracts a smaller size of loyal consumers. That is, in a horizontally differentiated market, social sharing may further strengthen the competitive status of the advantaged brand. Interestingly, the disadvantaged brand may become more likely to suffer from social sharing if it follows the conventional wisdom to expand the loyal segment. When the public can learn a consumer’s true type from other information sources (e.g., the consumer’s online blog), social sharing of consumers’ brand purchases brings a smaller profit gain to the advantaged brand. The disadvantaged brand may be better off or worse off, depending on the size of its loyal segment. Our theoretical findings shed light on how brands can devise competitive strategies to leverage the power of social media. History: Michael Zhang, Senior Editor; Hong Xu, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Although digital platforms have become mainstream, there still remain some unanswered questions pertaining to managing platform ecosystems. One such unexplored question pertains to the effect of marquee sellers on the platform—marquee sellers arguably attract other sellers and buyers to the platform, thereby enhancing the platform’s value. In this paper, we study how adding a marquee seller to a business-to-business (B2B) secondary-market platform for IT products affects other sellers, in terms of the prices they obtain for comparable products. Using proprietary data on B2B secondary-market auctions obtained from a platform provider, we show that the entry of a marquee seller has a positive effect on the prices obtained by other sellers on the platform, reflecting a reference-price effect. We further show that this positive effect on final prices is moderated by the extent to which bidders are active on multiple seller sites on the same platform and the extent to which bidders participate in the marquee seller site. We explain these effects using theory in multihoming and involvement, in terms of how reference prices are set. Our work extends the platforms literature by considering the specific influence of a marquee seller on other sellers, thereby informing platform owners on the implications of the advice to add more marquee sellers to platforms. We also contribute to the literature on secondary markets for durable, used IT products, which are instrumental in reducing electronic waste and mitigating the environmental damage done by electronic products in landfills.

  abstract     = {Informative online ratings enable digital platforms to reduce the search cost for buyers to find good sellers. However, rating inflation, a phenomenon in which average rating increases and rating variance across listings decreases, threatens the informativeness of ratings. We empirically identify the consequences of rating inflation by conducting a quasi-experiment with a digital platform that exogenously changed its rating display rule in a treated neighborhood, which resulted in rating inflation. Using a differences-in-differences approach, we find that platforms benefit from one aspect of rating inflation: user purchases and seller sales increase because of the increased average rating. However, they also face negative consequences: rating inflation causes a decrease in user trial and a greater concentration of sales among popular restaurants. Overall, our results illustrate the potential consequences of rating inflation that platforms need to consider when designing and managing their rating system.

  abstract     = {Recruitment is a critical activity for companies, and the research community has also shown significant interest in examining technology recruitment. Companies often communicate how they value their employees along with job requirements to potential candidates in a bid to attract them. However, there is an overall lack of understanding of how candidates react to such information and how their motivation toward the job changes with such online communication. Although there is substantial work that examines the decision-making process of managers who do technical hiring, to the best of our knowledge, there is a paucity of work that investigates the decision-making process of technical candidates. The broad research question studied is how including certain content in online communication about a technical job opportunity may (de)motivate heterogeneous candidates differently in applying for the job. We theorize the underlying process of how including certain content in online job communication may influence candidates’ propensity to apply and their minimum acceptable salary increase if they were to join the company. Additionally, we capture mediating variables that influence the effect of different online content on candidates’ propensity to apply and on candidates’ minimum acceptable salary increase. By testing actual job application behavior in a field study, we confirmed the content that can attract high performers while discouraging low performers from applying.

  abstract     = {Online healthcare portals have become prevalent worldwide in recent years. One common form of a healthcare portal is the online consultation website, which provides a bridge between patients and doctors and reduces patients’ time and cost when seeking healthcare services. Another form is the healthcare service appointment website, which facilitates offline visits for patients. Although nominally separate, the behaviors of the users (including patients and doctors) on these two types of websites could be related to each other. In particular, how does opening online consultation services impact the offline appointments of doctors? Although this is an important question for healthcare portals, doctors, and policy makers, it has not been rigorously examined in the literature. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this important gap by examining the overall impact of offering online consultations on offline appointments. Our results show that the number of offline appointments for doctors increases after opening an online consultation service. Additionally, we examine how several factors, such as recommendation heat, hospital ranking, and doctor title, moderate the impact of opening online consultation services on doctors’ offline appointments. Given that online consultation is a new but important way to connect patients and doctors, our findings provide useful implications for all the stakeholders—doctors, patients, hospitals, and policy makers—regarding how to integrate online and offline channels in the healthcare context.

  abstract     = {A Walrasian competitive equilibrium defines a set of linear and anonymous prices where no coalition of market participants wants to deviate. Walrasian prices do not exist in nonconvex markets in general, with electricity markets as an important real-world example. However, the availability of linear and anonymous prices is important for derivatives markets and as a signal for scarcity. Prior literature on electricity markets assumed price-inelastic demand and introduced numerous heuristics to compute linear and anonymous prices on electricity markets. At these prices, market participants often make a loss. As a result, market operators provide out-of-market side-payments (so-called make-whole payments) to cover these losses. Make-whole payments dilute public price signals and are a significant concern in electricity markets. Moreover, demand-side flexibility becomes increasingly important with growing levels of renewable energy sources. Demand response implies that different flexibility options come at different prices, and the proportion of price-sensitive demand that actively bids on power exchanges will further increase. We show that with price-inelastic demand there are simple pricing schemes that are individually rational (participants do not make a loss), clear the market, support an efficient solution, and do not require make-whole payments. With the advent of demand-side bids, budget balanced prices (no subsidies are necessary) cannot exist anymore, and we propose a pricing rule that minimizes make-whole payments. We describe design desiderata that different pricing schemes satisfy and report results of experiments that evaluate the level of subsidies required for linear and anonymous prices on electricity spot markets with price-sensitive demand.

  abstract     = {Incentivized reviews have become increasingly prevalent on product review sites such as Amazon. Whereas outright fake reviews are clearly unacceptable and should be removed from review platforms, reviews by incentivized consumers with otherwise authentic product experiences fall into a gray area. On the one hand, many critics and researchers have warned of their harm by pointing out their biased ratings. On the other hand, these reviews might complement organic reviews with review text of higher quality. The current paper studies whether incentivized reviews on Amazon are more coherent and offer richer detail. We use Amazon’s platform-incentivized reviews, known as Vine reviews, for our primary sample and use seller-incentivized reviews for checking robustness. Estimations from a two-way fixed-effect model consistently show that incentivized reviews do compensate for their reduced impartiality through better text quality, measured by discourse coherence and level of relevant detail. This finding is further supported by a randomized experiment using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Hence, current literature findings on the poor quality of text of incentivized reviews, based on review length and lexical complexity, portray only an incomplete picture of incentivized reviews. Given that numerical ratings for products via incentivized reviews are likely biased whereas their text content is of high quality, a natural way to embrace incentivized reviews is to keep their text content, suppress their numerical ratings, and always highlight the label of “incentivized reviews.” History: Juan Feng, Senior Editor; Jianqing Chen, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Online platforms often ask their users to refer friends in exchange for a reward. This paper addresses how referral generation and referral value evolve throughout the customer’s life cycle as a function of service usage, experience level, and past referral behavior. Our analysis is based on a longitudinal data set that comprises the transactions and referral actions of 400,000 users in a ride-sharing platform over a year. The richness of our data set allows us to address two shortcomings from previous studies: modeling dynamic behavior (i.e., the relationship between past and future referrals) and accounting for unobserved heterogeneity across users. Our results show that users make more referrals when they have used the service recently and intensively. For example, users become 9\% less likely to make referrals for each week they have not used the service. Furthermore, users make more high-value referrals as they become more experienced with the service. The referral generation and referral value of the top 10\% most experienced users are more than 18\% higher relative to when they first used the service. Finally, as users make more referrals, they become more likely to run out of friends to whom they can refer the service, leading to less referrals in the future. After users make their first referral, the probability of making additional referrals decreases by more than 78\% and the value of subsequent referrals reduces by 19\% on average. The results imply that platforms should consider tailoring their referral programs according to how referral generation and referral value evolve over time.

  abstract     = {With a large number of mobile apps on platforms such as iOS and Android, app developers face a significant challenge in generating market demand. Apps can incorporate social features to share information and create awareness. We focus on the impact of these features and their interplay with intrinsic features in the head, body, and tail of the demand distribution. Using a panel of version release notes from the iOS platform, we develop a novel hierarchical deep learning model to extract intrinsic and social features. Our results suggest that social features help increase the demand for tail apps and are also useful for head apps in informing users about new intrinsic features. To explore possible mechanisms, we analyze how different types of social features (personal and platform), intrinsic features (common versus differentiating), and app quality influence demand. We find that social features that allow sharing on platforms with large audiences are more effective at increasing demand than those on personal messaging systems. Furthermore, within platforms, social features perform better on those with stronger ties, such as Facebook as opposed to Twitter. Our analysis of different types of intrinsic features reveals that social features can help increase the demand for all apps when introduced with differentiating or less common intrinsic features. Furthermore, we find that there is a negative effect on the demand of tail apps when differentiating intrinsic features are combined with platform-based social features that have weaker ties. However, this negative effect is limited to low-quality tail apps only. Our results underscore the differences in the effect of different types of social and intrinsic features in various parts of the demand distribution. Our study provides managerial guidance to app developers in enabling social sharing through design choices and generating higher demand.

Algorithms are essential in open source because they remedy concerns incompletely addressed by parallel development or modularity. Following algorithmic interactions in open source allows us to map the performance of algorithms to understand the nature of work conducted by multiple algorithms functioning together. We zoom to the level of algorithmic interactions to show how residual interdependencies of modularity are worked around by algorithms. Moreover, the dependence on parallel development does not suffice to resolve all concerns related to the distributed work of open source. We examine the Linux Kernel case that reveals how algorithmic interactions facilitate open source work through the three processes of managing , organizing , and supervising development work. Our qualitative study theorizes how algorithmic interactions intensify through these processes that work together to facilitate development. We make a theoretical contribution to open source scholarship by explaining how algorithmic interactions navigate across module rigidity and enhance parallel development. Our work also reveals how, in open source, developers work to automate most tasks and augmentation is a bidirectional relationship of algorithms augmenting the work of developers and of developers augmenting the work of algorithms.

Such an IT-enabled engagement strategy serves as a marketing device to boost sales and customer loyalty. This study focuses on two significant game elements (i.e., badges and leaderboards) that promote consumer motivations and social comparisons. To qualify the impacts, we conduct a randomized field experiment at one of the largest shopping malls in Asia. In the experiment, we contrast the two elements against coupons regarding various shopping outcomes. A two-period design (consisting of the treatment and posttreatment periods) identifies the long-term behavior changes after the treatment removals. The main results suggest that badging and leaderboarding promote sales by 21.5\% and 22.5\% in the treatment period, respectively, whereas couponing delivers a more potent effect of 31.7\%. In the posttreatment period, the gamification impacts remain significant compared with the baseline, but the influence of couponing fades out. Besides, the additional analyses document the salient heterogeneous treatment effects across demographics. We further discover the substantial differences in the within-group heterogeneity across the treatments. Specifically, badging is a balanced tool for attracting the general public, whereas leaderboarding is a double-edged sword that could encourage self-reinforcing or self-banishing. Finally, gamification brings more explorations that lead to additional sales and engagements. Overall, the robust results can be translated into actionable strategies to utilize gamification proactively. History: Ravi Bapna, Senior Editor; Yili (Kevin) Hong, Associate Editor.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a systematic comparison of methods for individual treatment assignment, a general problem that arises in many applications and that has received significant attention from economists, computer scientists, and social scientists. We group the various methods proposed in the literature into three general classes of algorithms (or metalearners): learning models to predict outcomes (the O-learner), learning models to predict causal effects (the E-learner), and learning models to predict optimal treatment assignments (the A-learner). We compare the metalearners in terms of (1) their level of generality and (2) the objective function they use to learn models from data; we then discuss the implications that these characteristics have for modeling and decision making. Notably, we demonstrate analytically and empirically that optimizing for the prediction of outcomes or causal effects is not the same as optimizing for treatment assignments, suggesting that, in general, the A-learner should lead to better treatment assignments than the other metalearners. We demonstrate the practical implications of our findings in the context of choosing, for each user, the best algorithm for playlist generation in order to optimize engagement. This is the first comparison of the three different metalearners on a real-world application at scale (based on more than half a billion individual treatment assignments). In addition to supporting our analytical findings, the results show how large A/B tests can provide substantial value for learning treatment-assignment policies, rather than simply for choosing the variant that performs best on average.

  abstract     = {In today’s big data environment, missing values continue to be a problem that harms data quality. The bias caused by missing values raises the highest concern, as it cannot be eliminated simply by increasing the sample size. Although the statistics literature has developed approaches to handling missing values and formulated assumptions regarding when these approaches generate valid statistical inferences, these prescriptions have yet to be broadly accepted by many social science disciplines, including the information systems (IS) discipline. By reviewing recently published empirical research in information systems, we find that missing values are indeed an important and pervasive problem. We believe that a review of missing value theory is necessary and timely for the IS community to understand the nature of missing values and to promote more rigorous research practice when missing values are often unavoidable. In addition, the missing not at random (MNAR) mechanism brings about challenges in parameter estimation. We contribute to research practice by proposing and demonstrating the superior performance of a Monte Carlo likelihood approach in correcting bias in parameter estimation. We conclude by suggesting that research validity can be enhanced through a reasoned adoption of the missing value handling method and structured missing value reporting practices.

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of online learning. As learner autonomy is relatively high in online environments, learners must engage in self-regulated learning (SRL) to achieve optimal learning outcomes. Because most learners are unable to consistently engage in SRL, gamification interventions are being implemented to improve SRL engagement; however, mixed results cast doubt on the efficacy of this approach. Massively open online courses (MOOCs), a type of online learning environment, are currently experiencing rapid growth due to widespread adoption by many institutions. In MOOCs, there is no instructor intervention; hence, students have difficulty regulating their own learning and are easily distracted. Therefore, this study investigates whether mixed-research results regarding the efficacy of gamification can be attributed to lack of attention to individual learner traits during design. For this purpose, the study analyzes MOOCs as an instance of online learning by applying SRL theory and gamification principles. We altered a traditional MOOC platform to provide different types of gamified performance feedback to facilitate learners’ SRL engagement. We then examined whether this matched with goal orientation, an individual learner trait to influence SRL and learning outcomes. Using learning-analytics tools, we tracked 760 college students’ SRL engagement on a MOOC platform over five weeks. As theorized, SRL engagement and learning outcomes of participants who had a strong performance-avoidance goal orientation increased with positively framed performance feedback that involved no social comparisons; however, the same feedback had a negative impact on participants with a strong mastery goal orientation. Our findings add to SRL theory by demonstrating that gamification designs can enhance SRL engagement and learning outcomes in online learning, but with a caveat—this occurs only when there is a match with learner traits—confirming the gamification principle stating that task improvements and meaningful engagement can only occur through thoughtful gamification design.

  abstract     = {This study contributes to the information systems literature on mobile health interventions and omnichannel management by examining the relative effectiveness of mobile and offline channels in facilitating personal weight management. Drawing on the social cognitive theory of self-regulation, our empirical analysis utilizes a system generalized method of moments approach applied to panel data on customers enrolled in a weight loss program that delivers services through multiple channels, including a mobile app and offline office visits. Our results show that the use of the mobile app is positively associated with weight management by both free and paid users. For paid users, who have access to the mobile app and office visits, usage of both channels is associated with increased short-term weight loss. Furthermore, the two channels function as substitutes for one another, with users able to compensate for infrequent offline store visits through more intense mobile app usage. In the long term, however, only mobile app usage (and not offline store visits) contributes to the sustainability of weight loss, as reflected in reduced weight variability and lower overall failure rate. Qualitative evidence gleaned from interviews with actual customers substantiated the self-regulation mechanism enabled by mobile app usage. Additional empirical analyses further revealed that frequency and granularity of mobile app usage are positively associated with weight loss. We also found that individuals exposed to low performance pressure benefit more fully from mobile app usage. The results are robust to endogeneity concerns and alternative measures of the key variables. Overall, our analysis sheds light on the important role of a self-regulatory mobile app in a multichannel setting of personal weight management, as compared with the external influence stemming from human experts in offline channels, with useful implications for research and practice.

  abstract     = {Experimental research in the business disciplines often focuses on the overall treatment effect and the heterogeneity therein. Whereas this type of research allows us to understand the strength and direction of the treatment effect under different conditions, it does not directly speak to the generative mechanisms, namely, why and how the effect arises. A standard procedure to identify the mechanisms underlying a treatment effect is mediation analysis, but extant mediation analysis frameworks either have no causal interpretation or require the mediators to be unconfounded. Because mediators are posttreatment variables that typically cannot be preassigned beforehand, the endogeneity of mediators remains a serious concern even in randomized experiments. In response to this issue, we present a flexible endogenous mediation analysis framework that still has causal interpretation when the mediator is endogenous. We then discuss the identification conditions for different types of endogenous mediators, including unobserved or partially observed ones, under this framework. We show that endogenous mediation models can be parametrically identified without an instrumental variable when the generating process of the mediator is nonlinear. We further examine how the identification strengths of these models vary with a series of factors, including the level of endogeneity, the goodness of fit of the mediator model, the percentage of observed mediator values, and the misspecification of the error terms. Finally, we provide guidelines on when and how to use endogenous mediation analysis and discuss implications for experimental design and empirical research. We offer an R package that implements the proposed endogenous mediation models. History: Ravi Bapna, Senior Editor; Anuj Kumar, Associate Editor.

Through inductive and iterative analyses of primary data collected via interviews and surveys, and secondary data in the form of narrative accounts, we explain the process of addiction development via three phases associated with nominal, compulsive, and addicted use. In each phase, combinations of salient individual needs, affordances, technology features, IS use behaviors, and control mechanism outcomes (successful or unsuccessful) influence an individual’s trajectory toward hedonic IS use addiction. Drawing on cybernetic theory, we explain the role of users’ control mechanisms. We show how deficiencies related to the sensing, comparing, or regulating act, in conjunction with salient affordances, influence the development of addiction. The findings extend variance-based research on IS use addiction. They carry implications for research, users, technology providers, and policy makers in relation to hedonic IS use addiction.

  abstract     = {Although social media has helped online newspapers by allowing users to organically share articles, some have argued that it has cannibalized and hurt newspapers through reduced readership and diminished agenda-setting power. Motivated by these two opposing effects, it is critical to understand what affects the duality between sharing news articles on social media and reading the articles on news websites. Using rich clickstream data on online news readership obtained from an English-language newspaper in an Asian country and social media data collected from Twitter, we focus on article sentiment as a key news content attribute and find a differential effect of sentiment on readership and sharing behaviors across the news site and third-party social media platform. Our results show that people are likely to read news articles with negative sentiment on the news site, but they tend to share articles with positive sentiment on Twitter. Specifically, a one-unit increase in content sentiment is associated with a 10.86\% or 273-unit decrease in news site page views but a 17.0\% or 2.10-unit increase in Twitter sharing volume. Upon decomposition of news article sentiment, we also find a contrasting positive author sentiment effect and a negative news topic valence effect on news readership. To uncover the underlying mechanism of the findings, we test the key intuitions from prior self-presentation literature. We find that an increase in a Twitter user’s followers (i.e., audience size) leads to an increase in the Twitter user’s propensity to share positive-sentiment news articles. Our findings on the role of sentiment on content consumption and sharing affirm the coopetitive but complementary relationship between news websites and social media platforms. Our results also guide publishers to better craft their news content and manage social media presence to improve audience engagement and readership outcomes while preserving the agenda-setting ability of news media.

  abstract     = {Topic modeling methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) are powerful tools for analyzing massive amounts of textual data. They have been used extensively in information systems (IS) and business discipline research to identify latent topics for data exploration and as a feature engineering mechanism to derive new variables for analyses. However, existing topic modeling approaches are mostly unsupervised and only leverage textual data, while ignoring additional useful metadata often associated with text, such as star ratings in customer reviews or categories of posts in online forums. As a result, the identified topics and variables derived based on the learned topic model may not be accurate, which could lead to incorrect estimations that affect subsequent empirical analysis and to inferior performance on predictive tasks. In this study, we propose a novel supervised deep topic modeling approach called sDTM, which combines a neural variational autoencoder model and a recurrent neural network. sDTM leverages the auxiliary data associated with text to enhance the topic modeling capability. We conduct empirical case studies and predictive analytics on an online consumer review data set and an online knowledge community data set. Experimental results show that in comparison with benchmark methods, sDTM can enhance both the empirical estimation and predictive performance. sDTM makes methodological contributions to the IS literature and has direct relevance for research using text analytics.

  abstract     = {Password-based authentication is the most commonly used method for gaining access to secured systems. Unfortunately, empirical evidence highlights the fact that most passwords are significantly weak, and encouraging users to create stronger passwords is a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a theoretically augmented password strength meter design that is guided by the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion (ELM). We evaluate our design by leveraging three independent and complementary methods: a survey-based experiment using students to evaluate the saliency of our conceptual design (proof of concept), a controlled laboratory experiment conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test the effectiveness of the proposed design (proof of value), and a randomized field experiment conducted in collaboration with an online forum in Asia to establish proof of use. In each study, we observe the changes in users’ behavior in response to our proposed password strength meter. We find that the ELM-augmented password strength meter is significantly effective at addressing the challenges of password-based authentication. Users exposed to this strength meter are more likely to change their passwords, leading to a new password that is significantly stronger. Our findings suggest that the proposed design of augmented password strength meters is an effective method for promoting secure password behavior among end users.

  abstract     = {This study examines how a change in an online reputation system, specifically the addition of a social reputation feature, affects contestant performance in innovation tournaments. Drawing from the literature on peer recognition and social evaluation anxiety, we project competing effects whereby the feature could either enhance or diminish contestant performance. Furthermore, we hypothesize a series of contingent effects involving the soft reserve, a competitive dynamic that unfolds in tournaments, and a determinant of performance in its own right. Specifically, we hypothesize that the direct influence of the social reputation feature on contestant performance would be predicated on the level of two types of soft reserves in an innovation tournament: that created by the focal contestant and that created by competitors. We test these hypotheses leveraging a natural experiment, where an innovation tournament platform (Kaggle.com) introduced a social reputation feature, allowing contestants to follow other contestants unilaterally. Estimates obtained using a panel data set bracketed within a narrow time window (15 days) around the feature launch reveal that the feature significantly improves the performance. We further report that the two types of soft reserves significantly moderate the positive effect of the social reputation feature on contestant performance, whereby the higher the soft reserve, the weaker the effect of the social reputation feature on contestant performance. These findings have several theoretical and practical implications for managing innovation tournaments. History: Manju Ahuja, Senior Editor; Maha Shaikh, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Analysts, managers, and policymakers are interested in predictive analytics capable of offering better foresight. It is generally accepted that in forecasting scenarios involving organizational policies or consumer decision making, personal characteristics, including personality, may be an important predictor of downstream outcomes. The inclusion of personality features in forecasting models has been hindered by the fact that traditional measurement mechanisms are often infeasible. Text-based personality detection has garnered attention because of the public availability of digital textual traces. However, the text machine learning space has bifurcated into two branches: feature-based methods relying on manually crafted human intuition, or deep learning language models that leverage big data and compute, the main commonality being that neither branch generates accurate personality assessments, thereby making personality measures infeasible for downstream forecasting applications. In this study, we propose DeepPerson, a design artifact for text-based personality detection that bridges these two branches by leveraging concepts from relevant psycholinguistic theories in conjunction with advanced deep learning strategies. DeepPerson incorporates novel transfer learning and hierarchical attention network methods that use psychological concepts and data augmentation in conjunction with person-level linguistic information. We evaluate the utility of the proposed artifact using an extensive design evaluation on three personality data sets in comparison with state-of-the-art methods proposed in academia and industry. DeepPerson can improve detection of personality dimensions by 10–20 percentage points relative to the best comparison methods. Using case studies in the finance and health domains, we show that more accurate text-based personality detection can translate into significant improvements in downstream applications such as forecasting future firm performance or predicting pandemic infection rates. Our findings have important implications for research at the intersection of design and data science, and practical implications for managers focused on enabling, producing, or consuming predictive analytics.

Despite such focus, limited work has investigated the social implications of the democratization of capital by peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms, particularly within the healthcare sector, where financial constraints can be daunting. In this study, we investigate the effects of P2P lending platforms on local abortion rates, a medical procedure characterized by significant financial barriers and social stigma. Leveraging the entry of the P2P platform LendingClub into different states at different times, and a differences-in-differences approach, we find that the entry of LendingClub is associated with an increase in the rate at which women choose not to carry to term. Further, results indicate the effects vary based on the characteristics of the local area, with stronger effects manifesting in more religious areas and areas with lower levels of education, suggesting that social frictions in the form of stigma and knowledge asymmetries can influence financial need.

We rely on resource drain theory to investigate how family-work conflict (FWC) is linked to excessive use of mobile devices for work purposes during nonwork hours, which, in turn, affects individual productivity and physiological, psychological, and relational well-being. Furthermore, we examine the role of competitive climate as a boundary condition. We conducted a field study across two measurement periods involving 324 individuals and their live-in partners. Our results suggest that FWC affects productivity and well-being through excessive mobile use and that competitive climate amplifies these effects. The study contributes to a better understanding of the excessive mobile use phenomenon focusing on its determinants and its consequences. We discuss the implications of our findings both for theory and practice, and we outline directions for future research. History: Yulin Fang, Senior Editor; Likoebe M. Maruping, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Companies in platform-based business markets have widely embraced freemium business models where profit primarily depends on a minority of paying customers. However, the key challenge of these models is transitioning participants from free users to paying consumers. To encourage paid consumption, companies often rely on product differentiation such as providing consumers who pay for products or services with enhanced features. However, limited research has addressed how such product differentiation may convert consumers from “free” to “fee.” Our research examines the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game as a compelling example of a freemium platform-based business model. We contribute to the freemium literature by introducing three new MOBA-specific differentiations—character competency, character variety, and character-appearance differentiation. We also extend consumption values theory into a dual-path model to unveil the underlying mechanisms through which product differentiation influences in-game purchase. We empirically validate our dual-path model using data from a two-wave longitudinal experiment and three cross-sectional experiments. Our findings support opposing mediating paths for product differentiation in character competency and variety and indicate that these two types of differentiation can indeed undermine perceived game fairness. Conversely, character-appearance differentiation exerts only a positive influence on players’ purchasing of in-game items. Consequently, the findings of this study have important potential implications for platform-based companies leveraging freemium business models that seek to increase their share of paying customers.

  abstract     = {Monitoring, a digital surveillance technology that allows employers to track the activities of workers, is ubiquitous in the gig economy wherein the workforce is geographically dispersed. However, workers are often reluctant to be monitored because of privacy concerns, resulting in a hidden economic cost for employers as workers tend to demand higher wages for monitored jobs. To help employers make informed decisions on whether they should adopt monitoring and how to design monitoring policies, we investigate how three common dimensions of monitoring affect workers’ willingness to accept monitored jobs as well as the underlying mechanisms through online experiments on two gig economy platforms (Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and Prolific). The three dimensions of monitoring are intensity (how much information is collected), transparency (whether the monitoring policy is disclosed to workers), and control (whether workers can remove sensitive information). We find that, as the monitoring intensity increases, workers become less willing to accept monitoring because of elevated privacy concerns. Furthermore, we find that being transparent about the monitoring policy increases workers’ willingness to accept monitoring only when the monitoring intensity is low. Transparent disclosure does not reduce privacy concerns over high-intensity monitoring. Interestingly, providing control over high-intensity monitoring does not significantly reduce workers’ privacy concerns either, rendering this well-intentioned policy ineffective. Finally, females are more willing to accept monitored jobs than males as they perceive higher payment protection from monitoring and have lower privacy concerns. On average, we estimate that the compensations required for workers to accept monitoring are $1.8/hour for AMT workers and $1.6/hour for Prolific workers, which translate to roughly 37.5\% and 28.6\% of their average hourly wages, respectively.

  abstract     = {There is limited systematic research on managerial response strategies to online customer complaints and negative reviews. In this paper, we synthesize justice theory and service recovery literature to develop a model that explores the mechanisms through which appropriate managerial responses to customer complaints influence aggregate future review valence and complaints. We test our model using data from TripAdvisor.com, a leading travel review platform. Using text analysis (e.g., natural language processing and deep learning), we extract and code the variables in our model from the reviews and the managerial responses to these reviews. Key findings indicate that responding to customer reviews—in particular, negative reviews—will have a positive influence on future review valence. Moreover, responses with more rational cues than emotional cues to customer complaints about procedural unfairness will have a positive influence on future review valence. However, responses with more rational cues than emotional cues to customer complaints about interactional unfairness will have a negative influence on future review valence. Moreover, we find that when reviews have both distributive and interactional unfairness, responses with more rational cues matter. In addition, we find that both rational cues and emotional cues in responses to distributive unfairness and rational cues in responses to procedural unfairness are effective to decrease the future occurrence of similar complaints. We interpret and discuss the implication of these findings for theory and practice. History: Yulin Fang, Senior Editor; Zhengrui Jiang, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Despite widespread agreement among practitioners and academicians that organizational insiders are a significant threat to organizational information systems security, insider computer abuse (ICA)—unauthorized and deliberate misuse of organizational information resources by organizational insiders—remains a serious issue. Recent studies have shown that most employees are willing to share confidential or regulated information under certain circumstances, and nearly one-third to half of major security breaches are tied to insiders. These trends indicate that organizational security efforts, which generally focus on deterrence and sanctions, have yet to effectively address ICA. Therefore, leading security researchers and practitioners have called for a more nuanced understanding of insiders in respect to deterrence efforts. We answer these calls by proposing a middle-range theory of ICA that focuses on understanding the inherent tensions between insider motivations and organizational controls. Our careful review distinguishes two categories of personal motives for ICA: (1) instrumental (i.e., financial benefits) and (2) expressive (i.e., psychological contract violations) motives. Our novel theory of ICA also includes the influence of two classes of controls for ICA: (1) intrinsic (i.e., self-control) and (2) extrinsic (i.e., organizational deterrence) controls. We developed and empirically examined a research model based on our middle-range theory that explains a substantial portion of the variance in ICA. Specifically, our results indicate that both instrumental and expressive motives are positively related to ICA. Moreover, intrinsic self-control exerted significant direct and moderating influences in our research model, whereas extrinsic organizational deterrence failed to exhibit a direct effect on ICA and significantly moderated instrumental motives’ relationship with ICA only. Not only do our results show that self-control exerted a stronger effect on the model than deterrence did but they also help us identify the limits of deterrence in ICA research.

  abstract     = {The emergence of online platforms for professional services (e.g., cosmetic procedures) represents a natural progression of e-commerce from search and experience goods to credence goods. Because of the deeply consequential nature of professional services and the large information asymmetries between customers and service providers, designing effective risk-reduction strategies is crucial for facilitating digital transactions of professional services. In this paper, we study whether and how the introduction of a novel risk-reduction strategy, the add-on insurance covering the potential cost of negative consequences (e.g., complications and unsatisfactory outcomes), affects the demand for professional services in online platforms. We leverage a policy change in an online platform for cosmetic procedures, which started to offer the add-on insurance for a subset of cosmetic procedures in 2016. Our empirical analysis shows that this risk-reduction strategy has asymmetric effects on low- and high-risk procedures. Specifically, the introduction of insurance increases the sales of low-risk procedures, but not those of high-risk ones. More importantly, the insurance has a negative spillover effect on uninsured competitors of insured procedures, regardless of their risk levels. The negative spillover effect of insurance on high-risk procedures is noteworthy because it hurts the sales of their uninsured competitors without increasing their own sales, suggesting that the negative spillover effect goes beyond the typical demand cannibalization explanation and can decrease the overall demand for high-risk procedures. We further corroborate our findings and investigate the mechanisms behind the asymmetric treatment effects and the negative spillover effect using an online controlled experiment. Our findings have important implications for platforms to design, deploy, and evaluate their risk-reduction strategies. History: Eric Zheng, Senior Editor; Pallab Sanyal, Associate Editor.
