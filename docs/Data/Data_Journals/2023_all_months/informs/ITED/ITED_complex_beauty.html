  abstract     = {Intensive competition among supply chains often forces trading partners to collaborate despite their conflict of interests. Supply chain contracts and collaboration theory is well established in the academic literature to align the interests but much less conveyed to students and industry professionals for a practical impact. Although the Beer Game captures the bullwhip effect and the value of information sharing, it ignores the conflict of interests, that is, price and quantity bargaining, among the trading partners. We describe a new online teaching game, the FloraPark simulation (“the flower game” at https://flower.gamespots.net/ ), based on real-life events in the international fresh-cut flower supply chains, for students to learn supply chain collaboration via contracts in a setting of multiple supply chains competing in the same market. Students play trading partners in the flower supply chains and experiment with the push, pull, and advanced purchasing discount contracts by negotiating wholesale prices and quantities to achieve the conflicting objectives of (1) collaboration to beat other supply chains, and (2) bargaining to protect their own interests from their trading partners.

During virtual office hours, one participant described the exercises in terms of a “mystery” to solve.

The case has been tested across a diverse set of courses across different MBA programs at two public business schools in India.

With increasing pressure to teach larger groups of students, conduct formal assessment of learning outcomes, and offer online and hybrid classes, there is a need for alternatives to constructed response problem-solving test questions. We believe that appropriate use of multiple-choice (MC) questions can alleviate some of these pressures. However, the results will only be acceptable to dedicated faculty if these questions are well written and effective in measuring student learning. In this article, we propose a structured framework consisting of six design principles that serve as a guide for writing MC items that promote higher-order thinking through the use of scenario-based and multistep problems. Then we demonstrate how to apply these principles to develop high-quality test questions in MC format for introductory analytics courses in statistics or operations research/management science.},

  abstract     = {This case focuses on operational challenges faced by customer service centers, or call centers. The specific context for these cases is Patelco, which is a California based credit union. Patelco is facing a rising number of complaints about customer service, specifically, about the long delay customers had to face when they called one of Patelco‘s four call centers. The purpose of this case is to expose students to the statistical analysis of some of the raw data, obtained from such an environment, to support the investigation of call center performance. Important managerial insights can be drawn by summarizing the data graphically as well as quantitatively. In particular, the data can be used to show students how to perform a number of useful hypothesis tests, which are often needed to answer important questions that arise when assessing the performance of any system. The outcomes from these analyses can provide important managerial insights. In the operations management literature, and in practice, a number of modeling assumptions are made about the distribution of data to facilitate quantitative analysis. However, these assumptions are often not statistically validated. This case study gives students an opportunity to test such assumptions. This case can be used in graduate and undergraduate classes in Operations Management, Supply Chain Management and Service Operations to review statistical concepts related to the topic of queuing analysis, or in a Statistics class to illustrate data analysis and statistical tests in a real-world context.

The intended audiences are graduate students or advanced undergraduate students taking a first course in optimization who have been introduced to integer programming. The role-playing exercise aims to develop students’ skills in the iterative process of listening to decision makers describe their problem, asking them questions, and developing initial formulations of the problem. The case study provides students the opportunity to spend more time developing a full mathematical formulation, solving it, and writing up their findings. The case assumes students have already been introduced to the “Big-M” method but assumes no prior introduction to the concepts of hard versus soft constraints. There is no natural objective in this problem, such as the usual “maximize profit” or “minimize cost”; instead, students are introduced to the topic of Goal Programming, which also introduces them to the concept of multiobjective optimization.

  abstract     = {In this case study, students combine data-based insights with strategic considerations to make fundamental business decisions at the German grocery retail chain Real. In response to dwindling numbers of customers and reduced revenues, Real developed the RealPro customer benefits program to achieve a quick turnaround. For a fixed annual fee, RealPro members receive substantial and permanent discounts of 20% on nonpromoted items from a broad range of food categories. Students employ data analytics methods to extract insights from the provided data set, which contains point-of-sale information from the actual market test of RealPro. Based on these insights, decisions concerning the rollout and design of the RealPro program must be made. We provide data analysis solutions in both Excel and R to analyze 75 thousand customer transactions. In the case extension, students can apply the difference-in-differences method and two covariate balancing algorithms for in-depth statistical analyses. For this purpose, we provide an additional unbalanced data set with 83 thousand transactions, on which the students can test and analyze propensity score matching and entropy balancing models.

  abstract     = {The modeling-based case study is useful for two purposes: introduce closed-loop supply chains and highlight and model some of its unique aspects that the traditional newsvendor formulation does not capture. The case focuses on a third-party remanufacturer (3PR) who buys used cellphones in different quality grades in anticipation of demand. Phones in high grade have been used gently—they have a high acquisition cost but low remanufacturing cost. Low-grade phones have been used extensively—they are cheaper to acquire but have a higher remanufacturing cost. Medium-grade phones have intermediate acquisition and remanufacturing costs. The 3PR needs to trade off these two costs and determine which grade(s) of used phones to buy. The 3PR restores all phones to the same like-new standard during remanufacturing. Extensive use of the case in supply chain management courses shows that in the absence of a mathematical model, students systematically deviate from the optimal decisions because of contextual features. Overall, students believed the case was challenging and that it provides a valuable learning experience, both as an exposure to the closed-loop supply chain domain as well as developing models with industry-specific factors.

In a quantitative-intensive course that introduces data analytics concepts, engaging students quickly and exposing them to more nuanced parts of the data analytics lifecycle is critical. This exercise uses the movie Moneyball as a framing tool to achieve these goals. Leveraging an appealing movie can help increase student engagement in the subject by presenting concepts in a less foreboding way. This exercise highlights scenes in the movie which embody the various stages of the data analytics lifecycle and allows faculty to present concepts via an engaging story adapted from a real-world example.

The Snake Egg puzzle asks the player to draw a one-cell wide path, or “snake,” in a grid. The remaining cells should form a fixed number of separate, connected, discontiguous regions called “eggs.” We propose two solution approaches: a flow-based model and lazy constraints. Instead of providing the complete model at the outset, we will step through the puzzle in a manner suitable to the classroom, emphasizing the skills that are crucial to successfully implementing advanced techniques. The puzzle functions in particular as a prelude to Benders decomposition. Funding: M. Harris is supported by an Australian Government RTP (research training program) scholarship.},

The purpose of this course was to increase students’ technical expertise and build a mindset and skills needed to tackle current societal issues, raising their social responsibility and enhancing civic-mindedness. The course combined curricular learning with community service, applying the content of academic disciplines to practice. It brought students from industrial distribution and sociology together to help food pantries to improve their operational efficiencies so that the food pantries can serve more people and work toward their goal. In this project, student groups identified the specific needs of community food pantries. They recommended solutions to improve operational efficiency so that they could use their technical skills to address the challenges and make an impact on the communities. In addition, student groups interacted with partner agencies via technologies that aided distance communication, which facilitated partnerships in remote locations. We also evaluated this project. The results reveal that this project had an impact on students’ personal and professional development as well as the community. Funding: We acknowledge the tier-one priority grant funding from the provost office, dean of faculty, and department of student activities at Texas A&amp;M University.},

The MOLB game was designed based on the triple bottom line framework, in which the economic, social, and environmental aspects of line balancing decisions are simultaneously taken into account. The MOLB game can be played in teams of three or four students. First, each team receives unique information for balancing an assembly line. Each team should find as many feasible balances as possible in a collaborative form and then send the Pareto solution set and the best found solution to a peer team. In the second round of the game, the teams assess the results of a peer team first by trying to find infeasible or non-Pareto solutions and second by attempting to improve on the provided solutions. Finally, the reviewer team presents the results of the peer-review process to the entire class.

We share our experiences as well as didactic resources for two teaching formats. The first format involves hands-on exercises and is more appropriate for small student groups (up to 40 students). The second format is an interactive lecture that focuses more on current research challenges and is better suited for large student groups. During the last decade, both formats have been used repeatedly with consistent, positive feedback from students. The combination of a hands-on, interactive approach that actively involves students with the particularities and experiences of solving a real-life case makes our approach unique and positively affects students’ attention.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we describe a course project in which teams of undergraduate students propose and execute an end-to-end analytics project to solve a real-world problem. The project challenges students to implement machine learning, optimization, simulation, or a combination of these three techniques on real-world data that they collect. A designated project advisor helps each team refine its project and assesses the quality of the resulting work. In our analysis of 58 past projects, we show that students developed solutions for a wide range of topics by employing various methodologies. However, most teams encountered similar challenges that project advisors helped them overcome with tailored feedback. Based on feedback from 106 previous students, the project experience was largely positive and helped them prepare for their future careers. We believe that this type of hands-on project is conducive to the development of important data analytics skills.

  abstract     = {We introduce Ricerca Operativa Applicazioni Reali (ROAR; in English, Real Applications of Operations Research ), a three-year project for higher secondary schools. Its main aim is to improve students’ interest, motivation, and skills related to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics disciplines by integrating mathematics and computer science through operations research. ROAR offers examples and problems closely connected with students’ everyday life or with the industrial reality, balancing mathematical modeling and algorithmics. The project is composed of three teaching units, addressed to grades 10, 11, and 12. The implementation of the first teaching unit took place in Spring 2021 at the scientific high school IIS Antonietti in Iseo (Brescia, Italy). In particular, in this paper, we provide a full description of this first teaching unit in terms of objectives, prerequisites, topics and methods, organization of the lectures, and digital technologies used. Moreover, we analyze the feedback received from students and teachers involved in the experimentation, and we discuss advantages and disadvantages related to distance learning that we had to adopt because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding: E. Taranto and G. Colajanni were partially supported by the research projects “Programma Ricerca di Ateneo UNICT 2020-22 linea 2,” “EEEP&amp;DLaD,” and “OMNIA” of the University of Catania.

  abstract     = {This paper studies how both direct and indirect assessment outcomes can determine how students are learning different concepts in business statistics. We explore connections between the outcomes from the two assessment approaches and how different student characteristics and background factors impact these two methods of assessment. The results based on a sample of 64 students enrolled in an undergraduate business statistics course at a large public university designated as a minority-serving institution show some similarities and some differences among the two types of assessment outcomes and the insights they provide about overall student learning in the course. Furthermore, factors like gender and background grade point average are seen to impact both direct and indirect assessment results, whereas others such as the type of business concentration and student status only impact one type of assessment. Finally, we show that some indirect assessment outcomes can predict direct assessment outcomes while controlling for demographic and other background variables.},

  abstract     = {As the COVID-19 pandemic motivated a shift to virtual teaching, exams have increasingly moved online too. Detecting cheating through collusion is not easy when tech-savvy students take online exams at home and on their own devices. Such online at-home exams may tempt students to collude and share materials and answers. However, online exams’ digital output also enables computer-aided detection of collusion patterns. This paper presents two simple data-driven techniques to analyze exam event logs and essay-form answers. Based on examples from exams in social sciences, we show that such analyses can reveal patterns of student collusion. We suggest using these patterns to quantify the degree of collusion. Finally, we summarize a set of lessons learned about designing and analyzing online exams.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and operations research (OR) have long been intertwined because of their synergistic relationship. Given the increasing popularity of AI and machine learning in particular, we face growing demand for educational offerings in this area from our students. This paper describes two courses that introduce machine learning concepts to undergraduate, predominantly industrial engineering and operations research students. Instead of taking a methods-first approach, these courses use real-world applications to motivate, introduce, and explore these machine learning techniques and highlight meaningful overlap with operations research. Significant hands-on coding experience is used to build student proficiency with the techniques. Student feedback indicates that these courses have greatly increased student interest in machine learning and appreciation of the real-world impact that analytics can have and helped students develop practical skills that they can apply. We believe that similar application-driven courses that connect machine learning and operations research would be valuable additions to undergraduate OR curricula broadly.
