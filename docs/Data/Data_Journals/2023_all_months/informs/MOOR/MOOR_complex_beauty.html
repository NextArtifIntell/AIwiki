  abstract     = {This paper proposes and develops a new Newton-type algorithm to solve subdifferential inclusions defined by subgradients of extended real-valued prox-regular functions. The proposed algorithm is formulated in terms of the second order subdifferential of such functions that enjoy extensive calculus rules and can be efficiently computed for broad classes of extended real-valued functions. Based on this and on the metric regularity and subregularity properties of subgradient mappings, we establish verifiable conditions ensuring the well-posedness of the proposed algorithm and its local superlinear convergence. The obtained results are also new for the class of equations defined by continuously differentiable functions with Lipschitzian gradients ( C 1 , 1 functions), which is the underlying case of our consideration. The developed algorithms for prox-regular functions and their extension to a structured class of composite functions are formulated in terms of proximal mappings and forward–backward envelopes. Besides numerous illustrative examples and comparison with known algorithms for C 1 , 1 functions and generalized equations, the paper presents applications of the proposed algorithms to regularized least square problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related disciplines.

  abstract     = {Logit dynamics is a form of randomized game dynamics in which players have a bias toward strategic deviations that give a higher improvement in cost. It is used extensively in practice. In congestion (or potential) games, the dynamics converge to the so-called Gibbs distribution over the set of all strategy profiles when interpreted as a Markov chain. In general, logit dynamics can converge slowly to the Gibbs distribution, but beyond that, not much is known about its algorithmic aspects, nor that of the Gibbs distribution. In this work, we are interested in the following two questions for congestion games: (i) Is there an efficient algorithm for sampling from the Gibbs distribution? (ii) If yes, does there also exist natural randomized dynamics that converge quickly to the Gibbs distribution? We first study these questions in extension parallel congestion games, a well-studied special case of symmetric network congestion games. As our main result, we show that there is a simple variation on the logit dynamics that converges quickly to the Gibbs distribution in such games. We also address the first question for the class of so-called capacitated uniform congestion games and the second question for max cut games played on a complete graph. To prove our results, we rely on the recent breakthrough work of Anari et al. (2019) regarding the approximate sampling of a base of a matroid according to a strongly log-concave probability distribution.},

This class of games finds natural applications in the context of optimal productivity expansion in dynamic oligopolies. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the mean field equilibria, which are completely characterized through nonlinear equations. Furthermore, we relate the mean field equilibria for the discounted and ergodic games by showing the validity of an Abelian limit. The latter also allows us to approximate Nash equilibria of—so far unexplored—symmetric N -player ergodic singular control games through the mean field equilibrium of the discounted game. Numerical examples finally illustrate in a case study the dependency of the mean field equilibria with respect to the parameters of the games.

Despite the success of primal-dual conic interior point solvers, there has been little work on enabling direct support for spectral cones , that is, proper nonsymmetric cones defined from epigraphs and perspectives of spectral functions. We propose simple logarithmically homogeneous barriers for spectral cones and we derive efficient, numerically stable procedures for evaluating barrier oracles such as inverse Hessian operators. For two useful classes of spectral cones—the root-determinant cones and the matrix monotone derivative cones —we show that the barriers are self-concordant, with nearly optimal parameters. We implement these cones and oracles in our open-source solver Hypatia, and we write simple, natural formulations for four applied problems. Our computational benchmarks demonstrate that Hypatia often solves the natural formulations more efficiently than advanced solvers such as MOSEK 9 solve equivalent extended formulations written using only the cones these solvers support.

This acceleration halves the Bregman divergence between the current iterate and the optimal solution within every two iterations. Using the Bregman divergence as a potential in conjunction with combinatorial arguments, we obtain strongly polynomial algorithms in three applications domains. (i) For linear fractional combinatorial optimization, we show a convergence bound of O ( m log m ) iterations; the previous best bound was O ( m 2 log m ) by Wang, Yang, and Zhang from 2006. (ii) We obtain a strongly polynomial label-correcting algorithm for solving linear feasibility systems with two variables per inequality (2VPI). For a 2VPI system with n variables and m constraints, our algorithm runs in O ( mn ) iterations. Every iteration takes O ( mn ) time for general 2VPI systems and O ( m + n log n ) time for the special case of deterministic Markov decision processes (DMDPs). This extends and strengthens a previous result by Madani from 2002 that showed a weakly polynomial bound for a variant of the Newton–Dinkelbach method for solving DMDPs.

Our mechanisms are designed based on a powerful correspondence between two-sided markets and prophet inequalities. They satisfy individual rationality, dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, and budget balance constraints and give constant factor approximations to the optimal social welfare. We improve previous results in several settings. Our main focus is on matroid double auctions. Here, sellers hold identical items, and the set of buyers that obtain an item needs to be independent in a matroid. We construct two mechanisms, the first being a 1/3 approximation of the optimal social welfare-satisfying strong budget balance and requiring the agents to trade in a customized order and the second being a 1/2 approximation weakly budget balanced and able to deal with online arrival determined by an adversary. In addition, we construct constant factor approximations in two-sided markets with identical items when buyers need to fulfill a knapsack constraint. Also, in combinatorial double auctions with heterogeneous items, where buyers have valuation functions over item bundles instead of being interested in only one item, using similar techniques, we design a mechanism that is a 1/2 approximation of the optimal social welfare, is strongly budget balanced, and can deal with the online arrival of agents in an adversarial order.

We propose a new formulation of graphon games based on a single typical player’s label-state distribution. In contrast, other recently proposed models of graphon games work directly with a continuum of players, which involves serious measure-theoretic technicalities. In fact, by viewing the label as a component of the state process, we show in our formulation that graphon games are a special case of mean field games, albeit with certain inevitable degeneracies and discontinuities that make most existing results on mean field games inapplicable. Nonetheless, we prove the existence of Markovian graphon equilibria under fairly general assumptions as well as uniqueness under a monotonicity condition. Most importantly, we show how our notion of graphon equilibrium can be used to construct approximate equilibria for large finite games set on any (weighted, directed) graph that converges in cut norm. The lack of players’ exchangeability necessitates a careful definition of approximate equilibrium, allowing heterogeneity among the players’ approximation errors, and we show how various regularity properties of the model inputs and underlying graphon lead naturally to different strengths of approximation.

  abstract     = {The predict-then-optimize framework is fundamental in many practical settings: predict the unknown parameters of an optimization problem and then solve the problem using the predicted values of the parameters. A natural loss function in this environment is to consider the cost of the decisions induced by the predicted parameters in contrast to the prediction error of the parameters. This loss function is referred to as the smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss. In this work, we seek to provide bounds on how well the performance of a prediction model fit on training data generalizes out of sample in the context of the SPO loss. Because the SPO loss is nonconvex and non-Lipschitz, standard results for deriving generalization bounds do not apply. We first derive bounds based on the Natarajan dimension that, in the case of a polyhedral feasible region, scale at most logarithmically in the number of extreme points but, in the case of a general convex feasible region, have linear dependence on the decision dimension. By exploiting the structure of the SPO loss function and a key property of the feasible region, which we denote as the strength property, we can dramatically improve the dependence on the decision and feature dimensions. Our approach and analysis rely on placing a margin around problematic predictions that do not yield unique optimal solutions and then providing generalization bounds in the context of a modified margin SPO loss function that is Lipschitz continuous. Finally, we characterize the strength property and show that the modified SPO loss can be computed efficiently for both strongly convex bodies and polytopes with an explicit extreme point representation.

  abstract     = {Convex optimization over the spectrahedron, that is, the set of all real n × n positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace, has important applications in machine learning, signal processing, and statistics, mainly as a convex relaxation for optimization problems with low-rank matrices. It is also one of the most prominent examples in the theory of first order methods for convex optimization in which non-Euclidean methods can be significantly preferable to their Euclidean counterparts. In particular, the desirable choice is the matrix exponentiated gradient (MEG) method, which is based on the Bregman distance induced by the (negative) von Neumann entropy. Unfortunately, implementing MEG requires a full singular value decomposition (SVD) computation on each iteration, which is not scalable to high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose efficient implementations of MEG, with both deterministic and stochastic gradients, which are tailored for optimization with low-rank matrices, and only use a single low-rank SVD computation on each iteration. We also provide efficiently computable certificates for the correct convergence of our methods. Mainly, we prove that, under a strict complementarity condition, the suggested methods converge from a warm-start initialization with similar rates to their full SVD–based counterparts. Finally, we bring empirical experiments that both support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical appeal of our methods.

  abstract     = {Let ρ be a general law-invariant convex risk measure, for instance, the average value at risk, and let X be a financial loss, that is, a real random variable. In practice, either the true distribution μ of X is unknown, or the numerical computation of ρ ( μ ) is not possible. In both cases, either relying on historical data or using a Monte Carlo approach, one can resort to an independent and identically distributed sample of μ to approximate ρ ( μ ) by the finite sample estimator ρ ( μ N ) ( μ N denotes the empirical measure of μ ). In this article, we investigate convergence rates of ρ ( μ N ) to ρ ( μ ) . We provide nonasymptotic convergence rates for both the deviation probability and the expectation of the estimation error. The sharpness of these convergence rates is analyzed. Our framework further allows for hedging, and the convergence rates we obtain depend on neither the dimension of the underlying assets nor the number of options available for trading.

  abstract     = {The stochastic multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem is a common model for sequential decision problems. In the standard setup, a decision maker has to choose at every instant between several competing arms; each of them provides a scalar random variable, referred to as a “reward.” Nearly all research on this topic considers the total cumulative reward as the criterion of interest. This work focuses on other natural objectives that cannot be cast as a sum over rewards but rather, more involved functions of the reward stream. Unlike the case of cumulative criteria, in the problems we study here, the oracle policy, which knows the problem parameters a priori and is used to “center” the regret, is not trivial. We provide a systematic approach to such problems and derive general conditions under which the oracle policy is sufficiently tractable to facilitate the design of optimism-based (upper confidence bound) learning policies. These conditions elucidate an interesting interplay between the arm reward distributions and the performance metric. Our main findings are illustrated for several commonly used objectives, such as conditional value-at-risk, mean-variance trade-offs, Sharpe ratio, and more.

Each player aims to maximize the expected reward of her own share subject to her cost of effort. To reduce the free-rider issue, we propose some relative performance criteria (RPC), based on which the reward is redistributed to each player. We are interested in those RPCs that implement the optimal solution for the corresponding centralized problem, and we call such RPC an optimal one. That is, the expected payoff of each player under the equilibrium associated with an optimal RPC is as large as the value induced by the corresponding problem where players completely cooperate. We first analyze a one-period model with homogeneous players and obtain natural RPCs of different forms. Then, we generalize these results to a multiperiod model in discrete time. Next, we investigate a two-layer mean-field game. The top layer is an interteam game (team-wise competition), in which the reward of a team is impacted by the relative achievement of the team with respect to other teams; the bottom layer is an intrateam contribution game where an RPC is implemented for reward redistribution among team members. We establish the existence of equilibria for the two-layer game and characterize the intrateam optimal RPC. Finally, we extend the (one-layer) results of optimal RPCs to the continuous-time setup as well as to the case with heterogenous players.},

We study conditions under which such a network can be reduced to a smaller, equivalent network with the same behavior at the terminal nodes. Potential-based flow networks are widely used to model infrastructure networks, such as electricity, gas, or water networks. In contrast to Kron’s reduction for electrical networks, we prove that, in general, potential-based flow networks with at least three terminals cannot be reduced to smaller networks whose size only depends on the number of terminals. On the other hand, we show that it is possible to represent a special class of potential-based flow networks by a complete graph on the terminals, and we establish a characterization of networks that can be reduced to a path network.

For example, an IP can be solved in strongly polynomial time if the constraint matrix is bimodular: that is, the determinants are bounded in absolute value by two. Determinants are also used to bound the ℓ 1 distance between IP solutions and solutions of its linear relaxation. One of the first to quantify the complexity of IPs with bounded determinants was Heller, who identified the maximum number of differing columns in a totally unimodular matrix. Each extension of Heller’s bound to general determinants has been superpolynomial in the determinants or the number of equations. We provide the first column bound that is polynomial in both values. For integer programs with box constraints, our result gives the first ℓ 1 distance bound that is polynomial in the determinants and the number of equations. Our result can also be used to derive a bound on the height of Graver basis elements that is polynomial in the determinants and the number of equations. Furthermore, we show a tight bound on the number of differing columns in a bimodular matrix; this is the first tight bound since Heller.

Rooted variants of the problems have the additional constraint that a given vertex, the root, must be contained in the tour/tree. In our previous paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm for the rooted and unrooted versions of both the tree and tour variants using a parameterized primal–dual approach. Here, we illustrate an error in the proof of a lemma for the rooted version of the algorithm and show that the algorithm has no finite approximation guarantee for the rooted version of the problem. We also show that the lemma and the approximation guarantee of 2 continue to hold true for the unrooted version. This leaves the best-known approximations for the rooted tour an established ( 2 + ϵ ) -approximation algorithm and for the tree variant a previously published poly-log approximation algorithm.},

We study methods that use a collection of random observations to compute approximate solutions by searching over a known low-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space. First, we prove an instance-dependent upper bound on the mean-squared error for a linear stochastic approximation scheme that exploits Polyak–Ruppert averaging. This bound consists of two terms: an approximation error term with an instance-dependent approximation factor and a statistical error term that captures the instance-specific complexity of the noise when projected onto the low-dimensional subspace. Using information-theoretic methods, we also establish lower bounds showing that both of these terms cannot be improved, again in an instance-dependent sense. A concrete consequence of our characterization is that the optimal approximation factor in this problem can be much larger than a universal constant. We show how our results precisely characterize the error of a class of temporal difference learning methods for the policy evaluation problem with linear function approximation, establishing their optimality.

The proposed method uses an adaptive mechanism for the update of the feasibility penalizing elements, essentially turning our multiplier type method into a simple alternating minimization procedure based on the augmented Lagrangian function from some iteration onward. This allows us to avoid the restrictive and, until now, mandatory surjectivity-type assumptions on the model. We establish the iteration complexity of the proposed scheme to reach an ε -critical point. Moreover, we prove that the limit point of every bounded sequence generated by a procedure that employs the method with strictly decreasing levels of precision is a critical point of the problem. Our approach provides novel results even in the simpler composite linear model, in which the surjectivity of the linear operator is a baseline assumption. Funding: N.

Given an operator A : H ⇉ H that is maximal monotone, we propose a closed-loop control system that is governed by the operator I − ( I + λ ( t ) A ) − 1 , where a feedback law λ ( · ) is tuned by the resolution of the algebraic equation λ ( t ) ‖ ( I + λ ( t ) A ) − 1 x ( t ) − x ( t ) ‖ p − 1 = θ for some θ &gt; 0 . Our first contribution is to prove the existence and uniqueness of a global solution via the Cauchy–Lipschitz theorem. We present a simple Lyapunov function for establishing the weak convergence of trajectories via the Opial lemma and strong convergence results under additional conditions. We then prove a global ergodic convergence rate of O ( t − ( p + 1 ) / 2 ) in terms of a gap function and a global pointwise convergence rate of O ( t − p / 2 ) in terms of a residue function. Local linear convergence is established in terms of a distance function under an error bound condition. Further, we provide an algorithmic framework based on the implicit discretization of our system in a Euclidean setting, generalizing the large-step hybrid proximal extragradient framework. Even though the discrete-time analysis is a simplification and generalization of existing analyses for a bounded domain, it is largely motivated by the aforementioned continuous-time analysis, illustrating the fundamental role that the closed-loop control plays in acceleration in monotone inclusion. A highlight of our analysis is a new result concerning p th -order tensor algorithms for monotone inclusion problems, complementing the recent analysis for saddle point and VI problems.

  abstract     = {The extended trust region subproblem (ETRS) of minimizing a quadratic objective over the unit ball with additional linear constraints has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years because of its theoretical significance and wide spectra of applications. Several sufficient conditions to guarantee the exactness of its semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation have been recently developed in the literature. In this paper, we consider a generalization of the extended trust region subproblem (GETRS), in which the unit ball constraint in the ETRS is replaced by a general, possibly nonconvex, quadratic constraint, and the linear constraints are replaced by a conic linear constraint. We derive sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the exactness of the SDP relaxation of the GETRS under mild assumptions. Our main tools are two classes of convex relaxations for the GETRS based on either a simultaneous diagonalization transformation of the quadratic forms or linear combinations of the quadratic forms. We also compare our results to the existing sufficient conditions in the literature. Finally, we extend our results to derive a new sufficient condition for the exactness of the SDP relaxation of general diagonal quadratically constrained quadratic programs, where each quadratic function is associated with a diagonal matrix.

  abstract     = {We study stochastic teams (known also as decentralized stochastic control problems or identical interest stochastic dynamic games) with large or countably infinite numbers of decision makers and characterize the existence and structural properties of (globally) optimal policies. We consider both static and dynamic nonconvex teams where the cost function and dynamics satisfy an exchangeability condition. To arrive at existence and structural results for optimal policies, we first introduce a topology on control policies, which involves various relaxations given the decentralized information structure. This is then utilized to arrive at a de Finetti–type representation theorem for exchangeable policies. This leads to a representation theorem for policies that admit an infinite exchangeability condition. For a general setup of stochastic team problems with N decision makers, under exchangeability of observations of decision makers and the cost function, we show that, without loss of global optimality, the search for optimal policies can be restricted to those that are N -exchangeable. Then, by extending N -exchangeable policies to infinitely exchangeable ones, establishing a convergence argument for the induced costs, and using the presented de Finetti–type theorem, we establish the existence of an optimal decentralized policy for static and dynamic teams with countably infinite numbers of decision makers, which turns out to be symmetric (i.e., identical) and randomized. In particular, unlike in prior work, convexity of the cost in policies is not assumed. Finally, we show the near optimality of symmetric independently randomized policies for finite N -decision-maker teams and thus establish approximation results for N -decision-maker weakly coupled stochastic teams.

Motivated by the fact that nonnegative separable and nonnegative quadratic polynomials are sums of squares, we study whether nonnegative SPQ polynomials are (i) the sum of a nonnegative separable and a nonnegative quadratic polynomial and (ii) a sum of squares. We establish that the answer to question (i) is positive for univariate plus quadratic polynomials and for convex SPQ polynomials but negative already for bivariate quartic SPQ polynomials. We use our decomposition result for convex SPQ polynomials to show that convex SPQ polynomial optimization problems can be solved by “small” semidefinite programs. For question (ii), we provide a complete characterization of the answer based on the degree and the number of variables of the SPQ polynomial. We also prove that testing nonnegativity of SPQ polynomials is NP-hard when the degree is at least four. We end by presenting applications of SPQ polynomials to upper bounding sparsity of solutions to linear programs, polynomial regression problems in statistics, and a generalization of Newton’s method that incorporates separable higher order derivative information.

In this problem, a firm observes a sequence of T customers requesting a service. Each arrival is drawn independently from a known distribution of k different types, and the firm needs to decide irrevocably whether to accept or reject requests in an online fashion. The firm has a capacity of resources B and wants to maximize its profit. Each accepted service request yields a type-dependent revenue and has a type-dependent probability of requiring a resource once all arrivals have occurred (or be a no-show). If the number of accepted arrivals that require a resource at the end of the horizon is greater than B , the firm needs to pay a fixed compensation for each service request that it cannot fulfill. With a clairvoyant that knows all arrivals ahead of time, as a benchmark, we provide an algorithm with a uniform additive loss bound, that is, its expected loss is independent of T .

  abstract     = {The price of anarchy (PoA) is a standard measure to quantify the inefficiency of equilibria in nonatomic congestion games. Most publications have focused on worst-case bounds for the PoA. Only a few have analyzed the sensitivity of the PoA against changes of the demands or cost functions, although that is crucial for empirical computations of the PoA. We analyze the sensitivity of the PoA with respect to (w.r.t.) simultaneous changes of demands and cost functions. The key to this analysis is a metric for the distance between two games that defines a topological metric space consisting of all games with the same combinatorial structure. The PoA is then a locally pointwise Hölder continuous function of the demands and cost functions, and we analyze the Hölder exponent for different classes of cost functions. We also apply our approach to the convergence analysis of the PoA when the total demand tends to zero or infinity. Our results further develop the recent seminal work on the sensitivity of the PoA w.r.t. changes of only the demands under special conditions.

  abstract     = {Modern reinforcement learning (RL) is commonly applied to practical problems with an enormous number of states, where function approximation must be deployed to approximate either the value function or the policy. The introduction of function approximation raises a fundamental set of challenges involving computational and statistical efficiency, especially given the need to manage the exploration/exploitation trade-off. As a result, a core RL question remains open: how can we design provably efficient RL algorithms that incorporate function approximation? This question persists even in a basic setting with linear dynamics and linear rewards, for which only linear function approximation is needed. This paper presents the first provable RL algorithm with both polynomial run time and polynomial sample complexity in this linear setting, without requiring a “simulator” or additional assumptions. Concretely, we prove that an optimistic modification of least-squares value iteration—a classical algorithm frequently studied in the linear setting—achieves O ˜ ( d 3 H 3 T ) regret, where d is the ambient dimension of feature space, H is the length of each episode, and T is the total number of steps. Importantly, such regret is independent of the number of states and actions. Funding: This work was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program on Lifelong Learning Machines.},

General equilibrium theory can be applied here to solve the problem of deciding how to fairly and efficiently allocate resources among agents as resource sharing over the network can be modeled as a pure exchange economy. It is known that proportional sharing dynamics converges to a market equilibrium solution. We are particularly interested in proportional sharing dynamics as a mechanism for network resource sharing. Our focus is on the key issue in internet market design: whether an agent may manipulate its report of its own private information to gain more resources under this mechanism.

There are two main novelties in the optimal problems considered: The underlying stochastic process has discontinuous paths, and the cost function is not necessarily integrable on the entire time horizon, where the latter is often a key assumption in classical optimal stopping theory for diffusions. Under relatively mild conditions, we show, for the class of multidimensional optimal stopping problems under consideration, that the first entry time of the stopping region is an optimal stopping time. Further, we prove that the corresponding optimal stopping boundaries can be represented as the unique solution to a nonlinear integral equation.

  abstract     = {In the classic contextual bandits problem, in each round t , a learner observes some context c , chooses some action i to perform, and receives some reward r i , t ( c ) . We consider the variant of this problem in which in addition to receiving the reward r i , t ( c ) , the learner also learns the values of r i , t ( c ′ ) for some other contexts c ′ in set O i ( c ) , that is, the rewards that would be achieved by performing that action under different contexts c ′ ∈ O i ( c ) . This variant arises in several strategic settings, such as learning how to bid in nontruthful repeated auctions, which has gained a lot of attention lately as many platforms have switched to running first price auctions. We call this problem the contextual bandits problem with cross-learning. The best algorithms for the classic contextual bandits problem achieve O ˜ ( CKT ) regret against all stationary policies, in which C is the number of contexts, K the number of actions, and T the number of rounds. We design and analyze new algorithms for the contextual bandits problem with cross-learning and show that their regret has better dependence on the number of contexts. Under complete cross-learning in which the rewards for all contexts are learned when choosing an action, that is, set O i ( c ) contains all contexts, we show that our algorithms achieve regret O ˜ ( K T ) , removing the dependence on C . For any other cases, that is, under partial cross-learning in which | O i ( c ) | &lt; C for some context–action pair of ( i , c ), the regret bounds depend on how the sets O i ( c ) impact the degree to which cross-learning between contexts is possible. We simulate our algorithms on real auction data from an ad exchange running first price auctions and show that they outperform traditional contextual bandit algorithms.

  abstract     = {We study the fair division problem of allocating a mixed manna under additively separable piecewise linear concave (SPLC) utilities. A mixed manna contains goods that everyone likes and bads (chores) that everyone dislikes as well as items that some like and others dislike. The seminal work of Bogomolnaia et al. argues why allocating a mixed manna is genuinely more complicated than a good or a bad manna and why competitive equilibrium is the best mechanism. It also provides the existence of equilibrium and establishes its distinctive properties (e.g., nonconvex and disconnected set of equilibria even under linear utilities) but leaves the problem of computing an equilibrium open. Our main results are a linear complementarity problem formulation that captures all competitive equilibria of a mixed manna under SPLC utilities (a strict generalization of linear) and a complementary pivot algorithm based on Lemke’s scheme for finding one. Experimental results on randomly generated instances suggest that our algorithm is fast in practice. Given the PPAD -hardness of the problem, designing such an algorithm is the only non–brute force (nonenumerative) option known; for example, the classic Lemke–Howson algorithm for computing a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game is still one of the most widely used algorithms in practice. Our algorithm also yields several new structural properties as simple corollaries. We obtain a (constructive) proof of existence for a far more general setting, membership of the problem in PPAD , a rational-valued solution, and an odd number of solutions property. The last property also settles the conjecture of Bogomolnaia et al. in the affirmative. Furthermore, we show that, if the number of either agents or items is a constant, then the number of pivots in our algorithm is strongly polynomial when the mixed manna contains all bads.

  abstract     = {The projection onto the epigraph or a level set of a closed proper convex function can be achieved by finding a root of a scalar equation that involves the proximal operator as a function of the proximal parameter. This paper develops the variational analysis of this scalar equation. The approach is based on a study of the variational-analytic properties of general convex optimization problems that are (partial) infimal projections of the sum of the function in question and the perspective map of a convex kernel. When the kernel is the Euclidean norm squared, the solution map corresponds to the proximal map, and thus, the variational properties derived for the general case apply to the proximal case. Properties of the value function and the corresponding solution map—including local Lipschitz continuity, directional differentiability, and semismoothness—are derived. An SC 1 optimization framework for computing epigraphical and level-set projections is, thus, established. Numerical experiments on one-norm projection illustrate the effectiveness of the approach as compared with specialized algorithms.

  abstract     = {Mathematical approaches for modeling dynamic traffic can be roughly divided into two categories: discrete packet routing models and continuous flow over time models . Despite very vital research activities on models in both categories, their connection was poorly understood so far. We build this connection by specifying a (competitive) packet routing model, which is discrete in terms of flow and time, and proving its convergence to the intensively studied model of flows over time with deterministic queuing. More precisely, we prove that the limit of the convergence process when decreasing the packet size and time step length in the packet routing model constitutes a flow over time with multiple commodities. In addition, we show that the convergence result implies the existence of approximate equilibria in the competitive version of the packet routing model. This is of significant interest as exact pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed in the multicommodity setting.

By applying the completion-of-squares method, we prove the existence of the solutions for the obtained ODEs. The obtained results make it possible to compute the control and value function.

  abstract     = {Distributionally robust stochastic optimization (DRSO) is an approach to optimization under uncertainty in which, instead of assuming that there is a known true underlying probability distribution, one hedges against a chosen set of distributions. In this paper, we first point out that the set of distributions should be chosen to be appropriate for the application at hand and some of the choices that have been popular until recently are, for many applications, not good choices. We next consider sets of distributions that are within a chosen Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution. Such a choice of sets has two advantages: (1) The resulting distributions hedged against are more reasonable than those resulting from other popular choices of sets. (2) The problem of determining the worst-case expectation over the resulting set of distributions has desirable tractability properties. We derive a strong duality reformulation of the corresponding DRSO problem and construct approximate worst-case distributions (or an exact worst-case distribution if it exists) explicitly via the first-order optimality conditions of the dual problem. Our contributions are fourfold. (i) We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a worst-case distribution, which are naturally related to the growth rate of the objective function. (ii) We show that the worst-case distributions resulting from an appropriate Wasserstein distance have a concise structure and a clear interpretation. (iii) Using this structure, we show that data-driven DRSO problems can be approximated to any accuracy by robust optimization problems, and thereby many DRSO problems become tractable by using tools from robust optimization. (iv) Our strong duality result holds in a very general setting. As examples, we show that it can be applied to infinite dimensional process control and intensity estimation for point processes.},

It first establishes the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium to this GMFG, and it demonstrates that naively combining reinforcement learning with the fixed-point approach in classical mean-field games yields unstable algorithms. It then proposes value-based and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms (GMF-V and GMF-P, respectively) with smoothed policies, with analysis of their convergence properties and computational complexities. Experiments on an equilibrium product pricing problem demonstrate that two specific instantiations of GMF-V with Q-learning and GMF-P with trust region policy optimization—GMF-V-Q and GMF-P-TRPO, respectively—are both efficient and robust in the GMFG setting. Moreover, their performance is superior in convergence speed, accuracy, and stability when compared with existing algorithms for multiagent reinforcement learning in the N -player setting.

  abstract     = {We consider the question of whether and in what sense, Wardrop equilibria provide a good approximation for Nash equilibria in atomic unsplittable congestion games with a large number of small players. We examine two different definitions of small players. In the first setting, we consider games in which each player’s weight is small. We prove that when the number of players goes to infinity and their weights to zero, the random flows in all (mixed) Nash equilibria for the finite games converge in distribution to the set of Wardrop equilibria of the corresponding nonatomic limit game. In the second setting, we consider an increasing number of players with a unit weight that participate in the game with a decreasingly small probability. In this case, the Nash equilibrium flows converge in total variation toward Poisson random variables whose expected values are Wardrop equilibria of a different nonatomic game with suitably defined costs. The latter can be viewed as symmetric equilibria in a Poisson game in the sense of Myerson, establishing a plausible connection between the Wardrop model for routing games and the stochastic fluctuations observed in real traffic. In both settings, we provide explicit approximation bounds, and we study the convergence of the price of anarchy. Beyond the case of congestion games, we prove a general result on the convergence of large games with random players toward Poisson games. Funding: R.

  abstract     = {If f is a positive definite form, Reznick’s Positivstellensatz states that there exists k ∈ N such that ‖ x ‖ 2 2 k f is a sum of squares of polynomials. Assuming that f can be written as a sum of forms ∑ l = 1 p f l , where each f l depends on a subset of the initial variables, and assuming that these subsets satisfy the so-called running intersection property , we provide a sparse version of Reznick’s Positivstellensatz. Namely, there exists k ∈ N such that f = ∑ l = 1 p σ l / H l k , where σ l is a sum of squares of polynomials, H l is a uniform polynomial denominator, and both polynomials σ l , H l involve the same variables as f l for each l = 1 , … , p . In other words, the sparsity pattern of f is also reflected in this sparse version of Reznick’s certificate of positivity. We next use this result to also obtain positivity certificates for (i) polynomials nonnegative on the whole space and (ii) polynomials nonnegative on a (possibly noncompact) basic semialgebraic set, assuming that the input data satisfy the running intersection property. Both are sparse versions of a positivity certificate from Putinar and Vasilescu. Funding: V.

  abstract     = {Consider a stationary process taking values in a finite state space. Each state is associated with a finite one-shot zero-sum game. We investigate the infinitely repeated zero-sum game with incomplete information on one side in which the state of the game evolves according to the stationary process. Two players, named the observer and the adversary, play the following game. At the beginning of any stage, only the observer is informed of the state ξ n and is therefore the only one who knows the identity of the forthcoming one-shot game. Then, both players take actions, which become publicly known. The paper shows the existence of a uniform value in a new class of stationary processes: ergodic Kronecker systems. Techniques from ergodic theory, probability theory, and game theory are employed to describe the optimal strategies of the two players.

  abstract     = {The problem of community detection with two equal-sized communities is closely related to the minimum graph bisection problem over certain random graph models. In the stochastic block model distribution over networks with community structure, a well-known semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the minimum bisection problem recovers the underlying communities whenever possible. Motivated by their superior scalability, we study the theoretical performance of linear programming (LP) relaxations of the minimum bisection problem for the same random models. We show that, unlike the SDP relaxation that undergoes a phase transition in the logarithmic average degree regime, the LP relaxation fails in recovering the planted bisection with high probability in this regime. We show that the LP relaxation instead exhibits a transition from recovery to nonrecovery in the linear average degree regime. Finally, we present nonrecovery conditions for graphs with average degree strictly between linear and logarithmic. Funding: A.

  abstract     = {We consider a classic rendezvous game in which two players try to meet each other on a set of n locations. In each round, every player visits one of the locations, and the game finishes when the players meet at the same location. The goal is to devise strategies for both players that minimize the expected waiting time till the rendezvous. In the asymmetric case, when the strategies of the players may differ, it is known that the optimum expected waiting time of ( n + 1 ) / 2 is achieved by the wait-for-mommy pair of strategies, in which one of the players stays at one location for n rounds, while the other player searches through all the n locations in a random order. However, if we insist that the players are symmetric—they are expected to follow the same strategy—then the best known strategy, proposed by Anderson and Weber [Anderson EJ, Weber RR (1990) The rendezvous problem on discrete locations. J. Appl. Probab. 27(4):839–851], achieves an asymptotic expected waiting time of 0.829 n . We show that the symmetry requirement indeed implies that the expected waiting time needs to be asymptotically larger than in the asymmetric case. Precisely, we prove that for every n ⩾ 2 , if the players need to employ the same strategy, then the expected waiting time is at least ( n + 1 ) / 2 + ε n , where ε = 2 − 36 . We propose in addition a different proof for one our key lemmas, which relies on a result by Ahlswede and Katona [Ahlswede R, Katona GOH (1978) Graphs with maximal number of adjacent pairs of edges. Acta Mathematica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 32(1–2):97–120]: the argument is slightly shorter and provides a constant larger than 2 − 36 , namely, 1 / 3600 .

  abstract     = {Stochastic optimization problems often involve data distributions that change in reaction to the decision variables. This is the case, for example, when members of the population respond to a deployed classifier by manipulating their features so as to improve the likelihood of being positively labeled. Recent works on performative prediction identify an intriguing solution concept for such problems: find the decision that is optimal with respect to the static distribution that the decision induces. Continuing this line of work, we show that, in the strongly convex setting, typical stochastic algorithms—originally designed for static problems—can be applied directly for finding such equilibria with little loss in efficiency. The reason is simple to explain: the main consequence of the distributional shift is that it corrupts algorithms with a bias that decays linearly with the distance to the solution. Using this perspective, we obtain convergence guarantees for popular algorithms, such as stochastic gradient, clipped gradient, prox-point, and dual averaging methods, along with their accelerated and proximal variants. In realistic applications, deployment of a decision rule is often much more expensive than sampling. We show how to modify the aforementioned algorithms so as to maintain their sample efficiency when performing only logarithmically many deployments.

First we study the case in which vertices arrive in an adversarial order. For the case when agents depart in the order of arrival, we provide a randomized 1 / 4 -competitive algorithm. When departure times are drawn independently from a distribution with nondecreasing hazard rate, we establish a 1 / 8 -competitive algorithm. When the arrival order is chosen uniformly at random and agents leave after a fixed number of time periods, a batching algorithm, which computes a maximum-weighted matching periodically, is shown to be 0.279-competitive.},

These bounds rely on the conic approximations K n ( r ) introduced by Parrilo in 2000 for the copositive cone COP n . A difficulty in the convergence analysis of the bounds is the bad behavior of Parrilo’s cones under adding a zero row/column: when applied to a matrix not in K n ( r ) this gives a matrix that does not lie in any of Parrilo’s cones, thereby showing that their union is a strict subset of the copositive cone for any n ≥ 6 . We investigate the graphs for which the bound of order r ≤1 is exact: we algorithmically reduce testing exactness of ϑ ( 0 ) to acritical graphs, we characterize the critical graphs with ϑ ( 0 ) exact, and we exhibit graphs for which exactness of ϑ ( 1 ) is not preserved under adding an isolated node. This disproves a conjecture posed by Gvozdenović and Laurent in 2007, which, if true, would have implied the above conjecture by de Klerk and Pasechnik.

In optimization, Aubin and Ekeland show that this produces an a priori bound on the duality gap of separable nonconvex optimization problems involving finite sums. This bound is highly conservative and depends on unstable quantities; we relax it in several directions to show that nonconvexity can have a much milder impact on finite sum minimization problems, such as empirical risk minimization and multitask classification. As a byproduct, we show a new version of Maurey’s classical approximate Carathéodory lemma where we sample a significant fraction of the coefficients, without replacement, as well as a result on sampling constraints using an approximate Helly theorem, both of independent interest.

Players are ranked according to their level of stopping and rewarded as a function of their relative rank. There is a unique mean field equilibrium, and it is shown to be the limit of associated n -player games. Conversely, the mean field strategy induces n -player ε -Nash equilibria for any continuous reward function—but not for discontinuous ones. In a second part, we study the problem of a principal who can choose how to distribute a reward budget over the ranks and aims to maximize the performance of the median player. The optimal reward design (contract) is found in closed form, complementing the merely partial results available in the n -player case. We then analyze the quality of the mean field design when used as a proxy for the optimizer in the n -player game. Surprisingly, the quality deteriorates dramatically as n grows. We explain this with an asymptotic singularity in the induced n -player equilibrium distributions. Funding: M. Nutz is supported by an Alfred P.

Under the usual many-server diffusion scaling, we show that the system is asymptotically equivalent to a system with no abandonment. In particular, the limit is the Halfin-Whitt diffusion for the M / M / n queue when the traffic intensity approaches its critical value 1 from below, and is otherwise a transient diffusion, despite the fact that the prelimit is positive recurrent. To obtain a refined measure of the congestion due to the correlation, we characterize a lower-order fluid (LOF) limit for the case in which the diffusion limit is transient, demonstrating that the queue in this case scales like n 3 / 4 . Under both the diffusion and LOF scalings, we show that the stationary distributions converge weakly to the time-limiting behavior of the corresponding process limit.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of determining an upper bound for the value of a spectral risk measure of a loss that is a general nonlinear function of two factors whose marginal distributions are known but whose joint distribution is unknown. The factors may take values in complete separable metric spaces. We introduce the notion of Maximum Spectral Measure (MSM), as a worst-case spectral risk measure of the loss with respect to the dependence between the factors. The MSM admits a formulation as a solution to an optimization problem that has the same constraint set as the optimal transport problem but with a more general objective function. We present results analogous to the Kantorovich duality, and we investigate the continuity properties of the optimal value function and optimal solution set with respect to perturbation of the marginal distributions. Additionally, we provide an asymptotic result characterizing the limiting distribution of the optimal value function when the factor distributions are simulated from finite sample spaces. The special case of Expected Shortfall and the resulting Maximum Expected Shortfall is also examined. Funding: M. Ghossoub and D.

  abstract     = {We consider stochastic zeroth-order optimization over Riemannian submanifolds embedded in Euclidean space, where the task is to solve Riemannian optimization problems with only noisy objective function evaluations. Toward this, our main contribution is to propose estimators of the Riemannian gradient and Hessian from noisy objective function evaluations, based on a Riemannian version of the Gaussian smoothing technique. The proposed estimators overcome the difficulty of nonlinearity of the manifold constraint and issues that arise in using Euclidean Gaussian smoothing techniques when the function is defined only over the manifold. We use the proposed estimators to solve Riemannian optimization problems in the following settings for the objective function: (i) stochastic and gradient-Lipschitz (in both nonconvex and geodesic convex settings), (ii) sum of gradient-Lipschitz and nonsmooth functions, and (iii) Hessian-Lipschitz. For these settings, we analyze the oracle complexity of our algorithms to obtain appropriately defined notions of ϵ -stationary point or ϵ -approximate local minimizer. Notably, our complexities are independent of the dimension of the ambient Euclidean space and depend only on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold under consideration. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms by simulation results and real-world applications on black-box stiffness control for robotics and black-box attacks to neural networks. Funding: J.

The proposed model can be viewed as a zero-sum game between a statistician choosing an estimator—that is, a measurable function of the observation—and a fictitious adversary choosing a prior—that is, a pair of signal and noise distributions ranging over independent Wasserstein balls—with the goal to minimize and maximize the expected squared estimation error, respectively. We show that, if the Wasserstein balls are centered at normal distributions, then the zero-sum game admits a Nash equilibrium, by which the players’ optimal strategies are given by an affine estimator and a normal prior, respectively. We further prove that this Nash equilibrium can be computed by solving a tractable convex program. Finally, we develop a Frank–Wolfe algorithm that can solve this convex program orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art general-purpose solvers. We show that this algorithm enjoys a linear convergence rate and that its direction-finding subproblems can be solved in quasi-closed form.

This setting corresponds to the intersection of two matroids in the work of Kleinberg and Weinberg [ 40 ] and Feldman et al. [ 27 ]. We study a simple class of nonadaptive policies that we call vertex-additive policies. A vertex-additive policy assigns static prices to every vertex in the graph and accepts only those edges whose weight exceeds the sum of the prices on the edge endpoints. We show that there exists a vertex-additive policy with the expected payoff of at least one-third of the prophet’s payoff and present a gradient descent algorithm that quickly converges to the desired vector of vertex prices. Our results improve on the adaptive online policies of Kleinberg and Weinberg and Feldman et al. for the intersection of two matroids in two ways: our policy is nonadaptive and has a better approximation guarantee of 3 instead of the previous guarantees of 5.82 in Kleinberg and Weinberg and 5.43 in Feldman et al.

  abstract     = {A closed convex conic subset S of the positive semidefinite (PSD) cone is rank-one generated (ROG) if all of its extreme rays are generated by rank-one matrices. The ROG property of S is closely related to the exactness of semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) related to S . We consider the case where S is obtained as the intersection of the PSD cone with finitely many homogeneous linear matrix inequalities and conic constraints and identify sufficient conditions that guarantee that S is ROG. Our general framework allows us to recover a number of well-known results from the literature. In the case of two linear matrix inequalities, we also establish the necessity of our sufficient conditions. This extends one of the few settings from the literature—the case of one linear matrix inequality and the S-lemma—where an explicit characterization for the ROG property exists. Finally, we show how our ROG results on cones can be translated into inhomogeneous SDP exactness results and convex hull descriptions in the original space of a QCQP. We close with a few applications of these results; specifically, we recover the well-known perspective reformulation of a simple mixed-binary set via the ROG toolkit.

Our key insight is to draw an analogy between coordinate blocks in Euclidean space and tangent subspaces of a manifold. Hence, our method is called tangent subspace descent (TSD). The core principle behind ensuring convergence of TSD is the appropriate choice of subspace at each iteration. To this end, we propose two novel conditions, the ( C , r )-norm and C -randomized norm conditions on deterministic and randomized modes of subspace selection, respectively, that promise convergence for smooth functions and that are satisfied in practical contexts. We propose two subspace selection rules, one deterministic and another randomized, of particular practical interest on the Stiefel manifold.

  abstract     = {We consider a robust approach to address uncertainty in model parameters in Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are widely used to model dynamic optimization in many applications. Most prior works consider the case in which the uncertainty on transitions related to different states is uncoupled and the adversary is allowed to select the worst possible realization for each state unrelated to others, potentially leading to highly conservative solutions. On the other hand, the case of general uncertainty sets is known to be intractable. We consider a factor model for probability transitions in which the transition probability is a linear function of a factor matrix that is uncertain and belongs to a factor matrix uncertainty set . This is a fairly general model of uncertainty in probability transitions, allowing the decision maker to model dependence between probability transitions across different states, and it is significantly less conservative than prior approaches. We show that under an underlying rectangularity assumption, we can efficiently compute an optimal robust policy under the factor matrix uncertainty model. Furthermore, we show that there is an optimal robust policy that is deterministic, which is of interest from an interpretability standpoint. We also introduce the robust counterpart of important structural results of classical MDPs, including the maximum principle and Blackwell optimality, and we provide a computational study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating the conservativeness of robust policies.

The compatibility constraints are captured by a fixed bipartite graph between the servers and the task types. When the graph is complete bipartite, the mean-field approximation is accurate. However, such dense compatibility graphs are infeasible for large-scale implementation. We characterize a class of sparse compatibility graphs for which the mean-field approximation remains valid. For this, we introduce a novel notion, called proportional sparsity , and establish that systems with proportionally sparse compatibility graphs asymptotically match the performance of a fully flexible system.

We analyze this question using the stochastic discrete Bass model in which consumers may differ in their individual external influence rates { p j } and in their individual internal influence rates { q j } . When the network is complete and the heterogeneity is only manifested in { p j } or only in { q j } , it always slows down the diffusion, compared with the corresponding homogeneous network. When, however, consumers are heterogeneous in both { p j } and { q j } , heterogeneity slows down the diffusion in some cases but accelerates it in others. Moreover, the dominance between the heterogeneous and homogeneous adoption levels is global in time in some cases but changes with time in others.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a FIPP. In a semimartingale factor model, we show that the FIPP can be recovered as a triplet of processes that admit an integral representation with respect to semimartingales. Using an integrated stochastic factor model, we relate the factor representation of the triplet of processes to the smooth solution of an ill-posed partial integro-differential Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. We develop explicit constructions for the class of time-monotone FIPPs, generalizing existing results from Brownian to semimartingale market models. Funding: L.

  abstract     = {Catering to the incentives of people with limited rationality is a challenging research direction that requires novel paradigms to design mechanisms. Obviously strategy-proof (OSP) mechanisms have recently emerged as the concept of interest to this research agenda. However, the majority of the literature in the area has either highlighted the shortcomings of OSP or focused on the “right” definition rather than on the construction of these mechanisms. Here, we give the first set of tight results on the approximation guarantee of OSP mechanisms for scheduling related machines and a characterization of set system instances for which OSP mechanisms that return optimal solutions exist. By extending the well-known cycle monotonicity technique, we are able to concentrate on the algorithmic component of OSP mechanisms and provide some novel paradigms for their design, when private types belong to a set with few values. In essence, we prove that OSP encompasses careful interleaving of ascending and descending auctions.

  abstract     = {Facet-defining inequalities of the symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP) polytope play a prominent role in both polyhedral TSP research and state-of-the-art TSP solvers. In this paper, we introduce a new class of facet-defining inequalities, the circlet inequalities . These inequalities were first conjectured in Gutekunst and Williamson [Gutekunst SC, Williamson DP (2019) Characterizing the integrality gap of the subtour LP for the circulant traveling salesman problem. SIAM J. Discrete Math. 33(4):2452–2478] when studying the circulant TSP, and they provide a bridge between polyhedral TSP research and number-theoretic investigations of Hamiltonian cycles stemming from a conjecture from Marco Buratti in 2007. The circlet inequalities exhibit circulant symmetry by placing the same weight on all edges of a given length; our main proof exploits this symmetry to prove the validity of the circlet inequalities. We then show that the circlet inequalities are facet-defining and compute their strength following Goemans [Goemans MX (1995) Worst-case comparison of valid inequalities for the TSP. Math. Programming 69:335–349]; they achieve the same worst case strength as the similarly circulant crown inequalities of Naddef and Rinaldi [Naddef D, Rinaldi G (1992) The crown inequalities for the symmetric traveling salesman polytope.

The undiscounted Big Match has been much-studied. Blackwell and Ferguson (1968) give an ε -optimal strategy for player 1 that hides, in each stage, one pebble with a probability that depends on the entire past history. Any strategy that depends on just the clock or just a finite memory is worthless (i.e., cannot guarantee strictly more than the least reward). The long-standing natural open problem has been whether every strategy that depends on just the clock and a finite memory is worthless. The present paper proves that there is such a strategy that is ε -optimal. In fact, we show that just two states of memory are sufficient.},

  abstract     = {We develop provably efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for two-player zero-sum finite-horizon Markov games with simultaneous moves. To incorporate function approximation, we consider a family of Markov games where the reward function and transition kernel possess a linear structure. Both the offline and online settings of the problems are considered. In the offline setting, we control both players and aim to find the Nash equilibrium by minimizing the duality gap. In the online setting, we control a single player playing against an arbitrary opponent and aim to minimize the regret. For both settings, we propose an optimistic variant of the least-squares minimax value iteration algorithm. We show that our algorithm is computationally efficient and provably achieves an O ~ ( d 3 H 3 T ) upper bound on the duality gap and regret, where d is the linear dimension, H the horizon and T the total number of timesteps. Our results do not require additional assumptions on the sampling model. Our setting requires overcoming several new challenges that are absent in Markov decision processes or turn-based Markov games. In particular, to achieve optimism with simultaneous moves, we construct both upper and lower confidence bounds of the value function, and then compute the optimistic policy by solving a general-sum matrix game with these bounds as the payoff matrices. As finding the Nash equilibrium of a general-sum game is computationally hard, our algorithm instead solves for a coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE), which can be obtained efficiently. To our best knowledge, such a CCE-based scheme for optimism has not appeared in the literature and might be of interest in its own right. Funding: Q.

The model accounts for multiple trading periods, or phases, with multiple times at which compliance can occur. At the end of each trading period, the participating firms must surrender allowances for their emissions made during that period, and additional allowances can be used for compliance in the following periods. We show that the multiperiod allowance pricing problem is well-posed for various mechanisms (such as banking, borrowing, and withdrawal of allowances) linking the trading periods. The results are based on the analysis of a forward-backward stochastic differential equation with coupled forward and backward components, a discontinuous terminal condition, and a forward component that is degenerate. We also introduce an infinite-period model for a carbon market with a sequence of compliance times and with no end date. We show that, under appropriate conditions, the value function for the multiperiod pricing problem converges, as the number of periods increases, to a value function for this infinite-period model and that such functions are unique. Finally, we present a numerical example that demonstrates empirically the convergence of the multiperiod pricing problem.

  abstract     = {The Pandora’s Box problem, originally posed by Weitzman in 1979, models selection from a set of random-valued alternatives—the “boxes”—when evaluation is costly. Weitzman showed that the Pandora’s Box problem admits a simple threshold-based solution that considers the options in decreasing order of reservation value, a proxy for the actual value of the boxes in the exploration process. We study for the first time this problem when the order in which the boxes are opened is constrained, forcing the solution to account for both the depth of search, as opening a box gives access to more boxes, and the breadth, as there are many directions to explore. Despite these difficulties, we show that greedy optimal strategies exist and can be efficiently computed for tree-like order constraints. We also prove that finding optimal adaptive search strategies is NP-hard to approximate (up to a certain constant) when certain matroid constraints are applied to further restrict the set of boxes that may be opened or when the order constraints are given as reachability constraints on a directed acyclic graph. We complement this hardness result by giving efficient approximation algorithms, exploiting a low adaptivity gap for a carefully relaxed version of the problem.

This type of financial product was proposed as an instrument for stabilizing the global banking system after the financial crisis. Yet it was recognized early on that these products may create circularity problems in the definition of stock prices—even in the absence of trade. We find that, if conversion thresholds are such that bond holders are indifferent about marginal conversions, there exists a unique equilibrium irrespective of the network structure. When thresholds are lower, the existence of equilibrium breaks down, whereas higher thresholds may lead to multiplicity of equilibria. Moreover, there are complex network effects. One bank’s conversion may trigger further conversions—or prevent them, depending on the constellations of asset values and conversion triggers.},

The goal of the company is to maximize the expected cumulative discounted dividend payouts until bankruptcy or maturity, whichever comes earlier. The company is allowed to buy reinsurance contracts dynamically over the whole time horizon to cede its risk exposure with other reinsurance companies. This is a mixed singular–classical stochastic control problem, and the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation is a variational inequality with a fully nonlinear operator and subject to a gradient constraint. We obtain the C 2 , 1 smoothness of the value function and a comparison principle for its gradient function by the penalty approximation method so that one can establish an efficient numerical scheme to compute the value function. We find that the surplus-time space can be divided into three nonoverlapping regions by a risk-magnitude and time-dependent reinsurance barrier and a time-dependent dividend-payout barrier. The insurance company should be exposed to a higher risk as its surplus increases, be exposed to the entire risk once its surplus upward crosses the reinsurance barrier, and pay out all its reserves exceeding the dividend-payout barrier. The estimated localities of these regions are also provided.

  abstract     = {We study the existence of approximate pure Nash equilibria ( α -PNE) in weighted atomic congestion games with polynomial cost functions of maximum degree d . Previously, it was known that d -PNE always exist, whereas nonexistence was established only for small constants, namely, for 1.153-PNE. We improve significantly upon this gap, proving that such games in general do not have Θ ˜ ( d ) -PNE, which provides the first superconstant lower bound. Furthermore, we provide a black-box gap-introducing method of combining such nonexistence results with a specific circuit gadget, in order to derive NP-completeness of the decision version of the problem. In particular, by deploying this technique, we are able to show that deciding whether a weighted congestion game has an O ˜ ( d ) -PNE is NP-complete. Previous hardness results were known only for the special case of exact equilibria and arbitrary cost functions. The circuit gadget is of independent interest, and it allows us to also prove hardness for a variety of problems related to the complexity of PNE in congestion games. For example, we demonstrate that the question of existence of α -PNE, in which a certain set of players plays a specific strategy profile, is NP-hard for any α &lt; 3 d / 2 , even for unweighted congestion games. Finally, we study the existence of approximate equilibria in weighted congestion games with general (nondecreasing) costs, as a function of the number of players n . We show that n -PNE always exists, matched by an almost tight nonexistence bound of Θ ˜ ( n ) , which we can again transform into an NP-completeness proof for the decision problem.
