  abstract     = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) marks a transformative shift in financial services, harnessing the power of distributed ledger and smart contract technologies. Despite only five years of development, DeFi has rapidly matured, pioneering state-of-the-art financial products, a stratified ecosystem, and a myriad of innovative vertical and horizontal protocol integrations. Its distinctive characteristics establish DeFi as a crucible for innovation, carrying potential to spur advancements across various service sectors. However, the research community has yet to fully explore this burgeoning field. In this manuscript, we navigate the complexities of this emerging service system, analyzing 362 notable Ethereum-based DeFi initiatives. Our study reveals a robust and dynamic growth trajectory, the advent of a multi-tiered ecosystem, and a sophisticated network of primary market investors. We conclude by highlighting promising avenues for future exploration in DeFi and service system research.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare providers often implement quality improvement (QI) practices to improve clinical quality, which may be measured as the extent to which healthcare workers (HCWs) comply with standardized procedures designed for ensuring patient safety. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of QI practices to improve clinical quality varies from facility to facility because of healthcare delivery complexity. In this paper, we consider the contextual complexity and the provider complexity arising from healthcare delivery processes, and we propose an exploratory study based on discrete choice experiments to examine their roles in the relationship between QI practices and clinical quality. By collecting and analyzing data from 320 HCWs at a university hospital in Taiwan, we found that healthcare delivery complexity significantly moderated the effectiveness of QI practices and how they improved clinical quality. We found that the contextual complexity influenced the level of effectiveness of the QI practices, whereas the provider complexity influenced whether a QI practice may be effective or not. We also studied the effect of implementing multiple QI practices simultaneously to counter the provider complexity. We found that implementing more QI practices does not necessarily lead to better outcomes, but implementing the right ones would. Our findings provide healthcare facilities with ex ante insights for designing QI practices to improve clinical quality. Funding: W.

  abstract     = {Because of the informational advantage of online marketplaces (i.e., platforms), it is a common belief that a platform’s market entry will be detrimental to third-party sellers who sell similar products on the platform. To examine the validity of this belief, we conduct an exploratory analysis using the sales data for a single product category provided by JD.com for the month of March 2018. Our analysis reveals an unexpected result. Upon the platform’s entry, third-party sellers who sell similar products can afford to charge a higher price, obtain a higher demand, and earn a higher profit. To provide a plausible explanation for this unexpected exploratory result, we develop a duopoly model that incorporates the changing competitive dynamic before and after the platform’s entry. Specifically, before entry, the platform earns a commission (based on the seller’s revenue), whereas the seller sets its retail price as a monopoly. After entry, the platform earns a profit generated by its direct sales in addition to the commission from the seller. In addition, the seller and the platform operate in a duopoly and engage in a sequential game. By examining the equilibrium outcomes associated with this sequential game, we identify conditions under which the platform’s entry can create a win-win situation for both parties. Specifically, these conditions hold when the platform’s market potential is moderate and when the platform’s entry creates a sufficiently high spillover effect on the seller, providing a plausible explanation for our empirical finding that the seller can benefit from a platform’s entry.

  abstract     = {How should digital service firms design and bundle their offering to capture a large market while seeking differentiation from competition? To answer this question, we consider the most generic model of competition, namely, two symmetric firms competing on price with regard to two (independent or complementary) components with an arbitrary distribution of valuations, without restrictions on their product offering. We show that three outcomes emerge in equilibrium, namely, a full-mixed bundling monopoly , a full-mixed bundling competitive duopoly leading to a price war, and a pure or partial-mixed bundling differentiated duopoly yielding positive profits for both firms. The latter equilibrium is the most plausible because it is the only one that is both trembling-hand perfect and not payoff dominated. We demonstrate the benefits of bundling under competition, thereby explaining the online platforms’ motivation for and success in expanding their offering horizontally. Yet not all products may be offered in equilibrium to avoid direct or indirect competition; hence, competition may lead to a narrower range of products available than a monopoly. Is bundling anticompetitive? It is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it softens price competition by allowing firms to differentiate their offering. On the other hand, it stimulates competition by creating some product overlap.},

  abstract     = {As the fashion industry increasingly embraces artificial intelligence (AI), we investigate how a fast-fashion retailer should choose between using a manual design strategy or an AI-assisted design strategy to enhance existing products. A manual design is a traditional and basic approach that involves human designers only, whereas an AI-assisted design is a more innovative approach that involves both human designers and AI technologies. In this paper, the overall product enhancement is measured by two key attributes: product quality and product trendiness. Product quality can be measured by the product’s longevity as reflected by the quality of the materials and types of fabric and stitching used, where the product’s improvement level can be determined by the retailer in a continuous range. Consequently, the retailer may choose different levels of product quality under different design strategies. The two design approaches also lead to different natures of product trendiness , which is reflected by features such as styles, new materials, and colors, to name just a few. Specifically, we assume that the traditional manual design can predict well how trendy or popular the new product is. Hence, the trendiness attribute under the manual design is deterministic. However, given the uncertain nature of the AI-assisted design technology and the needed coordination between human designers and the adopted technologies, the trendiness of the new product designed under the AI-assisted approach is assumed uncertain. Two sets of designing costs are considered in product enhancement: the fixed design cost that is irrespective of the production volume and the variable marginal cost. Our analysis of the base model highlights the importance of decomposing different costs in determining the optimal design strategy. Specifically, the manual design is preferred when the fixed cost carries more weight, whereas the AI-assisted design is preferred when the marginal cost is a more important factor. Moreover, a higher level of innovation uncertainty under the AI-assisted design gives this strategy an advantage over the manual design. In our extended models, we demonstrate that (1) these results are robust even if the retailer does not have the flexibility to offer the existing product when the AI-assisted design is unpopular, and (2) the relative position of human designers in the two design approaches has an impact on the effects of these costs.

To ensure a more representative customer voice, companies often utilize different strategies to moderate the biases in online reviews. The strategies deployed by many hospitality firms differ dramatically in both how reviews are collected and where they are posted. This study investigates four review-collection strategies of major hospitality companies and analyzes how each strategy affects review ratings and length. We find that the effort required to post a review impacts review characteristics. We show that reviews collected through self-motivation methods tend to be lower rated and longer, whereas reviews solicited from companies through poststay emails tend to exhibit different characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Lockdown policies, such as stay-at-home orders, are known to be effective in controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019. However, concerns over economic burdens of these policies rapidly propelled U.S. states to move toward reopening in the early stage of the pandemic. Decision making in most states has been challenging, especially because of a dearth of quantitative evidence on health gains versus economic burdens of different policies. To assist decision makers, we study the health and economic impacts of various lockdown policies across U.S. states and shed light on policies that are most effective. To this end, we make use of detailed data from 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia on various factors, including number of tests, positive and negative results, hospitalizations, ICU beds and ventilators used, residents’ mobility obtained from cellphone data, and deaths. Our analyses allow quantifying the total cost versus the total quality-adjusted life year (QALY) associated with various lockdown policies. We utilize a compartmental model with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the spread of disease. To calibrate our model separately for each U.S. state, we make use of empirical data on the intensity of intervention policies, age, ratio of Black/Hispanic populations, per capita income, residents’ mobility, and number of daily tests and feed them to a longitudinal mixed-effect model. Finally, we utilize a microsimulation model to estimate the total cost and total QALY for each state and perform cost-effectiveness analysis to identify policies that would have worked best. Our results show that, compared with no intervention during March–June 2020, the policies undertaken across the United States saved, on average, about 41,284.51 years’ worth of QALY (per 100K capita), incurring $164.01 million (per 100K capita). Had the states undertaken more strict policies during the same time frame than those they adopted, these values would be 44,909.41 years and $117.28 million, respectively. By quantifying the impact of various lockdown policies separately for each state, our results allow federal and state authorities to avoid following a “one size fits all” strategy and instead enact policies that are better suited for each state. Specifically, by studying the trade-offs between health gains and economic impacts, we identify the particular states that would have benefited from implementing more restrictive policies. Finally, in addition to shedding light on the impact of lockdown policies during our study period (March–June 2020), our results have important implications on curbing future fast-spreading variants of the coronavirus or other related potential epidemics.

  abstract     = {We consider a physical asset consisting of complex systems, where the systems may require upgrades during the lifetime of the asset. In practice, the asset owner and system supplier can make the upgrade decisions together, requiring a decision-support model that can be jointly used to optimize the total benefit for both parties. Motivated by a real-life use case including an asset owner and a system supplier, we build a continuous-time model to optimize the upgrade decisions of a system during the fixed lifetime of the asset. In our model, we capture the key critical factors that drive the upgrade decisions: increasing functionality requirements due to evolving technology, age-dependent maintenance costs, a predetermined overhaul plan of the asset, and the lifetime of the asset. A system upgrade is less costly if it is executed jointly with an asset overhaul. We first analyze the case with no additional cost of upgrading outside an overhaul. We analytically characterize the structure of the optimal upgrade policy under various realistic assumptions that lead to different types of cost functions. We then use these results as a building block to characterize the optimal policy for a generalized cost function. When there is a penalty for upgrading outside an overhaul moment, we propose a dynamic programming approach that efficiently determines the optimal upgrade policy by using our analytical results. We also prove that as this penalty increases, the optimal policy can only change to one where the number of upgrades not jointly executed with overhauls is reduced. However, the optimal number of upgrades is a nonincreasing function of this penalty. Also, surprisingly, more overhauls may lead to a smaller number of upgrades under the optimal policy.

With technologies (e.g., electronic shelf labels) enabling retailers to change prices easily within each day, should supermarkets use peak-hour pricing? To examine this question formally, we introduce a stylized duopoly model in the presence of “negative externality,” where firms compete for congestion-averse customers. We characterize how customers endogenously segment themselves regarding when and where to shop, and then use the equilibrium outcomes to examine whether the firms should implement peak-hour pricing for varying types of customer flexibility and competitive asymmetry. Our analysis shows that, if customers are not flexible in their store choice, then both firms would always use peak-hour pricing. However, if store choice flexibility is present, then firms’ decisions depend on the competitive asymmetry as follows. If one firm has a clear competitive advantage (in terms of value or price) over the other firm, then the dominant firm will use peak-hour pricing, whereas the other firm will not. Otherwise, both firms will use peak-hour pricing if they engage in symmetric competition (in terms of similar value and price), or neither firm will use it if they engage in differentiated competition (high value versus low cost). Through our analysis of different extensions, we find that a firm’s ability to set its regular price would dampen the effect of peak-period pricing. Also, we obtain consistent results when there is heterogeneity in customer valuation and customer congestion aversion level.

  abstract     = {This study explores the nonlinear modeling of customer satisfaction (CS) and loyalty for resource allocation strategies that promote efficient loyalty programs. We first introduce global models to reflect several important nonlinear characteristics, particularly (a) a saturation-attainable limit of effectiveness, (b) nonconstant marginal returns, and (c) asymmetric responses between satisfied and dissatisfied customers. In the proposed models, we put forth the joint use of two types of mixture models to deal with different levels of heterogeneity. Based on the model best supported among alternatives in the literature, we targeted customers using expected incremental loyalty, which is derived from the joint use of an estimated response curve of loyalty to satisfaction and an empirical distribution of CS scores. Then, we evaluate the efficiency of loyalty programs under the assumption of full and limited access to customers and subsequently derive managerial implications. For instance, through a counterfactual simulation of the models for the three industries, we find that improving the perceived quality in the mobile communication industry may have a greater effect on loyalty than in the hotel and convenience store industries because of its higher switching cost.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the impact of bundled payment policy on healthcare cost, efficiency, quality, and shift of care. Using insurance claim data, we empirically offer a more nuanced understanding of the impact of bundled payment policy on hospital operations and provide new evidence from China. Our evidence suggests that transitioning from fee-for-service to bundled payment reimbursement resulted in declines in treatment costs and length of stay. Along with that decline, there was an increase in planned revisits to outpatient clinics, which indicates a shift of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting, as well as a rise in unplanned revisits, indicating a decline in service quality. The increase in readmission rate to inpatient wards is very small and not statistically significant. In addition, we discuss the design and implementation of bundled payment. Our results imply that careful bundle design is vital to encouraging providers to implement the new program without sacrificing quality.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a matching-and-pricing mechanism for a drivers’ demand-reporting problem in parking-sharing programs in which owners share their private parking slots with drivers. We generate a driver-slot matching solution by a centralized assignment procedure according to the demand and supply information reported by drivers and owners, respectively, and determine truth-telling pricing by the Vickrey-Clark-Grove mechanism. We show that under the assumption that drivers do not know with certainty whether other drivers will show up to compete for the parking slots, the mechanism proposed in this paper induces drivers to truthfully report their private information of the travel plans and guarantees three other desirable properties: participation of drivers and slot owners, optimal system efficiency, and balance of the system’s budget. We further extend these results to two dynamic situations. Finally, the results of the numerical experiments based on real-world data demonstrate the performance of the mechanism.

  abstract     = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led demand for online grocery orders for both click &amp; collect (C&amp;C) and attended home delivery (AHD) to outstrip delivery capacity by a wide margin. In the United Kingdom, the booking systems of some e-retailers could not handle the flood of incoming requests, forcing the retailers to proactively reach out to certain priority customer segments with the aim of serving as many high-priority customers as possible. To determine when to contact each customer segment in this extraordinary demand environment, we investigate the new demand management concept of proactively contacting customers. We first develop a decision policy for the C&amp;C fulfillment method to address the problem of when to contact customers. We then extend this approach to the AHD setting. To cope with increased problem complexity, we propose a three-step procedure to solve this problem. First, we subdivide the delivery area into smaller subareas; second, we select the most promising subareas; and third, we determine which customers to contact within the chosen subareas. To gain managerial insights and to show the practical benefits of our approaches, we apply both approaches to realistic data from the London area. Our results show that proactive customer contacting allows for a tailored allocation of scarce capacity in e-groceries. We conclude with a discussion on how these contacting techniques can be valuable in postcrisis times.

  abstract     = {This paper explores the logistics operations of instant grocery delivery services. Therefore, we introduce the instant delivery problem ( IDP ) to replicate and examine two widely adopted strategies in the rapid delivery market: the personal shopper system (PSS) and the inventory owned delivery (IOD) system. In the PSS, couriers visit affiliated brick-and-mortar stores in the delivery area to pick up and purchase ordered products and then deliver them to customers. In the IOD system, couriers collect products from a single distribution center, or so-called dark store, in which the platform manages the inventory. Even though a PSS strategy is asset light because of the utilization of existing retailers in the area, maintaining a good level of on-time instant deliveries with the PSS is more complex than with IOD. This is because the PSS requires deciding which store to purchase ordered goods from, and picking and shopping at stores needs to be considered in the real-time decision process. We propose a tailored rolling horizon framework that utilizes column generation to browse updated delivery plans for arriving customer orders. Computational studies both in real life–inspired settings and in case studies on selected urban areas show that the PSS is a highly competitive strategy compared with IOD, particularly when dealing with small-sized customer orders. We observe that the performance of the PSS is robust when varying the delivery service time frame. The case studies also suggest that the PSS becomes even more competitive in areas where the retail store density is high.

  abstract     = {A specific service type is applied by most one-way carsharing operators, either station-based or free-floating, which depends on whether users are required to pick up and return vehicles in fixed parking lots. However, both of them have inherent limitations. The station-based carsharing system encounters the weakness of low parking-space utilization, whereas the free-floating system needs to face high parking and relocation costs. To overcome the limitations of single-type carsharing systems, this paper proposes an integrated system to apply the two types in different parts of the service area. A mixed-integer linear-programming model is established to maximize the operator profit, considering both strategic decisions of service type and operational decisions of relocation and trip selection. Despite the fact that the model can be solved by the CPLEX solver, it is limited by excessive memory usage and too long solving time in large-scale cases. To enhance the solving feasibility of the proposed model, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to effectively iterate feasible strategic options and solve the operational subproblem. The numerical results of the case study show that the proposed algorithm can achieve comparable objectives with the CPLEX solver in a much shorter computational time. Through system comparison, the integrated system achieves a larger profit and higher demand-fulfillment rate, compared with the single station-based or free-floating system.
