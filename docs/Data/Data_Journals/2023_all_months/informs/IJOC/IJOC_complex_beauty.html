  abstract     = {Truck platooning technology allows trucks to drive at short headways to save fuel and associated emissions. However, fuel savings from platooning are relatively small, so forming platoons should be convenient and associated with minimum detours and delays. In this paper, we focus on developing optimization technology to form truck platoons. We formulate a mathematical program for the platoon routing problem with time windows (PRP-TW) based on a time–space network. We provide polynomial-time algorithms to solve special cases of PRP-TW with two-truck platoons. Based on these special cases, we build several fast heuristics. An extensive set of numerical experiments shows that our heuristics perform well. Moreover, we show that simple two-truck platoons already capture most of the potential savings of platooning.

  abstract     = {Scheduling frameworks are not necessarily stable. The aim is to introduce schedules resistant to disruptions such as when resources become unavailable, the supply chain for them breaks down, etc. A schedule is robust if it absorbs some level of unforeseen events when at most a certain number of activities are delayed. Taking advantage of constraint programming, we present two new filtering algorithms for a constraint that models cumulative scheduling problems in robust contexts where up to r out of n tasks can be concurrently delayed while keeping the schedule valid. We adapt the overload-checking and edge-finding filtering rules for this framework. We show that our robust versions of these algorithms run in Θ ( r 2 n log ( n ) ) and O ( r 2 z n log ( n ) ) , respectively, where z denotes the number of distinct capacities of all tasks. This achievement implies that the complexities of the state-of-the-art algorithms for these techniques are invariable when r is constant. Experiments illustrate that our algorithms scale, with respect to n and r . As a practical application, the experimental results on a special case of crane assignment problem also verify a stronger filtering for these methods in terms of backtrack numbers as well as computation times when used in conjunction with time tabling. Finally, in order to show that our CP-based algorithms improve to solve a robust scheduling problem, we make a comparison against temporal protection as an external robust scheduling approach.

  abstract     = {The ℓ 0 trend filtering ( ℓ 0 -TF) is a new effective tool for nonparametric regression with the power of automatic knot detection in function values or derivatives. It overcomes the drawback of ℓ 1 -TF that is known to have bias issues. To solve the ℓ 0 -TF problem, we propose an alternating minimization induced active set (AMIAS) search method based on the necessary optimality conditions derived from an augmented Lagrangian framework. The proposed method takes full advantage of the primal and dual variables with complementary supports, and decouples the high-dimensional problem into two subsystems on the active and inactive sets, respectively. A sequential AMIAS algorithm with warm start initialization is developed for efficient determination of the cardinality parameter, along with the output of solution paths. Theoretically, the oracle estimator of ℓ 0 -TF is justified to behave like regression splines under the continuous time setting with mild conditions. Our numerical experiments include simulation studies for comparing ℓ 0 -TF to ℓ 1 -TF and free-knot splines on several synthetic examples, and a real data application of time series segmentation on Hong Kong PM2.5 indexes.

An expression tree is typically used to represent a solution function, which is determined by assigning operators and operands to the nodes. Cozad and Sahinidis propose a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), in which binary variables are used to assign operators and nonlinear expressions are used to propagate data values through nonlinear operators, such as square, square root, and exponential. We extend this formulation by adding new cuts that improve the solution of this challenging MINLP. We also propose a heuristic that iteratively builds an expression tree by solving a restricted MINLP. We perform computational experiments and compare our approach with a mixed-integer program–based method and a neural network–based method from the literature.

  abstract     = {We study an integrated market selection and production planning problem. There is a set of markets with deterministic demand, and each market has a certain revenue that is obtained if the market’s demand is satisfied throughout a planning horizon. The demand is satisfied with a production scheme that has a lot-sizing structure. The problem is to decide on which markets’ demand to satisfy and plan the production simultaneously. We consider both single and multiobjective settings. The single objective problem maximizes the profit, whereas the multiobjective problem includes the maximization of the revenue and the minimization of the production cost objectives. We develop a decomposition-based exact solution algorithm for the single objective setting and show how it can be used in a proposed three-phase algorithm for the multiobjective setting. The master problem chooses a subset of markets, and the subproblem calculates an optimal production plan to satisfy the selected markets’ demand. We investigate the subproblem from a cooperative game theory perspective to devise cuts and strengthen them based on lifting. We also propose a set of valid inequalities and preprocessing rules to improve the proposed algorithm. We test the efficacy of our solution method over a suite of problem instances and show that our algorithm substantially decreases solution times for all problem instances.

It aims at constructing p fully interconnected hubs and links from nodes to hubs so that the longest path between any two nodes is minimized. Existing literature on the p -hub center problem under uncertainty often assumes a joint distribution of travel times, which is difficult (if not impossible) to elicit precisely. In this paper, we bridge the gap by investigating two distributionally robust chance-constrained models that cover, respectively, an existing stochastic one under independent normal distribution and one that is based on the sample average approximation approach as a special case. We derive deterministic reformulations as a mixed-integer program wherein a large number of constraints can be dynamically added via a constraint-generation approach to accelerate computation. Counterparts of our models in the emerging robust satisficing framework are also discussed. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the encouraging out-of-sample performance of our proposed models as well as the effectiveness of the constraint-generation approach.

  abstract     = {A key challenge in inventory management is to identify policies that optimally replenish inventory from multiple suppliers. To solve such optimization problems, inventory managers need to decide what quantities to order from each supplier given the net inventory and outstanding orders so that the expected backlogging, holding, and sourcing costs are jointly minimized. Inventory management problems have been studied extensively for more than 60 years, and yet even basic dual-sourcing problems, in which orders from an expensive supplier arrive faster than orders from a regular supplier, remain intractable in their general form. In addition, there is an emerging need to develop proactive, scalable optimization algorithms that can adjust their recommendations to dynamic demand shifts in a timely fashion. In this work, we approach dual sourcing from a neural network–based optimization lens and incorporate information on inventory dynamics and its replenishment (i.e., control) policies into the design of recurrent neural networks. We show that the proposed neural network controllers (NNCs) are able to learn near-optimal policies of commonly used instances within a few minutes of CPU time on a regular personal computer. To demonstrate the versatility of NNCs, we also show that they can control inventory dynamics with empirical, nonstationary demand distributions that are challenging to tackle effectively using alternative, state-of-the-art approaches. Our work shows that high-quality solutions of complex inventory management problems with nonstationary demand can be obtained with deep neural network optimization approaches that directly account for inventory dynamics in their optimization process. As such, our research opens up new ways of efficiently managing complex, high-dimensional inventory dynamics. History: Accepted by Ram Ramesh, Area Editor for Data Science &amp; Machine Learning.

  abstract     = {We study a pessimistic stochastic bilevel program in the context of sequential two-player games, where the leader makes a binary here-and-now decision, and the follower responds with a continuous wait-and-see decision after observing the leader’s action and revelation of uncertainty. We assume that only the information regarding the mean, covariance, and support is known. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust (DR) two-stage problem. The pessimistic DR bilevel program is shown to be equivalent to a generic two-stage distributionally robust stochastic (nonlinear) program with both a random objective and random constraints under proper conditions of ambiguity sets. Under continuous distributions, using linear decision rule approaches, we construct upper bounds on the pessimistic DR bilevel program based on (1) a 0-1 semidefinite programming (SDP) approximation and (2) an exact 0-1 copositive programming reformulation. When the ambiguity set is restricted to discrete distributions, an exact 0-1 SDP reformulation is developed, and explicit construction of the worst-case distribution is derived. To further improve the computation of the proposed 0-1 SDPs, a cutting-plane framework is developed. Moreover, based on a mixed-integer linear programming approximation, another cutting-plane algorithm is proposed. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches on a facility location problem.

  abstract     = {Presolving has become an essential component of modern mixed integer program (MIP) solvers, both in terms of computational performance and numerical robustness. In this paper, we present P a PILO, a new C++ header-only library that provides a large set of presolving routines for MIP and linear programming problems from the literature. The creation of P a PILO was motivated by the current lack of (a) solver-independent implementations that (b) exploit parallel hardware and (c) support multiprecision arithmetic. Traditionally, presolving is designed to be fast. Whenever necessary, its low computational overhead is usually achieved by strict working limits. P a PILO’s parallelization framework aims at reducing the computational overhead also when presolving is executed more aggressively or is applied to large-scale problems. To rule out conflicts between parallel presolve reductions, P a PILO uses a transaction-based design. This helps to avoid both the memory-intensive allocation of multiple copies of the problem and special synchronization between presolvers. Additionally, the use of Intel’s Threading Building Blocks library aids P a PILO in efficiently exploiting recursive parallelism within expensive presolving routines, such as probing, dominated columns, or constraint sparsification. We provide an overview of P a PILO’s capabilities and insights into important design choices. History: Accepted by Ted Ralphs, Area Editor for Software Tools.

  abstract     = {We introduce a prescriptive machine learning approach to speed up the process of solving mixed-integer convex optimization (MICO) problems. We solve multiple optimization instances and train a machine learning model in advance, which we use to solve new instances. Previous works have shown that the predictions of classification algorithms enable us to solve optimization problems much faster than commercial solvers. What distinguishes this paper from the previous work is that we use a prescriptive algorithm, Optimal Policy Trees (OPT), instead of classification algorithms. Whereas classification algorithms aim to predict the correct label and consider all other labels equally undesirable, a prescriptive approach takes into account all the available decision options and their counterfactuals. We first introduce an algorithm that is purely based on OPT and also its extension. We compare their performance with Optimal Classification Trees (OCT) on various MICO problems. Test problems include transportation optimization, portfolio optimization, facility location, and hybrid vehicle control. We also experiment on real-world instances taken from the Mixed Integer Programming Library. OPT-based methods have a significant edge on finding feasible solutions, whereas OCT-based methods have a slight edge on the degree of suboptimality. The proposed extension of the pure OPT algorithm improves on the suboptimality of the solutions the algorithm produces.

  abstract     = {When designing a patrol route, it is often necessary to pay more attention to locations with high crime rates. In this paper, we study a patrol routing problem for a fleet of patrol cars patrolling a region with a high-crime neighborhood (HCN) consisting of multiple hot spots. Considering the disorder and chaos in the HCN, at least one patrol car is required in the HCN at any given time during the patrol. We call this routing problem the hot spot coverage patrol problem (HSCPP). In the HSCPP, the importance of a patrol location is quantified by a prize, and the prize is collected if a patrol car visits the location. Our objective is to maximize the sum of prizes collected by the patrol cars, obeying all operational requirements. We propose mathematical formulations and develop several solution approaches for the HSCPP. The global approach consists of finding the routing solution for all patrol cars with a single integer programming (IP) formulation. The partition approach involves first partitioning the region geographically and solving the routing problem in each subregion with two IP formulations. Next, we strengthen the partition approach by developing a column generation (CG) approach in which the initial columns of the CG approach are the solutions generated from the partition approach. We conduct a detailed computational case study using instances based on real crime data from Montgomery County, Maryland. To further understand the computational tractability of our solution approaches, we also perform a sensitivity analysis using synthetic instances under various scenarios.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we tackle the resolution of chance-constrained problems reformulated via sample average approximation. The resulting data-driven deterministic reformulation takes the form of a large-scale mixed-integer program (MIP) cursed with Big-Ms. We introduce an exact resolution method for the MIP that combines the addition of a set of valid inequalities to tighten the linear relaxation bound with coefficient strengthening and constraint screening algorithms to improve its Big-Ms and considerably reduce its size. The proposed valid inequalities are based on the notion of k -envelopes and can be computed off-line using polynomial-time algorithms and added to the MIP program all at once. Furthermore, they are equally useful to boost the strengthening of the Big-Ms and the screening rate of superfluous constraints. We apply our procedures to a probabilistically constrained version of the DC optimal power flow problem with uncertain demand. The chance constraint requires that the probability of violating any of the power system’s constraints be lower than some positive threshold. In a series of numerical experiments that involve five power systems of different size, we show the efficiency of the proposed methodology and compare it with some of the best performing convex inner approximations currently available in the literature.

We build on the linear stochastic tracing procedure but introduce logarithmic penalty terms as a regularization device, which brings two major improvements. First, the scope of the method is extended: it now has a convergence guarantee for all games of this class rather than just generic ones. Second, by ensuring a smooth and interior solution path, computational performance is increased significantly. A ready-to-use implementation is publicly available. As demonstrated here, its speed compares quite favorably to other available algorithms, and it allows us to solve games of considerable size in reasonable times. Because the method involves the gradual transformation of a prior into equilibrium strategies, it is possible to search the prior space and uncover potentially multiple equilibria and their respective basins of attraction. This also connects the method to established theory of equilibrium selection. History: Accepted by Antonio Frangioni, Area Editor for Design &amp; Analysis of Algorithms – Continuous.

  abstract     = {This paper develops a cost-effective sequential route recommender system to provide real-time routing recommendations for vacant taxis searching for the next passenger. We propose a prediction-and-optimization framework to recommend the searching route that maximizes the expected profit of the next successful passenger pickup based on the dynamic taxi demand-supply distribution. Specifically, this system features a deep learning-based predictor that dynamically predicts the passenger pickup probability on a road segment and a recursive searching algorithm that recommends the optimal searching route. The predictor integrates a graph convolution network (GCN) to capture the spatial distribution and a long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture the temporal dynamics of taxi demand and supply. The GCN-LSTM model can accurately predict the pickup probability on a road segment with the consideration of potential taxi oversupply. Then, the dynamic distribution of pickup probability is fed into the route optimization algorithm to recommend the optimal searching routes sequentially as route inquiries emerge in the system. The recursion tree-based route optimization algorithm can significantly reduce the computational time and provide the optimal routes within seconds for real-time implementation. Finally, extensive experiments using Beijing Taxi GPS data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed recommender system.

Although such ambiguity sets have great modeling flexibility in characterizing uncertain probability distributions, the corresponding adjustable problems remain computationally intractable and challenging. To overcome this issue, we propose a greedy improvement procedure that consists of solving, via the (extended) linear decision rule approximation, a sequence of tractable subproblems—each of which considers a relaxed and finitely constrained ambiguity set that can be iteratively tightened to the infinitely constrained one. Through three numerical studies of adjustable distributionally robust optimization models, we show that our approach can yield improved solutions in a systematic way for both two-stage and multistage problems.

  abstract     = {A multidepot capacitated vehicle routing problem aims to serve customers’ demands using a fleet of capacitated vehicles located in multiple depots, such that the total travel cost of the vehicles is minimized. We study a variant of this problem, the k -depot split delivery vehicle routing problem (or k -DSDVRP in short), for the situation where each customer’s demand can be served by more than one vehicle, and the total number of depots, denoted by k ≥ 2 , is a fixed constant. This is a challenging problem with broad applications in the logistics industry, for which no constant ratio approximation algorithm is known. We develop a new approximation algorithm for the k -DSDVRP, ensuring an approximation ratio of ( 6 − 4 / k ) and a polynomial running time for any fixed constant k ≥ 2 . To achieve this, we propose a novel solution framework based on a new relaxation of the problem, a cycle splitting procedure, and a vehicle assignment procedure. To further enhance its efficiency for practical usage, we adapt the newly developed approximation algorithm to a heuristic, which runs in polynomial time even when k is arbitrarily large. Experimental results show that this heuristic outperforms a commercial optimization solver and a standard vehicle routing heuristic. Moreover, our newly proposed solution framework can be applied to developing new constant ratio approximation algorithms for several other variants of the k -DSDVRP with k ≥ 2 being a fixed constant.

  abstract     = {The development of a satisfying and rigorous mathematical understanding of the performance of neural networks is a major challenge in artificial intelligence. Against this background, we study the expressive power of neural networks through the example of the classical NP-hard knapsack problem. Our main contribution is a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with rectified linear units that are iteratively applied to each item of a knapsack instance and thereby compute optimal or provably good solution values. We show that an RNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum knapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum knapsack solutions. We also prove the following tradeoff between the size of an RNN and the quality of the computed knapsack solution: for knapsack instances consisting of n items, an RNN of depth five and width w computes a solution of value at least 1 − O ( n 2 / w ) times the optimum solution value. Our results build on a classical dynamic programming formulation of the knapsack problem and a careful rounding of profit values that are also at the core of the well-known fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the knapsack problem. A carefully conducted computational study qualitatively supports our theoretical size bounds. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized to many other combinatorial optimization problems that admit dynamic programming solution methods, such as various shortest path problems, the longest common subsequence problem, and the traveling salesperson problem.

  abstract     = {We propose a new nonconvex regularization scheme to improve the performance of the stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) algorithm for solving large-scale multistage stochastic programs. Specifically, we use a class of nonconvex regularization functions, namely folded concave penalty functions, to improve solution quality and the convergence rate of the SDDP procedure. We develop a strategy based on mixed-integer programming to guarantee global optimality of the nonconvex regularization problem. Moreover, we establish provable convergence guarantees for our customized SDDP algorithm. The benefits of our regularization scheme are demonstrated by solving large-scale instances of two multistage stochastic optimization problems.

We show that the problem can be reformulated as an optimization problem with a convex objective and binary variables. We design an algorithm called OptComplete, based on a novel concept of stochastic cutting planes to enable efficient scaling of the algorithm up to matrices of sizes n = 10 6 and m = 10 6 . We prove that OptComplete converges to an optimal solution of the interpretable matrix completion problem with exponentially vanishing failure probability. We report experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets that show that OptComplete has favorable scaling behavior and accuracy when compared with state-of-the-art methods for other types of matrix completion while providing insight on the factors that affect the matrix.

Because of the complexity and high dimensionality of some data, it is challenging to fit a valid model with high accuracy and interpretability. We propose a novel sparse reduced-rank multinomial logistic regression model to jointly select variables and reduce the dimension via a nonconvex row constraint. We develop a block-wise iterative algorithm with a majorizing surrogate function to efficiently solve the optimization problem. From an algorithmic aspect, we show that the output estimator enjoys consistency in estimation and sparsity recovery even in a high-dimensional setting. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is investigated via simulation studies and two real image data sets.

  abstract     = {Discrete optimal transport problems give rise to very large linear programs (LPs) with a particular structure of the constraint matrix. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm that mixes an interior point method (IPM) and column generation, specialized for the LP originating from the Kantorovich optimal transport problem. Knowing that optimal solutions of such problems display a high degree of sparsity, we propose a column generation–like technique to force all intermediate iterates to be as sparse as possible. The algorithm is implemented nearly matrix-free. Indeed, most of the computations avoid forming the huge matrices involved and solve the Newton system using only a much smaller Schur complement of the normal equations. We prove theoretical results about the sparsity pattern of the optimal solution, exploiting the graph structure of the underlying problem. We use these results to mix iterative and direct linear solvers efficiently in a way that avoids producing preconditioners or factorizations with excessive fill-in and at the same time guaranteeing a low number of conjugate gradient iterations. We compare the proposed method with two state-of-the-art solvers and show that it can compete with the best network optimization tools in terms of computational time and memory use. We perform experiments with problems reaching more than four billion variables and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {We present a new model for finding the optimal placement of electric vehicle charging stations across a multiperiod time frame so as to maximise electric vehicle adoption. Via the use of stochastic discrete choice models and user classes, this work allows for a granular modelling of user attributes and their preferences in regard to charging station characteristics. We adopt a simulation approach and precompute error terms for each option available to users for a given number of scenarios. This results in a bilevel optimisation model that is, however, intractable for all but the simplest instances. Our major contribution is a reformulation into a maximum covering model, which uses the precomputed error terms to calculate the users covered by each charging station. This allows solutions to be found more efficiently than for the bilevel formulation. The maximum covering formulation remains intractable in some instances, so we propose rolling horizon, greedy, and greedy randomised adaptive search procedure heuristics to obtain good-quality solutions more efficiently. Extensive computational results are provided, and they compare the maximum covering formulation with the current state of the art for both exact solutions and the heuristic methods.

We propose the globalized distributionally robust counterpart that disallows any (respectively, allows limited) constraint violation for distributions residing (respectively, not residing) in the ambiguity set. By varying its inputs, our proposal recovers several existing perceptions of parameter uncertainty. Focusing on the type 1 Wasserstein distance, we show that the globalized distributionally robust counterpart has an insightful interpretation in terms of shadow price of globalized robustness , and it can be seamlessly integrated with many popular optimization models under uncertainty without incurring any extra computational cost. Such computational attractiveness also holds for other ambiguity sets, including the ones based on probability metric, optimal transport, ϕ -divergences, or moment conditions, as well as the event-wise ambiguity set. Numerical studies on an adaptive network lot-sizing problem demonstrate the modeling flexibility of our proposal and its emphases on globalized robustness to constraint violation.

We discuss some basic properties of the simplified problem, design a corresponding heuristic for the original problem, and show empirically that this approach yields good quality alignments while significantly reducing the complexity of intermediate diagram transformations.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the hub location problem under interhub link failures, a hub location problem in which activated interhub links may fail with a given probability. Two different optimization models are studied, which construct hub backbone networks protected under interhub link disruptions by imposing that, for each commodity, an additional routing path exists besides its original routing path. Both models consider the minimization of the fixed costs of the activated hubs and interhub links plus the expected value of the routing costs of the original and alternative paths. The first model builds explicitly the alternative routing paths, whereas the second model guarantees that, for each commodity, at least one alternative path exists using a large set of connectivity constraints although the alternative paths are not built explicitly. The results of extensive computational testing allow us to analyze the performance of the two proposed models and to evaluate the extra cost required to design a robust backbone network under interhub link failures. The obtained results support the validity of the proposal. History: Accepted by David Alderson, Area Editor for Network Optimization: Algorithms &amp; Application.

  abstract     = {The security of credit card fraud detection (CCFD) models based on machine learning is important but rarely considered in the existing research. To this end, we propose a black-box attack-based security evaluation framework for CCFD models. Under this framework, the semisupervised learning technique and transfer-based black-box attack are combined to construct two versions of a semisupervised transfer black-box attack algorithm. Moreover, we introduce a new nonlinear optimization model to generate the adversarial examples against CCFD models and a security evaluation index to quantitatively evaluate the security of them. Computing experiments on two real data sets demonstrate that, facing the adversarial examples generated by the proposed attack algorithms, all six supervised models considered largely lose their ability to identify the fraudulent transactions, whereas the two unsupervised models are less affected. This indicates that the CCFD models based on supervised machine learning may possess substantial security risks. In addition, the evaluation results for the security of the models generate important managerial implications that help banks reasonably evaluate and enhance the model security.

  abstract     = {Stochastic programming involves large-scale optimization with exponentially many scenarios. This paper proposes an optimization-based scenario reduction approach to generate high-quality solutions and tight lower bounds by only solving small-scale instances, with a limited number of scenarios. First, we formulate a scenario subset selection model that optimizes the recourse approximation over a pool of solutions. We provide a theoretical justification of our formulation, and a tailored heuristic to solve it. Second, we propose a scenario assortment optimization approach to compute a lower bound—hence, an optimality gap—by relaxing nonanticipativity constraints across scenario “bundles.” To solve it, we design a new column-evaluation-and-generation algorithm, which provides a generalizable method for optimization problems featuring many decision variables and hard-to-estimate objective parameters. We test our approach on stochastic programs with continuous and mixed-integer recourse. Results show that (i) our scenario reduction method dominates scenario reduction benchmarks, (ii) our scenario assortment optimization, combined with column-evaluation-and-generation, yields tight lower bounds, and (iii) our overall approach results in stronger solutions, tighter lower bounds, and faster computational times than state-of-the-art stochastic programming algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We consider a class of integer linear programs (IPs) that arise as discretizations of trust-region subproblems of a trust-region algorithm for the solution of control problems, where the control input is an integer-valued function on a one-dimensional domain and is regularized with a total variation term in the objective, which may be interpreted as a penalization of switching costs between different control modes. We prove that solving an instance of the considered problem class is equivalent to solving a resource-constrained shortest-path problem (RCSPP) on a layered directed acyclic graph. This structural finding yields an algorithmic solution approach based on topological sorting and corresponding run-time complexities that are quadratic in the number of discretization intervals of the underlying control problem, the main quantifier for the size of a problem instance. We also consider the solution of the RCSPP with an A* algorithm. Specifically, the analysis of a Lagrangian relaxation yields a consistent heuristic function for the A* algorithm and a preprocessing procedure, which can be employed to accelerate the A* algorithm for the RCSPP without losing optimality of the computed solution. We generate IP instances by executing the trust-region algorithm on several integer optimal control problems. The numerical results show that the accelerated A* algorithm and topological sorting outperform a general-purpose IP solver significantly. Moreover, the accelerated A* algorithm is able to outperform topological sorting for larger problem instances. We also give computational evidence that the performance of the superordinate trust-region algorithm may be improved if it is initialized with a solution obtained with the combinatorial integral approximation.},

  abstract     = {Patient scheduling is a difficult task involving stochastic factors, such as the unknown arrival times of patients. Similarly, the scheduling of radiotherapy for cancer treatments needs to handle patients with different urgency levels when allocating resources. High-priority patients may arrive at any time, and there must be resources available to accommodate them. A common solution is to reserve a flat percentage of treatment capacity for emergency patients. However, this solution can result in overdue treatments for urgent patients, a failure to fully exploit treatment capacity, and delayed treatments for low-priority patients. This problem is especially severe in large and crowded hospitals. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based approach for online dynamic radiotherapy scheduling that dynamically adapts the present scheduling decision based on each incoming patient and the current allocation of resources. Our approach is based on a regression model trained to recognize the links between patients’ arrival patterns and their ideal waiting time in optimal off-line solutions when all future arrivals are known in advance. When our prediction-based approach is compared with flat-reservation policies, it does a better job of preventing overdue treatments for emergency patients and also maintains comparable waiting times for the other patients. We also demonstrate how our proposed approach supports explainability and interpretability in scheduling decisions using Shapley additive explanation values.},

  abstract     = {Constraint programming (CP) has been recently in the spotlight after new CP-based procedures have been incorporated into state-of-the-art solvers, most notably the CP Optimizer from IBM. Classical CP solvers were only capable of guaranteeing the optimality of a solution, but they could not provide bounds for the integer feasible solutions found if interrupted prematurely due to, say, time limits. New versions, however, provide bounds and optimality guarantees, effectively making CP a viable alternative to more traditional mixed-integer programming (MIP) models and solvers. We capitalize on these developments and conduct a computational evaluation of MIP and CP models on 12 select scheduling problems.1 We carefully chose these 12 problems to represent a wide variety of scheduling problems that occur in different service and manufacturing settings. We also consider basic and well-studied simplified problems. These scheduling settings range from pure sequencing (e.g., flow shop and open shop) or joint assignment-sequencing (e.g., distributed flow shop and hybrid flow shop) to pure assignment (i.e., parallel machine) scheduling problems. We present MIP and CP models for each variant of these problems and evaluate their performance over 17 relevant and standard benchmarks that we identified in the literature. The computational campaign encompasses almost 6,623 experiments and evaluates the MIP and CP models along five dimensions of problem characteristics, objective function, decision variables, input parameters, and quality of bounds. We establish the areas in which each one of these models performs well and recognize their conceivable reasons. The obtained results indicate that CP sets new limits concerning the maximum problem size that can be solved using off-the-shelf exact techniques.},

  abstract     = {The value at risk (VaR) and the conditional value at risk (CVaR) are two popular risk measures to hedge against the uncertainty of data. In this paper, we provide a computational toolbox for solving high-dimensional sparse linear regression problems under either VaR or CVaR measures, the former being nonconvex and the latter convex. Unlike the empirical risk (neutral) minimization models in which the overall losses are decomposable across data, the aforementioned risk-sensitive models have nonseparable objective functions so that typical first order algorithms are not easy to scale. We address this scaling issue by adopting a semismooth Newton-based proximal augmented Lagrangian method of the convex CVaR linear regression problem. The matrix structures of the Newton systems are carefully explored to reduce the computational cost per iteration. The method is further embedded in a majorization–minimization algorithm as a subroutine to tackle the nonconvex VaR-based regression problem. We also discuss an adaptive sieving strategy to iteratively guess and adjust the effective problem dimension, which is particularly useful when a solution path associated with a sequence of tuning parameters is needed. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. In particular, they are about 53 times faster than the commercial package Gurobi for the CVaR-based sparse linear regression with 4,265,669 features and 16,087 observations.},

  abstract     = {Personalized points-of-interest (POI) recommendation is very important for improving the service quality of location-based social network applications. It has become one of the most popular research directions in the industry and academia. However, the realization of high-quality personalized POI recommendation faces three major challenges: (i) the interest drift issue caused by the spatiotemporal dynamics of user check-in behavior, (ii) how to integrate as much heterogeneous information as possible to alleviate data sparseness and cold start issues, and (iii) how to use implicit feedback to model complex high-order nonlinear user-POI interactions. To jointly address all these challenges, we propose the TGVx recommendation framework and establish a dynamic personalized POI deep recommendation model, where T and G respectively represent time and geographic factors, V represents out-of-town visitors, and x represents time slot number. TGVx is composed of x parallel TGV models where the TG module mines high-order nonlinear user-POI interaction relationships and integrates multisource heterogeneous information, and the V module transfers the check-in records of out-of-town visitors in hometowns and generates pseudo check-in records in the target city. Technically, we design a new unsupervised deep learning network T-SemiDAE for the TG module. We built a POI-word heterogeneous network for the V module and used graph embedding technology to match the most similar POIs across cities and transfer check-in records. The experimental results on the actual datasets show that the TGVx model is always better than other advanced models in terms of accuracy and diversity for local and out-of-town recommendation scenarios. Compared with the best baseline model semi-deep auto-encoder with a conditional layer the average improvement rates of accuracy and diversity of TGVx are 17.1\% to 58.6\% and 2.25\% to 28.86\%, respectively. In theory, our research effectively uses data science and analysis methods to design a recommender system. In practice, our research is motivated by practical problems, and the research results have high practical promotion value.},

We assume the preference information in the form of holistic assignment examples derived from the analysis of alternatives’ performance vectors and textual descriptions. We characterize the decision policies using a mixture of threshold-based, value-driven preference models and associated latent topics. The latter serve as the stimuli underlying the contingency in decision behavior. Such a probabilistic model is constructed by using a flexible and nonparametric Bayesian framework. The proposed method adopts a hierarchical Dirichlet process as the prior so that a group of DMs can share a countably infinite number of contingent models and topics. For all DMs, it automatically identifies the components representing their evaluation strategies adequately. The posterior is summarized by using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling method. We demonstrate the method’s practical usefulness in a real-world recruitment problem considered by a Chinese IT company. We also compare the approach with counterparts that use a single preference model, implement the parametric framework, or consider each DM’s preferences individually. The results indicate that our approach performs favorably in both interpreting DMs’ contingent decision behavior and recommending decisions on new alternatives. Furthermore, the approach’s performance and robustness are investigated through a computational experiment involving real-world data sets.},

  abstract     = {Imbalanced classification is widely referred in many real-world applications and has been extensively studied. Most existing algorithms consider alleviating the imbalance by sampling or guiding ensemble learners with punishments. The combination of ensemble learning and sampling strategy at class level has achieved great progress. Actually, specific hard examples have little benefit for model learning and even degrade the performance. From the view of identifying classification difficulty of samples, one important motivation is to design algorithms to finely equip different samples with progressive learning. Unfortunately, how to perfectly configure the sampling and learning strategies under ensemble principles at the sample level remains a research gap. In this paper, we propose a new view from the sample level rather than class level in existing studies. We design an ensemble approach in pipe with sample-level gradient resampling, that is, balanced cascade with filters (BCWF). Before that, as a preliminary exploration, we first design a hard examples mining algorithm to explore the gradient distribution of classification difficulty of samples and identify the hard examples. Specifically, BCWF uses an under-sampling strategy and a boosting manner to train T predictive classifiers and reidentify hard examples. In BCWF, moreover, we design two types of filters: the first is assembled with a hard filter (BCWF_h), whereas the second is assembled with a soft filter (BCWF_s). In each round of boosting, BCWF_h strictly removes a gradient/set of the hardest examples from both classes, whereas BCWF_s removes a larger number of harder and easy examples simultaneously for final balanced-class retention. Consequently, the well-trained T predictive classifiers can be used with two ensemble voting strategies: average probability and majority vote. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct intensive experiments on 10 benchmark data sets and apply our algorithms to perform default user detection on a real-world peer to peer lending data set. The experimental results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and the managerial implications of our approach when compared with 11 competitive algorithms.},

Following the penalty function approach, we handle these constrained optimization problems by solving a series of unconstrained optimization subproblems with fixed containers. The proposed algorithm relies on a two-phase search strategy that combines a thresholding search method reinforced by two general-purpose perturbation operators and a container adjustment method. The performance of the algorithm is assessed relative to a large number of benchmark instances widely studied in the literature. Computational results show a high performance of the algorithm on both problems compared with the state-of-the-art results. For circle packing, the algorithm improves 156 best-known results (new upper bounds) in the range of 2≤N≤400 and matches 242 other best-known results. For sphere packing, the algorithm improves 66 best-known results in the range of 2≤N≤200, whereas matching the best-known results for 124 other instances. Experimental analyses are conducted to shed light on the main search ingredients of the proposed algorithm consisting of the two-phase search strategy, the mixed perturbation and the parameters.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a prediction model of the optimal dual variables for the cutting stock problem. For this purpose, we first analyze the influence of different attributes on the optimal dual variables within an instance for the cutting stock problem. We apply and compare our predictions in a stabilization technique for column generation. In most studies, the parameters for stabilized column generation are determined by numerical tests, that is, the same problem is solved several times with different settings. We develop two learning algorithms that predict the best algorithm configuration based on the predicted optimal dual variables and thus omit the numerical study. Our extensive computational study shows the tradeoff between the learning algorithms using full and sparse instance information. We show that both algorithms can efficiently predict the optimal dual variables and dominate the common update mechanism in a generic stabilized column generation approach. Although the learning algorithm with full instance information is applicable when one has to solve the problem mainly for a fixed set of items, the algorithm with sparse instance information is applicable when there is more variability in the number of items between the different instances.},

  abstract     = {In the era of big data, people benefit from the existence of tremendous amounts of information. However, availability of said information may pose great challenges. For instance, one big challenge is how to extract useful yet succinct information in an automated fashion. As one of the first few efforts, keyword extraction methods summarize an article by identifying a list of keywords. Many existing keyword extraction methods focus on the unsupervised setting, with all keywords assumed unknown. In reality, a (small) subset of the keywords may be available for a particular article. To use such information, we propose a rigorous probabilistic model based on a semisupervised setup. Our method incorporates the graph-based information of an article into a Bayesian framework via an informative prior so that our model facilitates formal statistical inference, which is often absent from existing methods. To overcome the difficulty arising from high-dimensional posterior sampling, we develop two Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms based on Gibbs samplers and compare their performance using benchmark data. We use a false discovery rate (FDR)-based approach for selecting the number of keywords, whereas the existing methods use ad hoc threshold values. Our numerical results show that the proposed method compared favorably with state-of-the-art methods for keyword extraction.},

Recent literature has explored the use of a single neural network to model either uncertain or complex elements within an objective function. However, it is well known that ensembles of neural networks produce more stable predictions and have better generalizability than models with single neural networks, which motivates the investigation of ensembles of neural networks rather than single neural networks in decision-making pipelines. We study how to incorporate a neural network ensemble as the objective function of an optimization model and explore computational approaches for the ensuing problem. We present a mixed-integer linear program based on existing popular big-M formulations for optimizing over a single neural network. We develop a two-phase approach for our model that combines preprocessing procedures to tighten bounds for critical neurons in the neural networks with a Lagrangian relaxation-based branch-and-bound approach. Experimental evaluations of our solution methods suggest that using ensembles of neural networks yields more stable and higher quality solutions, compared with single neural networks, and that our optimization algorithm outperforms (the adaption of) a state-of-the-art approach in terms of computational time and optimality gaps.},

The presence of complicated stochastic structure, such as the involvement of infinite-dimensional continuous-time stochastic processes, may cause the exact simulation of the system to be costly or even impossible. On the other hand, for a complicated system, one can sometimes construct a sequence of approximations at different resolutions, where the sequence has finer and finer approximation resolution but higher and higher cost to simulate. With the goal of optimizing the complicated system, we propose algorithms that strategically use the approximations with increasing resolution and higher simulation cost to construct stochastic gradients and perform gradient search in the decision space. To accommodate scenarios where approximations cause discontinuities and lead path-wise gradient estimators to have an uncontrollable bias, stochastic gradients for the proposed algorithms are constructed through finite difference. As a theory support, we prove algorithm convergence, convergence rate, and optimality of algorithm design under the assumption that the objective function for the complicated system is strongly convex, whereas no such assumptions are imposed on the approximations of the complicated system. We then present a multilevel version of the proposed algorithms to further improve convergence rates, when in addition the sequence of approximations can be naturally coupled.},

However, existing followee recommendation methods neglect to consider contextual engagement by only relying on users’ general preferences. In the light of the chronological characteristic of the user’s following behavior, we draw on the engagement theory and propose an interpretable algorithm, namely preference-engagement latent Dirichlet allocation (PE-LDA), which integrates users’ contextual engagements with their general preferences for followee recommendation. Specifically, we suggest that if engaged in the current interest, a user will be more likely to select a followee relevant to that interest. If not, the user tends to select a followee according to their general preference. To implement this framework, we extend the original LDA by (1) introducing an indicator to represent whether the user is engaged in the current interest or not and (2) allowing a potential dependency between a user’s successive interests to describe the condition of contextual engagement. We conduct extensive experiments using a real-world Twitter data set. Results demonstrate the superior performance of PE-LDA compared with several existing methods.},

Adapting legacy networks to the latest technology requires synchronized technicians responsible for migrating the equipment. The goal of the network migration problem is to find an optimal plan for this process. This is a defining step in the customer acquisition of telecommunications service suppliers, and its outcome directly impacts the network owners’ purchasing behavior. We propose the first exact method for the network migration problem, a logic-based Benders decomposition approach that benefits from a hybrid constraint programming–based column generation in its master problem and a constraint programming model in its subproblem. This integrated solution technique is applicable to any integer programming problem with similar structure, most notably the vehicle routing problem with node synchronization constraints. Comprehensive evaluation of our method over instances based on six real networks demonstrates the computational efficiency of the algorithm in obtaining quality solutions. We also show the merit of each incorporated optimization paradigm in achieving this performance.},

We first prove that these problems are NP-hard even when the feasible sets consist either of all spanning trees or of all s – t paths. Given this hardness, we propose an exact solution algorithm combining integer programming formulations with a cutting plane algorithm, identifying the cases where the separation problem can be solved efficiently. We also propose a conservative approximation and show its equivalence to the affine decision rule approximation in the context of Euclidean distances.

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, GPS-enabled traffic applications such as Google Maps and Waze have become ubiquitous and have had a significant influence on billions of daily commuters’ travel patterns. A consequence of the online route suggestions of such applications, for example, via greedy routing, has often been an increase in traffic congestion since the induced travel patterns may be far from the system optimum. Spurred by the widespread impact of traffic applications on travel patterns, this work studies online traffic routing in the context of capacity-constrained parallel road networks and analyzes this problem from two perspectives. First, we perform a worst-case analysis to identify the limits of deterministic online routing. Although we find that deterministic online algorithms achieve finite, problem/instance-dependent competitive ratios in special cases, we show that for a general setting the competitive ratio is unbounded. This result motivates us to move beyond worst-case analysis. Here, we consider algorithms that exploit knowledge of past problem instances and show how to design data-driven algorithms whose performance can be quantified and formally generalized to unseen future instances. We then present numerical experiments based on an application case for the San Francisco Bay Area to evaluate the performance of the proposed data-driven algorithms compared with the greedy algorithm and two look-ahead heuristics with access to additional information on the values of time and arrival time parameters of users. Our results show that the developed data-driven algorithms outperform commonly used greedy online-routing algorithms. Furthermore, our work sheds light on the interplay between data availability and achievable solution quality.},

The current literature lacks a characterization of decomposition strategies and a systematic investigation of their impact when integrated into state-of-the-art heuristics. This paper fills this gap: We discuss the main characteristics of decomposition techniques in vehicle routing heuristics, highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and derive a set of desirable properties. Through an extensive numerical campaign, we investigate the impact of decompositions within two algorithms for the capacitated vehicle routing problem: the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search of Pisinger and Ropke (2007) and the Hybrid Genetic Search of Vidal et al. (2012). We evaluate the quality of popular decomposition techniques from the literature and propose new strategies. We find that route-based decomposition methods, which define subproblems by means of the customers contained in selected subsets of the routes of a given solution, generally appear superior to path-based methods, which merge groups of customers to obtain smaller subproblems. The newly proposed decomposition barycenter clustering achieves the overall best performance and leads to significant gains compared with using the algorithms without decomposition.},

  abstract     = {Computing Bayesian Nash equilibrium strategies in auction games is a challenging problem that is not well-understood. Such equilibria can be modeled as systems of nonlinear partial differential equations. It was recently shown that neural pseudogradient ascent (NPGA), an implementation of simultaneous gradient ascent via neural networks, converges to a Bayesian Nash equilibrium for a wide variety of symmetric auction games. Whereas symmetric auction models are widespread in the theoretical literature, in most auction markets in the field, one can observe different classes of bidders having different valuation distributions and strategies. Asymmetry of this sort is almost always an issue in real-world multiobject auctions, in which different bidders are interested in different packages of items. Such environments require a different implementation of NPGA with multiple interacting neural networks having multiple outputs for the different allocations in which the bidders are interested. In this paper, we analyze a wide variety of asymmetric auction models. Interestingly, our results show that we closely approximate Bayesian Nash equilibria in all models in which the analytical Bayes–Nash equilibrium is known. Additionally, we analyze new and larger environments for which no analytical solution is known and verify that the solution found approximates equilibrium closely. The results provide a foundation for generic equilibrium solvers that can be used in a wide range of auction games.},

PyNumero’s design enables efficient, parallel algorithm development using high-level Python syntax while keeping expensive numerical calculations in fast, compiled implementations based on languages like C and Fortran. To demonstrate the utility of PyNumero, we also present Parapint, a Python package built on PyNumero for parallel solution of dynamic optimization problems. Parapint includes a parallel interior-point solver based on Schur-Complement decomposition. We illustrate the effectiveness of PyNumero for developing parallel algorithms with both code examples and scalability analyses for parallel matrix-vector dot products, parallel solution of structured systems of linear equations using Schur-Complement decomposition, and the parallel solution of a two-dimensional PDE optimal control problem. Our numerical results show nearly perfect scaling to more than 1,000 cores for large matrix-vector dot products and structured linear systems. Moreover, we obtain more than 354 times speedup for the optimal control example.},

  abstract     = {We consider the two bar charts packing problem (2-BCPP), a recent combinatorial optimization problem whose aim is to pack a set of one-dimensional items into the minimum number of bins. As opposed to the well-known bin packing problem, pairs of items are grouped to form bar charts, and a solution is only feasible if the first and second items of every bar chart are packed in consecutive bins. After providing a complete picture of the connections between the 2-BCPP and other relevant packing problems, we show how we can use these connections to derive valid lower and upper bounds for the problem. We then introduce two new integer linear programming (ILP) models to solve the 2-BCPP based on a nontrivial extension of the arcflow formulation. Even though both models involve an exponential number of constraints, we show that they can be solved within a constraint generation framework. We then empirically evaluate the performance of our bounds and exact approaches against an ILP model from the literature and demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on both benchmarks inspired by the literature and new classes of instances that are specifically designed to be hard to solve. The outcomes of our experiments are important for the packing community because they indicate that arcflow formulations can be used to solve targeted packing problems with precedence constraints and also that some of these formulations can be solved with constraint generation.},

  abstract     = {We present a solution framework for general alternating current optimal power flow (AC OPF) problems that include discrete decisions. The latter occur, for instance, in the context of the curtailment of renewables or the switching of power-generation units and transmission lines. Our approach delivers globally optimal solutions and is provably convergent. We model AC OPF problems with discrete decisions as mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs). The solution method starts from a known framework that uses piecewise linear relaxations. These relaxations are modeled as mixed-integer linear programs and adaptively refined until some termination criterion is fulfilled. In this work, we extend and complement this approach by problem-specific as well as very general algorithmic enhancements. In particular, these are mixed-integer second order cone programs as well as primal and dual cutting planes. For example, objective and no-good cuts help to compute good feasible solutions in which outer approximation constraints tighten the relaxations. We present extensive numerical results for various AC OPF problems in which discrete decisions play a major role. Even for hard instances with a large proportion of discrete decisions, the method is able to generate high-quality solutions efficiently. Furthermore, we compare our approach with state-of-the-art MINLP solvers. Our method outperforms all other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Worldwide epidemics, such as corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), cause unprecedented challenges for society and its healthcare systems. Governments attempt to mitigate those challenges by either reducing healthcare demand (“flattening the curve” by imposing restrictions, e.g., on travel or social gatherings) or by increasing healthcare capacity, for example, by canceling elective procedures or setting up field hospitals. To implement these mitigation procedures efficiently, accurate and timely forecasts of the epidemic’s progression are necessary. In this paper, we develop an innovative forecasting methodology based on the ideas of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. LSTM models are shown to outperform traditional forecasting models, especially when the relationship between input and output is complex and not available in closed form. However, whereas LSTM models perform well for data that changes dynamically over time, one shortcoming is that they are not directly applicable when the data also includes static, nontemporal components. In this work, we propose an LSTM+ model that overcomes this limitation. Our model leverages a private partnership with a mobile data company in order to capture population mobility (using mobility indices derived from mobile device data), which allows us to anticipate an epidemic’s spread early and accurately. In addition, we also leverage a public partnership with a consortium of hospitals. Using hospital admissions (rather than, say, positive caseload) results in an unbiased measure of the severity of an epidemic because patients seek and are admitted to hospital care only when symptoms worsen beyond a critical point. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on forecasting COVID-19 for a major U.S. metropolitan area where it has aided decision makers of the emergency policy group. Our model improves the predictive accuracy of hospital admission by a factor of 2.5× as compared with competing models in the same analytical space.},

  abstract     = {Intensive care units (ICUs) are crucial resources within hospitals, caring for the most critically ill patients. We propose a novel modeling framework that improves the outflow of ICU patients by anticipating unit interactions and resource sharing within the system. Across an arbitrary bipartite network of units, we consider two types of downstream staffing (baseline and flexible) and a two-stage decision process. In the first stage, we determine the level of flexible bed staffing using existing physical beds at downstream units in anticipation of incoming transfers from the ICUs. In the second stage, we determine the allocation of ICU patients to downstream beds. The goal of the model is to reduce inefficiencies and transfer delays causing ICU bed block due to lack of space in downstream units. We formulate a dynamic multiperiod model and analyze the dual of its (relaxed) stationary counterpart. Decomposing the relaxed stationary model into an ICU and downstream subproblems, we calculate the relative values of downstream beds and derive a practical acuity-based policy for the daily operational decisions. Using a large-scale simulation calibrated with historic hospital data, we demonstrate that our acuity-based policy reduces the number of long-run diverted ICU arrivals, particularly in high-demand scenarios, thus improving ICU throughput, when compared with a deterministic, a generalized randomized-most-idle, and static policies.},

  abstract     = {We consider performing simulation experiments in the presence of covariates. Here, covariates refer to some input information other than system designs to the simulation model that can also affect the system performance. To make decisions, decision makers need to know the covariate values of the problem. Traditionally in simulation-based decision making, simulation samples are collected after the covariate values are known; in contrast, as a new framework, simulation with covariates starts the simulation before the covariate values are revealed and collects samples on covariate values that might appear later. Then, when the covariate values are revealed, the collected simulation samples are directly used to predict the desired results. This framework significantly reduces the decision time compared with the traditional way of simulation. In this paper, we follow this framework and suppose there are a finite number of system designs. We adopt the metamodel of stochastic kriging (SK) and use it to predict the system performance of each design and the best design. The goal is to study how fast the prediction errors diminish with the number of covariate points sampled. This is a fundamental problem in simulation with covariates and helps quantify the relationship between the offline simulation efforts and the online prediction accuracy. Particularly, we adopt measures of the maximal integrated mean squared error (IMSE) and integrated probability of false selection (IPFS) for assessing errors of the system performance and the best design predictions. Then, we establish convergence rates for the two measures under mild conditions. Last, these convergence behaviors are illustrated numerically using test examples.},

Standard benchmarks include unrealistic scenarios in which all the flights move toward a common point or completely random generated instances. There is a lack of a common set of test instances that allows comparison of the available methods under a variety of heterogeneous and representative scenarios. We present a flight deconfliction benchmark generator that allows the user to choose between (i) different predefined scenario inspired by existing benchmarks in the literature; (ii) pseudo-random traffic meeting certain congestion measurements; (iii) and randomly generated traffic. The proposed setting can account for different levels of difficulty in the deconfliction of the aircraft and allows to explore and compare the real limitations of optimization approaches for aircraft conflict resolution.},
