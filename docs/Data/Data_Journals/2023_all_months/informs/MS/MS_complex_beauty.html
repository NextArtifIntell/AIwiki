  abstract     = {This study examines how electric utilities and regulators can encourage residential consumers to conserve electricity during the hottest summer days and shift electricity load from the day to off-peak, nighttime hours. We analyze a two-year field experiment involving 280 Texas households that explores approaches to conservation and load-shifting to enable emission reductions and reduce generation costs. Our critical peak pricing intervention reduces electricity consumption by 14\% on the peak hours of the hottest days, leading to greenhouse gas emission reductions of about 16\%. A key contribution of this study is the use of high-frequency appliance-level data. We show that 74\% of the critical peak response is from reducing air conditioning. In a complementary nighttime pilot program, consumers respond strongly to lower prices by programming the timing of electric vehicle charging. Our work highlights how automation can influence the consumer tradeoffs relating to effort costs, discomfort, monetary incentives, and warm glow.

However, firms with a strong environmental profile experience lower selling pressure on their bonds and stocks, although their fundamentals weakened following disasters.

  abstract     = {In a 2010 special report, The Economist magazine termed the resurgence of state-owned, publicly listed enterprises “Leviathan Inc.” and criticized the poor governance and low efficiency of these firms. We compile a new comprehensive data set of state ownership of publicly listed firms in 44 countries over the period of 2004–2017 and show that state-owned enterprises are more responsive to environmental issues. The effect is more pronounced in economies lacking energy security and strong environmental regulation, and among firms with more local operations and higher domestic government ownership. We find a similar effect on corporate social engagement but not on governance quality. These results suggest a different role for “Leviathan Inc.,” especially in dealing with environmental externalities.

  abstract     = {Is it feasible to build desalination plants for the coproduction of salt and fresh water from U.S. seawater that could lead to a restructuring of supply chains for salt imports? As it is predicted that climate change will increase water stress worldwide, an increasing number of countries are using desalination plants to generate fresh water. In most such cases, residual concentrates must be disposed of, and the disposal cost is increasing as countries are becoming more environmentally conscious. Selective salt recovery can help to alleviate this issue as it reduces the need for concentrate disposal and generates additional revenue. To gain some insights into the costs and benefits of coproduction plants, we have collected data on current desalination practices and salt imports in the United States along with the manufacturing costs and energy requirements for coproduction plants. We have used this data to build an optimization model to determine an optimal number and location of coproduction plants in the United States and their potential markets for the sale of coproduced salt. In our analysis, we consider a different total number of coproduction facilities, and for each configuration, we evaluate the resulting net water cost and carbon emissions impact. Our results indicate that there exists the potential for building several coproduction plants in the United States that would be both financially competitive with existing desalination plants and lead to a reduction in carbon emissions. This information might be of use to both governments and businesses when they make decisions about the type of desalination facilities built and the implemented “polluter pays” policies.

  abstract     = {Globally, 1.5 billion people live off the grid, with their only access to electricity often limited to operationally expensive fossil fuel generators. Solar power has risen as a sustainable and less costly option, but its generation is variable during the day and nonexistent at night. Thanks to recent technological advances, which have made large-scale electricity storage economically viable, a combination of solar generation and storage holds the promise of cheaper, greener, and more reliable off-grid power in the future. Still, it is not yet well understood how to jointly determine optimal capacity levels for renewable generation and storage. Our work aims to shed light on this question by developing a model of strategic capacity investment in both renewable generation and storage to match demand with supply in off-grid use cases while relying on fossil fuel as backup. Despite the complexity of the underlying model, we are able to extract two general results. First, we find that solar capacity and storage capacity are strategic complements, except in cases with very high investment in generation capacity, when they surprisingly turn into strategic substitutes with implications for long-term investment decisions. Second, we develop a simple heuristic to determine which storage technology, within a given portfolio, can turn a profit in the broadest set of market conditions and thus, is likely to be adopted first. We find that currently, low-efficiency, cheap technologies, such as thermal, can more easily turn a profit in off-grid applications than high-efficiency, expensive ones, such as lithium-ion batteries. We then develop two newsvendor-like approximations of the general model that are analytically tractable, yield precise values for the optimal investment decisions and profit in some cases, and provide bounds to the optimal investment decisions and profits in all other cases. To conclude, we calibrate our models to measure the accuracy of our solutions utilizing real-life data from three geographically-diverse islands, and then, we use our approximations to provide high-level insights on the role that large-scale storage will play in the years ahead as technology improves, carbon taxes are levied, and solar becomes cheaper.

  abstract     = {Many countries have adopted payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs to reduce deforestation. Empirical evaluations find such programs, which pay forest owners to conserve forest, can lead to anywhere from no impact to a 50\% reduction in deforestation level. To better understand the potential effectiveness of PES contracts, we use a principal–agent model, in which the agent has an observable amount of initial forest land and a privately known baseline conservation level. Commonly used conditional contracts perform well when the environmental value of forest is sufficiently high or sufficiently low, but can do arbitrarily poorly compared with the optimal contract for intermediate values. We identify a linear contract with a distribution-free per-unit price that guarantees at least half of the optimal contract payoff. A numerical study using U.S. land use data supports our findings and illustrates when linear or conditional contracts are likely to be more effective.

  abstract     = {This paper shows how green investing spurs companies to mitigate their carbon emissions by raising the cost of capital of the most carbon-intensive companies. Companies’ emissions decrease when the wealth share of green investors and their sensitivity to climate externalities increase. We show that the impact of green investors primarily governs companies’ long-run emissions. Companies are further incentivized to reduce their emissions when green investors anticipate tighter climate regulations and climate-related technological innovations. However, heightened uncertainty regarding future climate risks alleviates green investors’ pressure on the cost of capital of companies and pushes them to increase their emissions. Calibrated on U.S. data, our model suggests that, albeit effective, the impact of green investors remains limited given their current wealth share and practices.

  abstract     = {We find that manufacturing firms adopt more conservative capital structures in response to the Nitrogen Oxides (NO x ) Budget Trading Program (NBP) of 2004, a regional cap-and-trade program aimed at mitigating the NO x emissions of power plants in 11 midwestern and southeastern states in the United States. Our further analysis demonstrates that, because the NBP induces an electricity price shock, it affects manufacturers’ financial decisions by raising their operating leverage and distress risk. We also find that firms respond to the NBP’s adoption heterogeneously: they adjust their financial leverage more dramatically when facing greater electricity intensity, financial distress threats, or competitive pressure. In addition, firms adapt not only capital structure, but also other financial policies in response to the regulation. Overall, our study shows that climate policy risk constitutes an essential consideration in firm financial decisions. It also highlights potential unintended consequences of policy responses to climate change for the corporate sector.

  abstract     = {We show that managerial learning from stock prices can lead to feedback loop vulnerability: corrective actions based on perceived negative market signals reduce the sensitivity of asset payoffs to stock market information. Less sensitivity discourages liquidity provision and increases the price impact of liquidity shocks. Interestingly, overconfident managers who disregard stock price information may be less vulnerable to the adverse price impact of nonfundamental liquidity shocks. Our empirical evidence strongly supports the model’s underlying premises and predictions: First, investment decisions of overconfident CEOs are significantly less responsive to stock price fluctuations. Second, the price impact of liquidity shocks, for example, mutual fund fire sales, is substantially smaller for firms with overconfident CEOs. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.

  abstract     = {Climate change and uncertainty about its potential consequences has become a central concern for economists, investors, and policymakers alike. I use a stochastic, dynamic general equilibrium model where final output is produced using a mix of cheap, dirty inputs and expensive, clean inputs and preferences incorporate aversion to climate model misspecification to analyze the implications of climate change and climate model uncertainty on economic and financial market outcomes. I find that climate change leads to increased clean input production and reduced emissions and that there is a negative price of climate risk that is significantly amplified and increasing in magnitude as climate change increases due to aversion to climate model uncertainty. Existing empirical estimates are consistent with the model implications, highlighting the potentially significant influence of climate model uncertainty on macroeconomic and asset pricing outcomes.

(2021) that green firms outperform brown firms when concerns about climate change increase unexpectedly, using data for S&amp;P 500 companies from January 2010 to June 2018. To capture unexpected increases in climate change concerns, we construct a daily Media Climate Change Concerns index using news about climate change published by major U.S. newspapers and newswires. We find that on days with an unexpected increase in climate change concerns, the green firms’ stock prices tend to increase, whereas brown firms’ prices decrease. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we conclude that this effect holds for concerns about both transition and physical climate change risk. Finally, we decompose returns into cash flow and discount rate news components and find that an unexpected increase in climate change concerns is associated with an increase (decrease) in the discount rate of brown (green) firms.

  abstract     = {Private sector innovation is critical to mitigating and adapting to climate change. This paper studies innovation in solar energy technology, a key source of clean energy that has experienced rapid price declines over the past decade. To understand the causes and effects of innovation, I estimate a dynamic structural model of competition among solar panel manufacturers. The model captures important features of the industry, including the role of government subsidies for solar adoption, and I employ a unique measure of technological progress that is observable and verifiable. The results produce two main insights. First, ignoring innovation by firms can generate biased estimates of the effects of government policy. Second, decentralized government intervention in a global market generates spillovers; a subsidy in one country causes international firms to innovate more, leading to lower prices and increased adoption elsewhere. This spillover underscores the need for international coordination by governments and the private sector to address climate change.

  abstract     = {Blockchain-based smart contracts can potentially replace certain traditional contracts through decentralized enforcement and reduced transaction costs. However, scalability is a key bottleneck hindering their broader application and adoption, often leading to concentrated or exclusive networks. To avoid falling short of the original promise of the technology, firms actively explore “layer-2” methods for scaling. We provide some initial evidence on the economic implications of a layer-2 scaling solution, which moves information aggregation from on-chain to off-chain peer-to-peer networks. A parallel-system experiment allows clean identification because we observe the same unit in the treatment and control systems at the same time. We find that this scaling solution reduces operating costs by 76\%, and importantly, leads to decentralization with lower market concentration and more participation, which in turn improves data accuracy. The findings provide insights on how blockchain and smart contracting technologies evolve toward achieving decentralized and scalable trust.

  abstract     = {Although the rate of invention by firms and the effect on firm performance have been central themes in economics and strategy, the position and differentiation of invention by firms have received less attention. We develop a method to characterize a firm’s technology portfolio based on the semantic content of patents that allows us to map a firm’s unique spatial position relative to every other firm in technology space and to measure the overall differentiation of a firm’s technology portfolio. Using a large panel of U.S. public firms from 1980 to 2015, we illustrate that technology differentiation has a strong positive correlation with firm performance, particularly in research and development-intensive industries and industries with strong product market rivalry. We also show that technology differentiation is associated with subsequent differentiation from competitors in the product market and a reduction in outgoing technology spillovers to other firms. We provide open access to code and data to characterize the technology portfolio of firms and to measure the technological position and differentiation of U.S. public firms.

  abstract     = {Recent shifts in societal discourse have led digital platforms to support equity, inclusivity, and diversity by introducing identity-signaling features, for example, indicators of owner race or gender. In this work, we explore whether, when, and how using those features may impact retailer demand. We tackle this question via a multimethod study. We begin by conducting a controlled experiment on Prolific.co , presenting subjects with actual Google Places business profiles for a set of Black-owned restaurants in Chicago. We randomly vary the presence of Black- and women-owned labels in these profiles and assess subjects’ expectations of popularity and quality along various restaurant dimensions. Our results demonstrate that the Black-owned label, in particular, drives significant increases in all outcomes with the effects arising primarily from Black and democratically liberal subjects. Next, we conduct an archival analysis of the effect label adoption has on the physical foot traffic that retailers receive based on SafeGraph’s mobile patterns database. Our difference-in-differences estimations yield consistent results; we find evidence of a positive average effect on foot traffic volumes. Further, we show that a rise in visitors from liberal-leaning geographies drives these effects. We discuss implications for digital platform operators and retailers.

A one-standard-deviation increase in the number of hot days decreases revenues (operating income) by 0.6\% (1.8\%) of the average quarterly revenue (operating income).

  abstract     = {We estimate the risk premium for firm-level climate change exposure among S&amp;P 500 stocks and its time-series evolution between 2005 to 2020. Exposure reflects the attention paid by market participants in earnings calls to a firm’s climate-related risks and opportunities. When extracted from realized returns, the unconditional risk premium is insignificant but exhibits a period with a positive risk premium before the financial crisis and a steady increase thereafter. Forward-looking expected return proxies deliver an unconditionally positive risk premium with maximum values of 0.5\%–1\% p.a., depending on the proxy, between 2011 and 2014. The risk premium has been lower since 2015, especially when the expected return proxy explicitly accounts for the higher opportunities and lower crash risks that characterize high-exposure stocks. This finding arises as the priced part of the risk premium primarily originates from uncertainty about climate-related upside opportunities. In the time series, the risk premium is negatively associated with green innovation; Big Three holdings; and environmental, social, and governance fund flows and positively associated with climate change adaptation programs.

  abstract     = {Unchecked climate change will cause precipitation volatility to increase around the world, leading to economic damages in the face of adjustment costs. We estimate these damages for construction—an economically important, climate exposed industry. Empirically, employment falls in response to forecasted rainfall and more so as the forecast horizon increases. This pattern allows for identification of labor adjustment costs via a multisector model of local labor markets calibrated to our estimates. When rainfall is anticipatable one month ahead, construction firms pay 10\% of monthly profit to adjust. They pay less than 1\% for rainfall anticipatable six months ahead. Without further adaptation or forecast improvements, increased rainfall volatility due to climate change is projected to lead to more costly adjustment.

The checkout process and its related touch points are especially critical in shaping the customer experience. We study the impact of adopting one-click buying, a feature that reduces the number of steps required to place a purchase order to a single click, on subsequent customer behavior. Using quasi-experimental data over a period of 35 months from an online retailer before and after the launch of one-click buying, we find adopting one-click buying is effective in lifting customer purchases and does so by making treated customers purchase more often and more items. The impact of adopting one-click buying on customer purchases after adoption is economically significant, persistent over time, and heterogeneous across customers. Analyzing clickstream data of customer activity online and purchases across product categories, we provide evidence that the increase in purchases is driven by richer engagement through both more visits to the website and more page views on visit and the expansion of purchases across categories.

  abstract     = {We compute the social cost of carbon (SCC) when decision makers want robust estimates in the face of deep (or “Knightian”) uncertainty. We introduce the notion of full-path accumulated robust preferences from stochastic control theory to an integrated assessment model. Robust preferences are appropriate for analyzing climate-related problems because, given the large uncertainty in climate science, they enable decision makers to attain solutions that are robust to a wide range of climate change scenarios. We solve the resulting model, which includes uncertainty about climate change and the ensuing economic damage and show the existence of optimal solutions and time-consistent optimal deterministic Markov policies. Additionally, we also prove that the standard Hansen–Sargent recursive utility provides an upper bound of this full-path utility. In our baseline model specification, we find that the year 2020’s optimal SCC is US$162 per tCO 2 with an average annual growth rate of 2.5\%, setting the world on a 1.37°C path, which requires full decarbonization by 2068. We introduce the notion of the SCC robustness premium, which we define as the additional SCC price tag for robustness. For a plausible range of preference parameters, the SCC robustness premium in 2020 is between US$1.41 and US$25.89 per tCO 2 with US$2.20 per tCO 2 in our baseline calibration. Over time, this premium grows significantly. The forecasts of our model facilitate managerial decision making during the world’s transition from a carbon- and emission-intensive economy to a regenerative economy. The high estimates for the SCC predict drastic rises in emission costs for high-emission industries.

  abstract     = {Artist collaborations in music have been on the rise, and they tend to produce commercially and critically successful songs. We seek to uncover the effect of these collaborative projects on career trajectories and identify the factors that lift an artist’s profile in the short and long term. We develop a theory of collaboration based on the transfer of capital between the collaborating artists that facilitates spillovers across time. To validate the theory, we use weekly radio plays of individual songs across 25 European countries between the years 2011 to 2018, together with a multiattribute Spotify data set of songs and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions in relation to artist origins. We create pairs of similar artists who released a collaboration and a solo song in the same week and measure the impact of collaborations based on the difference-in-differences methodology. We find that releasing a collaboration song, in comparison with a solo song, increases the number of plays of an artist in the future by +4.6\%. This lift can be broken down into +9.6\% for the current song and +7.7\% for subsequently released songs, whereas past songs are unaffected. The effect is moderated by the difference in economic, social, and cultural capitals and is significantly larger when one’s partner has higher economic and social capital or is highly dissimilar along the cultural dimension. Our theoretical and empirical exploration of such strategic alliances uncovers several underlying mechanisms at play in the success of these pairings and can serve as the basis for future work targeted at prescriptive contributions.

  abstract     = {We consider the classic stochastic multiarmed bandit problem with a constraint that limits the total cost incurred by switching between actions to be no larger than a given switching budget. For this problem, we prove matching upper and lower bounds on the optimal (i.e., minimax) regret and provide efficient rate-optimal algorithms. Surprisingly, the optimal regret of this problem exhibits a nonconventional growth rate in terms of the time horizon and the number of arms. Consequently, we discover surprising “phase transitions” regarding how the optimal regret rate changes with respect to the switching budget: when the number of arms is fixed, there are equal-length phases, in which the optimal regret rate remains (almost) the same within each phase and exhibits abrupt changes between phases; when the number of arms grows with the time horizon, such abrupt changes become subtler and may disappear, but a generalized notion of phase transitions involving certain new measurements still exists. The results enable us to fully characterize the trade-off between the regret rate and the incurred switching cost in the stochastic multiarmed bandit problem, contributing new insights to this fundamental problem. Under the general switching cost structure, the results reveal interesting connections between bandit problems and graph traversal problems, such as the shortest Hamiltonian path problem.

  abstract     = {Immigration has proven to be a major force driving entrepreneurial dynamics. In this paper I investigate how the geographical distribution of immigrants within a given country, and in particular the presence of “enclaves,” affects the relationship between immigration and entrepreneurship. I examine the impact of Polish immigration to Great Britain following the unprecedented migration wave caused by the European Union enlargement in 2004. I address omitted variable concerns by using information on the location of historical Polish military settlements and the occupational composition and growth of Polish immigration in Ireland to construct instruments for enclaves and location choices of immigrants. The econometric results indicate, on the one hand, that immigration does increase immigrant entrepreneurship, but not in existing immigrant enclaves. On the other hand, immigrant entrepreneurs outside enclaves tend to achieve worse growth outcomes than those in enclaves. Further analyses provide an explanation to these findings due to blocked labor markets and to the higher prevalence of “necessity entrepreneurship” outside of enclaves. These results offer new insights to understand the influence of geography on entrepreneurship in the presence of immigration. This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.

  abstract     = {Governments worldwide have spent billions of dollars on monetary incentives for consumers to encourage the adoption of eco-friendly (“green”) products. However, there is little consensus on the effectiveness of delayed monetary incentives with complex structures, such as tax credits in increasing green product adoption and reducing carbon emissions. The literature is also limited on the mechanisms through which monetary incentives work in general. We address these issues by studying the impact of tax credit incentives on green and nongreen vehicle sales in the U.S. auto industry. A tax credit incentive could boost green vehicle sales through cost savings on the vehicle’s price. However, the incentive may prove ineffective because of important barriers to adoption (e.g., long charging times for electric cars). To measure the sales and emissions impacts of tax credits, we study incentive changes in South Carolina and Oregon via various quasi-experimental approaches and assess the generalizability of our key findings to Colorado. Unlike recent studies showing an insignificant or negative correlation between tax credits and electric vehicle adoption, our analyses show that unit sales of incentivized plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) increase by an average of 3.7\% (up to 52.7\% in some counties) following a $2,000 incentive. In contrast, PHEV sales remain unchanged after the incentive’s termination, implying a positive net sales effect. We also explore the underlying mechanisms for the incentive’s impact by examining various purchase funnel stages. In the awareness stage, the incentive’s positive effect on PHEV demand peaks around the consumers’ tax-filing period. As for the consideration stage, our analyses of online consumer search indicate that the incentive does not expand the consumer pool considering PHEVs. In the conversion stage, the incentive generates more sales for PHEVs in counties where (i) consumers are more likely to have PHEVs in their consideration sets regardless of the incentive (i.e., Democratic counties) and (ii) consumers value cost-saving more (i.e., counties with lower middle income). Also, the heightened demand for PHEVs following the incentive stems from the substitution from gasoline vehicles with high fuel efficiency. We estimate the average cost of reducing carbon emissions through tax credits to be $109 per ton, which is less expensive than tax rebates for conventional hybrids and subsidies for residential solar panels.

  abstract     = {The trust game, a simple two-player economic exchange, is extensively used as an experimental measure for trust and trustworthiness of individuals. We construct deep neural network–based artificial intelligence (AI) agents to participate a series of experiments based upon the trust game. These artificial agents are trained by playing with one another repeatedly without any prior knowledge, assumption, or data regarding human behaviors. We find that, under certain conditions, AI agents produce actions that are qualitatively similar to decisions of human subjects reported in the trust game literature. Factors that influence the emergence and levels of cooperation by artificial agents in the game are further explored. This study offers evidence that AI agents can develop trusting and cooperative behaviors purely from an interactive trial-and-error learning process. It constitutes a first step to build multiagent-based decision support systems in which interacting artificial agents are capable of leveraging social intelligence to achieve better outcomes collectively.

  abstract     = {We report experimental and quasi-experimental evidence from a “sharing economy” marketplace that transitioned from decentralized to centralized pricing. Centralized pricing increased the utilization of providers’ assets, resulting in higher revenues but also higher transaction costs. Providers who were barred from accessing the price system made nonprice adjustments, including reducing the availability of their assets, canceling booked transactions, and exiting the market. Providers who retained partial pricing control reacted substantially less but experienced similar revenue increases. We highlight the challenges of implementing centralized pricing and assessing its welfare effects. We show that partial control can mitigate these challenges, allowing providers to express their private and heterogeneous preferences while maintaining the benefits of centralization.

I find that even when considering potentially offsetting shifts of sales between outdoor and indoor stores, to the firm’s website, or over time, weather has significant persistent effects on sales. This suggests that weather may increase sales volatility as more severe weather shocks become more frequent under climate change. Consistent with adaptation to climate, I find that sensitivity of sales to weather decreases with historical experience for precipitation, snow, and cold weather events, but—surprisingly—not for extreme heat events. This suggests that adaptation may moderate some but not all the adverse impacts of climate change on sales.

  abstract     = {We study collaborative shareholder engagements on climate change issues. These engagements involve coalitions of investors pursuing behind-the-scenes dialogue to encourage target firms to adopt environmental sustainability practices. Drawing on a unique data set of 553 engagements coordinated by the United Nations–supported Principles for Responsible Investment—and an innovative mixed-methods approach integrating fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis with regression analysis and qualitative interviews—we investigate how four coalition composition levers (coalition size, shareholding stake, experience, local access) combine to enable or hinder engagement success. We find that successful coalitions use four configurations of coalition composition levers that are tailored to target firms’ financial capacity and environmental predispositions, that is, target firms’ receptivity. Unsuccessful configurations instead emphasize single levers at the expense of others. Drawing on qualitative interviews, we identify three mechanisms (synchronizing, contextualizing, overfocusing) that plausibly underly the identified configurations and provide investor coalitions with knowledge about target firms and their local contexts, thus enhancing communication and understanding between investor coalitions and target firms. Our study contributes an emerging “tailor-to-target” theory of collaborative shareholder engagement that extends the literature by showing the importance of designing investor coalitions for effective climate-related engagement and the value of conceiving coalitions as different configurations of the same levers that can fit a target firm’s receptivity. From a practical perspective, our study prompts investors to move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches to instead tailor their engagement strategies to target firms’ receptivity.

  abstract     = {Enthusiasm for “greening the financial system” is welcome, but a fundamental challenge remains: financial decision makers lack the necessary information. It is not enough to know that climate change is bad. Markets need credible, digestible information on how climate change translates into material risks. To bridge the gap between climate science and real-world financial indicators, we simulate the effect of climate change on sovereign credit ratings for 109 countries, creating the world’s first climate-adjusted sovereign credit rating. Under various warming scenarios, we find evidence of climate-induced sovereign downgrades as early as 2030, increasing in intensity and across more countries over the century. We find strong evidence that stringent climate policy consistent with limiting warming to below 2 °C, honoring the Paris Climate Agreement and following representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, could nearly eliminate the effect of climate change on ratings. In contrast, under higher emissions scenarios (i.e., RCP 8.5), 59 sovereigns experience climate-induced downgrades by 2030, with an average reduction of 0.68 notches, rising to 81 sovereigns facing an average downgrade of 2.18 notches by 2100. We calculate the effect of climate-induced sovereign downgrades on the cost of corporate and sovereign debt. Across the sample, climate change could increase the annual interest payments on sovereign debt by US$45–$67 billion under RCP 2.6, rising to US$135–$203 billion under RCP 8.5. The additional cost to corporations is US$10–$17 billion under RCP 2.6 and US$35–$61 billion under RCP 8.5.

  abstract     = {How do firms address complex collective action problems effectively? Institutional and stakeholder research suggests that firms may avoid the tragedy of the commons by aligning the interests of critical proximate stakeholders in ways that governments cannot accomplish. This phenomenological paper investigates this possibility by analyzing Amazon rainforest preservation by Natura, a Brazilian cosmetics company. The results indicate that Natura internalized environmental externalities by linking ecologically conscious consumers with rural Amazonian communities. A differences-in-differences analysis compares forest preservation and fire activity in the municipalities that Natura entered with those in which it did not enter. Natura’s impact is identified through an instrumental variable analysis using missing satellite images, which Natura relied upon to decide which municipalities to enter. Quantitative results tie Natura’s entry into municipalities with forest preservation. Analysis of three mechanisms associates Natura’s involvement with stakeholder decisions to cultivate diverse forest-generated crops instead of clearing the land for conventional agriculture. This study contributes to the management literature by suggesting how firms can address important global challenges, such as rainforest preservation, by investing in stakeholder capability development and by creating institutional arrangements in line with those envisioned elsewhere.

  abstract     = {The U.S. healthcare system is undergoing a period of substantial change with hospitals purchasing many physician practices (“vertical integration”). In theory, this vertical integration could improve quality by promoting care coordination but could also worsen it by impacting the care delivery patterns. The evidence quantifying these effects is limited because of the lack of understanding of how physicians’ behaviors alter in response to the changes in financial ownership and incentive structures of the integrated organizations. We study the impact of vertical integration by examining Medicare patients treated by gastroenterologists, a specialty with a large outpatient volume and a recent increase in vertical integration. Using a causal model and large-scale patient-level national panel data that includes 2.6 million patient visits across 5,488 physicians, we examine changes in various measures of care delivery. We find that physicians significantly alter their care process (e.g., in using anesthesia with deep sedation) after they vertically integrate, and there is a substantial increase in patients’ postprocedure complications. We further provide evidence that the financial incentive structure of the integrated practices is the main reason for the changes in physician behavior because it discourages the integrated practices from allocating expensive resources to relatively unprofitable procedures. We also find that, although integration improves operational efficiency (e.g., measured by physicians’ throughput), it negatively affects quality and overall spending. Finally, to shed light on potential mechanisms through which policymakers can mitigate the negative consequences of vertical integration, we perform both mediation and cost-effectiveness analyses and highlight some useful policy levers.

  abstract     = {We use firm-level data that measure forward-looking physical climate risk to examine the impact of climate risk on capital structure. We find that greater physical climate risk leads to lower leverage in the post-2015 period (i.e., after the Paris Agreement and the first step of standardization of disclosure of climate risk information). Our results hold after controlling for firm characteristics known to determine leverage, including credit ratings. Our evidence shows that the reduction in leverage related to climate risk is shared between a demand effect (the firm’s optimal leverage decreases) and a supply effect (bankers and bondholders increase spreads when lending to firms with the greatest risk). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that physical climate risk affects leverage via larger expected distress costs and higher operating costs.

  abstract     = {Traditional two-sided platforms (e.g., Amazon, Uber) rely primarily on commission contracts to generate revenues and fuel growth, whereas their decentralized counterparts (e.g., Uniswap, Filecoin) often forego these in favor of token retention. What economics underpin this choice? We show that with properly designed initial coin offerings (ICOs), both mechanisms can independently alleviate market failures at the initial fundraising stage and incentivize long-term platform building. However, they achieve this in different ways. Although commission contracts often lead to higher profits for founders, token retention leads to higher service levels, benefiting the users and service providers. In essence, token retention surrenders a fraction of earnings to better align with the tenets of decentralized governance. Combining both mechanisms can add value, but only in relatively limited cases. These findings offer guidance and a possible rationale for why platforms may want to favor one mechanism over the other or use both.

  abstract     = {We present the first systematic approach to detect fake transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges by exploiting robust statistical and behavioral regularities associated with authentic trading. Our sample consists of 29 centralized exchanges, among which the regulated ones feature transaction patterns consistently observed in financial markets and nature. In contrast, unregulated exchanges display abnormal first significant digit distributions, size rounding, and transaction tail distributions, indicating widespread manipulation unlikely driven by a specific trading strategy or exchange heterogeneity. We then quantify the wash trading on each unregulated exchange, which averaged more than 70\% of the reported volume. We further document how these fabricated volumes (trillions of dollars annually) improve exchange ranking, temporarily distort prices, and relate to exchange characteristics (e.g., age and user base), market conditions, and regulation.

  abstract     = {Many central banks are considering issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). How will the CBDC affect the macroeconomy? Will its design matter? To answer these questions, we theoretically and quantitatively assess the effects of a CBDC on consumption, banking, and welfare. Our model captures the competition between different means of payments and incorporates a novel general equilibrium feedback effect from transactions to deposits creation. The general equilibrium effects of a CBDC are decomposed into three channels: payment efficiency, price effects, and bank funding costs. We show that a cash-like CBDC is more effective than a deposit-like CBDC in promoting consumption and welfare. Interestingly, a cash-like CBDC can also crowd in banking, even in the absence of bank market power. In a calibrated model, at the maximum, a cash-like CBDC can increase bank intermediation by 10.2\% and welfare by 0.059\%, and it can capture up to 23.3\% of the payment market. We also discuss some lessons for designing a CBDC. This paper was accepted by Will Cong, Special Section of Management Science : Blockchains and Crypto Economics.

  abstract     = {Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are an essential component of the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The most common DEXs are so-called automated market makers (AMMs): smart contracts that pool liquidity and process trades as atomic swaps of tokens. AMMs price transactions with a deterministic liquidity invariance rule that only uses the AMM’s token deposits as inputs and that has no precedent in traditional finance. Yet, in the context of transparent and open blockchain operations, any liquidity invariance pricing function allows so-called sandwich attacks (akin to front running) that increase the cost of trading and threaten the long-term viability of the DeFi ecosystem. Invariance pricing is also not regret free. Linear pricing rules have similar problems except for uniform pricing, which has regret-free prices and limits sandwich attack profits but which invites excessive order splitting. Comparing trading costs using a model of liquidity provision, constant product pricing is often cheaper except when the variance of the underlying asset is small or when the order is large.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the contribution of analysts to the functioning and failure of the market for initial coin offerings (ICOs). The assessments of freelancing analysts exhibit biases because of reciprocal interactions of analysts with ICO team members. Even favorably rated ICOs tend to fail raising some capital when a greater portion of their ratings reciprocate prior ratings. Ninety days after listing on an exchange, the market capitalization relative to the initial funds raised is smaller for tokens with more reciprocal ratings. These findings suggest that conflicts of interest help explain the failure of ICOs. This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, Special Section of Management Science : Blockchains and Crypto Economics.

  abstract     = {In the high-stakes race for scalability, some blockchains have turned to committee-based consensus (CBC), whereby the chain’s recordkeeping rights are entrusted to a committee of block producers elected via approval voting . Smaller committees boost speed and scalability but can compromise security when voters have limited information. In this environment, voting strategies are naturally nonlinear, and equilibria can become intractable. Despite this, we show that elections converge to optimality asymptotically (in voter numbers), exponentially quickly, and under relatively weak informational requirements. Compared to popular stake-weighted lottery and single-vote protocols used in practice, we find that CBC, when paired with approval voting, can offer meaningful efficiency and robustness gains if enough voters are engaged.

  abstract     = {Real-world contractual agreements between firms are often incomplete, leading to suboptimal investment and loss of value in supply chain relationships. To what extent can blockchain technology help alleviate problems arising from contractual incompleteness? We examine this issue by exploiting a quasi-natural experiment based on the staggered adoption of U.S. state laws that increased firms’ in-state ability to develop, adopt, and use blockchain technology. We find that, after exposure to a pro-blockchain law, firms with greater asset specificity exhibit more positive changes to Tobin’s Q , research and development, and blockchain-related innovation. Also, such firms appear to rely less on vertical integration, form more strategic alliances, and shift their emphasis to less geographically proximate customers. Overall, our results suggest that blockchain technology can help firms remedy constraints and inefficiencies arising from contractual incompleteness.

  abstract     = {The prior literature on analyst forecasts has focused almost exclusively on firms that just meet or beat the mean or median consensus analyst forecast, without much regard to alternative benchmarks within the forecast distribution. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is institutional significance to the lowest (minimum) and highest (maximum) analyst earnings forecast. We rigorously explore whether these two new benchmarks actually have incremental significance and, if so, whether there are differences in how managers and investors perceive the importance of these three benchmarks (i.e., minimum, mean, and maximum). Consistent with the theory of investor ambiguity aversion, which predicts an asymmetric market response to good and bad news, our results support the notion that of the three benchmarks we explore, firms act most aggressively to exceed the minimum forecast, followed by the mean, and then finally the maximum. This order is consistently supported by the following evidence: the existence of higher incentives to beat the benchmark; the likelihood of earnings management to beat the benchmark; accrual reversal after firms just barely achieve each benchmark; accrual mispricing around each benchmark; and, finally, a faster incorporation into the stock price of the bad news that a firm misses the minimum than of the good news that a firm meets or beats the maximum. These findings fill a void in academic research on these two new benchmarks and offer a consistent explanation as to why the popular press and managers frequently highlight and discuss beating these benchmarks as a separate and notable achievement.

  abstract     = {We examine strategic communication in labor market recommendations. Our formal model features two-sided asymmetric information: An adviser has private information about his own preference bias for a focal candidate and a signal of the quality of this candidate, whereas the hiring firm has private information about the quality of an alternative candidate. The adviser can choose whether to recommend his focal candidate to the firm. If he recommends and the firm hires the candidate, then the adviser pays a reputational cost (receives a reputation boost) if the firm later learns that the hire has low quality (high quality). Our main results describe how the equilibrium behavior of advisers (lying choices) and firms (hiring choices) depend on the intricate interplay between preference biases, reputation, lying costs, and the hiring firm’s labor market strength (access to alternative candidates with higher quality). We show that the equilibrium features assortative matching: advisers with a higher (lower) reputation choose to lie less (more), and consequently, their candidates are more likely to be hired by firms with strong (weak) access to high-skilled outside candidates. Two equilibrium forces create a “rich get richer” effect. First, advisers choose to lie less to hiring firms with access to better top candidates, further benefiting those firms. Second, advisers with a higher (lower) reputation choose to lie less (more), which increases (decreases) their future reputation, creating a “reputation trap.” We discuss the implications of our model for hiring strategy, referral systems, and the ability to accrue and sustain human capital-based competitive advantages.

  abstract     = {The well-documented rating inflation of incentivized reviews (IRs) can mislead consumers into choosing a product that they would otherwise not buy. To protect consumers from this undesirable influence, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission recommends that reviewers conspicuously disclose any material connection they may have with sellers. In theory, such disclosures safeguard consumers by motivating reviewers to be truthful and inducing consumers to discount inflated IR ratings. Our research finds, however, that IR disclosure accomplishes neither. Specifically, our empirical analysis of consumer reviews on Amazon reveals that, even with disclosure, (1) rating inflation of IRs remains, and (2) this inflation boosts sales at consumers’ expense. Finally, we propose an alternative approach to eliminate rating inflation of IRs and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness. These findings have important implications for consumers, firms, and ongoing policy discussions around IRs. This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing. Funding: S.

  abstract     = {Affirmative action policies are often implemented through reserve systems. In this study, we demonstrate that reserve systems face widespread misunderstanding by the public. This misunderstanding can lead individuals to support policies that ineffectively pursue their interests. To establish these claims, we present 1,013 participants in the Understanding America Study with choices between pairs of reserve systems. Participants are members of the group receiving affirmative action and are financially incentivized to choose the system that maximizes their chance of admission. Using this data, we apply a novel approach to identifying the rate of uptake of different decision rules used by participants. We find that participants rarely use a fully optimal decision rule. In contrast, we find that many choices—40\% in our primary estimates—are rationalized by a nearly correct decision rule, with errors driven solely by failing to appreciate the importance of processing order. Failing to account for processing order causes individuals to fail to distinguish between two policies that achieve different degrees of affirmative action: policies that provide nonbinding minimum guarantees of the number of spaces allocated and policies that provide spaces over-and-above what would be allocated absent a reserve. Confusion about the importance of processing order helps to explain otherwise surprising decisions made in field applications of reserve systems. We discuss implications for managers and policy makers who are trying to implement reserve systems and who are accountable to the public.

  abstract     = {Gender segregation remains a significant problem in many occupations and organizations. To solve this problem, many U.S. employers now seek to craft gender-neutral job postings. In this article, we investigate whether such employer recruitment efforts are successful in encouraging women and men to apply equally for jobs. Specifically, we move beyond the well-studied effects of the gender typing of occupations, organizations, and industries to study the extent to which the recruiting language used in job postings influences the actual preapplication behavior of job seekers of different genders. Using unique data from both a large-sample observational field study (Study 1) and a field experiment study (Study 2) of real online job postings, we first assess the gendered language mechanism by testing whether stereotypical femininity in the wording that recruiters use to advertise otherwise identical jobs differently influences female and male job seekers’ interest in applying. We then assess the recruiter gendering mechanism by testing whether the gender of the recruiter and the femininity in the wording recruiters use when presenting themselves to job seekers further contribute to gender job search disparities. Our analyses ultimately show negligible effects for both the gendering of job postings or of the job poster, and we therefore conclude that, in practice, employers’ efforts to simply tweak the language of recruitment messages do not matter much for gender equality and diversity.

  abstract     = {In nearly every betting market, gamblers overvalue the riskiest bets. This “longshot bias” is usually explained by a tendency to overweight low-probability events. We offer a novel explanation: contrast effects enhance the attractiveness of longshots because gambles presented in terms of their payoffs are easier to compare along the payoff dimension than along the probability dimension. Our analysis of historical betting odds suggests that contrasts between gamble payoffs can explain the longshot bias. Laboratory experiments confirm those contrast effects and show that the longshot bias disappears when gamblers consider bets in isolation or when winning probabilities are easier to compare.

  abstract     = {Choosing job applicants to hire in online labor markets is hard. To identify the best applicant at hand, employers need to assess a heterogeneous population. Recommender systems can provide targeted job-applicant recommendations that help employers make better-informed and faster hiring choices. However, existing recommenders that rely on multiple user evaluations per recommended item (e.g., collaborative filtering) experience structural limitations in recommending job applicants: Because each job application receives only a single evaluation, these recommenders can only estimate noisy user-user and item-item similarities. On the other hand, existing recommenders that rely on classification techniques overcome this limitation. Yet, these systems ignore the hired worker’s performance—and, as a result, they uniformly reinforce prior observed behavior that includes unsuccessful hiring choices—while they overlook potential sequential dependencies between consecutive choices of the same employer. This work addresses these shortcomings by building a framework that uses job-application characteristics to provide recommendations that (1) are unlikely to yield adverse outcomes (performance-aware) and (2) capture the potentially evolving hiring preferences of employers (sequence-aware). Application of this framework on hiring decisions from an online labor market shows that it recommends job applicants who are likely to get hired and perform well. A comparison with advanced alternative recommender systems illustrates the benefits of modeling performance-aware and sequence-aware recommendations. An empirical adaptation of our approach in an alternative context (restaurant recommendations) illustrates its generalizability and highlights its potential implications for users, employers, workers, and markets.

  abstract     = {We study the allocative challenges that governmental and nonprofit organizations face when tasked with equitable and efficient rationing of a social good among agents whose needs (demands) realize sequentially and are possibly correlated. As one example, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Emergency Management Agency faced overwhelming, temporally scattered, a priori uncertain, and correlated demands for medical supplies from different states. In such contexts, social planners aim to maximize the minimum fill rate across sequentially arriving agents, where each agent’s fill rate (i.e., its fraction of satisfied demand) is determined by an irrevocable, one-time allocation. For an arbitrarily correlated sequence of demands, we establish upper bounds on the expected minimum fill rate (ex post fairness) and the minimum expected fill rate (ex ante fairness) achievable by any policy. Our upper bounds are parameterized by the number of agents and the expected demand-to-supply ratio, yet we design a simple adaptive policy called projected proportional allocation (PPA) that simultaneously achieves matching lower bounds for both objectives (ex post and ex ante fairness) for any set of parameters. Our PPA policy is transparent and easy to implement, as it does not rely on distributional information beyond the first conditional moments. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that the PPA policy provides significant improvement over the canonical class of nonadaptive target-fill-rate policies. We complement our theoretical developments with a numerical study motivated by the rationing of COVID-19 medical supplies based on a standard compartmental modeling approach that is commonly used to forecast pandemic trajectories. In such a setting, our PPA policy significantly outperforms its theoretical guarantee and the optimal target-fill-rate policy.

  abstract     = {The internet advertising market is a multibillion dollar industry in which advertisers buy thousands of ad placements every day by repeatedly participating in auctions. An important and ubiquitous feature of these auctions is the presence of campaign budgets, which specify the maximum amount the advertisers are willing to pay over a specified time period. In this paper, we present a new model to study the equilibrium bidding strategies in standard auctions, a large class of auctions that includes first and second price auctions, for advertisers who satisfy budget constraints on average. Our model dispenses with the common yet unrealistic assumption that advertisers’ values are independent and instead assumes a contextual model in which advertisers determine their values using a common feature vector. We show the existence of a natural value pacing–based Bayes–Nash equilibrium under very mild assumptions. Furthermore, we prove a revenue equivalence showing that all standard auctions yield the same revenue even in the presence of budget constraints. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove price of anarchy bounds for liquid welfare and structural properties of pacing-based equilibria that hold for all standard auctions. In recent years, the internet advertising market has adopted first price auctions as the preferred paradigm for selling advertising slots. Our work, thus, takes an important step toward understanding the implications of the shift to first price auctions in internet advertising markets by studying how the choice of the selling mechanism impacts revenues, welfare, and advertisers’ bidding strategies.

I analyze new products in the U.S. hard drive market, which is characterized by ample product innovation. Using unique click-stream data, I measure the magnitude of two frictions, category consideration and costly search, and show that both play a crucial role in shaping consumer demand. To estimate consumer surplus from new products, I develop a search model that captures both frictions and propose a novel Bayesian estimation method to recover its parameters. I then show that ignoring information frictions leads researchers to underestimate the consumer surplus from new hard drives because it appears that consumers do not value the combinations of attributes these hard drives offer. Partly eliminating frictions, through marketing efforts or market-wide transparency initiatives, can help consumers to more fully internalize the benefits of new product launches.

  abstract     = {Battery swapping for electric vehicle refueling is reviving and thriving. Despite a captivating sustainable future where swapping batteries will be as convenient as refueling gas today, a tension is mounting in practice (beyond the traditional “range anxiety” issue): On one hand, it is desirable to maximize battery proximity and availability to customers. On the other hand, capacitated urban power grids may curb decentralized charging at a slow speed. To reconcile this tension, some cities are embracing an emerging infrastructure network: Decentralized swapping stations replenish charged batteries from centralized charging stations. It remains unclear how to design such a network or whether pooling charging demands will save costs or batteries. In this paper, we model this new urban infrastructure network. This task is complicated by non-Poisson swaps and by the intertwined stochastic operations of swapping, charging, stocking, and circulating batteries among swapping and charging stations. We tackle these complexities by deriving analytical models, which enrich the classical batched repairable-inventory theory. We next propose a joint location and repairable-inventory model for citywide deployment of hub charging stations, with a nonconvex nonconcave objective function. We solve this problem exactly by exploiting submodularity and combining constraint-generation and parameter-search techniques. Even for solving convexified problems, our algorithm brings a speedup of at least three orders of magnitude relative to the Gurobi solver. The major insight is twofold: The benefit of pooling charging demands alone is not enough to justify the adoption of the “swap-locally, charge-centrally” network; instead, the main justification is that faster charging accessible at centralized charging stations significantly reduces the system-wide battery stock level. In a broader sense, this work deepens our understanding of how mobility and energy are coupled toward enabling smart cities. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization. Funding: Y.

  abstract     = {As the industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT) is becoming increasingly valuable, manufacturers are eager to establish IIoT-based platforms for preventative maintenance (PM). These platforms reposition the roles of manufacturers and reshape the patterns of the after-sales service market. Manufacturers can adopt either the competitive strategy by introducing improved after-sales services to compete with independent maintenance, repair, and operations firms (MROs) or the “coopetitive” strategy by simultaneously opening the platform to these MROs. However, relevant research on this topic remains scarce. Hence, our study fills this gap by investigating a manufacturer’s decision for the IIoT-based platform and the subsequent relationship with an MRO. First, we find that even when the product value is relatively low and the IIoT adoption increases PM cost; interestingly, it is sometimes beneficial for the manufacturer to establish the platform. Next, we find that even if the royalty revenue is lower than the increased IIoT costs, the manufacturer may sometimes still adopt the coopetitive strategy of opening the platform. Moreover, with the opening of the platform, the manufacturer pays more technology investment, even in the competitive market. Furthermore, whenever the manufacturer opens the platform, the MRO can profit more by accessing the platform. Hence, there is sometimes a win-win equilibrium with the IIoT adoption. In addition, we find that the opening of the platform sometimes causes less customer surplus but generates more social welfare. Following the IIoT adoption, our findings offer insightful takeaways for the manufacturer’s decisions on the establishment and opening of the platform, the MRO’s reaction, and policymakers’ welfare policies.

  abstract     = {Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies must solve the problem of assigning priorities to competing transactions. The most widely used mechanism involves each transaction offering a fee to be paid once the transaction is processed, but this discriminatory price mechanism fails to yield stable equilibria with predictable prices. We propose an alternate fee setting mechanism, StableFees, that is based on uniform price auctions. We prove that our proposed protocol is free from manipulation by users and miners as the number of users and miners increases and show empirically that gains from manipulation are small in practice. We show that StableFees reduces the fees paid by users and reduces the variance of fee income to miners. Data from December 2017 show that, if implemented, StableFees could have saved Bitcoin users $272,528,000 USD in transaction fees while reducing the variance of miner’s fee income, on average, by a factor of 7.4. We argue that our fee protocol also has important social welfare and environmental benefits.

  abstract     = {In several transportation systems, vehicles can choose where to meet customers rather than stopping in fixed locations. This added flexibility, however, requires coordination between vehicles and customers that adds complexity to routing operations. This paper develops scalable algorithms to optimize these operations. First, we solve the one-stop subproblem in the ℓ 1 space and the ℓ 2 space by leveraging the geometric structure of operations. Second, to solve a multistop problem, we embed the single-stop optimization into a tailored coordinate descent scheme, which we prove converges to a global optimum. Third, we develop a new algorithm for dial-a-ride problems based on a subpath-based time–space network optimization combining set partitioning and time–space principles. Finally, we propose an online routing algorithm to support real-world ride-sharing operations with vehicle–customer coordination. Computational results show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, yielding far superior solutions in shorter computational times and can support real-time operations in very large-scale systems. From a practical standpoint, most of the benefits of vehicle–customer coordination stem from comprehensively reoptimizing “upstream” operations as opposed to merely adjusting “downstream” stopping locations. Ultimately, vehicle–customer coordination provides win–win–win outcomes: higher profits, better customer service, and smaller environmental footprint.

  abstract     = {Hospitals throughout the developed world are reimbursed based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Under this scheme, patients are divided into clinically meaningful groups, and hospitals receive a fixed fee per patient episode tied to the patient DRG. The fee is based on the average cost of providing care to patients who belong to the same DRG across all hospitals. This scheme, sometimes referred to as “yardstick competition,” provides incentives for cost reduction, as no hospital wants to operate at a higher cost than average, and can be implemented using accounting data alone. Nevertheless, if costs within a DRG are heterogeneous, this scheme may give rise to cherry-picking incentives, where providers “drop” patients who are more expensive to treat than average. To address this problem, regulators have tried to reduce within-DRG cost heterogeneity by expanding the number of DRG classes. In this paper, we show that even if cost heterogeneity is eliminated, such expansion will fail to completely eliminate patient cherry picking. In equilibrium, the market will bifurcate into two groups, one of which will continue to cherry-pick patients and underinvest in cost reduction, whereas the other group treats all patients. Furthermore, we show that DRG expansion is particularly problematic if hospitals are also able to “upcode” patients, that is, intentionally assign patients to a more resource-intensive DRG than needed to increase income. Upcoding increases within-DRG cost heterogeneity and amplifies cherry-picking incentives. We examine potential solutions involving yardstick competition based on input statistics.

  abstract     = {We model cryptocurrencies as utility tokens used by a decentralized digital platform to facilitate transactions between users of certain goods or services. The network effect governing user participation, in conjunction with the nonneutrality of the token price, can cause the token market to break down. We show that token retradeability mitigates this risk of breakdown on younger platforms by harnessing user optimism but worsens this fragility when sentiment trading by speculators crowds out users. Elastic token issuance mitigates this fragility, but strategic attacks by miners exacerbate it because users’ anticipation of future losses depresses the token’s resale value.

This paper studies the case of state-aggregated representations, in which the state space is partitioned and either the policy or value function approximation is held constant over partitions. This paper shows a policy gradient method converges to a policy whose regret per period is bounded by ϵ , the largest difference between two elements of the state-action value function belonging to a common partition. With the same representation, both approximate policy iteration and approximate value iteration can produce policies whose per-period regret scales as ϵ / ( 1 − γ ) , where γ is a discount factor. Faced with inherent approximation error, methods that locally optimize the true decision objective can be far more robust. This paper was accepted by Hamid Nazerzadeh, data science.

  abstract     = {Does the proof-of-work consensus protocol serve its intended purpose of supporting decentralized cryptocurrency mining? To address this question, we develop a game-theoretical model in which miners first invest in hardware to improve the efficiency of their operations and then compete for mining rewards in a rent-seeking game. We show that centralization grows with heterogeneity in mining costs, but hardware capacity constraints prevent the most efficient miners from monopolizing the mining process. Investment leads to a more decentralized network unless larger miners have a significant comparative advantage in acquiring new hardware. Our model generates empirically supported implications: (i) mining centralization is countercyclical with respect to mining reward, and (ii) a change in mining reward leads to a less-than-proportional change in hash rates.

To many financial industry insiders, tokens have no intrinsic merit and exist only as a way to evade regulations. We demonstrate that generic revenue-based token contracts are indeed economically inferior to equity and lead to over- or underproduction. However, an optimally designed token contract, which is a combination of an output presale and an incremental revenue-sharing agreement, yields the same payoffs as equity and debt. Moreover, with entrepreneurial moral hazard, tokens can finance a strictly larger set of ventures than equity.

  abstract     = {Cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity to identify how derivatives impact spot markets. They are fully fungible and trade across multiple spot exchanges at different prices, and futures contracts were selectively introduced on Bitcoin (BTC) exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (USD) in December 2017. Following the futures introduction, we find a significantly greater increase in cross-exchange price synchronicity for BTC–USD relative to other exchange rate pairs as demonstrated by an increase in price correlations and a reduction in arbitrage opportunities and volatility. We also find support for an increase in price efficiency, market quality, and liquidity. The evidence suggests that futures contracts allowed investors to circumvent arbitrage frictions associated with short-sale constraints, arbitrage risk associated with block confirmation time, and market segmentation. Overall, our analysis supports the view that the introduction of BTC–USD futures was beneficial to the Bitcoin spot market by making the underlying prices more informative.

We show that the amount of mining power supplied to currencies that rely on specialized hardware, such as Bitcoin, responds less to adverse exchange rate shocks than other currencies respond to such shocks, a fact that is instrumental to avoiding double-spending attacks. The results may change if mining equipment used for one cryptocurrency can be transferred to another. For smaller currencies with low exchange rate correlation, transferability eliminates the protection that fixed costs provide.

  abstract     = {We examine digital product markets in which consumers are heterogeneous in their propensity to actively interact with other users and valuations increase with the share of active users (e.g., social network platforms). We propose a model in which entrepreneurs can issue digital claims (tokens) to promise exclusive access to benefits that specifically enhance the utility of active users. This allows entrepreneurs to extract consumer surplus through price discrimination. Because there is an incentive to renege on the “exclusivity” promise ex post and expand the network of active users, the credibility of this commitment resides in a costly technology (blockchain) that embeds automatic contracts in the tokens sold and limits entrepreneurial discretion. We show that the profitability of token-based sales increases with entrepreneurial ability and the intensity of network effects.

We disclose the drawbacks of the recently reformed allocation procedure in admissions to technical colleges and offer a solution through “de-reservation via choice rules .” We propose a novel priority design— Backward Transfers (BT) choice rule —for institutions and the deferred acceptance mechanism under these choice rules (DA-BT) for centralized clearinghouses. We show that DA-BT corrects the shortcomings of existing mechanisms. By formulating India’s legal requirements and policy goals as formal axioms, we show that the DA-BT mechanism is unique for the concurrent implementation of reservation and de-reservation policies.

Anecdotal evidence links succession risk to significant value destruction, but there is limited academic research evaluating the effects of succession planning on chief executive officer (CEO) turnover outcomes. We provide evidence that succession planning reduces the cost of management transitions by improving their efficiency. Firms with succession plans experience not only lower uncertainty around turnover events but also a faster reduction in uncertainty over the incoming CEO’s tenure, consistent with faster learning about CEO-firm fit. Succession planning also raises the quality of the CEO-firm match, as evidenced by longer CEO tenure, and improves the board’s readiness to replace an underperforming CEO, increasing turnover performance sensitivity.

  abstract     = {An IPO is a significant event for an individual firm, and the literature examining initial public offering (IPO) firms is extensive. However, there is little evidence on the subsequent effect of a significant IPO on incumbent firms. We extend this literature by using firms’ tax policies as a powerful setting to identify whether incumbent firms respond to a significant IPO in their industry. Specifically, we use a first difference analysis to examine whether incumbent firms herd their effective tax rates (ETRs) toward a significant IPO’s ETR. We provide robust evidence that incumbent firms adjust their ETR either up or down by one to two percentage points, on average, for up to three years following a significant IPO entrance to the industry. Cross-sectional analyses support attention-based and tax-specific motives for herding, and additional analysis documents market attention-based consequences. Finally, we find that incumbents weigh the benefits of herding against the cost of adjusting their ETR and that incumbent firms use discretionary tax accruals as a less costly mechanism to imitate IPO firms’ generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) ETRs. We contribute to an IPO literature that focuses almost exclusively on the IPO firm. We extend the literature by providing evidence that a significant IPO in an industry can result in a herding response in incumbent firms’ policy choices.

Second, we find that business politicians enjoy an early fundraising advantage over their opponents, both because they are more likely to self-fund their campaigns and because they receive more campaign contributions from their firms. Third, the election of business politicians benefits their industries and firms, which experience positive abnormal stock returns when their executives win political office. We also show that business politicians, once elected, vote for policies that shift the balance of power toward corporate interests. Using close elections for identification, we show that this policy shift cannot be attributed solely to the changes in the underlying preferences of the electorate. Overall, our results indicate that corporate executives have become more involved in U.S. politics and that this involvement has benefited business interests and affected aggregate legislative outcomes.

  abstract     = {This study tests whether modulating a brain region associated with cognitive control using noninvasive brain stimulation affects the disposition effect. A participant trades stocks in an experimental asset market while their level of cognitive control is exogenously manipulated by applying weak current stimulation to a control-related cortical region. We find that the stimulation significantly affects the participant’s cognitive control and tendency to exhibit the disposition effect. This result is also obtained for financial professionals. We thus provide evidence that cognitive control is important for the disposition effect. This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance. Funding: X.

  abstract     = {Financing frictions may create a misallocation of assets in a market, thus depressing output, productivity, and asset values. This paper empirically explores how liquidity shocks generate a reallocation that diminishes this misallocation. Using a unique data set of agricultural outcomes, I explore how farmers respond to a relaxation of financial constraints through a liquidity shock unrelated to farming fundamentals, namely exogenous cash inflows caused by an expansion of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) leases. Farmers experiencing positive cash flow shocks increase their land purchases, which results in a reallocation effect. Examining purchases across areas, I find that farmers in high-productivity areas who receive cash flow shocks buy farmland in low-productivity areas, but farmers in low-productivity areas receiving positive cash flow shocks do not. Moreover, farmers increase their purchases of vacant (undeveloped) land. Average output, productivity, equipment investment, and profits all increase significantly following these positive cash flow shocks. Farmland prices also rise significantly, consistent with a cash-in-the-market pricing effect. These effects are consistent with an efficient reallocation of land toward more productive users.

  abstract     = {We develop a model of private equity capturing two fundamental features of this market: the fund structure and illiquidity. A fund structure with sequential capital calls arises as an optimal solution to fund managers’ (GPs) moral hazard problem but exposes investors (LPs) to illiquidity risk. Funds with more illiquidity-tolerant LPs realize higher returns, leading to different expected returns across both funds and LPs in equilibrium. GPs may inefficiently accelerate drawdowns to avoid default by LPs on capital commitments. With a secondary market for LP claims, differences in fund returns are attenuated but differences in LP returns remain. The model can rationalize several empirical findings on primary and secondary private equity markets. This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance. Funding: V.

First, the option-implied volatility on average increases in the first four weeks after the filings, followed by a net decrease in the subsequent six weeks. Second, this hump-shaped volatility dynamic is more pronounced for firms with larger 10-K file sizes. Third, we provide a novel decomposition of 10-K file size based on the individual sections’ disclosure amount and topic analysis and find that the discussions on topics in the “risk factors” section mainly capture the complexity aspect, whereas the discussions on topics in the “managerial discussion and analysis” section mainly capture the information content aspect of the 10-K filings.

  abstract     = {We study the problem when a firm sets prices for products based on the transaction data, that is, which product past customers chose from an assortment and what were the historical prices that they observed. Our approach does not impose a model on the distribution of the customers’ valuations and only assumes, instead, that purchase choices satisfy incentive-compatible constraints. The uncertainty set of potential valuations of each past customer can then be encoded as a polyhedral set, and our approach maximizes the worst case revenue, assuming that new customers’ valuations are drawn from the empirical distribution implied by the collection of such polyhedra. We study the single-product case analytically and relate it to the traditional model-based approach. Then, we show that the optimal prices in the general case can be approximated at any arbitrary precision by solving a compact mixed-integer linear program. We further design three approximation strategies that are of low computational complexity and interpretable. In particular, the cutoff pricing heuristic has a competent provable performance guarantee. Comprehensive numerical studies based on synthetic and real data suggest that our pricing approach is uniquely beneficial when the historical data has a limited size or is susceptible to model misspecification.

  abstract     = {We study the relative merits of different dispute resolution mechanisms in two-sided platforms in the context of disputes involving malicious reviews and blackmail. We develop a game-theoretic model of the strategic interactions between a seller and a (potentially malicious) consumer. In our model, the seller takes into account the impact of consumer reviews on his future earnings; recognizing this, a malicious consumer may attempt to blackmail the seller by purchasing the product, posting a negative review, and demanding ransom to remove it. Without a dispute resolution mechanism in place, the presence of malicious consumers in the market can lead to a significant decrease in seller profit, especially in settings characterized by high uncertainty about product quality. The introduction of a standard centralized dispute resolution mechanism (whereby the seller can report allegedly malicious reviews to the host platform, which then judges whether to remove the review) can restore efficiency to some extent but requires the platform’s judgments to be both very quick and highly accurate. We demonstrate that a more decentralized mechanism (whereby the firm is allowed to remove reviews without consulting the platform, subject to ex post penalties for wrongdoing) can be much more effective, while simultaneously alleviating—almost entirely—the need for the platform’s judgments to be quick. Our results suggest that decentralization, when implemented correctly, may represent a more efficient approach to dispute resolution.

This price path is controlled via two levers: (i) a fare ladder, which defines a set of airfares before the selling season, and (ii) revenue management algorithms, which control how fares evolve along the ladder during the season. We hypothesize that the current policies to control both levers—which do not account for quality differences between competing airlines—give rise to an inefficient price path and, accordingly, a loss of potential revenue. We substantiate this hypothesis via a field experiment. By partnering with an airline, we introduced quality considerations in the design of fare ladders, across 5,000 itineraries, to show that current ladder-design policies indeed lead to a suboptimal price path. We also show that this inefficiency can be mitigated by incorporating quality differences between competing airlines. This creates a smoother (and more profitable) price path.

A model of a long-term employment relationship is developed that implies that generous upfront wages activate the norm of reciprocity and then are more important when an employee is close to retirement.

Hence, direct and reciprocity-based incentives reinforce each other and should be used in combination.

  abstract     = {In environments with impending regime shifts, previous research studies probability judgments of decision makers (DMs) regarding a regime shift and finds evidence for the system neglect hypothesis: In unstable environments with precise signals, DMs exhibit relatively more underreaction in their probability judgments, and in stable environments with noisy signals, they exhibit relatively more overreaction. In the present paper we focus on pricing decisions and study how risk attitudes, as well as probability judgments regarding a regime shift, affect these decisions. We develop a model that integrates prospect theory with the system neglect hypothesis and compare changes in empirical pricing decisions to those of a Bayesian risk-neutral agent. We find a pattern of under- and overreaction in pricing decisions that mimics the system neglect hypothesis in probability judgments only when the DM’s prior probability of a regime shift is low; the system neglect pattern vanishes when the DM’s prior probability of a regime shift is high. We argue that in the case of low priors, changes in risk attitude in reaction to signals indicative of a regime shift amplify system neglect in probability judgments. In the case of high priors, on the other hand, changes in risk attitude dampen the effect of system neglect. We test our model predictions in experimental insurance markets and offer various extensions to check for the robustness of our findings. Finally, we discuss implications for managerial practice in organizational contexts that are characterized by continuous change.

  abstract     = {An important problem in single-player video game design is how to sequence game elements within a level (or “chunk”) of the game. Each element has two critical features: a reward (e.g., earning an item or being able to watch a cinematic) and a degree of difficulty (e.g., how much energy or focus is needed to interact with the game element). The latter property is a distinctive feature in video games. Unlike passive services (like a trip to the spa) or passive entertainment (like watching sports or movies), video games often require concerted effort to consume. We study how to sequence game elements to maximize overall experienced utility subject to the dynamics of adaptation to rewards and difficulty and memory decay. We find that the optimal design depends on the relationship between rewards and difficulty, leading to qualitatively different designs. For example, when the proportion of reward-to-difficulty is high, the optimal design mimics that of more passive experiences. By contrast, the optimal design of games with low reward-to-difficulty ratios resembles work-out routines with “warm-ups” and “cool-downs.” Intermediate cases may follow the classical “mini-boss, end-boss” design where difficulty has two peaks. Numerical results reveal optimal designs with “waves” of reward and difficulty with multiple peaks. Level designs with multiple peaks of difficulty are ubiquitous in video games. In summary, this paper provides practical guidance to game designers on how to match the design of single-player games to the relationship between reward and difficulty inherent in their game’s mechanics. Our model also has implications for other interactive services that share similarities with games, such as summer camps for children. This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.

  abstract     = {Quality certification is ubiquitously used in markets with asymmetric information, but little is known about the impact of the number of certification tiers on market outcomes. Exploiting a field experiment on a large e-commerce marketplace with an existing two-tier certification, we study the impact of introducing a new certification tier that is less history dependent and less demanding than the existing top tier. Consistent with the theoretical literature on information design, we find that the change in information granularity among the previously noncertified sellers increases demand for high-quality young sellers, incentivizes their quality provision, and increases their chance of eventually obtaining the top-tier certification. Moreover, the three-tier certification structure prompts established sellers with higher effort cost to reduce their effort, opt out of the top tier, and adopt the new tier instead. Lastly, we provide evidence that the net impact of introducing the new certification tier on seller effort depends on how history dependent the certification requirements are in a market.

  abstract     = {Partial vertical ownership describes a situation in which a firm holds financial shares in either its supplier (referred to as partial backward integration) or its customer (partial forward integration). We study the effect of such financial interconnectedness on two operational decisions: capacity investment and information exchange. In our model, a retailer, who has superior information about the future market demand, has passive financial holdings in the supplier. Although this passive financial investment does not enable the retailer to directly influence the supplier’s operational decisions, it does affect the market equilibrium. Specifically, financial interconnectedness between the firms can result in the retailer financing the entire capacity in the market. In addition, we characterize the conditions that ensure that information between the retailer and the supplier can be exchanged via cheap-talk communication. Interestingly, a high level of information asymmetry facilitates the exchange of information via cheap talk in the presence of these financial links. When cheap talk is not possible, we study the separating equilibrium that is achieved through the retailer’s commitment to order in advance. In this case, the separating quantity can either increase or decrease with the level partial vertical ownership, and this trend does not depend the actual level of the financial holdings. We further analyze the incentive of the retailer to conceal demand information by choosing a pooling equilibrium and conclude with discussing the effect of the financial interconnectedness on the parties’ operational payoffs.

  abstract     = {Outpatient care providers usually allow patients to access service via scheduling appointments or direct walk-in. Patients choose strategically between these two access channels (and otherwise balking) based on the trade-off of appointment delay and in-clinic waiting. How to manage outpatient care with such dual access channels, taking into account patient strategic choice behavior, is a challenge faced by providers. We study three operational levers to address this management challenge: service capacity allocation between these two channels, appointment delay information revelation via the choice and design of online scheduling systems, and a walk-in triage system that restricts the use of walk-in hours only for acute care. By studying a stylized queueing model, we find that neither a real-time online scheduling system (which offers instant access to appointment delay information at time of booking) nor an asynchronous online system (which does not directly provide delay information) can be universally more efficient. Although real-time systems appear more popular in practice, asynchronous systems sometimes can result in higher operational efficiency. Under the provider’s optimal capacity allocation, which scheduling system is more efficient hinges on two key factors: the patient demand–provider capacity relationship and patient willingness to wait. For the walk-in triage system, we find that it may or may not be beneficial to adopt; the provider’s own cost trade-off between lost demand and overtime work is the key determinant. Our research highlights that there is no one-size-fits-all model for outpatient care management, and the best use of operational levers critically depends on the practice environment.

  abstract     = {We consider a platform facilitating trade between sellers and buyers with the objective of maximizing consumer surplus. Even though in many such marketplaces, prices are set by revenue-maximizing sellers, platforms can influence prices through (i) price-dependent promotion policies that can increase demand for a product by featuring it in a prominent position on the web page and (ii) the information revealed to sellers about the value of being promoted. Identifying effective joint information design and promotion policies is a challenging dynamic problem as sellers can sequentially learn the promotion value from sales observations and update prices accordingly. We introduce the notion of confounding promotion policies, which are designed to prevent a Bayesian seller from learning the promotion value (at the expense of the short-run loss of diverting some consumers from the best product offering). Leveraging these policies, we characterize the maximum long-run average consumer surplus that is achievable through joint information design and promotion policies when the seller sets prices myopically. We then construct a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, in which the seller’s best response to the platform’s optimal policy is to price myopically in every period. Moreover, the equilibrium we identify is platform optimal within the class of horizon-maximin equilibria, in which strategies are not predicated on precise knowledge of the horizon length and are designed to maximize payoff over the worst-case horizon. Our analysis allows one to identify practical long-run average optimal platform policies in a broad range of demand models.

  abstract     = {Policy learning using historical observational data are an important problem that has widespread applications. Examples include selecting offers, prices, or advertisements for consumers; choosing bids in contextual first-price auctions; and selecting medication based on patients’ characteristics. However, existing literature rests on the crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the data: an assumption that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper, we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with incomplete observational data. We first present a policy evaluation procedure that allows us to assess how well the policy does under worst-case environment shift. We then establish a central limit theorem type guarantee for this proposed policy evaluation scheme. Leveraging this evaluation scheme, we further propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a policy that is robust to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts with a performance guarantee based on the theory of uniform convergence. Finally, we empirically test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in synthetic datasets and demonstrate that it provides the robustness that is missing using standard policy learning algorithms. We conclude the paper by providing a comprehensive application of our methods in the context of a real-world voting data set. This paper was accepted by Hamid Nazerzadeh, data science.

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has seen dramatic demand surges for hospital care that have placed a severe strain on health systems worldwide. As a result, policy makers are faced with the challenge of managing scarce hospital capacity to reduce the backlog of non-COVID patients while maintaining the ability to respond to any potential future increases in demand for COVID care. In this paper, we propose a nationwide prioritization scheme that models each individual patient as a dynamic program whose states encode the patient’s health and treatment condition, whose actions describe the available treatment options, whose transition probabilities characterize the stochastic evolution of the patient’s health, and whose rewards encode the contribution to the overall objectives of the health system. The individual patients’ dynamic programs are coupled through constraints on the available resources, such as hospital beds, doctors, and nurses. We show that the overall problem can be modeled as a grouped weakly coupled dynamic program for which we determine near-optimal solutions through a fluid approximation. Our case study for the National Health Service in England shows how years of life can be gained by prioritizing specific disease types over COVID patients, such as injury and poisoning, diseases of the respiratory system, diseases of the circulatory system, diseases of the digestive system, and cancer.

Using unique data of all flights emanating from 5,015 airports around the globe from 2005 to 2015 and exploiting a regression discontinuity framework, we report that a 10\% increase in nonstop flights between two locations leads to a 3.4\% increase in citations and a 1.4\% increase in the production of collaborative patents between those locations. This effect is driven primarily by firms as opposed to academic institutions. We further study the characteristics of firms and firm locations that are salient to the relation between nonstop flights and innovation outcomes across countries. Using a gravity model, we posit and find that the positive effect of nonstop flights on innovation is stronger for firms and subsidiaries with greater innovation mass (e.g., stocks of inventors and R&amp;D spending), located in innovation hubs or countries that are deemed technology leaders, and that are separated by large cultural or temporal distance.

  abstract     = {Historical data are typically limited. We study the following fundamental data-driven pricing problem. How can/should a decision maker price its product based on data at a single historical price? How valuable is such data? We consider a decision maker who optimizes over (potentially randomized) pricing policies to maximize the worst-case ratio of the garnered revenue compared to an oracle with full knowledge of the distribution of values, when the latter is only assumed to belong to a broad nonparametric set. In particular, our framework applies to the widely used regular and monotone nondecreasing hazard rate (mhr) classes of distributions. For settings where the seller knows the exact probability of sale associated with one historical price or only a confidence interval for it, we fully characterize optimal performance and near-optimal pricing algorithms that adjust to the information at hand. The framework we develop is general and allows to characterize optimal performance for deterministic or more general randomized mechanisms and leads to fundamental novel insights on the value of data for pricing. As examples, against mhr distributions, we show that it is possible to guarantee 85\% of oracle performance if one knows that half of the customers have bought at the historical price, and if only 1\% of the customers bought, it still possible to guarantee 51\% of oracle performance.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a family of sales-based rebate mechanisms as an effective tool to implement price discrimination across a population of buyers with correlated heterogeneous valuations on indivisible goods and services. In order to implement such sales-based rebate mechanisms, the seller charges each buyer a fixed price at the time of purchase contingent on a rebate that is a function of the ex post sales volume to be realized at the end of the sales period. The seller declares both a price and a menu of rebates as a function of sales. We show that, when there is a common component of uncertainty in consumers’ valuations (to which we refer as the quality of the product), such rebates enable a seller to effectively induce different expected net prices at different valuations. Importantly, this effective price discrimination over valuations is achieved keeping both the base price and the rebate uniform across all buyers. This uniformity of price and rebate across buyers is a key advantage of our proposed rebate mechanism, thereby providing a new mechanism for price discrimination in crowd-based markets. We use tools and techniques from game theory and variational optimization to provide insight into the economics of such mechanisms. In particular, we identify two mechanisms that are monotone functions of the sales volume that are easy to implement in practice and perform well when compared with the much more complex optimal mechanism. We provide a rigorous analysis of the optimal mechanism and discuss practical limitations in implementing the globally optimal design, further demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed monotone mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Motivated by operations research applications, such as inventory control and real-time bidding, we consider undiscounted reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes under model uncertainty and temporal drifts. In this setting, both the latent reward and state transition distributions are allowed to evolve over time, as long as their respective total variations, quantified by suitable metrics, do not exceed certain variation budgets . We first develop the sliding window upper confidence bound for reinforcement learning with confidence-widening ( SWUCRL2-CW ) algorithm and establish its dynamic regret bound when the variation budgets are known. In addition, we propose the bandit-over-reinforcement learning algorithm to adaptively tune the SWUCRL2-CW algorithm to achieve the same dynamic regret bound but in a parameter-free manner (i.e., without knowing the variation budgets). Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to show that our proposed algorithms achieve superior empirical performance compared with existing algorithms. Notably, under nonstationarity, historical data samples may falsely indicate that state transition rarely happens. This thus presents a significant challenge when one tries to apply the conventional optimism in the face of uncertainty principle to achieve a low dynamic regret bound. We overcome this challenge by proposing a novel confidence-widening technique that incorporates additional optimism into our learning algorithms. To extend our theoretical findings, we demonstrate, in the context of single-item inventory control with lost sales, fixed cost, and zero lead time, how one can leverage special structures on the state transition distributions to achieve improved dynamic regret bound in time-varying demand environments.

We collect panel data on the web technology vendors selected by more than 27,000 top websites internationally. The week after the GDPR’s enforcement, website use of web technology vendors falls by 15\% for EU residents. Websites are relatively more likely to retain top vendors, which increases the concentration of the vendor market by 17\%. Increased concentration predominantly arises among vendors that use personal data, such as cookies, and from the increased relative shares of Facebook and Google-owned vendors, but not from website consent requests. Although the aggregate changes in vendor use and vendor concentration dissipate by the end of 2018, we find that the GDPR impact persists in the advertising vendor category most scrutinized by regulators.

  abstract     = {We consider a class of three-objective mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) where at least one of the objective functions takes only discrete values. These problems commonly occur in MILPs where one or more of the three objective functions contain only integer decision variables. In such problems, the nondominated set consists of the union of nondominated edges and individual nondominated points. The nondominated edges can provide valuable insights on the trade-offs between the two continuous objectives at different levels of the discrete-valued objective. We develop an objective-space search algorithm that keeps partitioning the search space by progressively creating cones in the two-dimensional feasible space of the two continuous objectives for relevant values of the discrete-valued objective. The algorithm generates the nondominated points or edges in the nonincreasing order of the feasible values of the selected discrete-valued objective. Additionally, the algorithm uncovers all efficient integer variable vectors, including different vectors that lead to the same nondominated points or edges. We apply the algorithm to the day-ahead electricity market clearing problem. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {We study the classical newsvendor problem in which the decision maker must trade off underage and overage costs. In contrast to the typical setting, we assume that the decision maker does not know the underlying distribution driving uncertainty but has only access to historical data. In turn, the key questions are how to map existing data to a decision and what type of performance to expect as a function of the data size . We analyze the classical setting with access to past samples drawn from the distribution (e.g., past demand), focusing not only on asymptotic performance but also on what we call the transient regime of learning , that is, performance for arbitrary data sizes. We evaluate the performance of any algorithm through its worst-case relative expected regret, compared with an oracle with knowledge of the distribution. We provide the first finite sample exact analysis of the classical sample average approximation (SAA) algorithm for this class of problems across all data sizes. This allows one to uncover novel fundamental insights on the value of data: It reveals that tens of samples are sufficient to perform very efficiently but also that more data can lead to worse out-of-sample performance for SAA. We then focus on the general class of mappings from data to decisions without any restriction on the set of policies and derive an optimal algorithm (in the minimax sense) and characterize its associated performance. This leads to significant improvements for limited data sizes and allows to exactly quantify the value of historical information. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, data science.

  abstract     = {Effective treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a continual challenge for healthcare providers, and providers can benefit from leveraging emerging technologies to supplement traditional clinic care. We develop a data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize PD medication regimens through wearable sensors. We leverage a data set of n = 26 PD patients who wore wrist-mounted movement trackers for two separate six-day periods. Using these data, we first build and validate a simulation model of how individual patients’ movement symptoms respond to medication administration. We then pair this simulation model with an on-policy RL algorithm that recommends optimal medication types, timing, and dosages during the day while incorporating human-in-the-loop considerations on medication administration. The results show that the RL-prescribed medication regimens outperform physicians’ medication regimens, despite physicians having access to the same data as the RL agent. To validate our results, we assess our wearable-based RL medication regimens using n = 399 PD patients from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative data set. We show that the wearable-based RL medication regimens would lead to significant symptom improvement for these patients, even more so than training RL policies directly from this data set. In doing so, we show that RL models from even small data sets of wearable data can offer novel, generalizable clinical insights and medication strategies, which may outperform those derived from larger data sets without wearable data.

  abstract     = {On-demand delivery through sharing platforms represents a rapidly expanding segment of the global workforce. The emergence of sharing platforms enables gig workers to choose when and where to work, allowing them to do so in a flexible manner. However, such flexibility brings notorious challenges to platforms in managing the gig workforce. Thus, understanding the incentive and behavioral issues of gig workers in this new business model is inherently meaningful. This paper investigates how the incentive mechanisms of sharing platforms—earnings, ratings, and penalties—affect the working decisions of gig workers and their nuanced relationships. To achieve this goal, we use data from one leading on-demand delivery platform with more than 50 million active consumers in China and implement a two-stage Heckman model with instrumental variables to estimate the impact of earnings, ratings, and penalties. We first show that better ratings motivate gig workers to work more. However, interestingly, when ratings are employed together with earnings, the two positive effects of ratings and earnings can be substitutes for each other. Second, we reveal that higher past penalties discourage workers from working more, whereas, interestingly, workers with higher past penalties tend to be more sensitive toward an increase in earnings. Finally, we conduct follow-up surveys to understand the underlying mechanisms of the observed moderating effects from both psychological and economic perspectives. The ultimate goal of this work is to provide managerial implications to help platform managers understand how earnings, ratings, and penalties work together to affect gig workers’ working decisions and how to manage high- and low-quality workers.

  abstract     = {Over the last two decades, researchers in operations management have increasingly leveraged laboratory experiments to identify key behavioral insights. These experiments inform behavioral theories of operations management, impacting domains including inventory, supply chain management, queuing, forecasting, and sourcing. Yet, until now, the replicability of most behavioral insights from these laboratory experiments has been untested. We remedy this with the first large-scale replication study in operations management. With the input of the wider operations management community, we identify 10 prominent experimental operations management papers published in Management Science , which span a variety of domains, to be the focus of our replication effort. For each paper, we conduct a high-powered replication study of the main results across multiple locations using original materials (when available and suitable). In addition, our study tests replicability in multiple modalities (in-person and online) due to laboratory closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our replication study contributes new knowledge about the robustness of several key behavioral theories in operations management and contributes more broadly to efforts in the operations management field to improve research transparency and reliability.

  abstract     = {Using a unique panel data set of manufacturing firms in Spain in 1994–2006, I show that the use of flexible (shorter and cheaper-to-fire) employment contracts promotes debt financing. I build the identification strategy on the intertemporal, cross-regional, and cross-gender variation in government subsidies that differentially encouraged firms to hire workers on the less flexible contracts. A thought experiment of prohibiting an average firm from hiring workers on flexible contracts suggests that such a firm should reduce its debt-to-capital ratio by 7\%. These findings suggest that flexible employment contracts reduce operating leverage and the fixity of firms’ costs, increasing financial leverage. The unique institutional environment allows me to isolate this mechanism from collective bargaining and total labor cost channels. I further show that employment flexibility increases firm performance for firms that benefit most from operating leverage reductions and depend more on external financing. The results demonstrate how management can use heterogenous labor contracts to improve firm outcomes. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.

  abstract     = {“Freemium,” whereby a basic service level is provided free of charge but consumers are charged for more advanced features, has become a popular business model for firms selling digital goods. However, it is not clear whether the launch of a free version helps or hurts the demand of an existing paid version. The free version may allow consumers to sample the product before making a purchase decision and subsequently increase demand of the paid version, but it may also cannibalize demand of the paid version. We use a comprehensive data set on game apps from Apple’s App Store that tracks the launch of both the paid and the free versions of individual apps on a daily level to identify whether a freemium strategy stimulates or hurts demand of an existing paid version. We estimate the spillover effects between the free version and the paid version of the same app under a difference-in-difference framework, relying on the fact that app developers cannot predict the exact launch date of the free version of the app due to Apple’s review and approval of apps prior to release and accounting for app-level product heterogeneity. We find that the launch of a free version increases demand of the paid version of the same app. Under the main specification, if the daily number of ratings before the free version’s launch is at the mean, then all else equal, the launch of the free version leads to an 8.9\% increase in the daily number of ratings. We then describe multiple robustness checks. Finally, we present evidence that the results are driven by consumers sampling the free version as well as enhanced app discovery and explore the relative importance of the two mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Strategic decisions are increasingly delegated to algorithms. We extend previous results of the algorithmic collusion literature to the context of dynamic optimization with imperfect monitoring by analyzing a setting where a limited number of agents use simple and independent machine-learning algorithms to buy and sell a storable good. No specific instruction is given to them, only that their objective is to maximize profits based solely on past market prices and payoffs. With an original application to battery operations, we observe that the algorithms learn quickly to reach seemingly collusive decisions, despite the absence of any formal communication between them. Building on the findings of the existing literature on algorithmic collusion, we show that seeming collusion could originate in imperfect exploration rather than excessive algorithmic sophistication. We then show that a regulator may succeed in disciplining the market to produce socially desirable outcomes by enforcing decentralized learning or with adequate intervention during the learning process.

  abstract     = {We experimentally study information transmission by experts motivated by their reputation for being well-informed. In our game of reputational cheap talk, a reporter privately observes information about a state of the world and sends a message to an evaluator; the evaluator uses the message and the realized state of the world to assess the reporter’s informativeness. We manipulate the key driver of misreporting incentives: the uncertainty about the phenomenon to forecast. We highlight three findings. First, misreporting information is pervasive even when truthful information transmission can be an equilibrium strategy. Second, consistent with the theory, reporters are more likely to transmit information truthfully when there is more uncertainty on the state. Third, evaluators have difficulty learning reporters’ strategies and, contrary to the theory, assessments react more strongly to message accuracy when reporters are more likely to misreport. In a simpler environment with computerized evaluators, reporters learn to best reply to evaluators’ behavior and, when the state is highly uncertain and evaluators are credulous, to transmit information truthfully.

  abstract     = {A combination of point estimates from multiple judges often provides a more accurate aggregate estimate than a point estimate from a single judge, a phenomenon called “the wisdom of crowds.” However, if the judges use shared information when forming their estimates, the simple average will end up overemphasizing this common component at the expense of the judges’ private information. A decision maker could in theory obtain a more accurate estimate by appropriately combining all information behind the judges’ opinions. Although this information underlies the judges’ individual estimates, it is typically unobservable and thus cannot be directly aggregated by a decision maker. In this article, we propose a weighting of judges’ individual estimates that appropriately combines their collective information within a single estimation problem. Judges are asked to provide both a point estimate of the quantity of interest and a prediction of the average estimate that will be given by all other judges. Predictions of others are then used as part of a criterion to determine weights that are applied to each judge’s estimate to form an aggregate estimate. Our weighting procedure is robust to noise in the judges’ responses and can be expressed in closed form. We use both simulation and data from a collection of experimental studies to illustrate that the weighting procedure outperforms existing methods. An R package called metaggR implements our method and is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

  abstract     = {We show that intensified competition changes the location of business activity and, in turn, affects supply chain relationships. Using establishment-level data, we find that, when upstream product markets become more competitive, suppliers are more likely to relocate their establishments closer to customers. Following the supplier’s relocation, its sales to the customer increase, its relationship with the customer is less likely to be terminated, and its innovation is more aligned with the customer’s innovation. The relocated supplier also experiences more analyst following and institutional ownership that are in common with the customer and is more likely to issue equity than debt. However, the improved relationship, by causing the supplier to engage more in innovation dedicated to the customer, adversely affects creative innovation, which is known to drive growth.

  abstract     = {We show that superstitions—beliefs without scientific grounding—impact the investment and risk-taking of Chinese firms. We focus on widely held beliefs in bad luck during one’s “zodiac year,” which occurs on a 12-year cycle around a person’s birth year, to study superstitions and risk taking. We first show a direct correspondence between zodiac year and risk taking via survey data: respondents are two percentage points more likely to favor no-risk investments if queried during their zodiac year. Turning to corporate decision making, we find that return volatility declines in the chairman’s zodiac year, suggesting a reduction in risk taking overall. Focusing on specific types of risk taking, investment in R&amp;D and corporate acquisitions both decline during the chairman’s zodiac year; returns around acquisition announcements are also lower, suggesting real allocative consequences of zodiac year beliefs.

  abstract     = {Content-sharing social network platforms rely heavily on user-generated content to attract users and advertisers, but they have limited authority over content provision. We develop an intervention that leverages social interactions between users to stimulate content production. We study social nudges , whereby users connected with a content provider on a platform encourage that provider to supply more content. We conducted a randomized field experiment ( N = 993 , 676 ) on a video-sharing social network platform where treatment providers could receive messages from other users encouraging them to produce more, but control providers could not. We find that social nudges not only immediately boosted video supply by 13.21\% without changing video quality but also, increased the number of nudges providers sent to others by 15.57\%. Such production-boosting and diffusion effects, although declining over time, lasted beyond the day of receiving nudges and were amplified when nudge senders and recipients had stronger ties. We replicate these results in a second experiment. To estimate the overall production boost over the entire network and guide platforms to utilize social nudges, we combine the experimental data with a social network model that captures the diffusion and over-time effects of social nudges. We showcase the importance of considering the network effects when estimating the impact of social nudges and optimizing platform operations regarding social nudges. Our research highlights the value of leveraging co-user influence for platforms and provides guidance for future research to incorporate the diffusion of an intervention into the estimation of its impacts within a social network.

  abstract     = {Host-generated property images as a visual channel reveal substantial information about properties. Selecting proper images to display can lead to higher demand and increased rental revenue. In this paper, we define, estimate, and optimize the impacts of Airbnb photos on customers’ renting decisions. We apply ResNet-50, a convolutional neural network model, to build two separate, supervised learning models to evaluate the image quality and room types posted by Airbnb hosts. Then, we characterize the overall impacts of photo layout by the room type featured in the photo, photo quality, and order of display on the listings’ web pages. To address two estimation challenges in the Airbnb setting, namely, censored demand and changing consideration sets, we propose a novel pairwise comparison model that utilizes customers’ booking sequence data to consistently estimate the impact of photo layout on customers’ renting decisions. Our estimation results suggest that the cover image has a significantly larger impact than noncover photos and a high-quality bedroom cover image leads to the largest increase in demand. Furthermore, we build a nonlinear integer programming optimization problem and develop an algorithm to determine the optimal photo layout. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a listing’s unilateral adoption of optimal photo layout leads to 11.0\% more bookings on average. Moreover, depending on the neighborhood and market size, when listings simultaneously switch to the optimal photo layout, they get booked for two to five additional days in a year on average, which boosts revenue by $500 to $1,100.

  abstract     = {Buy-one-get-one (BOGO) promotions have become popular. With BOGO, the first unit is sold for the regular price, and the second unit is discounted. We analyze BOGO in manufacturer–retailer supply chains. We identify conditions under which BOGO outperforms price reduction (PR) and everyday low price (EDLP) policies. We find that, for some products, whether consumers stockpile or not, if BOGO and PR have the same market size, BOGO has a larger retailer profit and the same or larger manufacturer profit because BOGO induces more consumers to buy and consume two units. When consumers stockpile, the retailer sets prices to prevent such behavior, and the retailer’s share of supply chain profits is largest under BOGO, whereas consumer surplus with BOGO is smaller than PR. We also find that BOGO reduces double marginalization. When PR expands market size more than BOGO, BOGO’s effectiveness diminishes. When consumers stockpile without increasing consumption and/or production cost is high, EDLP is best. Our results are robust to multiperiod with single-promotion-period settings. A large number of regular-price periods following a promotion period increases stockpiling, which erodes the retailer’s profit and favors EDLP. If promotions are offered for consecutive periods, a larger number of promotion periods increases PR’s efficacy relative to BOGO. Time-inconsistent consumers increase stockpiling and make PR outperform BOGO. Heterogeneous consumers’ holding cost and marginal utility prevent retailers from perfectly discriminating among consumers who make profit-reducing choices. Compared with retailers’ BOGO, manufacturers’ BOGO increases double marginalization and decreases retailers’ and manufacturers’ profits and consumer surplus.

  abstract     = {There are more than 7,000 known rare diseases, but pharmaceutical manufacturers developed treatments for only 500 of them. To improve the availability and accessibility of treatments for rare diseases, governments have introduced several programs including subsidies, exogenous pricing, and outcome-based payment schemes in recent years. What kind of subsidy programs and pricing mechanisms can improve patient access? Inspired by various pilot programs, we present a multistage game theoretic model to analyze different subsidy schemes proposed for rare diseases. In addition to the traditional setting in which the manufacturer sets the price, we consider an “exogenous pricing scheme” under which an independent consortium sets the price. We also examine an outcome-based payment scheme, which offers the drug for free if it is not efficacious. We formulate a four-stage Stackelberg game to determine whether it is optimal to subsidize the pharmaceutical manufacturer, the patients, or both. Our results offer several insights. First, we find that government subsidies are crucial to entice new drug development for rare diseases. Also, we find that the pricing scheme matters: The exogenous pricing scheme can improve patient welfare, but it reduces the manufacturer’s expected profit. We find that this result is robust even when an outcome-based payment scheme is used. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.

  abstract     = {Project selection decisions are complex because they must balance not only financial returns, project risk, and fit with strategy, but also competitive circumstances. A rival’s project development efforts provide two pieces of information: a market rivalry signal, indicating potentially heightened competition in a market, and a technological signal, indicating a possible solution to a problem in that market. We hypothesize that these signals affect a firm’s likelihood of project selection in opposite directions, and that the timing of the signals matters for selection. We examine the drug development pipelines of the top 15 pharmaceutical companies from 1999 to 2016 to examine how rival projects drive the decision to progress a drug from preclinical laboratory trials to clinical trials in humans. Early-stage rival projects provide a stronger market rivalry signal, and they are associated with a decreased likelihood of the firm selecting its own project to compete in the same market. Late-stage rival projects signal technological feasibility and are associated with an increase in the likelihood of selection. We then exploit heterogeneity in market potential (i.e., disorder prevalence/incidence) and a molecular compound’s technology (i.e., therapeutic modality) to independently manipulate the salience of the two signals. Finally, we provide evidence on how selection based on rival signals informs project success. Information from rival projects prompts the selection of more successful drugs, but only after a threshold when sufficient uncertainty has been resolved.

We address the endogeneity of lockdowns by modeling anticipation effects. Our data cover 178 countries in the period from December 2019 to November 2020 and identify lockdown and release periods along with confirmed cases of infections and deaths resulting from COVID-19. Overall, we find that lockdowns were effective, reduced mobility, and saved about 3.6 million lives in developed countries within 100 days after they were implemented. Measures taken within countries (rather than border closure) and partial lockdowns (instead of more constraining measures) were the most effective. However, in developing countries, where the opportunity cost of staying home might be too high for people to comply, lockdowns were ineffective. Additionally, the release of lockdown measures, which started in mid-May 2020 in most countries, did not lead to a strong resurgence of the virus except for border closure releases.

In this study, we develop a team formation and interteam contest field experiment at a ride-sharing platform. We assign drivers to teams either randomly or based on similarity in age, hometown location, or productivity. Having these teams compete for cash prizes, we find that (1) compared with those in the control condition, treated drivers work longer hours and earn 12\% higher revenue during the contest; (2) the treatment effect persists two weeks postcontest, albeit with half of the effect size; and (3) drivers in hometown-similar teams are more likely to communicate with each other, whereas those in age-similar teams continue to work longer hours and earn higher revenue during the two weeks after the contest ends. Together, our results show that platform designers can leverage team identity and team contests to increase revenue and worker engagement in a gig economy.

  abstract     = {Decision making on the job is becoming increasingly important in the labor market, in which there is an unprecedented rise in demand for workers with problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. This paper investigates how indoor air quality affects the quality of strategic decision making based on data from official chess tournaments. Our main analysis relies on a unique data set linking the readings of air-quality monitors inside the tournament room to the quality of 30,000 moves, each of them objectively evaluated by a powerful artificial intelligence–based chess engine. The results show that poor indoor air quality hampers players’ decision making. We find that an increase in the indoor concentration of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) by 10 μ g / m 3 (corresponding to 75\% of a standard deviation in our sample) increases a player’s probability of making an erroneous move by 26.3\%. The decomposition of the effects by different stages of the game shows that time pressure amplifies the damage of poor air quality to the players’ decisions. We implement a number of robustness checks and conduct a replication exercise with analogous move-quality data from games in the top national league showing the strength of our results. The results highlight the costs of poor air quality for highly skilled professionals faced with strategic decisions under time pressure.

We study the effectiveness of two reward mechanisms, all-or-nothing and piece-rate, to incentivize full completion of repeated tasks over time. Our theoretical analysis shows that exogenously imposing the all-or-nothing mechanism can be ineffective due to the potential discouragement effect. In contrast, empowering individuals to choose between the two reward mechanisms can significantly improve the full completion rate. Data from a series of field experiments and follow-up replications provide robust evidence that the all-or-nothing mechanism is effective only when it is presented as an option.

  abstract     = {Many decision makers are thought to economize on attention by processing information at the simpler level of a category. We directly test whether such category focus reflects an adaptive response to attention constraints, in five preregistered experiments using an information sampling paradigm with mouse tracking. Consistent with rational principles, participants focus more on category-level information when individual differences are small, when the category contains more members, and when time constraints are more severe. Participants are sensitive to the statistical structure of the category even when it must be learned from experience, and they respond to a latent shift in this structure. Beliefs about category members tend to cluster together more when category focus is high—a key element of rational inattention. However, this is counteracted by greater weight placed on salient and idiosyncratic information when the category is large. Our results broadly substantiate influential theories of categorical thinking, giving us a clearer view on the drivers and consequences of inattention.

  abstract     = {We examine the effect of a U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding abortion laws on Americans’ preferences for political candidates. The decision was leaked in advance of the official announcement, and we track the evolution of political preferences from before to after the leak and, eventually, to after the formal announcement. The abortion issue was already very important to voters before the leak, but the Court’s decision did not simply make it more important for everyone. We find that the decision decreased the importance weight of abortion for Republicans, while increasing it for independents/nonvoters. Further, the decision increased Republican support for candidates who want to ban abortions although this effect is diminished for candidates that oppose exceptions for rape, incest, or the mother’s health. Nonaffiliated voters move sharply away from candidates who want to ban abortions without exceptions. The decision also resulted in a lasting polarization along gender lines whereby men became more likely to vote for a candidate that supports a ban on abortion, while women are less likely to support candidates that ban abortions.

However, this paper explores how a brand can generate value for a firm through the ability to deter entry of new competitors. In this respect, we distinguish between a brand’s direct effect on demand and its strategic effect on the behavior of rival firms. We investigate this within the context of the U.S. stacked chips category using a dynamic model that endogenizes brand building and entry decisions. We find that up to 63\% of a brand’s value can be derived from its ability to deter entry. Furthermore, we find that a brand is most valuable when the cost of entry that potential entrants face is moderate: neither too high nor too low. This paper was accepted by Matt Shum, marketing.

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has opened up many unprecedented opportunities in revolutionizing the digital marketing field. In this study, we designed a DRL-based personalized targeting strategy in a sequential setting. We show that the strategy is able to address three important challenges of sequential targeting: (1) forward looking (balancing between a firm’s current revenue and future revenues), (2) earning while learning (maximizing profits while continuously learning through exploration-exploitation), and (3) scalability (coping with a high-dimensional state and policy space). We illustrate this through a novel design of a DRL-based artificial intelligence (AI) agent. To better adapt DRL to complex consumer behavior dimensions, we proposed a quantization-based uncertainty learning heuristic for efficient exploration-exploitation. Our policy evaluation results through simulation suggest that the proposed DRL agent generates 26.75\% more long-term revenues than can the non-DRL approaches on average and learns 76.92\% faster than the second fastest model among all benchmarks. Further, in order to better understand the potential underlying mechanisms, we conducted multiple interpretability analyses to explain the patterns of learned optimal policy at both the individual and population levels. Our findings provide important managerial-relevant and theory-consistent insights. For instance, consecutive price promotions at the beginning can capture price-sensitive consumers’ immediate attention, whereas carefully spaced nonpromotional “cooldown” periods between price promotions can allow consumers to adjust their reference points. Additionally, consideration of future revenues is necessary from a long-term horizon, but weighing the future too much can also dampen revenues. In addition, analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects suggest that the optimal promotion sequence pattern highly varies across the consumer engagement stages. Overall, our study results demonstrate DRL’s potential to optimize these strategies’ combination to maximize long-term revenues. This paper was accepted by Kartik Hosanagar, information systems.

  abstract     = {Success tends to increase and failure tends to decrease the chances of future success. We show that this impact of past outcomes can change how diagnostic success or failure are regarding the competence of an individual or a firm. Succeeding under adverse circumstances is especially impressive when initial failure reduces the chances of success more for low-quality agents than for high-quality agents. Succeeding after initial failure (being a “successful underdog”) can also indicate higher expected quality than succeeding twice if initial success increases the chances of success of all agents to a high level. In different circumstances, the outcome after success can be especially informative about quality, implying that failing after an initial success (a “one-hit wonder”) indicates lower quality than failing twice does. We find effects consistent with our model in data on Canadian professional hockey players and on data from the Music Laboratory experiment: Initial failure combined with eventual success is associated with high quality. The results help to clarify when failure should be attributed to the person in charge or to the situation, when underdogs and individuals who overcome adversity are especially impressive and when a naïve “more is better” heuristic for evaluating performance can be misleading.

  abstract     = {Decisions in management and finance rely on information that often includes win-lose feedback (e.g., gains and losses, success and failure). Simple reinforcement then suggests to blindly repeat choices if they led to success in the past and change them otherwise, which might conflict with Bayesian updating of beliefs. We use finite mixture models and hidden Markov models, adapted from machine learning, to uncover behavioral heterogeneity in the reliance on difference behavioral rules across and within individuals in a belief-updating experiment. Most decision makers rely both on Bayesian updating and reinforcement. Paradoxically, an increase in incentives increases the reliance on reinforcement because the win-lose cues become more salient.

The policy that changes the liquidity premia on assets has broad implications for private-sector behavior and market efficiency. Liquidity tightening, that is, a reduction in the aggregate quantity of liquid debt, is associated with credit loosening, that is, an increase in funds raised through the issuance of private liquid debt. A positive liquidity premium on debt is required for capital-allocation efficiency, while a zero-liquidity premium is required for liquidity-allocation efficiency. The optimal policy balances these two considerations. Government purchase of private debt is needed to support low interest rates.

On the other hand, there can also be a crowding-in effect because high-precision disclosures indicate greater managerial confidence and higher investment, which increases the traders’ value of information. The crowding-in effect can dominate if the firm discloses above-average profitability.

  abstract     = {Prior studies document the role social media information plays in the stock market and the important dissimilarities between the bond and stock markets. Bridging these two types of literature, we examine the role of social media information in the corporate bond market. Analyzing a broad sample of messages by Twitter individual users, posted just prior to earnings announcements, containing bond, credit risk, and fundamental information, we find that aggregate Twitter opinion ( OPI ) predicts upcoming announcement bond returns and changes in credit default swap (CDS) spreads, and is associated with future changes in bond yield spreads and credit ratings, thereby providing economically important information to the bond market. This interpretation is bolstered by results from a variety of cross-sectional analyses. Finally, we document an association between OPI and future changes in default risk, which casts light on the nature of the Twitter information underlying our findings. Overall, our findings demonstrate that Twitter appears to disseminate potentially economically important information to even the presumably sophisticated bond and CDS investors, as well as information intermediaries.

  abstract     = {This study examines a reputation-concerned entrepreneur’s incentives to provide disaggregated information about a project’s future performance when the entrepreneur seeks to increase both the market price of the project and the market assessment of the entrepreneur’s ability as a project manager. Two factors determine equilibrium: (i) the informational quality of the signal related to the entrepreneur’s ability and (ii) the magnitude of reputational concerns. If the former is relatively low, the entrepreneur with moderate reputational concerns is more likely to provide disaggregated information when the signal about the project’s overall performance is intermediate than when it is sufficiently good or bad. Also, given any value of the signal about the overall performance, this entrepreneur withholds disaggregated information when the signal about the entrepreneur’s ability is intermediate rather than sufficiently good or bad. The comparative static results provide novel empirical predictions about disclosure of aggregate versus disaggregated information. This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.},

Agrawal, Ferguson, Toktay, and Thomas [Agrawal VV, Ferguson M, Toktay LB, Thomas VM (2012) Is leasing greener than selling? Management Sci. 58(3):523–533.] study the focal point of steady-state firm–consumer games for leasing and selling models. We note that the optimal solution for their selling model does not reflect self-replicated leases mirroring the lease offered by the firm and show that the solution is indeed erroneous as it violates the constraint on consumer-type cutoffs. Although this does not affect the structure of their propositions, that is, outlining thresholds for more profitability and greenness of selling compared with leasing, it renders the thresholds incorrect. We first uncover and fix the root cause of the error. We then distinguish the focal point analysis from the rental price approach and note a few remarks for future durable goods models.

  abstract     = {General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)—the European Union’s data protection regulation—has two key principles. It recognizes that individuals own and control their personal (but not contractual) data in perpetuity, leading to three critical privacy rights , namely, the rights to (i) explicit consent (data opt-in), (ii) to be forgotten (data erasure), and (iii) portability (data transfer). It also includes data security mandates against privacy breaches through unauthorized access. We study GDPR’s equilibrium impact by including these features in a dynamic two-period model of forward-looking firms and consumers. Firms collect consumer data for personalization and price discrimination. Consumers trade off gains from personalization relative to potential losses from privacy breaches and price discrimination in their purchase, data opt-in, erasure, and transfer decisions. Though data security mandates impose fines on firms for privacy breaches, firms can benefit from higher opt-in given lower breach risk. Surprisingly, data security mandates can hurt consumers. The effect of privacy rights is nuanced. Since the right to opt in separates goods exchange from the provision of personal data, it prevents market failure under high breach risk. But it also reduces consumer opt-in and personal data availability. Erasure and portability rights reduce consumers’ hold-up concerns by disciplining firms to provide ongoing value by limiting price discrimination and not slacking off on data security; but they also reduce the incentive to offer lower initial prices that encourages opt-in. Overall, privacy rights always benefit consumers in competitive markets, but they can surprisingly hurt consumers under monopoly, as monopolists have less incentives to subsidize consumer opt-in. They raise (reduce) firm profit and social welfare when breach risk is high (low). Finally, privacy rights increase firm profit most at moderate levels of data transferability.

  abstract     = {Although variable pricing enables sports teams to respond to changing demand across games, reports point to somewhat limited implementation. In this paper, we study the implications of a switch to variable pricing on the primary and resale ticket markets using quasi-experimental data from the National Football League. Applying a difference-in-differences technique with propensity score weighting, we first show that the adoption of variable pricing increases primary market ticket sales by 1.59\% per game. We then explore the mechanism behind this positive impact. We find that lower prices for the less attractive games are well received by customers, and customers do not have an unfavorable response to higher prices for the more attractive games. Our analysis of the customers’ activities in the resale market shows that the minimum resale market prices increase for the more attractive games following the switch to variable pricing. This analysis provides evidence for the increase in the option value created by the resale market and explains the positive response to higher prices for the more attractive games. Finally, we investigate when variable pricing is likely to be the most effective. We find that variable pricing has greater success in team hometowns with lower income levels and higher income diversity, and creating more game tiers in variable pricing leads to higher sales.

The paper demonstrates the framework’s application to regulate the U.S. radio broadcasting industry. In particular, it investigates the long-run efficacy of two commonly used merger heuristics: radio station ownership caps (see the Telecom Act of 1996) and static merger simulations.

  abstract     = {Ad targeting technology has enabled a highly personalized delivery of online ads. Behind this development is the belief that better targeting will lead to more relevant ads. This paper challenges this lay belief by showing that irrelevant advertising can arise not necessarily from technological imperfection but also from the incentive problem embedded in the ad agency-advertisers relationship. We first demonstrate that the ad agency serving multiple advertisers may strategically allocate an ad impression to a lesser-matched, sometimes totally irrelevant, niche advertiser because future impressions can match better with the mainstream advertiser. We further find that, without a contractual obligation to serve both advertisers, the agency may not deliver completely irrelevant ads to consumers. However, another type of inefficiency can arise where the agency may not send any ad to potentially interested consumers who have a strictly positive match probability with advertisers. These inefficiencies arise due to contractual restrictions, either contractual obligations or budget constraints, when the agency serves multiple advertisers. As such, we endogenize the advertisers’ contractual requirement choices and show how the contractual obligation(s) can arise in equilibrium. Finally, we show that irrelevant ads will not disappear simply because more impressions are available in the market. Our analysis suggests that as the number of impressions increases, the irrelevant ads can persist, but the probability of receiving irrelevant ads decreases.

  abstract     = {Counterfeits are available across many marketplaces. In emerging markets, in particular, consumers often observe a mix of counterfeits and authentic products sold by retailers. It is difficult for some consumers to distinguish between the two types of products. From these consumers’ perspective, the products can be considered as probabilistic goods, and we term retailers’ strategies probabilistic selling of counterfeits. Retailers who sell counterfeits are subject to a penalty by regulation. We develop a game-theoretical model to study this dishonest strategy under regulation. Our model offers the following insights. First, a higher penalty for selling counterfeits can lead to a smaller proportion of authentic products in the market. This finding is driven by a manufacturer’s strategic response: knowing that the penalty becomes higher, the manufacturer has greater incentives to raise the wholesale price of its authentic products. From the retailers’ point of view, this elevated procurement cost can, in turn, encourage them to lower the probability of their products being authentic. Second, manufacturer profit increases with the penalty, whereas retailer profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare do not, in general, exhibit a monotonic relationship with the penalty.

  abstract     = {Advancements in targeting technology have allowed firms to engage in more precise targeting based on several aspects of consumers’ preferences. Exposed to more targeted ads, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of being targeted and respond accordingly. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of multidimensional targeting under which consumers can draw inferences about multiple components of their utility from the advertised product. We show that the firm can be worse off under multidimensional targeting than under single-dimensional targeting, in which the firm targets consumers based only on a single component of their utility. This is because, with multidimensional targeting, targeted consumers may face greater uncertainty about on which specific dimension(s) they can expect to enjoy the advertised product. Therefore, they may be less willing to exert a costly effort of clicking the ad and making a purchase decision. When this result holds, the firm may want to adopt a single-dimensional targeting strategy. However, we show that the firm cannot credibly commit to such a strategy once given access to multiple dimensions of customer data. Interestingly, a higher unit cost of advertising can mitigate the firm’s commitment problem for using customer data and thus increase the firm’s profit. Moreover, the firm can sometimes lower the price to recover some of, but not entirely offset, the drawbacks of multidimensional targeting. We discuss the implications of our results regarding the current practice of targeted advertising and data privacy protection policies. This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.

  abstract     = {Research in psychology shows that consumption goals can help consumers avoid excessive consumption of vice goods and the associated long-term harm. In this paper, we propose a model of self-control with consumption goals and examine how goals moderate the behavior of consumers and the firm’s strategy. We find that consumers’ personal goals lead to a lower price for a less unhealthy product but a higher price for a more unhealthy product. Furthermore, even though personal goals reduce the sales of a product, the firm can be better off if consumers have goals rather than no goals. The improvement in the firm’s profits need not be at consumers’ expense. In fact, consumer welfare increases with personal goals. In some contexts, consumption is not driven by personal goals but shaped by social norms, such as the advice of experts or social groups. We find that, unlike personal goals, normative goals make consumers less sensitive to price and do not always improve consumer welfare. Furthermore, normative goals can hurt the firm’s profits in contexts in which personal goals could improve profits. Finally, we show that our framework with dynamically inconsistent preferences yields results that are consistent with alternative formulations of consumer self-control problems, such as the dual-self model of Thaler and Shefrin and the costly self-control model of Gul and Pesendorfer.

  abstract     = {Whether to purchase a product is of fundamental importance to marketing, but purchasing behaviors vary widely across individuals and contexts. This paper proposes that a sizeable fraction of this variation is associated with differences in the time at which a product’s desirability and its price are processed and utilized by consumers. To test this hypothesis, participants purchased different products while their mouse cursor movements associated with purchasing an option were recorded across three laboratory studies. These natural cursor movements and estimates from a cognitive model identified the time at which product desirability and price each began to influence decisions. On average, we found that product desirability impacted the decision-making process significantly earlier than price. Moreover, the difference in the time at which product and price influenced choice explained a sizeable fraction of the variation in the option that was purchased. Additional analysis and studies revealed that the time at which an attribute begins to influence decisions can be altered by simple marketing actions, such as a product’s visual display and price discount framing, and that these actions have consequences for choice. Together, these results add to our understanding of how consumers make simple purchasing decisions. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.

  abstract     = {Because the average treatment effect (ATE) measures the change in social welfare, even if positive, there is a risk of negative effect on, say, some 10\% of the population. Assessing such risk is difficult, however, because any one individual treatment effect (ITE) is never observed, so the 10\% worst-affected cannot be identified, whereas distributional treatment effects only compare the first deciles within each treatment group, which does not correspond to any 10\% subpopulation. In this paper, we consider how to nonetheless assess this important risk measure, formalized as the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of the ITE distribution. We leverage the availability of pretreatment covariates and characterize the tightest possible upper and lower bounds on ITE-CVaR given by the covariate-conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. We then proceed to study how to estimate these bounds efficiently from data and construct confidence intervals. This is challenging even in randomized experiments as it requires understanding the distribution of the unknown CATE function, which can be very complex if we use rich covariates to best control for heterogeneity. We develop a debiasing method that overcomes this and prove it enjoys favorable statistical properties even when CATE and other nuisances are estimated by black box machine learning or even inconsistently. Studying a hypothetical change to French job search counseling services, our bounds and inference demonstrate a small social benefit entails a negative impact on a substantial subpopulation.

  abstract     = {Trade credit is an important source of short-term financing and an integrated part in supply contracts. Although a number of theories have been proposed on how trade credit could improve supply chain efficiency, causal studies on the impact of trade credit on operational decisions are scarce. In this study, we examine the impact of trade credit on inventory decisions using an empirical strategy that leverages (i) an exogenous shock imparted by the French government’s intervention to impose a ceiling on trade credit duration, (ii) a triple difference-in-differences identification strategy, and (iii) synthetic controls (SCs). By considering the 60-day ceiling coverage and SC construction requirements, we identify four French retail sectors as our main sample. Among them, in the postregulation period, the hardware retail sector firms on average exhibited a significant 16\% decline in trade credit usage. Correspondingly, these firms also displayed a significant 11\% decline in inventory level. In the remaining three sectors, we found mixed results in the main sample. All the four sectors, however, show consistent support for a causal link between trade credit and inventory in a subsample compiled using a stringent 90-day ceiling criterion. Collectively, our findings offer direct evidence that trade credit is an indispensable financing source for inventory procurement. Finally, in the postregulation period, the hardware retailers exhibited a 15.5\% decline in revenue and 3.5\% reduction in gross profit. This cautions policy makers that regulations limiting the use of trade credit may have unintended consequences on downstream firms, and may harm overall supply chain efficiency.

  abstract     = {We study the design of a decentralized two-sided matching market in which agents’ search is guided by the platform. There are finitely many agent types, each with (potentially random) preferences drawn from known type-specific distributions. Equipped with knowledge of these distributions, the platform guides the search process by determining the meeting rate between each pair of types from the two sides. Focusing on symmetric pairwise preferences in a continuum model, we first characterize the unique stationary equilibrium that arises given a feasible set of meeting rates. We then introduce the platform’s optimal directed search problem, which involves optimizing meeting rates to maximize equilibrium social welfare. We first show that incentive issues arising from congestion and cannibalization make the design problem fairly intricate. Nonetheless, we develop an efficiently computable search design whose corresponding equilibrium achieves at least 1 / 4 the social welfare of the optimal design. In fact, our construction always recovers at least 1 / 4 the first-best social welfare, where agents’ incentives are disregarded. Our search design is simple and easy to implement, as its corresponding bipartite graph consists of disjoint stars. Furthermore, our design implies the platform can substantially limit choice and yet induce an equilibrium with approximately optimal welfare. We offer alternative search designs with improved approximation factors for markets with certain special structures. Finally, we show that approximation is likely the best one can hope for by establishing that the problem of designing optimal directed search is NP -hard to even approximate beyond a certain constant factor.

  abstract     = {In after-sales product support, both literature and practice have highlighted the advantages of paying for performance under performance-based contracts (PBC) over the more traditional transaction-based contracts (TBC) that tie supplier payments to each repair incident. Although PBC is believed to better align incentives in the supply chain when the supplier’s private effort is difficult to verify, emerging technologies can make the repair process more transparent, which can eliminate the supplier’s moral hazard problem. Meanwhile, fast growth of service outsourcing for established products makes information asymmetry with regards to product failure rates a new challenge for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) operations. To analyze this changing environment, we build a stylized adverse selection model and explore which contract is more efficient in dealing with information asymmetry. We assume that equipment failure rates are only known by the customer, whose outside options are type dependent. The uninformed supplier has to design appropriate mechanisms to overcome the disadvantages of this information structure while maximizing profits. We show that the two contracts demonstrate different screening ability, and TBC may be preferred over PBC. Type-dependent outside options can lead to countervailing incentives, making PBC immune to information asymmetry and enabling it to achieve the first-best outcome. When the differential of outside options has a relatively stronger effect compared with the differential of failure rates, TBC can bring the supplier a higher ex ante payoff than PBC. Our paper brings to light a heretofore unknown advantage of TBC, and we demonstrate when these contracts are likely to be observed in the third-party MRO market.

  abstract     = {Mergers and acquisitions in healthcare are increasingly leading to changes in firm management. This paper studies how a change in firm management impacts clinical performance using data on an understudied phenomenon: medical practice acquisitions by physician practice management companies (PPMCs). PPMCs market themselves as offloading the administrative burden of running a medical practice without compromising physician autonomy over clinical decisions. However, a PPMC’s management strategy and practices, such as performance monitoring and financial incentives, could influence physician behavior. For example, some PPMCs advertise increasing revenue through better financial management, whereas others also advertise improving quality through better clinical management. In this paper, I collect data on three large PPMCs that manage the practices of more than 40\% of obstetricians and gynecologists (Ob-Gyns) in Florida between 2006 and 2014. An Ob-Gyn’s main clinical decision in childbirth involves a tradeoff between financial and clinical outcomes: cesarean sections (C-sections) are often more highly reimbursed than vaginal births but pose risks to maternal and infant health when not medically necessary. Using difference-in-differences methods, I find heterogeneous effects on C-sections depending on a PPMC’s publicized management strategy. Physicians acquired by PPMCs that focus on financial management increase the use of C-sections, resulting in less clinically appropriate care and worse patient outcomes. The opposite result is found when PPMCs focus on clinical management. I provide qualitative and quantitative evidence that differences in firm management are the most likely driver of changes in C-sections. This paper informs how the corporatization of medicine can alter clinical performance outcomes. This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.

  abstract     = {Online marketplaces, such as Amazon, Alibaba, Google Shopping, and JD.com, allow sellers to promote their products by charging them for the right to be displayed on top of organic search results. In this paper, we study the problem of designing auctions for sponsored products and highlight some new challenges emerging from the interplay of two unique features: substitution effects and information asymmetry. The presence of substitution effects, which we capture by assuming that consumers choose sellers according to a multinomial logit model, implies that the probability a seller is chosen depends on the assortment of sellers displayed alongside. Additionally, sellers may hold private information about how their own products match consumers’ interests, which the platform can elicit to make better assortment decisions. We first show that the first-best allocation, that is, the welfare-maximizing assortment in the absence of private information, cannot be implemented truthfully in general. Thus motivated, we initiate the study of incentive-compatible assortment optimization by characterizing prior-independent and prior-dependent mechanisms and quantifying the worst-case social cost of implementing truthful assortment mechanisms. An important finding is that the worst-case social cost of implementing truthful mechanisms can be high when the number of sellers is large. Structurally, we show that optimal mechanisms may need to downward distort the efficient allocation both at the top and the bottom.

  abstract     = {Do political differences, which are becoming increasingly acute among Americans, inhibit market transactions? We study this by examining whether the perceived political distance between investors and borrowers in an online lending market affects whom investors choose to fund. Using two complementary empirical approaches (a gravity model and a difference-in-differences analysis), we find a nuanced effect: Investors from comparatively conservative states consider political distance when making lending decisions, whereas investors from comparatively liberal states do not. Lending activity drops by as much as 11.6\% when the investor’s state is more conservative than the borrower’s state. We also find that political distance between investors and borrowers reduces the likelihood that a borrower’s listing will be funded, thereby limiting the ability of the market to fulfill its function. However, political distance does not predict loan performance, which is consistent with another finding: The relationship of political distance to lending activity is not significant for experienced investors. It may be that investors stop considering political distance after they learn from experience that it does not predict loan performance. We find evidence for two mechanisms underlying our results: (1) a preference-based mechanism, in which investors from conservative states have a general preference for borrowers from conservative states, and (2) a rationality-based mechanism in which investors from conservative states use political ideology as a signal of creditworthiness (rightly or wrongly). Our results contribute to the literatures on online frictions and political (in)tolerance and have implications for the design of online lending (and other) markets.

  abstract     = {Decision research often takes the variability of potential outcomes as a measure of risk. It thus characterizes sure things, which, by definition, guarantee a specific outcome, as safe. But is this characterization always empirically valid? We show that, when the prevailing reference point is an uncertain option or position, sure things can be perceived as risky rather than safe. Furthermore, preferences may hinge on such perceptions: when construed as risky, sure things can be less appealing. Our findings suggest a perception-based explanation for why the classic tendency to favor sure things over uncertain options is often attenuated given an uncertain reference point. More broadly, they tap an unresolved debate about the determinants of decisions. Much research focuses on taste-based determinants, such as attitudes toward perceived risks, and thereby underplays the critical role of the underlying perceptions. Appreciating the impact of perceptions on decision making leads to novel prescriptive recommendations. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, decision analysis.

  abstract     = {In jobs in which workers have the flexibility to decide how much work to supply, such as in the gig economy, the effect of a wage change on work supply can be hard to predict. A wage increase offers workers the opportunity to make more money. At the same time, it allows them to make money faster, so they can enjoy more leisure and do not need to work as much. Economic theory alone does not predict which outcome is more likely to occur, and the empirical evidence is also mixed. This paper provides some psychological insights into this economic problem by showing that the short-term effect of a wage change on work supply depends on how the change is framed. Given a current wage of “work l hours to earn $ m ,” a pay-change frame (“work the same l hours and earn $ M ”) facilitates a change in work supply in the same direction as the wage change, whereas a load-change frame (“work L hours and earn the same $ m ”) facilitates the opposite change. Hence, if strategically framed, a wage decrease can elicit the same increase in work supply as a wage increase. A set of studies demonstrate this wage frame effect on both actual work performance and expressed willingness to work. The findings from these studies offer a behavioral perspective on a classic labor economics problem, document a novel framing effect for the judgment and decision-making literature, and suggest a nudge strategy that managers and policy makers can use in incentive designs.

We consider a setting in which mandatory disclosure is a disaggregated disclosure (e.g., a financial statement), voluntary disclosure is an aggregate disclosure (e.g., an earnings forecast), and the costs of each type of disclosure are distinct. In this setting, we show that managers endogenously substitute between the two types of disclosure; managers that choose to withhold information from mandatory disclosure are more likely to provide voluntary disclosure. We test our predictions using a comprehensive sample of mandatory disclosures in which the SEC allows the firm to redact information that would otherwise jeopardize its competitive position. Consistent with our predictions, we find strong evidence that redacted mandatory disclosure is associated with greater voluntary disclosure. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.

  abstract     = {Analysts’ street earnings forecasts are sometimes based on GAAP earnings and sometimes based on non-GAAP earnings, which exclude various GAAP earnings components. Therefore, differences in analysts’ street earnings forecasts may capture differences in not only expected performance but also the earnings metric forecasted. We argue that analysts who forecast non-GAAP, rather than GAAP, street earnings are more likely to separately analyze earnings components. Consistent with this argument, we find that analysts who forecast non-GAAP street earnings issue relatively more accurate forecasts. We also argue that excluded earnings components often reflect negative transitory items, and that variation across analysts in the earnings metric forecasted suggests that the negative excluded items are forecasted by only a subset of analysts. Consistent with this assertion, we find that variation across analysts in the earnings metric forecasted is associated with a lower consensus GAAP earnings surprise and lower stock returns around the earnings announcement. Finally, although variation in the earnings metric forecasted is a source of analyst forecast dispersion, we find that it is also incrementally associated with a lower earnings response coefficient, consistent with the existence of transitory items. We therefore find that the variation in the earnings metric forecasted is an important source of analyst forecast dispersion that predicts not only a lower earnings surprise but also a lower earnings response.

  abstract     = {We examine which categories of option trading volume carry information about future stock prices around corporate news announcements. We predict and find that purchases of options are informative on news days and ahead of unscheduled events but not before scheduled events, and sales of options predict returns only ahead of scheduled news releases. Therefore, although the arrival of new information is an important reason why option volume predicts stock returns, this relation depends on whether the information is scheduled or unscheduled because only the former affects volatility and thus option prices. We also study how trading costs and margin costs affect ex post profitability around news. This paper was accepted by Karl Diether, finance. Funding: D.

  abstract     = {Based on an online experiment with a sample of finance professionals and participants from the general population (acting as clients), we examine drivers and motives of clients’ choices to delegate investment decisions to agents. We find that clients favor delegation to investment algorithms, followed by delegation to finance professionals compensated with an aligned incentive scheme, and lastly to finance professionals receiving a fixed payment for investing on behalf of others. We show that trust in investment algorithms or finance professionals, and clients’ propensity to shift blame on others increase the likelihood of delegation, whereas clients’ own decision-making quality is associated with a decrease in delegation frequency.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the attention effect in the options market. We show that option investors (especially retail investors) buy more calls and puts on both daily winner and loser stocks, and this buying pressure leads to an overvaluation, as shown in subsequent lower hedged returns. The overvaluation is due to a combination of differences of opinion, risk aversion, and margin requirements. The economic magnitude is large. For instance, a zero-financing portfolio involving options on loser stocks renders an alpha of 2.90\% per month. Aside from contributing to the broad literature of investor attention versus asset returns, our study also sheds light on an important yet largely neglected topic: the impact of margins on option trading and pricing.

  abstract     = {We examine whether rating agencies act defensively toward issuers with a higher likelihood of default. We find that agencies’ qualitative soft rating adjustments are more accurate as issuers’ default risk grows, as evidenced by the adjustments leading to lower type I and type II error rates and better prediction of default and default recovery losses. We also find that soft adjustments’ relevance increases with issuers’ default risk, as evidenced by the adjustments being more predictive of initial offering yields and leading to a greater market reaction to rating changes. Further, we find that the rating agencies assign better educated and more experienced analysts to higher-risk issuers, providing evidence of one mechanism used by the rating agencies to generate more accurate and relevant soft adjustments. Overall, our study suggests that as the likelihood of issuer default grows, the threat of reputational harm from discovered rating failures increasingly mitigates the rating agencies’ strategic behavior incentivized by the issuer-pay model.

Higher paid CIOs outperform their counterparts by 47–60 basis points per year, largely through increased and superior investment in private equity and real estate. This outperformance generates an additional $74.91–$95.63 million in economic value. Plans offering higher compensation hire better educated CIOs and are more likely to retain their CIOs. Higher CIO compensation is positively correlated with the use of incentive compensation, but incentive compensation does not directly affect performance. Demand- and supply-side frictions help explain the variation in CIO pay and the persistent low compensation paid by some plans despite the positive relation between compensation and performance.

  abstract     = {We examine the link between the scarcity of arbitrage capital and investors’ response to firms’ earnings information. The cost of financing levered investment strategies (i.e., investing with borrowed funds) increases in the risk profile of the securities being traded. As a result, when capital is scarce, levered traders face heightened incentives to tilt their portfolios in the direction of firms’ earnings information as an indicator of lesser risk because doing so mitigates financing constraints. Our results suggest that these investors become more responsive to firms’ earnings announcements when capital is scarce. Moreover, market prices display a stronger reaction to firms’ announcements and less postearnings announcement drift. Together, our findings suggest the scarcity of arbitrage capital spurs both the use of and responsiveness of market prices to firms’ earnings news.

  abstract     = {Switchback experiments, where a firm sequentially exposes an experimental unit to random treatments, are among the most prevalent designs used in the technology sector, with applications ranging from ride-hailing platforms to online marketplaces. Although practitioners have widely adopted this technique, the derivation of the optimal design has been elusive, hindering practitioners from drawing valid causal conclusions with enough statistical power. We address this limitation by deriving the optimal design of switchback experiments under a range of different assumptions on the order of the carryover effect—the length of time a treatment persists in impacting the outcome. We cast the optimal experimental design problem as a minimax discrete optimization problem, identify the worst-case adversarial strategy, establish structural results, and solve the reduced problem via a continuous relaxation. For switchback experiments conducted under the optimal design, we provide two approaches for performing inference. The first provides exact randomization-based p -values, and the second uses a new finite population central limit theorem to conduct conservative hypothesis tests and build confidence intervals. We further provide theoretical results when the order of the carryover effect is misspecified and provide a data-driven procedure to identify the order of the carryover effect. We conduct extensive simulations to study the numerical performance and empirical properties of our results and conclude with practical suggestions.

  abstract     = {We study the effectiveness of information design in reducing congestion in social services catering to users with varied levels of need. In the absence of price discrimination and centralized admission, the provider relies on sharing information about wait times to improve welfare. We consider a stylized model with heterogeneous users who differ in their private outside options: low-need users have an acceptable outside option to the social service, whereas high-need users have no viable outside option. Upon arrival, a user decides to wait for the service by joining an unobservable first-come-first-serve queue, or leave and seek her outside option. To reduce congestion and improve social outcomes, the service provider seeks to persuade more low-need users to avail their outside option, and thus better serve high-need users. We characterize the Pareto-efficient signaling mechanisms and compare their welfare outcomes against several benchmarks. We show that if either type is the overwhelming majority of the population, then information design does not provide improvement over sharing full information or no information. On the other hand, when the population is sufficiently heterogeneous, information design not only Pareto-dominates full-information and no-information mechanisms, in some regimes it also achieves the same welfare as the “first-best,” that is, the Pareto-efficient centralized admission policy with knowledge of users’ types.

  abstract     = {Motivated by online decision making in time-varying combinatorial environments, we study the problem of transforming offline algorithms to their online counterparts. We focus on offline combinatorial problems that are amenable to a constant factor approximation using a greedy algorithm that is robust to local errors. For such problems, we provide a general framework that efficiently transforms offline robust greedy algorithms to online ones using Blackwell approachability. We show that the resulting online algorithms have O ( T ) (approximate) regret under the full information setting. We further introduce a bandit extension of Blackwell approachability that we call Bandit Blackwell approachability. We leverage this notion to transform greedy robust offline algorithms into a O ( T 2 / 3 ) (approximate) regret in the bandit setting. Demonstrating the flexibility of our framework, we apply our offline-to-online transformation to several problems at the intersection of revenue management, market design, and online optimization, including product ranking optimization in online platforms, reserve price optimization in auctions, and submodular maximization. We also extend our reduction to greedy-like first-order methods used in continuous optimization, such as those used for maximizing continuous strong DR monotone submodular functions subject to convex constraints. We show that our transformation, when applied to these applications, leads to new regret bounds or improves the current known bounds. We complement our theoretical studies by conducting numerical simulations for two of our applications, in both of which we observe that the numerical performance of our transformations outperforms the theoretical guarantees in practical instances.

  abstract     = {Cold start describes a commonly recognized challenge for online advertising platforms: with limited data, the machine learning system cannot accurately estimate the click-through rates (CTR) of new ads and, in turn, cannot efficiently price these new ads or match them with platform users. Traditional cold start algorithms often focus on improving the learning rates of CTR for new ads to improve short-term revenue, but unsuccessful cold start can prompt advertisers to leave the platform, decreasing the thickness of the ad marketplace. To address these issues, we build a data-driven optimization model that captures the essential trade-off between short-term revenue and long-term market thickness on the platform. Based on duality theory and bandit algorithms, we develop the shadow bidding with learning (SBL) algorithms with a provable regret upper bound of O ( T 2 / 3 K 1 / 3 ( log T ) 1 / 3 d 1 / 2 ) , where K is the number of ads and d captures the error magnitude of the underlying machine learning oracle for predicting CTR. Our proposed algorithms can be implemented in a real online advertising system with minimal adjustments. To demonstrate this practicality, we have collaborated with a large-scale video-sharing platform, conducting a novel, two-sided randomized field experiment to examine the effectiveness of our SBL algorithm. Our results show that the algorithm increased the cold start success rate by 61.62\% while compromising short-term revenue by only 0.717\%. Our algorithm has also boosted the platform’s overall market thickness by 3.13\% and its long-term advertising revenue by (at least) 5.35\%. Our study bridges the gap between the theory of bandit algorithms and the practice of cold start in online advertising, highlighting the value of well-designed cold start algorithms for online advertising platforms.

  abstract     = {The log realized volatility (RV) is often modeled as an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model ARFIMA( 1 , d , 0 ). Two conflicting empirical results have been found in the literature. One stream shows that log RV has a long memory (i.e., the fractional parameter d &gt; 0). The other stream suggests that the autoregressive coefficient α is near unity with antipersistent errors (i.e., d &lt; 0). This paper explains how these conflicting empirical findings can coexist in the context of ARFIMA( 1 , d , 0 ) model by examining the finite sample properties of popular estimation methods, including semiparametric methods and parametric maximum likelihood methods. The finite sample results suggest that it is challenging to distinguish Model 1 (ARFIMA( 1 , d , 0 ) with α close to 0 and d close to 0.5) from Model 2 (ARFIMA( 1 , d , 0 ) with α close to unity and d close to –0.5). An intuitive explanation is given. For the 10 financial assets considered, despite that no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the data-generating process, we find that the frequency domain maximum likelihood (or Whittle) method can generate the most accurate out-of-sample forecasts.

  abstract     = {A novel laboratory experiment is used to show that mismatching between task preferences and task assignment strongly undermines worker performance and leads to free riding in teams. Unlike prior experiments using real effort tasks, task preferences are elicited from all workers. Under team-based remuneration (revenue sharing), free riding is significant, but this effect is largely driven by those working on undesired tasks. Workers’ endogenous sorting into tasks improves productivity as it mitigates task mismatching although workers’ task selection per se has only small effects on work performance and effort provisions beyond the positive sorting effects.

  abstract     = {Trust is an important element of many financial transactions. Yet, the financial industry has been struggling with public mistrust. One explanation for this could be the selection of individuals who wish to work in and get job offers from the financial industry. In this paper, we examine the selection into the financial industry based on social preferences. We identify the social preferences of business and economics students, and, for more than six years, follow up on their early career choices and their job placement after graduation. Students eager to work in the financial industry behave in a substantially less trustworthy manner and show less willingness to cooperate than those with other career plans. The job market does not alleviate this selection. Those subjects who find their first permanent job in finance behave in significantly less trustworthy manner in a trust game than those working in other industries.

  abstract     = {Health wearables in combination with gamification enable interventions that have the potential to increase physical activity—a key determinant of health. However, the extant literature does not provide conclusive evidence on the benefits of gamification, and there are persistent concerns that competition-based gamification approaches will only benefit those who are highly active at the expense of those who are sedentary. We investigate the effect of Fitbit leaderboards on the number of steps taken by the user. Using a unique data set of Fitbit wearable users, some of whom participate in a leaderboard, we find that leaderboards lead to a 370 (3.5\%) step increase in the users’ daily physical activity. However, we find that the benefits of leaderboards are highly heterogeneous. Surprisingly, we find that those who were highly active prior to adoption are hurt by leaderboards and walk 630 fewer steps daily after adoption (a 5\% relative decrease). In contrast, those who were sedentary prior to adoption benefited substantially from leaderboards and walked an additional 1,300 steps daily after adoption (a 15\% relative increase). We find that these effects emerge because sedentary individuals benefit even when leaderboards are small and when they do not rank first on them. In contrast, highly active individuals are harmed by smaller leaderboards and only see benefit when they rank highly on large leaderboards. We posit that this unexpected divergence in effects could be due to the underappreciated potential of noncompetition dynamics (e.g., changes in expectations for exercise) to benefit sedentary users, but harm more active ones.

  abstract     = {With one-third of marriages in the United States beginning online, online dating platforms have become important curators of the modern social fabric. Prior work on online dating has elicited two critical frictions in the heterosexual dating market. Women, governed by age-old social norms of not making the first move, are inhibited in their interactions in that they do not initiate contact with men. On the other side, men send an abundance of messages, the majority of which do not convert to matches. A key distinguishing feature of online dating versus its traditional counterpart is the ability to leave a range of digital signals not replicable in the offline world. These digital signals can impact the nature of online dating platform outcomes. In this paper, we study the impact of a feature that reveals “ who likes you ” (WLY) on engagement, the number of matches, match efficiency, and match sorting in online dating. This feature reveals the identity of the voters who have rated the focal user with a like. To causally identify the effect of this feature, we conduct a large-scale randomized control trial in collaboration with a major North American dating platform. The treatment causes women to be more proactive, sending 7.4\% more messages, which is a highly desirable market improvement given that men send double the number of messages compared with women. Further, we find that the women endowed with this feature increase their matches by 14.4\%, whereas men increase their matches by 11.5\%. Analyzing the moderating impact of desirability—a key aspect of the WLY feature—provides us with nuanced findings. Depending on the levels of each of the two parties’ desirability, we see evidence of sorting, encouragement, and discouragement. This paper was accepted by Anandhi Bharadwaj, information systems.

  abstract     = {The scalability of a marketplace depends on the operations of the marketplace platform and its sellers’ capacities. In this study, we explore one strategy that a marketplace platform can use to enhance its scalability: providing an ancillary service to sellers. In our model, a platform can choose whether and when to provide this service to sellers and, if so, what prices to charge and which types of sellers to serve. Although such a service helps small sellers, we highlight that the provision of such a service can diminish the incentives of large sellers to make their own investment, thereby reducing their potential output. When the output reduction by large sellers is substantial, the platform may not want to provide the ancillary service, and, even if it does, it may choose to set a price higher than its marginal cost to motivate large sellers to scale. The platform may also choose to strategically delay the provision of the service. This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.

  abstract     = {When acquiring consumer data for marketing or new business initiatives, it is important to decide what attributes or features of potential customers should be acquired. We study a new feature selection problem in the context of customer data acquisition in which different features have different acquisition costs. This feature selection problem is studied for linear regression and logistic regression. We formulate the feature selection and acquisition problems as nonlinear discrete optimization problems that minimize prediction errors subject to a budget constraint. We derive the analytical properties of the solutions for the problems, develop a computational procedure for solving the problems, provide an intuitive interpretation for the feature selection criteria, and discuss managerial implications of the solution approach. The results of the experimental study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. This paper was accepted by Kartik Hosanagar, information systems.

  abstract     = {We study the maintenance of a machine that deteriorates according to a Markov process until it fails. When failure occurs (which is observable), corrective replacement is made. Otherwise, the machine can be in one of two unobservable working states, and the decision maker can choose production, inspection, or preventive replacement. The state is revealed upon inspection and is reset by corrective or preventive replacement. The objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over an infinite horizon. We derive an exact, analytical solution to this problem via a dual framework for partially observable Markov decision processes. The solution can be easily computed without value iteration. We identify six possible structures of the optimal solution, which are represented as graphs. Each graph contains an absorbing, cyclic subgraph that governs the steady-state behavior of the machine. The exact analytical solution facilitates comparative statics analysis, comprehensive numerical studies, and the generation of insights. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {One of the most prevalent demand models in the revenue management literature is based on dividing the selling horizon into a number of time periods such that there is at most one customer arrival at each time period. This demand model is equivalent to using a discrete-time approximation to a Poisson process, but it has an important shortcoming. If the mean number of customer arrivals is large, then the coefficient of variation of the number of customer arrivals has to be small. In other words, large demand volume and large demand variability cannot coexist in this demand model. In this paper, we start with a revenue management model that incorporates general mean and variance for the number of customer arrivals. This revenue management model has a random selling horizon length, capturing the distribution of the number of customer arrivals. The question we seek to answer is the form of the fluid approximation that corresponds to this revenue management model. It is tempting to construct the fluid approximation by computing the expected consumption of the resource capacities in the constraints and the total expected revenue in the objective function through the distribution of the number of customer arrivals. We demonstrate that this answer is wrong in the sense that it yields a fluid approximation that is not asymptotically tight as the resource capacities get large. We give an alternative fluid approximation where perhaps surprisingly, the distribution of the number of customer arrivals does not play any role in the constraints. We show that this fluid approximation is asymptotically tight as the resource capacities get large. A numerical study also demonstrates that the policies driven by the latter fluid approximation perform substantially better, so there is practical value in getting the fluid approximation right under high-variance demand.

  abstract     = {Buying display ad impressions via real-time auctions comes with significant allocation and price uncertainties. We design and analyze a contract that mitigates this uncertainty risk by providing guaranteed allocation and prices while maintaining the efficiency of buying in an auction. We study how risk aversion affects the desire for guarantees and how to price a guaranteed allocation. We propose to augment the traditional auction with a programmatic purchase option (which we call a Market-Maker contract ) that removes allocation and price uncertainties. Instead of participating in the auction, advertisers can secure impressions in advance at a fixed premium price offered by the Market-Maker. It is then the responsibility of the Market-Maker to procure these impressions by bidding in the auction. We model buyers as risk-averse agents and analyze the equilibrium outcome when buyers face two purchase options (auction and Market-Maker contract). We derive analytical expressions for the Market-Maker price that reveal insightful relationships with uncertainties in the auction price and buyers’ risk levels. We also show the existence of a Market-Maker price that simultaneously improves the seller’s revenue and the sum of buyers’ utilities. As a building block to our analysis, we establish the truthfulness of the multiunit auction when buyers have nonquasilinear utilities because of risk aversion. Recently, the Google’s Display &amp; Video 360 platform started offering a product akin to Market-Maker called “Guaranteed Packages,” which was inspired by this paper.

We study China’s 2017 issuance of two U.S. dollar (USD)-denominated sovereign bonds when there were (effectively) no outstanding USD sovereigns. We find that Chinese corporate USD bonds experienced a four- to nine-basis-point decline in yield spreads, whereas corporate renminbi (RMB) bonds did not. The effect was stronger for corporate bonds with maturities similar to those of the USD sovereigns. Further consistent with the reference effect, USD-denominated corporate bonds experienced declines in bid-ask spreads and volatility; corporate bond yield spread changes became more sensitive to sovereign yield innovations; and the less-informed foreign mutual funds significantly increased their holdings of offshore USD Chinese corporate bonds. Limited evidence indicates that new corporate bond maturities shifted toward the sovereign bonds’ maturity after their issuance. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance. Funding: B.

  abstract     = {I develop a continuous-time model to examine how the interaction between competition and financial constraints affects firms’ research and development (R&amp;D) strategies. The model integrates two key characteristics of R&amp;D investment: accelerability (i.e., higher R&amp;D intensity leads to faster discovery) and scalability (i.e., higher R&amp;D intensity leads to higher project payoff). I find that firms react strategically to their rivals’ financial constraints when making investment decisions in a duopoly R&amp;D race. In particular, firms respond positively to the R&amp;D intensity of an unconstrained rival, while they respond in a hump-shaped fashion to the R&amp;D intensity of a constrained rival. As a result, a constrained firm can pre-empt an unconstrained competitor in market equilibrium. Accelerability is necessary for such pre-emption to occur, and scalability generally reduces its likelihood. Comparison with a monopoly benchmark shows that the economic mechanism differs from over-investment induced by financial constraints alone. The model also generates new implications regarding how project characteristics and cash flow risks impact R&amp;D decisions. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.

Shared analysts are also more likely to issue estimates about the acquirer in the proximity of the impending deal and their estimates are associated with a decrease in the uncertainty about acquirer’s cash flows. Our results highlight how the position of analysts in a deal results in an informational edge that enhances the screening of deals and mitigation of the acquirer’s informational disadvantage. Shared analysts who enhance the acquirer’s ability to screen out deals also exhibit superior career outcomes post-completion. We find similar results in the pre- and post-Regulation Fair Disclosure period, using brokerage house closures as a quasi-natural experiment and after controlling for analysts’ affiliations.

  abstract     = {Using terrorist attacks as an exogenous shock to uncertainty, we provide evidence that firms located near terrorism-stricken areas are less likely takeover targets for two years after the attack and receive lower acquisition premiums. The latter finding is reflected in lower target firm abnormal returns and synergy gains. Additionally, in terrorism-stricken areas, target firms are associated with a lower share of synergies, withdrawn deals rise, and acquirers are more likely to get involved in acquisitions of target firms located in different metropolitan statistical areas than their own or acquire faraway target firms. We attribute our results to the real options theory, which predicts that high uncertainty increases the value of the option to delay investments. Additionally, we show that the impact on target firm human capital and acquirer CEO uncertainty and fear are potential sources of terrorism-induced uncertainty with the former source prevailing over the latter.

  abstract     = {Institutional investors’ proxy voting decisions are influenced by their neighbors. I identify peer effects in proxy voting using close-call votes on shareholder-sponsored governance proposals at publicly traded financial institutions (focal institutions). I first show that the passage of a governance proposal at a focal institution makes the institution more likely to vote against management at its portfolio firms. Using a triple-difference approach, I find that the neighboring institutions of the focal institution that passes a governance proposal become more likely to vote against management in stocks that are heavily held by the focal institution. These results suggest that peer influence is an important determinant of proxy voting behavior. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

  abstract     = {I develop a continuous-time general equilibrium model with a continuum of states of the world and a continuum of agents endowed with heterogeneous beliefs. The model permits to analyze the interactions between financial markets and production. There is a single firm that faces convex adjustment costs and maximizes its terminal value. Equivalently, the firm uses decreasing returns to scale risk-return technology. The model is tractable and matches many of the empirical regularities in aggregate output and stock prices, such as a financial volatility that is higher than the macroeconomic volatility, skewness, kurtosis, short-term momentum, and volatility risk premium during recessions. All these aspects disappear when one assumes beliefs homogeneity or constant returns to scale. In particular, the impact of beliefs heterogeneity observed in endowment economies does not pertain when introducing production unless one assumes decreasing returns to scale in the risk-return technology.

  abstract     = {Modern consumers are concerned about not only their material payoff, but also the fairness of the transaction when making purchasing decisions. In this paper, we investigate how consumers’ inequity aversion affects a manufacturer who sources inputs from upstream suppliers. We find that, when the manufacturer sources from a single supplier or when consumers observe the manufacturer’s cost, inequity aversion hurts both the supplier’s and manufacturer’s profits. However, when the manufacturer sources from multiple suppliers and consumers do not observe the manufacturer’s cost, inequity aversion reduces both the suppliers’ and manufacturer’s margins, which significantly alleviates the double marginalization problem, increases consumer demand, and improves channel efficiency. As a result, inequity aversion benefits the suppliers, manufacturer, and consumers alike, leading to a “win–win–win” outcome. By comparing cases in which consumers observe and do not observe the manufacturer’s cost, we also find that, when faced with inequity-averse consumers, a manufacturer may find it optimal to withhold its cost information to help secure lower procurement costs from upstream suppliers.

We propose trust in management as an important characteristic over which equity pay sorts employees, as such pay typically leaves employees with concentrated positions in employer stock and therefore more exposed to the outcomes of management’s actions. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that the relation between employees’ perceptions of management’s credibility and voluntary turnover intentions is significantly stronger in the presence of a broad-based equity plan. Our findings provide insight into how broad-based equity pay can improve firm performance despite theoretical challenges regarding its incentive effects.

  abstract     = {Widely acknowledged as one of the most controversial standards in governmental accounting, Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statements 67/68 radically altered both the recognition and measurement for defined benefit public pensions. The standards require the recognition of previously only disclosed unfunded pension liabilities and increase the magnitude of reported pension liabilities by requiring the partial incorporation of a market-based discount rate. Although the recognition proposal was unaltered from its initial conception to the final standards, the discount rate proposal was significantly attenuated after the initial proposal met with unanimous preparer opposition. Accordingly, we examine what incentives drive preparer lobbying positions, whether such lobbying is aligned with user interests, and how such lobbying affects ex post implementation of the final standard. Our results suggest a misalignment between preparer lobbying and a user interest perspective. In particular, although state opposition for liability-increasing proposals is positively associated with expected financial statement impact, economic constraints, and political ramifications, user lobbying exhibits the opposite relationship, suggesting that users demand greater transparency in the states most likely to eschew it. We further find that state governments consistently opposed to the market-based discount rate are more likely to maintain status quo higher discount rates that lower reported liabilities after the implementation of GASB 67/68. Examining the mechanism, we find that opposing states avoid the market-rate trigger by increasing required contributions from employees rather than by increasing government funding or implementing benefit cuts. The evidence taken together contributes to our understanding of the development and implementation of the landmark GASB 67/68 standards. This paper was accepted by Brian Bushee, accounting.

  abstract     = {Ownership segmentation in the municipal bond market gives rise to competition among local issuers for a limited supply of capital. We consider the disclosure implications of this competition for capital, using Moody’s 2010 recalibration of the municipal rating scale. The recalibration placed lowly upgraded issuers at a disadvantage relative to their highly upgraded peers within the same market segment. We develop a model in which two municipal bond issuers compete for investors’ capital by choosing bond yields. The model predicts the issuer that is disadvantaged by the recalibration is more likely to improve its disclosure to better compete with its advantaged peer if (i) the rating upgrade that its peer receives is higher and (ii) competition for capital is fiercer. Empirically, we find that the disadvantaged issuers provide more and timelier financial disclosures after the recalibration. This improvement in disclosure quality increases in the extent of the issuer’s disadvantage, arises only if we consider peers with whom the issuer directly competes for capital, and is pronounced when the local capital supply is constrained. Our analytical and empirical analyses support the idea that a competitive disadvantage in raising capital in segmented markets can motivate issuers to improve disclosure quality.

Second, we find financial obligations were positively associated with the loan amount received as a percentage of total payroll costs.

The users’ data the business collects improve the service it provides to consumers, but they may also be accessed, at a cost, by strategic third parties in a way that harms users, imposing endogenous users’ privacy costs. We characterize how the revenue model of the business shapes its optimal data strategy: collection and protection of users’ data. A business with a more data-driven revenue model will collect more users’ data and provide more data protection than a similar business that is more usage driven . Consequently, if users have small direct benefit from data collection, then more usage-driven businesses generate larger consumer surplus than their more data-driven counterparts (the reverse holds if users have large direct benefit from data collection). Relative to the socially desired data strategy, the business may over- or undercollect users’ data and may over- or underprotect it. Restoring efficiency requires a two-pronged regulatory policy, covering both data collection and data protection; one such policy combines a minimal data protection requirement with a tax proportional to the amount of collected data. We finally show that existing regulation in the United States, which focuses only on data protection, may even harm consumer surplus and overall welfare.

  abstract     = {Much of the evidence on managerial biases in corporate finance focuses on the CEO and, in particular, CEO overconfidence. This singular focus can lead to misattribution as it ignores the roles of other managers who are responsible for a given corporate outcome. We evaluate the influence of the CFO and other C-suite executives as compared with the CEO. Mirroring the widely used Longholder CEO measure of CEO overconfidence, we construct Longholder CFO and Longholder Other measures. For financing decisions, we find that CEO overconfidence becomes an insignificant predictor of most decisions when included jointly with the CFO proxy, whereas CFO overconfidence has strong predictive power. The reverse holds for nonfinancing decisions: CEO beliefs predict the risk and return of investment projects and, thus, their cost of financing as well as acquisitions. Other C-suite managers’ overconfidence is not significant in either of these two realms. CEO overconfidence does remain significant even for financing decisions in the subsample of firms with “powerful” (entrenched) CEOs. We also show that overconfident CEOs tend to hire overconfident CFOs, which generates a multiplier effect and explains the misattribution to the CEO in analyses that do not account for the roles of other managers. Our results imply that analyses of managerial biases need to identify the dominant decision makers and account for their respective influence. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.

  abstract     = {We study healthcare operations of emergency departments (EDs) by examining the practice styles and skills of ED physicians. Our data include all residents of Montreal, Canada, with an initial ED visit in Montreal during a nine-month period. For each visit, our data record the initial treating hospital, ED physician, ED billed expenditures, and all interactions with the health system within the subsequent 90 days. Physicians in Montreal rotate across shifts between simple and difficult cases, implying a quasi-random assignment of patients to physicians within an ED. We consider three medical conditions that present frequently in the ED and for which mistreatment may have dramatic consequences—angina, appendicitis, and transient ischemic attacks—jointly examining diagnostic and disposition skills. To control for variation in diagnosis, our sample for each condition consists of patients with a broader set of symptoms and signs potentially indicative of the condition. Separately by condition, we regress healthcare usage and cost measures on indicators for physicians to estimate the skill and practice style of each physician. We then evaluate the variation across physicians in their practice style and skills and the correlations between different measures of skill and practice style. We find significant variation across physicians in their practice styles and skills. We also find that physicians with costly practice styles often have worse outcomes in terms of more ED revisits and more hospitalizations. Finally, the practice styles and skills of physicians correlate positively across the three conditions that we consider. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.

  abstract     = {Free trial promotions are a commonly used customer acquisition strategy in the Software as a Service industry. We use data from a large-scale field experiment to study the effect of trial length on customer-level outcomes. We find that, on average, shorter trial lengths (surprisingly) maximize customer acquisition, retention, and profitability. Next, we examine the mechanism through which trial length affects conversions and rule out the demand cannibalization theory, find support for the consumer learning hypothesis, and show that long stretches of inactivity at the end of the trial are associated with lower conversions. We then develop a personalized targeting policy that allocates the optimal treatment to each user based on individual-level predictions of the outcome of interest (e.g., subscriptions) using a lasso model. We evaluate this policy using the inverse propensity score reward estimator and show that it leads to 6.8\% improvement in subscription compared with a uniform 30-days for-all policy. It also performs well on long-term customer retention and revenues in our setting. Further analysis of this policy suggests that skilled and experienced users are more likely to benefit from longer trials, whereas beginners are more responsive to shorter trials. Finally, we show that personalized policies do not always outperform uniform policies, and we should be careful when designing and evaluating personalized policies. In our setting, personalized policies based on other methods (e.g., causal forests, random forests) perform worse than a simple uniform policy that assigns a short trial length to all users.

  abstract     = {We show that firms strategically alter their disclosures when investors’ access to information via search engines is interrupted. We conduct a textual analysis and exploit an exogenous event—Google’s 2010 surprising withdrawal from mainland China, which significantly hampered domestic investors’ ability to search for foreign information but did not affect their cost to access domestic information. Following Google’s exit, Chinese firms’ announcements on foreign transactions become more bullish relative to domestic transactions. Optimism in disclosure is especially rosy if the press releases are conveying negative news or are issued by poorly governed firms. This effect is mitigated in the presence of foreign investors or analysts affiliated with foreign brokers who are not subject to foreign information censorship by the government. The increase in search cost also appears to leave domestic news media and financial analysts more vulnerable to the influence of corporate disclosure. These optimistic announcements allow insiders to harvest higher returns from selling their shares and are associated with a higher likelihood of corporate misconduct.

  abstract     = {We study a compensation problem for salespeople with learning potential. In our model, both the firm and sales agent are risk neutral and forward-looking; the agent can privately observe his skill, exert effort, and learn from experience; the firm can learn from the agent’s choice and revise sales targets over time. The problem entails a dynamic tradeoff between exploiting learning, screening information, and maximizing efficiency. We find the optimal compensation plan differs substantially from the existing ones: it sets aggressive targets for expediting skill development, and pays the information rent for neutralizing the agent’s misbehaving temptation over the entire relationship. We find learning drives the long-run outcomes; ignoring it can mislead compensation design and inflict substantial losses. Our results shed light on when and why firms distort sales, favor incumbents, and prefer long-term plans. By highlighting the critical role of learning in long-run performance, this study advances our understanding of salesforce theory and practice. This paper was accepted by Juanjuan Zhang, marketing.

In this paper, we estimate the network effect at the smartphone operating system (OS) level and study multi-OS telecommunication carriers’ dynamic pricing strategies in an oligopolistic setting, using data on the U.S. smartphone industry. We find a positive OS network effect. Counterfactual analysis indicates that if the carriers were single-OS sellers, they would increase the phone prices of large OSs and lower the prices of small OSs, which reduces the consumer surplus by $6.99 billion. Further analyses show that the multi-OS carriers choose lower prices for large OSs than for small OSs because of their preference for OS concentration.

Our field setting is the game of chess and we benefit from a large and rich data set to investigate the robustness and heterogeneity of our uncovered gender differences in competition. We find a macro gender gap in every country: there are fewer female than male players, especially at the top, and women have lower average rankings. Moreover, comparing millions of individual games, we find a small but robust micro gender gap: women’s scores are about 2\% lower than expected when playing a man rather than a woman with an identical rating, age and country. Using a simple theoretical model, we show how this small micro gap may affect women’s long-run human-capital formation.

This situation arises because blockchain adoption costs are borne by manufacturers, and manufacturers cannot extract consumer gains through prices due to the competitive nature of the manufacturing sector.

Leveraging optimal control theory, we characterize optimal dynamic pricing and advertising policies and show that the developer should prioritize initial growth through aggressive advertising, while postponing the introduction of a premium subscription. Surprisingly, the optimal subscription price may start high and gradually decrease. We further show that the developer should strengthen social-comparison effects, that payment-based matchmaking can be an effective monetization driver, and that our main findings remain robust when allowing individual in-game item purchases/partial premium subscription.

Allocations of this budget may be static (with no dependence on the random values of the samples) or adaptive (decisions are made based on the results of previous decisions). A popular methodological strategy in the simulation literature is to first characterize optimal static allocations by using large deviations theory to derive a set of optimality conditions, and then to use these conditions to guide the design of adaptive allocations. We propose a new methodology that can be guaranteed to adaptively learn the solution to these optimality conditions in a computationally efficient manner, without any tunable parameters, and under a wide variety of parametric sampling distributions.

  abstract     = {We analyze the design of a randomization procedure in a field setting with high stakes and substantial public interest: matching sports teams in the Union of European Football Association Champions League. While striving for fairness in the chosen lottery—giving teams similar distributions over potential partners—the designers seek to balance two conflicting forces: (i) imposing a series of combinatorially complex constraints on the feasible matches; and (ii) designing an easy-to-understand and credible randomization. We document the tournament’s solution, which focuses on sequences of uniform draws over each element in the final match, assisted by a computer to form the support for each draw. We first show that the constraints’ effects within this procedure are substantial, with shifts in expected prizes of up to a million euro and large distortions in match likelihoods of otherwise comparable team pairs. However, examining all possible counterfactual lotteries over the feasible assignments, we show that the generated inequalities are, for the most part, unavoidable and that the tournament design is close to a constrained-best. In two extensions, we outline how substantially fairer randomizations are possible when the constraints are weakened, and how the developed procedure can be adopted to more-general settings.

  abstract     = {In complex procurement projects, it is difficult to write enforceable contracts that condition price upon quality. Supplier nonperformance becomes an acute risk, particularly when there is intense competition for the contract. An established incentive mechanism used to mitigate the problem of supplier nonperformance is retainage, in which the buyer sets aside a portion of the purchase price. After project completion, the buyer determines the amount of retainage that is released to the seller, considering any defects that arise. Although generally a feasible contract form to implement, the practical difficulties in assessing completion introduce a moral hazard for the buyer. We develop a structurally new game and experimental design to offer managerial insights on how retainage principles mediate trust and trustworthiness in competitive procurement settings with moral hazard. The experimental results suggest that if trust in the procurement relationship is strong enough, then retainage can mitigate the seller-side moral hazard problem and substitute for reputation in a fragmented supply chain at the cost of inflated tender prices. In high retainage structures, there is a tradeoff between trade efficiency and supplier participation in request for bids. We further develop a model of fair payment norms and offer managerial insights on how to design the retainage mechanism, conditional on prevailing levels of trust and beliefs about fairness.

  abstract     = {Health systems are placing increasing emphasis on improving the design and operation of clinical trials with the aim of making the health technology adoption process more value-based . We present a model of a value-based, two-armed clinical trial in which both the recruitment rate and trial length are optimized. The model is value-based because it balances the cost of the trial with the expected benefit it generates for patients, valued by the relative health benefits and costs of the technologies. We consider a wide range of regulatory and practical contexts that address how patient health is valued (discount rate, time horizon, pragmatic trials). We present comparative statics and asymptotic analysis together with a retrospective application to a recent health technology assessment and an extension for adaptive trials. Results challenge traditional perceptions concerning the efficiency, length, and knowledge that may be gained from clinical research for trial managers or funders charged with delivering value efficiently: we highlight trade-offs between trial costs and population health benefits influenced by trial outcomes and the importance of optimizing both recruitment rate and trial duration rather than sample size alone.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of a seller of data who sells information to a buyer regarding an unknown (to both parties) state of the world. Traditionally, the literature explores one-round strategies for selling information because of the seller’s holdup problem: once a portion of the data set is released, the buyer’s estimate improves, and as a result, the value of the remaining data set drops. In this paper, we show that this intuition is true when the buyer’s objective is to improve the precision of the estimate. On the other hand, we establish that when the buyer’s objective is to improve downstream operational decisions (e.g., better pricing decisions in a market with unknown elasticity) and when the buyer’s initial estimate is misspecified, one-round strategies are outperformed by selling strategies that initially provide free samples. In particular, we provide conditions under which such free-sample strategies generate strictly higher revenues than static strategies and illustrate the benefit of providing data samples for free through a series of examples. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal dynamic pricing strategy within the class of strategies that provide samples over time (at a constant rate), charging a flow price until some time when the rest of the data set is released at a lump-sum amount.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the agricultural industries, this paper studies the economic and environmental implications of biomass commercialization; that is, converting organic waste into a saleable product from the perspective of a processor that uses a commodity input to produce both a commodity output and biomass. We characterize the economic value of biomass commercialization and examine how input and output spot price uncertainties affect this value. Using a model calibration, we find that lower input spot price variability or higher output spot price variability or correlation between the two spot prices increases this value for a typical palm oil mill. To measure the environmental impact, we use total expected carbon emissions resulting from profit-maximizing decisions and characterize the change in total expected emissions after commercialization. Our analysis reveals that, although higher biomass demand or biomass price always increases the value of biomass commercialization, these changes are not necessarily environmentally beneficial as they may increase the emissions associated with biomass commercialization. We also characterize conditions under which biomass commercialization is environmentally beneficial or harmful; that is, it leads to a reduction or an increase in the total expected emissions, respectively. In comparison with the existing understanding which does not take into account optimization of operational decisions, our analysis highlights two types of misconceptions (and characterizes the specific conditions under which they appear): (i) we would mistakenly think that biomass commercialization is environmentally beneficial when it is not, and (ii) we would mistakenly think that biomass commercialization is environmentally harmful when it is not.

Worker initiative ensures efficiency but requires strong incentives. When incentives are relational and the firm faces shocks to its credibility, it may adopt standardized work processes that ignore local information but yield satisfactory (though suboptimal) performance. The adoption of such standardized processes helps the firm survive the current shock but inflicts inefficiencies in the future. Although the firm may recover, it becomes more vulnerable to future shocks, and consequently, more reliant on the standardized work procedures.

  abstract     = {We consider a nondurable good monopolist that collects data on its customers in order to profile them and subsequently practice price discrimination on returning customers. The monopolist’s price discrimination scheme is leaky in the sense that an endogenous fraction of consumers choose to incur a privacy cost to conceal their identity when they return in the following periods. We characterize the Markov perfect equilibrium of the game under two alternative customer profiling regimes: full information acquisition (FIA) and purchase history information (PHI). In both cases, we find that, contrary to what could be expected, the monopolist’s aggregate profit is not monotonically increasing in the level of the privacy cost, but a U-shaped function of it, leading to ambiguous profit effects: a reduction in privacy costs increases the fraction of customers who choose to be anonymous (detrimental profit effect), but it also softens the firm’s introductory price, reducing the pace at which prices targeted to new customers fall over time (positive profit effect). When comparing results under FIA and PHI, we find that market expansion is faster, and more customers conceal their identity under FIA than under PHI. Equilibrium profits are also higher in the FIA case. Although equilibrium profits are U-shaped functions of the privacy cost in both profiling regimes, they tend to be globally decreasing with the privacy cost under PHI and globally increasing under FIA.

  abstract     = {Drawing on the notion of compensatory behavior, this paper studies how students compensate for learning loss during a pandemic and what role artificial intelligence (AI) plays in this regard. We further probe into a difference in compensatory behavior for learning loss in terms of quantity, pattern, and pace (i.e., tripartite aspect of learning behavior) of AI-powered learning app usage depending on the level of pandemic threat and the proximity of a goal to students. Results show that the pandemic threat affects student learning behavior differently. Immediately following the COVID-19 outbreak, students who live in the epicenter of the outbreak (versus those who do not) use the app less at first, but with time, they use it more (quantity), on a more regular basis (pattern), and rebound to a curriculum path (pace) comparable to students who do not live in the outbreak’s epicenter. These findings collectively explain behavior that is consistent with compensation for learning loss. The results also partially corroborate the goal-proximity effect, revealing that proximity to a goal (e.g., the degree to which the national university admission exam is approaching) has a moderating role in explaining the tripartite perspective of student learning behavior. Overall, these findings have important theoretical and practical implications for understanding how innovative education technologies can not only facilitate student learning during adversity, but also support learning recovery after adversity.

  abstract     = {We study the effects of implicit government guarantee (IGG) on Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs). We find that SOEs reduce their investments by 2.4\% of book assets, on average, relative to matched non-SOEs after the first SOE default in China’s onshore bond markets in 2015. The investment reduction concentrates among SOEs that are financially constrained, yet SOEs financed by large state banks are hardly affected. Bondholders require more stringent default protection in newly issued SOE bonds. We also find that the investment reduction is more pronounced for SOEs with severe agency problems and that SOEs experienced more positive market reactions to acquisition announcements after 2015. Our results suggest that the reduction in IGG has confounding effects on Chinese firms. Although the weakening of IGG may help mitigate overinvestment, it exacerbates financial constraints of those with limited access to alternative sources of financing.

The resulting poststudy probability that market performance is better described by rational expectations than the prior information (Walrasian) model under the conditions specified in the original paper is very low. As a result of our failure to replicate, we investigate an alternate set of market features that combines aspects of the original experimental design. For these markets, which include both contingent claims and homogeneous dividend payments (as in many prediction markets), we do find robust evidence of information aggregation in support of the rational expectations model.

The underlying economic forces entail a trade-off between the time-inconsistency problem (the CEO’s ex post preferences can diverge from the CEO’s ex ante goals) and how silence (absence of information) under the ex ante and ex post paths is valued differentially by the union.

Of the 69 firms in the sample, 18 have committed to net-zero carbon targets, 14 have announced significant emissions cuts, whereas the remaining 37 firms have not announced any formal commitment to reduce emissions. We find that a firm’s energy production and ownership by BlackRock is positively associated with its decision to announce a net-zero pledge or significant emission cuts. E&amp;P firms are likely to announce such commitments after Engine No. 1 proposed its slate of directors for Exxon’s board. The stock market reacts more negatively to net-zero pledges relative to emission-reduction pledges on average. However, the market reaction is related to the quality and credibility of these pledges. In particular, we find that the negative market reaction to net-zero pledges is mainly driven by firms with post-2030 target years relative to firms that commit to achieving net zero by 2030. We also find that the market reacts more negatively to net-zero pledges when the firm does not show the strength of its commitment via the presence of a board-level committee to monitor the company’s progress toward its emission goals or when the top management’s pay is not linked to specific emission reduction goals.

  abstract     = {Telemedicine is increasingly used across the developing world to expand access to healthcare, to improve outcomes, and to reduce costs. One common model is that of telemedicine centers, which are small primary care facilities run by midlevel (nonphysician) providers who conduct a preliminary examination and then facilitate a telemedicine visit with a remote physician in real time. However, the impact of this channel of care delivery—particularly on existing physical healthcare-delivery channels—has not been thoroughly examined. We use data from one of the largest tele-ophthalmology implementations in the world to examine this issue. Using a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences approach, we find that opening a nearby telemedicine center generates a 31\% increase in the overall network visit rate from the population within 10 km of the new center, 62\% of which is driven by new patients, suggesting a substantial increase in access. The rate of eyeglasses prescriptions to correct for simple refractive errors increases by 18.5\%, whereas the rate of cataract surgery to replace the natural lens in a patient’s eye with an artificial lens remains unchanged. The increase in access and treatment rates does not significantly impact the direct costs incurred by patients, but reduces their indirect costs (measured as travel distance) by 30\% (12 km). Finally, we find significant spatial heterogeneity in these effects, which vary with the distance of patients to facilities. These results have important implications for the design of telemedicine networks and the portfolio of healthcare services provided through them.

  abstract     = {This paper shows that investments based on deep learning signals extract profitability from difficult-to-arbitrage stocks and during high limits-to-arbitrage market states. In particular, excluding microcaps, distressed stocks, or episodes of high market volatility considerably attenuates profitability. Machine learning-based performance further deteriorates in the presence of reasonable trading costs because of high turnover and extreme positions in the tangency portfolio implied by the pricing kernel. Despite their opaque nature, machine learning methods successfully identify mispriced stocks consistent with most anomalies. Beyond economic restrictions, deep learning signals are profitable in long positions and recent years and command low downside risk. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance. Funding: D.

Our empirical context is the quality of service for restaurants in the city of Austin, and we examine how they were impacted by the exogenous exit and reentry of rideshare platforms, Uber and Lyft, because of regulatory changes. We leverage these exogenous shocks and combine them with sentiment-analyzed data from Yelp reviews that capture how customers assess the quality of service at each restaurant. We show that, compared with control cities, customers in Austin become more negative about service quality when Uber and Lyft are present in the city. Additionally, we use rich data on employee turnover and wages to demonstrate that service staff turnover increases in Austin when Uber and Lyft are present compared with the control cities. We also conduct several additional studies and robustness checks that are all congruent with our hypothesis that Uber and Lyft lower the quality of service in Austin restaurants by raising their staff turnover.

  abstract     = {This paper exploits a major food safety crisis to estimate a full demand model for the unsafe product and its substitutes, recovering consumers’ preference parameters for different product characteristics. Counterfactual exercises quantify the relevance of different mechanisms driving consumers’ responses, such as changes in safety perceptions, idiosyncratic taste, product characteristics, and price. We find that consumers’ reactions are limited by their preferences for the product’s observable and unobservable characteristics. Because of the costs associated with switching from the affected product, the decline in demand following a product-harm crisis tends to understate the true weight of such events in consumers’ utility. We find that unobservable taste is a crucial driver of consumers’ responses. Our counterfactual exercises illustrate that the demand would have declined further if consumers had had access to a closer substitute. For an accurate assessment of product-harm crises, managerial strategies should therefore account for how different demand drivers bind consumers’ substitution patterns.

  abstract     = {Effective approaches to forecast model selection are crucial to improve forecast accuracy and to facilitate the use of forecasts for decision-making processes. Information criteria or cross-validation are common approaches of forecast model selection. Both methods compare forecasts with the respective actual realizations. However, no existing selection method assesses out-of-sample forecasts before the actual values become available—a technique used in human judgment in this context. Research in judgmental model selection emphasizes that human judgment can be superior to statistical selection procedures in evaluating the quality of forecasting models. We, therefore, propose a new way of statistical model selection based on these insights from human judgment. Our approach relies on an asynchronous comparison of forecasts and actual values, allowing for an ex ante evaluation of forecasts via representativeness. We test this criterion on numerous time series. Results from our analyses provide evidence that forecast performance can be improved when models are selected based on their representativeness.

  abstract     = {In this research we reexamine and update prior research on the association between decision conflict and choice deferral. Decision conflict has featured prominently in psychology literature, going back to the seminal work of Lewin (1933) , Miller (1944) , and Janis and Mann (1977) . Building on this earlier work and the assumption of conflict as an inhibitor of choice, Tversky and Shafir (1992 ; see also Dhar 1997 ) argued that the tendency to defer a decision can increase when decision makers experience conflict because of the need to make trade-offs between options in a set. Tversky and Shafir (1992) showed that decision makers may defer choice more when faced with two options presenting trade-offs compared with when they are offered either a single option (see also Dhar 1997 ) or two options where one alternative dominates the other. Relatedly, Luce (1998) showed that decision makers may be more likely to defer choice when faced with multiple options presenting relatively difficult (versus easy) trade-offs. We reexamine published data and report the results of 40 well-powered direct and conceptual replications of these effects (total n = 26,703) that cast doubt on the replicability of prior research. Our data suggest that additional research is needed in order to reveal a robust association between experimental manipulations of decision conflict and choice deferral. We conclude our investigation by delineating a set of directions for future research on this topic. This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

  abstract     = {Decision makers often ask experts to forecast a future state. Experts, however, can be biased. In the economics and psychology literature, one extensively studied behavioral bias is called herding. Under strong levels of herding, disclosure of public information may lower forecasting accuracy. This result, however, is derived only for point forecasts. In this paper, we consider experts’ probabilistic forecasts under herding, find a closed-form expression for the first two moments of a unique equilibrium forecast, and show that the experts report too similar locations and inflate the variance of their forecasts because of herding. Furthermore, we show that the negative externality of public information no longer holds. In addition to reacting to new information as expected, probabilistic forecasts contain more information about the experts’ full beliefs and interpersonal structure. This facilitates model estimation. To this end, we consider a one-shot setting with one forecast per expert and show that our model is identifiable up to an infinite number of solutions based on point forecasts but up to two solutions based on probabilistic forecasts. We then provide a Bayesian estimation procedure for these two solutions and apply it to economic forecasting data collected by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. We find that, on average, the experts invest around 19\% of their efforts into making similar forecasts. The level of herding shows an increasing trend from 1999 to 2007 but drops sharply during the financial crisis of 2007–2009 and then rises again until 2019.

In our model, participants dislike rejections and enjoy the confirmation from getting what they declare desirable. Formally, the payoff from a match decreases in its position in the submitted ranking such that a strategic trade-off between preference intensity and match probability arises. This trade-off can trigger the commonly observed self-selection strategies. We show that misrepresentations can persist for arbitrarily small report-dependent components. However, honesty is guaranteed to be optimal if and only if there is no conflict between the quality and feasibility of a match.

First, we use laboratory and classroom experiments to show that preferences for speaking in public vary strongly across individuals with many participants willing to give up significant amounts of money to avoid giving a short presentation in front of an audience. Second, we introduce two self-reported items to elicit preferences for speaking in public through surveys. We show that these items are strongly related to choices in the incentivized laboratory experiment and that public speaking aversion is distinct from established traits and preferences, including extraversion. Third, we elicit these items in a survey of business and economics students and show that public speaking aversion predicts career expectations.

  abstract     = {We provide evidence that investor behavior is sensitive to two dimensions of subjective uncertainty concerning future asset values. Investors vary in the extent to which they attribute market uncertainty to (1) missing knowledge, skill, or information (epistemic uncertainty) and (2) chance or stochastic processes (aleatory uncertainty). Investors who view stock market uncertainty as higher in epistemicness (knowability) are more likely to reduce uncertainty by seeking guidance from experts and are more responsive more responsive to available information when choosing whether to invest. In contrast, investors who view stock market uncertainty as higher in aleatoriness (randomness) are more likely to reduce uncertainty through diversification, and their risk preferences better predict whether they choose to invest. We show, further, that attributions of uncertainty can be perturbed by the format in which historical information is presented: charts displaying absolute stock prices promote perceptions of epistemicness and greater willingness to pay for financial advice, whereas charts displaying the change in stock prices from one period to the next promote perceptions of aleatoriness and a greater tendency to diversify.

These contracts place limits on the number of calls and total number of hours of power reduction per customer per year as well as the duration of each call. The stochastic dynamic program that determines how many customers to call and the timing and duration of each call for each day is an extremely difficult (NP-hard) optimization problem. We design a scenario-based approximation method to generate probabilistic allocation polices in a reasonable amount of time. Our approach consists of three approximations: deterministic approximation of demand, discretization of the expected demand, and aggregation/disaggregation of the resources. We show the relative information error resulting from the deterministic approximation is O ( 1 / n ) , the discretization error is O ( 1 / n ) , and the aggregation/disaggregation error is O ( 1 / n ) , where n represents the length of the horizon. Finally, we show the total relative error is O ( 1 / n ) . Our error analysis establishes that our approximation method is near optimal . In addition, our extensive numerical experiments verify the high quality of our approximation approach. The error, conservatively measured, is quite small and has an average and standard deviation of 8.6\% and 1.4\%, respectively. We apply our solution approach to the data provided by three major utility companies in California. Overall, our study shows our procedure improves the savings in energy-generation cost by 37.7\% relative to current practices. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the yet-uncharted assortment optimization problem under the exponomial choice model, in which the objective is to determine the revenue-maximizing set of products that should be offered to customers. Our main algorithmic contribution comes in the form of a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme, showing that the optimal expected revenue can be efficiently approached within any degree of accuracy. We synthesize several ideas related to approximate dynamic programming, intended to construct a compact discretization of the continuous state space by keeping track of “key statistics” in rounded form and by operating with a suitable bit precision complexity. We complement this result by a number of NP-hardness reductions to natural extensions of this problem. Moreover, we conduct empirical and computational evaluations of the exponomial choice model and our solution method. Focusing on choice models with a simple parametric structure, we provide new empirical evidence that the exponomial choice model can achieve higher predictive accuracy than the multinomial logit (MNL) choice model on several real-world data sets. We uncover that this predictive performance correlates with certain characteristics of the choice instance—namely, the entropy and magnitude of choice probabilities. Finally, we leverage fully ranked preference data to simulate the expected revenue of optimal assortments prescribed using the fitted exponomial and MNL models. On semisynthetic data, the exponomial-based approach can lift revenues by 3\%–4\% on average against the corresponding MNL benchmark. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {The growing complexity of consulting, new product development, and information technology projects has led firms to increasingly adopt the strategy of collaborative value cocreation with their vendors. Although such value cocreation often involves a client firm engaging with more than one vendor, research in this field has primarily focused on single-vendor cocreation, whereas research on multivendor sourcing has rarely considered collaborative value cocreation. We bridge this gap by studying a cocreation environment involving a client, a primary vendor, and a potential secondary vendor. Examining the trade-offs that arise in the strategic interactions among the three firms, we derive novel insights about how these interactions differ from those under one-vendor cocreation, and from those under traditional multivendor sourcing. Specifically, we demonstrate that the client can sometimes be better off by adding a secondary vendor that is less efficient than the primary one; and a more expensive primary vendor can sometimes make the client less inclined to add the secondary vendor. The client’s decision to add the secondary vendor is driven by the value per unit of output rather than purely cost or efficiency parameters. We show that in such collaborative environments, the primary vendor benefits from the addition of a secondary vendor whenever it benefits the client. The conceptual and managerial insights drawn from our research contribute to a better theoretical and practical understanding of strategic decision making by firms in multivendor cocreation environments that are increasingly becoming prevalent.

  abstract     = {We consider a principal who periodically offers a fixed and costly nonmonetary reward to agents to incentivize them to invest effort over the long run. An agent’s output, as a function of his effort, is a priori uncertain and is worth a fixed per-unit value to the principal. The principal’s goal is to design an attractive reward policy that specifies how the rewards are to be given to an agent over time based on that agent’s past performance. This problem, which we denote by P , is motivated by practical examples from both academia (e.g., a reduced teaching load) and industry (e.g., “Supplier of the Year” awards). The following “limited-term” (LT) reward policy structure has been quite popular in practice. The principal evaluates each agent periodically; if an agent’s performance over a certain (limited) number of periods in the immediate past exceeds a predefined threshold, then the principal rewards him for a certain (limited) number of periods in the immediate future. When agents’ outputs are deterministic in their efforts, we show that there always exists an optimal policy that is an LT policy and also, obtain such a policy. When agents’ outputs are stochastic, we show that the class of LT policies may not contain any optimal policy of problem P but is guaranteed to contain policies that are arbitrarily near optimal. Given any ϵ &gt; 0 , we show how to obtain an LT policy whose performance is within ϵ of that of an optimal policy. This guarantee depends crucially on the use of sufficiently long histories of the agents’ outputs. We also analyze LT policies with short histories and derive structural insights on the role played by (i) the length of the available history and (ii) the variability in the random variable governing an agent’s output. We show that the average performance of these policies is within 5\% of the optimum, justifying their popularity in practice. We then introduce and analyze the class of “score-based” reward policies; we show that this class is guaranteed to contain an optimal policy and also, obtain such a policy. Finally, we analyze a generalization in which the principal has a limited number for rewards in any given period and show that the class of score-based policies, with modifications to accommodate the limited availability of the rewards, continues to contain an optimal solution for the principal.

  abstract     = {Exaptation refers to the emergence of novel functionalities in existing products. Exaptations frequently arise in the context of users who creatively modify (or hack) existing products to accommodate new needs. Here, we examine how product-first (compared with problem-first) search affects the occurrence of exaptations. In a product-first search, the user identifies the product to be hacked before seeking a viable need. In a problem-first search, the user has a defined problem before seeking a viable solution. We argue that users are more likely to achieve exaptations following a problem-first (compared with a product-first) search. Indeed, with problem-first search, they are less likely to face functional fixedness, and they can leverage their greater awareness of problems that may not have readily adaptable solutions, which leads them to generate exaptations. Using a novel data set comprising user hacks of IKEA products, we present evidence that hacks originating from a product-first search are less likely to generate exaptations than hacks originating from a problem-first search. We also show that this difference is mitigated when the user has hacking experience or when the IKEA product being hacked is more modular. We also explore how the mitigation happens. Increased hacking experience appears to reduce functional fixedness; meanwhile, increased product modularity increases the likelihood that users will make serendipitous discoveries leading to exaptations. We contribute to the growing literature on exaptation as a source of novelty and discuss the implications of this phenomenon for managing user innovation.

  abstract     = {We study professional players and their roles in peer-to-peer (P2P) markets. Most notably, P2P home-sharing platforms (e.g., Airbnb) consist of both professional hosts and nonprofessional individual hosts. What are the roles of the professionals? Should home-sharing platforms regulate their participation? Professional hosts may primarily offer properties that nonprofessional hosts would not supply and attract more guests—the differentiation effect. Or they may mostly supply similar properties and compete with the nonprofessionals—the competition effect. Using a unique data set of Airbnb listings, we first find that professional hosts’ properties are more expensive and have superior characteristics than nonprofessionals’. Second, we capitalize on a quasi-experiment in which Airbnb capped the number of properties a host can manage in several cities in the United States to determine the roles of professional hosts. With different predictions (about the policy impacts) under the differentiation versus competition effects, we find evidence suggesting the dominance of the latter. In particular, the policy increased the supply from nonprofessional hosts, and the price level of nonprofessional properties as a group went up after the policy. However, our findings of heterogeneity in policy impacts suggest that the dominance of competition is less prominent in certain markets. Finally, we find that the platform was not worse off in attracting reservations or securing revenue after the policy. Our findings contribute to both theory and practice as they reveal the roles of professional players and how P2P platforms can manage their participation.

  abstract     = {Could a salary history ban (SHB) reduce the gender wage gap? Proponents of this intervention believe the gap is sustained by the practice of eliciting salary histories from job applicants. Although observational studies suggest that SHB operates as envisioned, two features complicate the interpretation of its effects. These are, respectively, the passage of relevant legislation alongside SHB, and the presence of public campaigns that propel SHB into law. We assessed SHB in the United Kingdom, where neither potential confound was present, and did not find evidence that the intervention operated as intended. An intention-to-treat analysis of a 16-month field experiment, conducted with 230 staff hires at a private educational institution, indicates that SHB was about as likely to harm new hires as it was to help them. Additional analyses did not reveal significant differences between women and men. We supplement these results with an interrupted time series analysis of 3,687 placements made by a recruitment firm that voluntarily adopted SHB for its job candidates. Salaries were significantly lower under SHB, but were not significantly different for women versus men. Taken together, our results suggest that SHB was ineffective in isolation from contemporaneous legislative changes, proequality messaging, or some combination thereof.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces formal monitoring procedures as a risk-management tool. Continuously monitoring risk forecasts allows practitioners to swiftly review and update their forecasting procedures as soon as forecasts turn inadequate. Similarly, regulators may take timely action in case reported risk forecasts become poor. Extant (one-shot) backtests require, however, that all data are available prior to testing and are not informative of when inadequacies might have occurred. To monitor value-at-risk and expected shortfall forecasts “online”—that is, as new observations become available—we construct sequential testing procedures. We derive the exact finite-sample distributions of the proposed procedures and discuss the suitability of asymptotic approximations. Simulations demonstrate good behavior of our exact procedures in finite samples. An empirical application to major stock indices during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the economic benefits of our monitoring approach. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

Strong U.S. stock and bond return predictability from several macroeconomic volatility series before 1982 was followed by a significant predictability decline during the Great Moderation (1982–2008). These findings are robust to alternative empirical specifications and out-of-sample tests. In a calibrated equilibrium model with time-varying volatility, the predictability decline requires changes in several model elements. Lower return predictability is consistent with stronger policy responses to inflation and output, a larger slope in the New Keynesian Phillips curve, and reduced sensitivity of both macroeconomic and financial variables to a volatility factor. Our results contribute to the examination of macroeconomic volatility as a driver of expected asset returns and the instability in predictive regressions.

  abstract     = {This paper examines an innovation in capital formation that has spurred contentious debate: the Umbrella Partnership Corporation (“Up-C”) IPO. Advisors and underwriters argue that the Up-C deal structure is a driver of post-IPO value and, thus, is a value-enhancing means of raising capital that may be one solution to concerns regarding the drop in the number of publicly traded companies. Consistent with these claims, recent research suggests that organizing soon-to-be public businesses as pass-through entities (as is the case for Up-Cs) leads to superior future performance. Yet, broadening the analysis to consider abnormal stock performance and post-IPO litigation of a larger and more recent sample of exclusively Up-C IPOs, we conclude just the opposite. While the Up-C deal structure increases IPO valuations and predicts positive post-IPO operating performance, the return performance of Up-C IPOs indicates that Up-C deals harm public shareholders. Further, despite their superior earnings performance, Up-C IPOs face a significantly higher rate of post-IPO litigation as compared with non-Up-C IPOs. Because IPO investors seemingly do not anticipate the myriad ways in which the Up-C deal structure might facilitate opportunism by pre-IPO owners, they frequently turn to litigation as an ex-post settling-up mechanism. Consequently, our paper offers the first empirical evidence of downsides associated with the Up-C deal structure for public shareholders and, in so doing, affords the rarity of having academic evidence lead (as opposed to respond to) a controversial debate.

  abstract     = {We study the effect of proximity to corporate headquarters on the productivity of inventors and research and development (R&amp;D) facilities. Distant inventors and R&amp;D facilities are less productive, and plausibly exogenous reductions in the travel time from these inventors or facilities to headquarters increase their productivity and creativity. We hypothesize that these improvements in the management of innovation production occur because proximity improves monitoring, managerial ability to provide direction, relationship building that supports creativity, and information exchange, including advice from headquarters. Consequently, our results suggest that proximity can help managers balance both exploration and exploitation when overseeing innovation. Naturally, these results then beg the question of why firms do not locate all inventors and R&amp;D facilities in close proximity to headquarters. We find that distant inventors and R&amp;D facilities are located in areas with better general economic indicators, and especially more favorable tax rates, than headquarters, suggesting firms balance these benefits against the benefits of proximity when locating innovation production.

  abstract     = {When reporting after-tax non–generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings, firms are required to adjust for the tax effects of exclusions. Since 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued and updated compliance and disclosure interpretations (C&amp;DIs), which specifically require firms to disclose the tax effects of exclusions. We assemble a detailed, hand-collected data set of S&amp;P 1500 firms’ disclosures to provide the first large-sample evidence on the reporting of the tax effects of non-GAAP exclusions. We find three key results. First, echoing the SEC’s concern, a significant proportion of non-GAAP reporting firms do not follow the C&amp;DI guidelines (i.e., they do not disclose the tax effects of exclusions). Second, among firms that disclose the tax effects of exclusions, we find that managers strategically select the tax rates applied to exclusions to achieve after-tax earnings targets. Third, manager-reported non-GAAP earnings are less persistent for future operating earnings and cash flows relative to non-GAAP earnings calculated by applying various benchmark tax rates to exclusions. This evidence suggests that managers’ strategic behavior in selecting the tax rates applied to exclusions pollutes reported non-GAAP earnings and reduces their usefulness for predicting future performance. Overall, our results shed light on a specific channel through which firms use non-GAAP reporting to meet or beat earnings expectations. This paper was accepted by Brian Bushee, accounting.

  abstract     = {We examine the incentive effects of subjectivity in allocating tournament-based rewards and punishments. We use data from a company where reward and punishment decisions are based on a combination of objective metrics and subjective performance assessments. Rankings based on the objective metrics and the ultimate payoff allocations are disclosed to all members of the organization. This information allows employees to observe whether and how managers subjectively override the objective rankings. Consistent with expectancy theory, we predict and find that subjective rewards and punishments manifesting as favorable (unfavorable) deviations from formula-based payoff expectations are associated with subsequent performance improvements (declines). These performance responses are incremental to the effects of receiving a reward or punishment per se. Our results suggest that managers can benefit from using subjective rewards, but using subjective punishments can be very costly in the absence of sufficiently strong ex ante incentive effects associated with the prospect of subjective penalties. Our findings contribute to the literature on subjectivity in performance evaluations and have important practical implications for designing incentive systems.

We take advantage of the passage of the American Inventor’s Protection Act (1999), which mandates the pre-grant public disclosure of all information in patent application documents within 18 months of the initial filings.

Nevertheless, improvements in the accuracy of analysts’ forecasts are smaller when firms issue more original and scientifically broader patents.

  abstract     = {We study the impact of inclusive institutions on innovation using novel, hand-collected, county-level data for Imperial Germany. We use the timing and geography of the French occupation of different German regions after the French Revolution of 1789 as an instrument for institutional quality. We find that the number of patents per capita in counties with the longest occupation was more than double that in unoccupied counties. Among the institutional changes brought by the French, the introduction of the Code civil, ensuring equality before the law, and the promotion of commercial freedom through the abolition of guilds and trade licenses had a stronger effect on innovation than the abolition of serfdom, which increased labor market mobility, and agricultural reforms that broke up the power of rural elites. The effect of institutions on innovation is particularly pronounced for high-tech innovation, suggesting that innovation might be a key channel through which institutions ultimately affect economic growth. Our findings highlight inclusive institutions as a first-order determinant of innovation. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.

We show how to train forest decision policies for this problem by growing trees that choose splits to directly optimize the downstream decision quality rather than split to improve prediction accuracy as in the standard random forest algorithm. We realize this seemingly computationally intractable problem by developing approximate splitting criteria that use optimization perturbation analysis to eschew burdensome reoptimization for every candidate split, so that our method scales to large-scale problems. We prove that our splitting criteria consistently approximate the true risk and that our method achieves asymptotic optimality. We extensively validate our method empirically, demonstrating the value of optimization-aware construction of forests and the success of our efficient approximations. We show that our approximate splitting criteria can reduce running time hundredfold while achieving performance close to forest algorithms that exactly reoptimize for every candidate split.

  abstract     = {To maximize productivity, manufacturers must organize and equip their workforces to efficiently handle variable workloads. Their success depends on their ability to assign experienced and skilled workers to specialized tasks and coordinate work on production lines. Worker turnover may disrupt such efforts. We use staffing, productivity, and pay data from within a major consumer electronics manufacturer’s supply chain to study how firms should manage worker turnover and its effects using production decisions, wages, and inventory. We find that worker turnover impedes coordination between assembly line coworkers by weakening knowledge sharing and relationships. Publicly available unit-cost estimates imply that worker turnover accounts for $206–274 million in added direct expenses alone from defectively assembled units failing the firm’s stringent quality control. To evaluate managerial alternatives, we structurally estimate a dynamic equilibrium model (an Experience-Based Equilibrium) encompassing (1) workers’ endogenous turnover decisions and (2) the firm’s weekly planning of its production scheduling and staffing in response. In counterfactual analyses, a less turnover-prone, hence more productive, workforce significantly benefits the firm, reducing its variable production costs by 4.5\%, or an estimated $928 million for the studied product. Such benefits justify paying higher efficiency wages even to less skilled workforces; furthermore, interestingly, rational inventory management policies incentivize self-interested firms to reduce rather than tolerate turnover.

  abstract     = {In-store promotions are a highly effective marketing tool that can have a significant impact on revenue. In this research, we study the question of dynamic promotion planning in the face of Bounded-Memory Peak-End demand models. In order to determine promotion strategies, we establish that a High-Low pricing policy is optimal under diagonal dominance conditions (so that the current period price dominates both past period price effects and competitive product price effects on the demand), as well as conditions on the price dispersion. We show that finding the optimal High-Low dynamic promotion policy is NP-hard in the strong sense. Nevertheless, for the special case of promotion planning for a single item, we propose a compact Dynamic Programming (DP) approach that can find the optimal promotion plan that follows a High-Low policy in polynomial time. When the diagonal dominance conditions do not hold, and, hence, a High-Low policy is not necessarily optimal, we show that the optimal High-Low policy that is found by our proposed DP can find a provably near-optimal solution. Using the proposed DP as a subroutine, for the case of multiple items, we propose a Polynomial-Time-Approximation Scheme (PTAS) that can find a solution that can capture at least 1 − ε of the optimal revenue and runs in time that is exponential only in 1 / ε . Finally, we test our approach on data from large retailers and demonstrate an average of 5.1 − 15.6\% increase in revenue relative to the retailer’s current practices.

We work in a completely realistic setting, in that we only assume the knowledge of traded prices for other single- and multi-asset derivatives and even allow for the presence of bid–ask spread in these prices. We provide a fundamental theorem of asset pricing for this market model, as well as a superhedging duality result, that allows to transform the abstract maximization problem over probability measures into a more tractable minimization problem over vectors, subject to certain constraints. Then, we recast this problem into a linear semi-infinite optimization problem and provide two algorithms for its solution. These algorithms provide upper and lower bounds for the prices that are ε -optimal, as well as a characterization of the optimal pricing measures. These algorithms are efficient and allow the computation of bounds in high-dimensional scenarios (e.g., when d = 60). Moreover, these algorithms can be used to detect arbitrage opportunities and identify the corresponding arbitrage strategies. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real market data showcase the efficiency of these algorithms, and they also allow understanding of the reduction of model risk by including additional information in the form of known derivative prices.

  abstract     = {Motivated by online labor markets, we consider the online assortment optimization problem faced by a two-sided matching platform that hosts a set of suppliers waiting to match with a customer. Arriving customers are shown an assortment of suppliers and may choose to issue a match request to one of them. After spending some time on the platform, each supplier reviews all the match requests she has received and, based on her preferences, she chooses whether to match with a customer or to leave unmatched. We study how platforms should design online assortment algorithms to maximize the expected number of matches in such two-sided settings. We establish that a simple greedy algorithm is 1/2-competitive against an optimal clairvoyant algorithm that knows in advance the full sequence of customers’ arrivals. However, unlike related online assortment problems, no randomized algorithm can achieve a better competitive ratio, even in asymptotic regimes. To advance beyond this general impossibility, we consider structured settings where suppliers’ preferences are described by the multinomial logit and nested logit choice models. We develop new forms of balancing algorithms, which we call preference-aware , that leverage structural information about suppliers’ choice models to design the associated discount function. In certain settings, these algorithms attain competitive ratios provably larger than the standard “barrier” of 1 − 1 / e in the adversarial arrival model. Our results suggest that the shape and timing of suppliers’ choices play critical roles in designing online assortment algorithms for two-sided matching platforms.

  abstract     = {Assortment optimization concerns the problem of selling items with fixed prices to a buyer who will purchase at most one. Typically, retailers select a subset of items, corresponding to an “assortment” of brands to carry, and make each selected item available for purchase at its brand-recommended price. Despite the tremendous importance in practice, the best method for selling these fixed-price items is not well understood, as retailers have begun experimenting with making certain items available only through a lottery. In this paper, we analyze the maximum possible revenue that can be earned in this setting, given that the buyer’s preference is private, but drawn from a known distribution. In particular, we introduce a Bayesian mechanism-design problem where the buyer has a random ranking over fixed-price items and an outside option, and the seller optimizes a (randomized) allocation of up to one item. We show that allocations corresponding to assortments are suboptimal in general, but under many commonly studied Bayesian priors for buyer rankings, such as the Multinomial Logit and Markov Chain choice models, assortments are, in fact, optimal. Therefore, this large literature on assortment optimization has much greater significance than appreciated before—it is not only computing optimal assortments; it is computing the economic limit of the seller’s revenue for selling these fixed-price substitute items. We derive several further results—a more general sufficient condition for assortments being optimal that captures choice models beyond Markov Chain; a proof that Nested Logit choice models cannot be captured by Markov Chain, but can, to some extent, be captured by our condition; and suboptimality gaps for assortments when our condition does not hold. Finally, we show that our mechanism-design problem provides the tightest-known Linear Programming relaxation for assortment optimization under the ranking distribution model.

  abstract     = {The design of performance-based incentives—commonly used in online labor platforms—can be naturally posed as a moral hazard principal-agent problem. In this setting, a key input to the principal’s optimal contracting problem is the agent’s production function: the dependence of agent output on effort. Although agent production is classically assumed to be known to the principal, this is unlikely to be the case in practice. Motivated by the design of performance-based incentives, we present a method for estimating a principal-agent model from data on incentive contracts and associated outcomes, with a focus on estimating agent production. The proposed estimator is statistically consistent and can be expressed as a mathematical program. To circumvent computational challenges with solving the estimation problem exactly, we approximate it as an integer program, which we solve through a column generation algorithm that uses hypothesis tests to select variables. We show that our approximation scheme and solution technique both preserve the estimator’s consistency and combine to dramatically reduce the computational time required to obtain sound estimates. To demonstrate our method, we conducted an experiment on a crowdwork platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk) by randomly assigning incentive contracts with varying pay rates among a pool of workers completing the same task. We present numerical results illustrating how our estimator combined with experimentation can shed light on the efficacy of performance-based incentives.

  abstract     = {This paper studies a pricing problem for a single-server queue where customers arrive according to a Poisson process. For each arriving customer, the service provider announces a price rate and system wait time. In response, the customer decides whether to join the queue, and, if so, the duration of the service time. The objective is to maximize either the long-run average revenue or social welfare. We formulate this problem as a continuous-time control model whose optimality conditions involve solving a set of delay differential equations. We develop an innovative method to obtain the optimal control policy, whose structure reveals interesting insights. The optimal dynamic price rate policy is not monotone in the wait time. That is, in addition to the congestion effect (the optimal price rate increases in the wait time), we find a compensation effect, meaning that the service provider should lower the price rate when the wait time is longer than a threshold. Compared with the prevalent static pricing policy, our optimal dynamic pricing policy improves the objective value through admission control, which, in turn, increases the utilization of the server. In a numerical study, we find that our revenue-maximizing pricing policy outperforms the best static pricing policy, especially when the arrival rate is low, and customers are impatient. Interestingly, the revenue-maximizing policy also improves social welfare over the static pricing policy in most of the tested cases. We extend our model to consider nonlinear pricing and heterogeneous customers. Nonlinear pricing may improve the revenue significantly, although linear pricing is easier to implement. For the hetergeneous customer case, we obtain similar policy insights as our base model. This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.

  abstract     = {We address a very important problem in offshore wind farm design, namely, the combined optimization of the turbine location and of the connection cables required to bring the electrical power produced by the turbines to a given substation, and eventually to shore. We first describe a mixed-integer linear programming model that combines previous proposals from the literature. Then we improve it by a number of additional inequalities intended to strengthen its linear programming relaxation. In particular, we propose new classes of Benders-like cuts derived from an induced-clique substructure of the problem. The validity of these cuts is established in a purely combinatorial way, without resorting to Benders’s standard duality theory, and efficient separation procedures are proposed. The practical effectiveness of the proposed cuts is established through computational tests, showing that they do improve very significantly the dual bound provided by the standard model. We also present an exact branch-and-cut solver for the problem, which separates the new cuts at run time. Computational results confirm that the new cuts are instrumental for the success of our exact solver. This paper was accepted by Chung-Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the learning problem in contextual search, which is motivated by applications such as crowdsourcing and personalized medicine experiments. In particular, for a sequence of arriving context vectors, with each context associated with an underlying value, the decision maker either makes a query at a certain point or skips the context. The decision maker will only observe the binary feedback on the relationship between the query point and the value associated with the context. We study a probably approximately correct learning setting, where the goal is to learn the underlying mean value function in context with a minimum number of queries. To address this challenge, we propose a trisection search approach combined with a margin-based active learning method. We show that the algorithm only needs to make O ˜ ( 1 / ε 2 ) queries to achieve an ε -estimation accuracy. This sample complexity significantly reduces the required sample complexity in the passive setting where neither sample skipping nor query selection is allowed, which is at least Ω ( 1 / ε 3 ) .

  abstract     = {We study the optimal design of information nudges directed to present-biased consumers who make consumption decisions over time without exact prior knowledge of their long-term consequences. For any distribution of risks, there exists a consumer-optimal information nudge that is of cutoff type, recommending abstinence if the risk is high enough. Depending on the distribution of risks, more or fewer consumers have to be sacrificed, as they cannot be credibly warned even though they would like to be. Under a stronger present bias, the target group receiving a credible warning to abstain must be tightened, but this need not increase the probability of harmful consumption. If some consumers have a stronger present bias than others, traffic-light nudges turn out to be optimal and, when subgroups of consumers differ sufficiently, the optimal traffic-light nudge is also subgroup optimal. We finally compare the consumer-optimal nudge with those that a health authority or a lobbyist would favor. This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

In the performance pay treatments, managers receive a bonus, which is a simple linear function of the profits achieved above a threshold value. In the performance review treatments, managers have to report their activities undertaken to increase profits in regular meetings. We find that whereas performance pay did not yield significant profit increases, performance review conversations increased profits by about 7\%. However, when additionally receiving performance pay, the positive effect of performance reviews vanished. We provide evidence from surveys and meeting protocols that performance pay changes the nature of conversations, leading to a stronger self-reliance of store managers, which undermines the value of the performance reviews.

  abstract     = {Combinatorial auctions have found widespread application for allocating multiple items in the presence of complex bidder preferences. The enumerative exclusive OR (XOR) bid language is the de facto standard bid language for spectrum auctions and other applications, despite the difficulties, in larger auctions, of enumerating all the relevant packages or solving the resulting NP-hard winner determination problem. We introduce the flexible use and efficient licensing (FUEL) bid language, which was proposed for radio spectrum auctions to ease both communications and computations compared with XOR-based auctions. We model the resulting allocation problem as an integer program, discuss computational complexity, and conduct an extensive set of computational experiments, showing that the winner determination problem of the FUEL bid language can be solved reliably for large realistic-sized problem instances in less than half an hour on average. In contrast, auctions with an XOR bid language quickly become intractable even for much smaller problem sizes. We compare a sealed-bid FUEL auction to a sealed-bid auction with an XOR bid language and to a simultaneous clock auction. The sealed-bid auction with an XOR bid language incurs significant welfare losses because of the missing bids problem and computational hardness, the simultaneous clock auction leads to a substantially lower efficiency than FUEL because of the exposure problem.

  abstract     = {To shed light on the factors that affect who speaks up in teams in the workplace, we study willingness to speak up after someone has raised an opinion. We call voicing disagreement overriding and study this behavior in a laboratory experiment where participants answer multiple choice questions in pairs. In a control treatment, participants interact anonymously. In a photo treatment, both participants see the photo of the person they are matched with at the beginning of the group task. Using a series of incentivized tasks, we elicit beliefs about the likelihood that each possible answer option to a question is correct. This allows us to measure disagreement and to tease apart the role of disagreement versus preferences in the decision to override ideas in teams. Results show that anonymity increases overriding. This treatment effect is driven by social image costs. Analysis of heterogeneity in behavior by gender reveals no differences between the likelihood that men and women override. However, we find some evidence that men and women are treated differently; when participants disagree with their partner, they are more likely to override a woman than a man. Preferences seem to in part explain the differential treatment of men and women. Studying group performance, we find that overriding helps groups on average, while the gender composition of teams does not affect team performance.

  abstract     = {Should firms that apply machine learning algorithms in their decision making make their algorithms transparent to the users they affect? Despite the growing calls for algorithmic transparency, most firms keep their algorithms opaque , citing potential gaming by users that may negatively affect the algorithm’s predictive power. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to compare firm and user surplus with and without algorithmic transparency in the presence of strategic users and present novel insights. We identify a broad set of conditions under which making the algorithm transparent actually benefits the firm. We show that, in some cases, even the predictive power of the algorithm can increase if the firm makes the algorithm transparent. By contrast, users may not always be better off under algorithmic transparency. These results hold even when the predictive power of the opaque algorithm comes largely from correlational features and the cost for users to improve them is minimal. We show that these insights are robust under several extensions of the main model. Overall, our results show that firms should not always view manipulation by users as bad. Rather, they should use algorithmic transparency as a lever to motivate users to invest in more desirable features. This paper was accepted by D. J. Wu, information systems.

This paper studies the impacts of compulsory secrecy on firm invention and the wider innovation system. In World War II, USPTO issued secrecy orders to more than 11,000 patent applications, which it rescinded en masse at the end of the war. Compulsory secrecy caused implicated firms to shift their patenting away from treated classes, with effects persisting through at least 1960. It also restricted commercialization and impeded follow-on innovation. Yet it appears it was effective at keeping sensitive technology out of public view. The results provide insight into the effectiveness of compulsory secrecy as a regulatory strategy and into the roles, and impacts, of formal intellectual property in the innovation system.

  abstract     = {Massive online text reviews can be a powerful market research tool for understanding consumer experiences and helping firms improve and innovate. This research exploits the rich semantic properties of text reviews and proposes a novel machine learning modeling framework that can reliably and efficiently extract consumer opinions and uncover potential interaction effects across these opinions, thereby identifying hidden and nuanced areas for product and service improvement beyond existing modeling approaches in this domain. In particular, we develop an opinion extraction and effect estimation framework that allows for uncovering customer opinions’ average effects and their interaction effects. Interactions among opinions can be synergistic when the co-occurrence of two opinions yields an effect greater than the sum of two parts, or as what we call dysergistic, when the co-occurrence of two opinions results in dampened effect. We apply the model in the context of large-scale customer ratings and text reviews for hotels and demonstrate our framework’s ability to screen synergy and dysergy effects among opinions. Our model also flexibly and efficiently accommodates a large number of opinions, which provides insights into rare yet potentially important opinions. The model can guide managers to prioritize joint areas of product and service improvement and innovation by uncovering the most prominent synergistic pairs. Model comparison with extant machine learning approaches demonstrates our improved predictive ability and managerial insights. This paper was accepted by Gui Liberali, marketing.

We study negative advertising with a focus on how its regulation impacts product positioning for profit-maximizing firms. We build a model of informative advertising competition, where product positioning is endogenous, and consumers have rational expectations. We show that despite the informational benefits of negative advertising, permitting it (as the Federal Trade Commission in the United States does) may lead to reduced product differentiation and lower consumer welfare, even in markets where firms do not use negative advertising in equilibrium. We then extend our model to political competition, where a candidate’s objective is to obtain a larger share of votes than the competitor. We show that political competition supports higher positional differentiation, along with more negative advertising than product competition, in line with observed high use of negative advertising in political races and their rarer use in product competition.

  abstract     = {It is generally acknowledged that sunk cost bias leads to suboptimal decisions, such as escalation of commitment. Some researchers, however, suggest that sunk cost bias can be beneficial when consumers have self-control problems. In this paper we explore the case when consumers with sunk cost bias have time-inconsistent preferences and, therefore, suffer from self-control problems. We experimentally demonstrate that sunk costs can make subjects better off by inducing higher effort. We then develop an analytical model to explore the implications of sunk cost bias for firm’s pricing strategy. We find that, in the presence of sunk cost bias, higher prices can lead to higher experienced quality. We show that sunk cost bias can sometimes improve firm’s profits, lead to lower prices, and increase welfare. Our results suggest that, when consumers use a product for multiple periods, pricing policies such as 0\% financing, which are often viewed as exploitative, can instead lead to lower total prices, higher profits, and higher welfare.

An informed trader holds private information about the fundamental value of a firm, and the firm’s manager relies on the asset price to infer such information and invest accordingly. We characterize an informative, but illiquid, equilibrium where the firm’s value is optimal but trade is inefficiently low, together with an uninformative equilibrium with maximal liquidity but inefficient firm value. Although an FTT inefficiently reduces trading, it may tilt the market’s equilibrium and make asset prices more informative. We characterize the situations in which one or the other of these two effects prevails. The analysis also helps us to reconcile some puzzling empirical evidence regarding the adoption of the FTT.

Self-funding clusters among nonincumbent campaigns, republican campaigns, and more expensive campaigns. Self-funded campaigns raise less money from individuals and special interests and also spend less. Self-funders are wealthier on average and run in more competitive elections. The analysis of self-funders’ legislative decisions shows that self-funders’ votes, especially those of republicans, are significantly more sensitive to contributions from special interests that are affected by the votes. The results highlight the importance of considering politicians’ self-funding choices in analyzing voting behavior and the value of political activism.

  abstract     = {This paper examines how female directors (FDs) affect firm value in the absence of mandatory gender quotas. Using a newly collected data set on director deaths around the globe, we find that stock prices decrease approximately 2\% more when an FD passes away, compared with a male director. What explains this negative capital market reaction? We find evidence that finding successors for deceased FDs is challenging for firms: Succession delays are longer, and although firms try to replace FDs with women, two-thirds of their successors are male. Furthermore, their successors tend to be younger, less experienced, and more often externally hired. Stock prices decline less if more potential female successors exist in a country, the firm is larger, or FDs other than the deceased woman were on the board. Because observable characteristics such as age, tenure, education, and network centrality cannot explain the negative stock market reaction, unobserved differences across genders that lead to a lower fit of male successors to the existing board are the most likely explanation for the firm value loss after the death of an FD.

Management Sci. 58(1):35–51] in which a gambler whose preferences are specified by the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) must decide when to stop gambling by a prescribed deadline. We assume that the gambler can assist their decision using independent randomization. The problem is inherently time inconsistent because of the probability weighting in CPT, and we study both precommitted and naïve stopping strategies. We turn the original problem into a computationally tractable mathematical program from which we devise an algorithm to compute optimal precommitted rules that are randomized and Markovian. The analytical treatment enables us to confirm the economic insights of Barberis for much longer time horizons and to make additional predictions regarding a gambler’s behavior, including that, with randomization, a gambler may enter the casino even when allowed to play only once and that it is prevalent that a naïf never stops loss.

We consider a multiagent setting where the employer makes use of career competition to motivate the team. Our analysis reveals incentive effects that do not exist in the well-studied case of teams of size 2. In teams with more than two members, diversity may have a positive effect on the efforts of some members although diversity leads to unbalanced career competition. As a consequence, expected profits are higher under a moderate degree of diversity compared with a situation with completely homogeneous agents.

The result extends the principle of “aiming in front of target” introduced by Gârleanu and Pedersen (2013) from a constant weight between current and future positions to a time-varying weight because the rebalancing performance is monitored only at discrete time points, but the rebalancing takes place continuously.

  abstract     = {The timely flow of financial information is critical for efficient capital market functioning, yet we have little understanding of firms’ and auditors’ collective abilities to maintain timely financial reporting when under duress. We use COVID as a stress test case to examine whether reporting systems can withstand systemic increases in complex economic events and coordination challenges. Despite COVID-related challenges persisting through 2020 and beyond, we document surprisingly modest average delays in financial reports during COVID and only in Q1-2020. Reporting timeliness reverts to pre-COVID levels no later than Q2-2020. We find no evidence of meaningful declines in actual reporting quality during COVID, but we do find some evidence consistent with declines in perceived reporting quality. Overall, our findings indicate that current financial reporting processes are remarkably robust and provide insights about financial reporting more broadly. In particular, given that nearly all firms were able to weather the unprecedented disruptions caused by COVID, our findings imply that most material reporting delays observed outside of COVID are likely a result of either a firm’s strategic choices or exceptionally fragile reporting processes.

This paper compares these strategies in terms of their efficiency of matchmaking as proxied by the amount of communication needed to facilitate a good market outcome. The paper finds that the relative performance of these matchmaking strategies is driven by whether the preferences of agents on each side of the market are easy to describe. Here, “easy to describe” means that the preferences can be inferred with sufficient accuracy based on responses to standardized questionnaires. For markets with suitable characteristics, each of these matchmaking strategies can provide near-optimal performance guarantees according to an analysis based on information theory.

  abstract     = {We initiate the study of incentive-compatible forecasting competitions in which multiple forecasters make predictions about one or more events and compete for a single prize. We have two objectives: (1) to incentivize forecasters to report truthfully and (2) to award the prize to the most accurate forecaster. Proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting if all forecasters are paid according to their scores. However, incentives become distorted if only the best-scoring forecaster wins a prize, since forecasters can often increase their probability of having the highest score by reporting more extreme beliefs. In this paper, we introduce two novel forecasting competition mechanisms. Our first mechanism is incentive compatible and guaranteed to select the most accurate forecaster with probability higher than any other forecaster. Moreover, we show that in the standard single-event, two-forecaster setting and under mild technical conditions, no other incentive-compatible mechanism selects the most accurate forecaster with higher probability. Our second mechanism is incentive compatible when forecasters’ beliefs are such that information about one event does not lead to belief updates on other events, and it selects the best forecaster with probability approaching one as the number of events grows. Our notion of incentive compatibility is more general than previous definitions of dominant strategy incentive compatibility in that it allows for reports to be correlated with the event outcomes. Moreover, our mechanisms are easy to implement and can be generalized to the related problems of outputting a ranking over forecasters and hiring a forecaster with high accuracy on future events.

  abstract     = {We introduce a new distributionally robust optimization model to address a two-period, multiitem joint pricing and production problem, which can be implemented in a data-driven setting using historical demand and side information pertinent to the prediction of demands. Starting from an additive demand model, we introduce a new partitioned-moment-based ambiguity set to characterize its residuals, which also determines how the second-period demand would evolve from the first-period information in a data-driven setting. We investigate the joint pricing and production problem by proposing a cluster-adapted markdown policy and an affine recourse adaptation, which allow us to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear optimization problem that we can solve to optimality using commercial solvers. We also extend our framework to ensemble methods using a set of ambiguity sets constructed from different clustering approaches. Both the numerical experiments and case study demonstrate the benefits of the cluster-adapted markdown policy and the partitioned moment-based ambiguity set in improving the mean profit over the empirical model—when applied to most out-of-sample tests.

  abstract     = {Understanding the drivers of market concentration in the generic pharmaceutical industry is essential to guaranteeing the availability of low-cost generics. In this paper, we develop a structural model to capture the multiple determinants governing manufacturers’ entry decisions; in particular, we focus on how manufacturing complexity and the regulatory environment for generics approval affect concentration in drug markets. We estimate the model using data collated from six disparate sources. We find that manufacturing complexity, as reflected in the number of active ingredients, for example, significantly reduces the likelihood of generics entry. Moreover, the delay in the review process for the generics applications significantly affects the number of firms entering a market. Our policy simulations suggest that a shortened drug approval review time significantly increases the average number of entrants per market and reduces the fraction of markets with no generics entry; however, a notable portion of markets would still lack any generic competition.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a container leasing firm that has elementary and premium containers, which are downward substitutable and for use by elementary contract customers (ECCs), premium contract customers (PCCs), as well as walk-in customers (WICs). ECCs can be satisfied by elementary containers or premium ones at discounted prices while PCCs only accept premium containers. WICs can be satisfied by any type of container at different prices. The objective is to maximise the expected total rental revenue by managing its limited capacity. We formulate this problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process and show the submodularity and concavity of the value function. Based on this, we show that the optimal policy can be characterised by a series of rationing thresholds, a series of substitution thresholds and a priority threshold, all of which depend on the system states. We further give conditions under which the optimal policy can be simplified. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the impact of the substitution of two items on the revenue, to compare the performance of the optimal policy with those of the commonly used policies and to investigate the influence of arrival rates on the optimal policy. Last, we extend the basic model to consider different rental durations, ECCs’ acceptance behaviour and endogenous prices for WICs.

  abstract     = {We consider a mixed duopoly service system with two service providers (SPs): one private and the other public. The public SP’s objective is welfare maximization, whereas the private SP is profit driven. Customers are heterogeneous in terms of their quality tastes and choose from three options, namely, joining the private queue, joining the public queue, and balking (or taking an outside option). We first consider the scenario where the private SP provides a premium service and the public SP provides a regular service. Paradoxically, we find that although the public SP’s objective is welfare maximization, welfare in the system can be less than that obtained with only profit-seeking private SPs. We further demonstrate that the maximum social welfare is achieved by partially privatizing the public SP, that is, by including both welfare and profit maximization as arguments in its objective function. In extreme cases in which the public SP’s capacity is very small, fully privatizing the public SP can be socially desirable. We then consider the alternate setting where the public SP provides a premium service and the private SP provides a regular service and obtain similar conclusions. These findings, however, rely on the assumption that an outside option exists for balking customers, and one should be cautious in generalizing to no-balking situations.

  abstract     = {We examine the effect of plant managers on productivity using unique matched manager-plant panel data on U.S. auto-assembly plants during 1993–2007. Our econometric approach is two-pronged. Our first approach relies on using the panel nature of our data to measure variation in productivity due to managerial influence. We estimate the interquartile range of the effect of individual plant managers on average hours-per-vehicle to be about 30\%. Further, we find that plant managers’ experience with the models that are in production ameliorates the negative impact of new model introductions on productivity. We also observe evidence that managers’ plant-specific tenure has a positive impact on productivity. In our second approach, we use high-frequency time-series data, along with structural-break tests and machine-learning methodologies, to predict variation in production using plant-manager switches. We find that a plant manager’s identity is predictive of changes in both the mean and variance of production, further highlighting their channels of managerial influence. These findings are robust to narrowing the sample to focus on retirements as an exogenous source of managerial switches. This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.

  abstract     = {Improving traceability in food supply chains has been a big part of ongoing effort to reduce contamination risks and food waste. Recent technology advancement such as blockchain technology has propelled innovative retailers to promote food traceability system adoption in their supply chains. We develop a three-tier supply chain model with multiple upstream (tier 2) suppliers to investigate how traceability technology adoption affects incentives of supply chain members and whether and how its anticipated benefits can be realized. We find that full traceability brings direct revenue benefit to every supply chain member by saving uncontaminated food from disposal (pure traceability effect) but also leaves each tier of the supply chain vulnerable to its immediate downstream buyer’s exploitation through strategically lowering the purchasing price (strategic pricing effect). The interplay of the two effects may result in some of the supply chain members (even the retailer) being worse off with traceability adoption and the system being exposed to higher contamination risk; the latter is because of the weakened upstream supplier’s incentive to exert contamination risk-reduction effort. Moreover, we find that the supply chain network structure also influences the benefit distribution of traceability adoption: The retailer always benefits from traceability adoption in network structures where the tier 1 supplier’s strategic pricing power is eliminated or weakened; all supply chain members benefit from traceability adoption in a network with a large number of tier 2 suppliers. Finally, we show that alternative risk-mitigation schemes such as tier 2 coordination can diminish the value of traceability adoption, and partial traceability enabled by tier 1 product inspection can be more beneficial to the retailer than full traceability.

  abstract     = {Operating under both supply-side and demand-side uncertainties, a mobile-promotion platform conducts advertising campaigns for individual advertisers. Campaigns arrive dynamically over time, which is divided into seasons; each campaign requires the platform to deliver a target number of mobile impressions from a desired set of locations over a desired time interval. The platform fulfills these campaigns by procuring impressions from publishers, who supply advertising space on apps via real-time bidding on ad exchanges. Each location is characterized by its win curve , that is, the relationship between the bid price and the probability of winning an impression at that bid. The win curves at the various locations of interest are initially unknown to the platform, and it learns them on the fly based on the bids it places to win impressions and the realized outcomes. Each acquired impression is allocated to one of the ongoing campaigns. The platform’s objective is to minimize its total cost (the amount spent in procuring impressions and the penalty incurred due to unmet targets of the campaigns) over the time horizon of interest. Our main result is a bidding and allocation policy for this problem. We show that our policy is the best possible (asymptotically tight) for the problem using the notion of regret under a policy, namely the difference between the expected total cost under that policy and the optimal cost for the clairvoyant problem (i.e., one in which the platform has full information about the win curves at all the locations in advance): The lower bound on the regret under any policy is of the order of the square root of the number of seasons, and the regret under our policy matches this lower bound. We demonstrate the performance of our policy through numerical experiments on a test bed of instances whose input parameters are based on our observations at a real-world mobile-promotion platform.

  abstract     = {We extend the existing literature on gender differences in competitive behavior by investigating tournament entry choices when a principal decides for an agent. In a laboratory experiment, we randomly assign subjects the role of either principal or agent. The principal decides whether the agent performs a real-effort task under piece-rate or tournament incentives. When deciding, the principal is informed about the agent’s previous performance, age, and residency. Between treatments, we vary whether the principal knows the agent’s gender. In a baseline treatment, we replicate the standard setting in which subjects decide for themselves whether to compete. Our main findings are, first, that there is no gender gap in tournament entry when principals decide for agents as opposed to the baseline treatment. Second, the gender gap closes because more women are made to compete by principals. Third, whereas there is no gender gap in either of the principal treatments, revealing the agent’s gender is associated with higher overall tournament entry rates. Exploratory analyses of principals’ choice determinants reveal a positive effect of preferences to take risks, competitiveness, and confidence in agents’ performances on making agents compete. In addition, we find no difference in how principals evaluate male and female agents’ performances. Finally, we test the efficiency of principals’ competition choices and show that they lead to fewer payoff-maximizing outcomes than when subjects decide for themselves. Additionally, overall tournament performances and winners’ performances are lower when agents are made to compete, but this effect is not robust to controlling for agents’ previous performances.

  abstract     = {Many important managerial outcomes hinge on the co-occurrence of multiple uncertain events, a situation termed conjunctive risk . Whereas past literature has addressed the psychology of choosing to enter situations with conjunctive risk, this article elucidates a novel way in which the psychology of managing conjunctive risk is importantly distinct. We examine a case in which there are two independent events, one is currently less likely than the other, both are required for overall success, and the decision maker must evaluate opportunities to increase the chance of the less-likely or more-likely requirement. We introduce the hypothesis of a worst-first heuristic. Decision makers intuitively evaluate improvements in conjunctive risk according to their impact on the biggest barrier to success, the least likely of the required events. We find evidence for such a worst-first heuristic across nine experiments ( n = 3,653, including samples from the United States and United Kingdom in Studies 1–5 and Studies S1–S3 in the online supplement, as well as a sample of managers in Study 6). Participants invest more to improve chances of less-likely requirements than more-likely requirements, even when the latter improvements have at least as much impact on the aggregate chance of success. Moreover, we find that decision makers exhibit this behavior particularly when managing conjunctive risk, as doing so makes them attend to which threat is the worst. Conversely, they do not appear to exhibit the behavior when making formally equivalent decisions about choosing between conjunctive risks. This bias toward underinvesting in stronger-links holds important implications for decision making in contexts subject to conjunctive risk—both managerial and societal.

  abstract     = {Hiring in online labor markets involves considerable uncertainty: which hiring choices are more likely to yield successful outcomes and how do employers adjust their hiring behaviors to make such choices? We argue that employers will initially explore the value of available information. When employers observe successful outcomes, they will keep reinforcing their hiring strategies; but when the outcomes are unsuccessful, employers will adjust their hiring behaviors. To investigate these dynamics, we propose a two-component framework that links hiring choices with task outcomes. The framework’s first component, a Hidden Markov Model, captures how employers transition from unsuccessful to successful hiring decisions. The framework’s second component, a conditional logit model, estimates employer hiring choices. Analysis of 238,364 hiring decisions from a large online labor market shows that, often, employers initially explore cheaper contractors with a lower reputation. When these options result in unsuccessful outcomes, employers learn and adjust their hiring behaviors to rely more on reputable contractors who are not as cheap. Such hiring tends to be successful, guiding employers to reinforce their hiring processes. As a result, the market observes employers transition from cheaper, lower-reputation options with poorer performance to more expensive reputable options with better performance. We attribute part of this behavior to employer confidence and risk attitude, which can change over time. This work is the first to investigate how employers learn to make successful hiring choices in online labor markets. As a result, it provides platform managers with new knowledge and analytics tools to target employer interventions. This paper was accepted by Anandhi Bharadwaj, information systems.

We establish that participation in an HIE network increases the referrals sent to and received from other HIE participants.

Whereas the econometric analysis focuses on the underlying associations between HIE adoption and referral patterns, the network analysis addresses the transformation process by which HIE adoption and referrals coevolve over time.

  abstract     = {The rapid, widespread adoption of cloud computing over the last decade has sparked debates on its environmental impacts. Given that cloud computing alters the dynamics of energy consumption between service providers and users, a complete understanding of the environmental impacts of cloud computing requires an investigation of its impact on the user side, which can be weighed against its impact on the vendor side. Drawing on production theory and using a stochastic frontier analysis, this study examines the impact of cloud computing on users’ energy efficiency. To this end, we develop a novel industry-level measure of cloud computing based on cloud-based information technology (IT) services. Using U.S. economy-wide data from 57 industries during 1997–2017, our findings suggest that cloud-based IT services improve users’ energy efficiency. This effect is found to be significant only after 2006, when cloud computing started to be commercialized, and becomes even stronger after 2010. Moreover, we find heterogeneous impacts of cloud computing, depending on the cloud service models, energy types, and internal IT hardware intensity, which jointly assist in teasing out the underlying mechanisms. Although software-as-a-service (SaaS) is significantly associated with both electric and nonelectric energy efficiency improvement across all industries, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is positively associated only with electric energy efficiency for industries with high IT hardware intensity. To illuminate the mechanisms more clearly, we conduct a firm-level survey analysis, which demonstrates that SaaS confers operational benefits by facilitating energy-efficient production, whereas the primary role of IaaS is to mitigate the energy consumption of internal IT equipment and infrastructure. According to our industry-level analysis, the total user-side energy cost savings from cloud computing in the overall U.S. economy are estimated to be USD 2.8–12.6 billion in 2017 alone, equivalent to a reduction in electricity use by 31.8–143.8 billion kilowatt-hours. This estimate exceeds the total energy expenditure in the cloud service vendor industries and is comparable to the total electricity consumption in U.S. data centers.

  abstract     = {In programmatic advertising, firms outsource the bidding for ad impressions to ad platforms. Although firms are interested in targeting consumers that respond positively to advertising, ad platforms are usually rewarded for targeting consumers with high overall purchase probability. We develop a theoretical model that shows if consumers with high baseline purchase probability respond more positively to advertising, then firms and ad platforms agree on which consumers to target. If, conversely, consumers with low baseline purchase probability are the ones for which ads work best, then ad platforms target consumers that firms do not want to target—the incentives are misaligned. We conduct a large-scale randomized field experiment, targeting 208,538 individual consumers, in a display retargeting campaign. Our unique data set allows us to both causally identify advertising effectiveness and estimate the degree of incentive misalignments between the firm and ad platform. In accordance with the contracted incentives, the ad platform targets consumers that are more likely to purchase. Importantly, we find no evidence that ads are more effective for consumers with higher baseline purchase probability, rendering the ad platform’s bidding suboptimal for the firm. A welfare analysis suggests that the ad platform’s bidding optimization leads to a loss in profit for the firm and an overall decline in welfare. To remedy the incentive misalignment, we propose a solution in which the firm restricts the ad platform to target only consumers that are profitable based on individual consumer-level estimates for baseline purchase probability and ad effectiveness.

  abstract     = {The availability of consumer data is inducing a growing number of firms to adopt more personalized pricing policies. This affects both the performance of, and the competition between, alternative distribution channels, which in turn has implications for firms’ distribution strategies. We develop a formal model to examine a brand manufacturer’s choice between mono distribution (selling only through its own direct channel) or dual distribution (selling through an independent retailer as well). We consider different demand patterns, covering both horizontal and vertical differentiation and different pricing regimes, with the manufacturer and retailer each charging personalized prices or a uniform price. We show that dual distribution is optimal for a large number of cases. In particular, this is always the case when the channels are horizontally differentiated, regardless of the pricing regime; moreover, if both firms charge personalized prices, a well-designed wholesale tariff allows them to extract the entire consumer surplus. These insights obtained here for the case of intrabrand competition between vertically related firms are thus in stark contrast to those obtained for interbrand competition, where personalized pricing dissipates industry profit. With vertical differentiation, dual distribution remains optimal if the manufacturer charges a uniform price. By contrast, under personalized pricing, mono distribution can be optimal when the retailer does not expand demand sufficiently. Interestingly, the industry profit may be largest in a hybrid pricing regime, in which the manufacturer forgoes the use of personalized pricing and only the retailer charges personalized prices.

  abstract     = {In order to thrive, organizations need to build and maintain an ability to meet unexpected external challenges. Yet many organizations are sluggish: their capabilities can only undergo incremental changes over time. What are the stochastic processes governing “routinely occurring” challenges that best prepare a sluggish organization for unexpected challenges? We address this question with a stylized principal-agent model. The “agent” represents a sluggish organization that can only change its capability by one unit at a time, and the “principal” represents the organization’s head or its competitive environment. The principal commits ex ante to a Markov process over challenge levels. We characterize the process that maximizes long-run capability for both myopic and arbitrarily patient agents. We show how stochastic, time-varying challenges dramatically improve a sluggish organization’s preparedness for sudden challenges. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.

  abstract     = {This research investigates the role of parents in explaining the surprisingly low presence of women among inventors despite their increase among graduates from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. With Danish registry data on the population born between 1966 and 1985 and an experimental setting crafted on siblings’ gender composition, we find that the transmission of inventorship from parents to children disfavors daughters if they have a (second-born) brother. We complement this analysis with evidence about the role of parental factors at different stages of children’s education. Overall, our results confirm that parental role models matter for children’s education, especially at early stages and, through this, increase the probability of a child’s becoming an inventor. However, the direct transmission of inventorship that favors boys much more than girls seems to be affected by gendered expectations developed by parents about daughters’ and sons’ returns from inventorship. Our study contributes to explaining who becomes an inventor and why by adding an important boundary condition to the literature: Parents are intermediaries who, based on their own interpretation of external information about inventive jobs, contribute to create or limit opportunities for their children.

  abstract     = {In many markets, buyers sign advance contracts before actual decisions on transactions or consumptions are made. Therefore, a buyer may have private information on expected payoff at the contracting stage, and as time moves on, new information on other components of payoff may arrive. However, prior information can be losable, forgettable, or unattended. In this paper, we investigate how limited memory may influence the optimal design of contracts for sequential screening. Despite memory loss, the buyer can make ex post inference about her initially informed type from the chosen contract. As ex ante screening facilitates subsequent retrospection, the chosen contract can serve as a self-reminding instrument. This would yield an endogenous demand for separation in ex ante contract choice. In response, distortions in the optimal contract design can be either mitigated or intensified, leading to improved or undermined social welfare, respectively. As a result, the equilibrium buyer surplus can be higher than that under perfect memory. We also show that the buyer can exhibit the so-called flat-rate bias, even though her preference is time consistent and perfectly predicted. In addition, as memory can be perfectly recovered from the equilibrium contract choice, investing on any other memory-improving instrument is redundant. Moreover, the buyer’s demand for screening can induce her to choose dominated refund contract. Nevertheless, when dominance must be obeyed, the seller may offer a menu of refund contracts with two-way distortions. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.

  abstract     = {We propose a two-step machine learning algorithm—the Supervised Adaptive Group LASSO (SAGLasso) method—that is suitable for constructing parsimonious return predictors from a large set of macro variables. We apply this method to government bonds and a set of 917 macro variables and construct a new, transparent, and easy-to-interpret macro variable with significant out-of-sample predictive power for excess bond returns. This new macro factor, termed the SAGLasso factor, is a linear combination of merely 30 selected macro variables out of 917. Furthermore, it can be decomposed into three sublevel factors: a novel housing factor, an employment factor, and an inflation factor. Importantly, the predictive power of the SAGLasso factor is robust to bond yields, namely, the SAGLasso factor is not spanned by bond yields. Moreover, we show that the unspanned variation of the SAGLasso factor cannot be attributed to yield measurement error or macro measurement error. The SAGLasso factor therefore provides a potential resolution to the spanning controversy in the macro-finance literature. This paper was accepted by Haoxiang Zhu, finance.

This endogenously arising heterogeneity generates interbank trading. The credit market is partially frozen in a recession: only high-capital banks have continued funding access.

By capitalizing on comparative advantages of experimental methods, we provide insights into how investors process the information contained in different presentation methods to make cash flow forecasts, especially in the context of various types of nonrecurring items. We predict and find that, when nonrecurring accrued expenses are present, the indirect method leads to lower forecast errors by activating investors’ underlying knowledge structures of operating cash flows in terms of an accrual (versus cash) basis. We also find that, in the presence of nonrecurring cash or nonrecurring accrued revenues, there is no difference in forecast errors between the indirect and direct methods. Moreover, we find that the combination of the direct and indirect methods (the direct-plus-indirect method) leads to lower forecast errors than the direct method, but it does not provide an incremental benefit for forecast accuracy beyond the indirect method.

I demonstrate that this inter-announcement growth in information asymmetry occurs gradually throughout the entire inter-announcement period and not just right before each new earnings announcement. This inter-announcement growth has implications for reporting frequency decisions. A semiannual reporter that switches to quarterly reporting cuts the growth time in half by cutting each semiannual reporting period into two quarterly reporting periods. As a result, it reduces information asymmetry in what would have been the second half of the semiannual reporting period. I confirm this in a European setting, showing that the average reduction in bid-ask spreads from the inter-announcement growth channel is 1.6\% when firms switch from semiannual to quarterly reporting.

  abstract     = {In their 2012 paper, Bemmaor and Glady introduced the gamma/Gompertz/negative binomial distribution model for customer base analysis. Their model uses exponentially distributed interpurchase times and a Gompertz distributed customer lifetime, where the latter distribution is nonmemoryless. This comment corrects an error in their expression for the conditional expected number of individual future purchases E ( x i * ) in a forecasting interval of length T * . Contrary to their approach, the correct derivation of the conditional expectation must be based on the conditional survival and density functions of the lifetime distribution. Using the wrong formula leads managers to overestimate the expected future customer purchases. Further, the comment corrects the erroneous expressions for the conditional variance Var ( x i * ) and the conditional mean residual lifetime E ( τ − T i ) .

  abstract     = {We investigate the role of physical distance in corporate lending by exploiting infrastructure improvements as shocks to travel time. Lower travel time increases the likelihood of initiating a new banking relationship, consistent with an economic surplus from lower transaction costs. In existing lending relationships, banks capture part of this surplus by increasing interest rates, in particular, if banks have higher bargaining power. Reductions in travel time to competing banks have the opposite effects. Banks benefit from improved infrastructure through an increase in clients, and lenders that rely more on technology do not exhibit sensitivity to changes in distance.

  abstract     = {The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is the largest global environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiative in the asset-management industry to date. We analyze what happens after active U.S. mutual funds sign the PRI to assess whether they exhibit ESG implementation. We find that PRI signatories attract a large fund inflow, but we do not observe improvements in fund-level ESG scores or fund returns. We consider a battery of ways to proxy for funds’ ESG incorporation (e.g., entry/exit, screening, engagement, voting for pro-ESG proposals), but fail to observe evidence of meaningful on average follow-through. Next, we explore cross-sectional fund characteristics and find that only quant funds exhibit small improvements in ESG performance versus other funds, mainly through buying high-ESG-performing stocks. Furthermore, we note that signatories are not superior performers in ESG issues prior to joining the PRI relative to non-PRI funds, but PRI affiliation tends to be widely advertised on company websites, marketing materials, and fund documents. Overall, a reasonable reader may perceive our findings as consistent with PRI funds’ greenwashing. We note, however, that what we uncover is based only on outcome-based measures and may miss some actual efforts of signatories. This paper was accepted by Brian Bushee, accounting.

  abstract     = {We investigate a data-driven multiperiod inventory replenishment problem with uncertain demand and vendor lead time (VLT) with accessibility to a large quantity of historical data. Different from the traditional two-step predict-then-optimize (PTO) solution framework, we propose a one-step end-to-end (E2E) framework that uses deep learning models to output the suggested replenishment amount directly from input features without any intermediate step. The E2E model is trained to capture the behavior of the optimal dynamic programming solution under historical observations without any prior assumptions on the distributions of the demand and the VLT. By conducting a series of thorough numerical experiments using real data from one of the leading e-commerce companies, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed E2E model over conventional PTO frameworks. We also conduct a field experiment with JD.com, and the results show that our new algorithm reduces holding cost, stockout cost, total inventory cost, and turnover rate substantially compared with JD’s current practice. For the supply chain management industry, our E2E model shortens the decision process and provides an automatic inventory management solution with the possibility to generalize and scale. The concept of E2E, which uses the input information directly for the ultimate goal, can also be useful in practice for other supply chain management circumstances.

To capture the impact of such delays, we propose a simple parametric model of the continuous double auction market format. The model examines the dynamics of midpoint pegged order queues and finds their steady states. It shows how messaging delays can protect pegged orders and improve investor welfare, but typically increase queuing costs.

  abstract     = {Health information exchanges (HIEs) are designed to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare by facilitating improved information sharing between health entities. This study systematically examines the impact of HIE use in emergency departments (EDs) on the quality and efficiency of medical care. We focus on the length of stay (LOS) and the 30-day readmission rate to capture healthcare efficiency and quality, respectively. We also examine whether the breadth of patient health information and physicians’ experience with the HIE moderates these effects. We leverage a unique panel data that tracks actual HIE access by physicians who practice in a set of hospitals that participate in the focal HIE. The patient-level encounter data set—which involves more than 80,000 ED encounters attended by more than 300 physicians over a 19-month period—comprises detailed medical provider information, patient-level medical information, and various other information related to procedures that were performed. After controlling for a battery of patient-specific, physician-specific, disease-specific, and ED visit-specific variables, our results show that HIE access in information-intensive environments (such as EDs) reduces LOS and 30-day readmission rate. We find that breadth of patient health information and physicians’ HIE experience amplify these benefits. We account for endogeneity issues and perform additional falsification tests and robustness checks. We document that benefits of HIE access are amplified for noninjury, chronic condition, and uncommon diagnoses related patient visits. Based on our results, we offer insights to practitioners and academicians alike on how HIEs can yield better patient-level and provider-level outcomes.

  abstract     = {Restaurant delivery platforms collect customer orders via the Internet, transmit them to restaurants, and deliver the orders to customers. They provide value to restaurants by expanding their markets, but critics claim they destroy restaurant profits by taking a percentage of revenues and generating congestion that negatively impacts dine-in customers. We consider these tensions using a model of a restaurant as a congested service system. We find that the predominant industry contract, in which the platform takes a percentage cut of each delivery order (a “commission”), fails to coordinate the system because the platform does not internalize its effect on dine-in revenues; this leads to prices that are too low, reducing the restaurant’s margins and leaving money on the table for both firms. Two commonly proposed remedies to this problem (commission caps and allowing the restaurant to set a price floor on the platform) can increase restaurant revenue but do not solve the coordination issue. We thus propose an alternative, practical coordinating contract that is a variation of the current industry standard: for each delivery order, the platform pays the restaurant a percentage revenue share and a fixed fee. We show that this contract, appropriately designed, coordinates the system, protects restaurant margins by ensuring a lower bound on its revenue per delivery order, and allocates revenue between the restaurant and the platform with a high degree of flexibility.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates how the pricing policy of a revenue-maximizing monopolist is influenced by the social learning dynamics of customers who use online reviews to estimate the quality of the product. A salient feature of our problem is that the customers’ willingness to pay, and hence the demand function, evolves over time in conjunction with the online reviews. The monopolist strives to maximize its total expected revenue over a finite horizon by adjusting prices in response to these dynamics. The revenue maximization problem is studied using two different review models: a quality-based review model, where customers report their experienced quality, and a value-based review model, where reviews internalize experienced quality as well as the purchase price. To formulate the problem in tractable form, we derive a fluid model that provides a good approximation of the system dynamics when the volume of sales is large. This formulation lends itself to key structural insights into the interactions between optimal pricing policies and review dynamics. In particular, we identify critical time scales and social learning regimes that sharply separate the efficacy of dynamic pricing vis-à-vis fixed-price strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of the quality-based and value-based review models on key structural properties of the optimal pricing policies. These structural insights are also elucidated in an illustrative simulation study based on data from an online marketplace.

  abstract     = {We consider periodic review perishable inventory systems with a fixed product lifetime. Unsatisfied demand can be either lost or backlogged. The objective is to minimize the long-run average holding, penalty, and outdating cost. The optimal policy for these systems is notoriously complex and computationally intractable because of the curse of dimensionality. Hence, various heuristic replenishment policies are proposed in the literature, including the base-stock policy, which raises the total inventory level to a constant in each review period. Whereas various studies show near-optimal numerical performances of base-stock policies in the classic system with zero replenishment lead time and a first-in-first-out issuance policy, the results on their theoretical performances are very limited. In this paper, we first focus on this classic system and show that a simple base-stock policy is asymptotically optimal when any one of the product lifetime, demand population size, unit penalty cost, and unit outdating cost becomes large; moreover, its optimality gap converges to zero exponentially fast in the first two parameters. We then study two important extensions. For a system under a last-in-first-out or even an arbitrary issuance policy, we prove that a simple base-stock policy is asymptotically optimal with large product lifetime, large unit penalty costs, and large unit outdating costs, and for a backlogging system with positive lead times, we prove that our results continue to hold with large product lifetime, large demand population sizes, and large unit outdating costs. Finally, we provide a numerical study to demonstrate the performances of base-stock policies in these systems. This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albéniz, operations management.

  abstract     = {The notion of omnichannel, an integration of brick-and-mortar stores with online channels, has been thriving in recent years and is reforming the traditional service industry. Many service chains, such as Starbucks and McDonald’s, established omnichannel capability by allowing customers to order online in advance before visiting stores for pickup. The premise of omnichannel services is that when customers take advantage of the low-cost-of-waiting online channel, both their utility and the provider’s revenue will increase. Although simply adding an online-ordering option to the conventional walk-in model stimulates revenue, it also inflicts interference on the walk-in channel. We show that online ordering inadvertently reduces customers’ individual utility and social welfare when both channels are used in equilibrium. Moreover, the less it costs to order and wait online, the more the social welfare is reduced. We then evaluate two industry state-of-the-art operational remedies: regulating the use of the online channel and establishing channel-dedicated capacities. Although both remedies may improve the throughput over the walk-in-only service or even the first-come-first-served omnichannel service, they are unlikely to achieve this without jeopardizing the social welfare. We thus propose prioritizing walk-in customers and show that such prioritization can deliver this premise—that is, simultaneously benefiting the service provider and customers in comparison with the conventional walk-in-only service when both channels are used in equilibrium. Our results highlight that creating an efficient marketplace requires synergy between innovative technology and effective operational strategies.

  abstract     = {We study a single product pricing problem with demand censoring in an offline data-driven setting. In this problem, a retailer has a finite amount of inventory and faces a random demand that is price sensitive in a linear fashion with unknown price sensitivity and base demand distribution. Any unsatisfied demand that exceeds the inventory level is lost and unobservable. We assume that the retailer has access to an offline data set consisting of triples of historical price, inventory level, and potentially censored sales quantity. The retailer’s objective is to use the offline data set to find an optimal price, maximizing his or her expected revenue with finite inventories. Because of demand censoring in the offline data, we show that the existence of near-optimal algorithms in a data-driven problem—which we call problem identifiability— is not always guaranteed. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition for problem identifiability by comparing the solutions to two distributionally robust optimization problems. We propose a novel data-driven algorithm that hedges against the distributional uncertainty arising from censored data, with provable finite-sample performance guarantees regardless of problem identifiability and offline data quality. Specifically, we prove that, for identifiable problems, the proposed algorithm is near-optimal and, for unidentifiable problems, its worst-case revenue loss approaches the best-achievable minimax revenue loss that any data-driven algorithm must incur. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is highly effective and significantly improves both the expected and worst-case revenues compared with three regression-based algorithms.

  abstract     = {The impact of product reviews on consumer purchasing behavior is empirically well documented. This can create perverse incentives for firms to offer reviewers side payments (“bribes”) in exchange for biased reviews for their products. The presence of bribes distorts the information in reviews and leads to detrimental effects on consumer utility. This paper builds a two-sided reputation model where a reviewer can inflate her reviews in exchange for bribes. If the reviewer accepts bribes and misrepresents her reviews, then she builds her reputation as an inaccurate reviewer and makes consumers less likely to follow her recommendations. This in turn makes firms no longer interested in offering her a bribe. Can the reviewer retain influence over consumers’ purchasing decisions while simultaneously accepting bribes and misrepresenting her reviews? We provide a characterization of the environments that allow this kind of manipulation and show that regulatory policies that aim to reduce bribes can lead to undesirable outcomes. Finally, we show that eliminating bribes from the market can increase the welfare of all market participants, even for those firms who would have otherwise bribed in exchange for more favorable reviews.

  abstract     = {We derive generalized bounds on conditional expected excess returns that can be computed from option prices. The generalized lower bound may serve as an expected excess return proxy for individual and basket-type assets, is conditionally tight, accounts for the entire risk-neutral distribution of returns, and outperforms existing variance-based models in out-of-sample predictions. Bounds calibrated to realized returns correspond to reasonable risk aversion and prudence. On average, expected stock returns given by the bounds decrease on even weeks of the Federal Open Market Committee cycle. Cross-sectional tests deliver a reasonable market risk premium.

  abstract     = {This paper examines startups’ positioning within technological cycles. We use patent text to measure whether innovation pertains to a technological area that is rapidly evolving or stable. We show that innovation in rapidly evolving areas (i.e., early in the cycle) substitute for existing technologies, whereas innovation in stable areas (i.e., later in the cycle) complement them. Our new measure is distinct from existing characterizations of innovation and is economically important. We find that startups in rapidly evolving areas tend to exit via initial public offering, thus remaining independent, consistent with technological substitution. In contrast, startups in stable areas tend to sell out, consistent with technological complementarity and synergies. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.

  abstract     = {We study the spread of misinformation in a social network characterized by unequal access to learning resources. Agents use social learning to uncover an unknown state of the world, and a principal strategically injects misinformation into the network to distort this learning process. A subset of agents throughout the network is endowed with knowledge of the true state. This gives rise to a natural definition of inequality: privileged communities have unrestricted access to these agents, whereas marginalized communities do not. We show that the role that this inequality plays in the spread of misinformation is highly complex. For instance, communities who hoard resources and deny them to the larger population can end up exposing themselves to more misinformation. Conversely, although more inequality generally leads to worse outcomes, the prevalence of misinformation in society is nonmonotone in the level of inequality. This implies that policies that decrease inequality without substantially reducing it can leave society more vulnerable to misinformation.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study how an on-demand service platform could improve its performance through managing user conduct. In such a platform, service providers may reject certain platform-proposed service requests, and their responses, in turn, incentivize users to adjust their conduct. We develop an evolutionary game theory model of user conduct and provider responses that shows that the platform could improve user conduct through either setting a low wage for service providers or implementing priority matching. Building upon these results, we further model providers and users joining and leaving the platform by once again utilizing the evolutionary game theory approach. We find that wage setting alone is a blunt instrument to improve platform performance via managing user conduct, whereas supplementing the wage decision with priority matching could overcome its limitations and serve as an effective strategy to further improve platform performance in terms of growth and profitability. This finding suggests that matching prioritization could be an important strategy for managing platforms with user and provider heterogeneities. In addition, our analysis and results also demonstrate the potential of the evolutionary game theory approach for analyzing the impact of pricing and matching decisions on the performance of large markets.

  abstract     = {The “right-to-repair” (RTR) movement calls for government legislation that requires manufacturers to provide repair information, tools, and parts so that consumers can independently repair their own products with more ease. The initiative has gained global traction in recent years. Repair advocates argue that such legislation would break manufacturers’ monopoly on the repair market and benefit consumers. They further contend that it would reduce the environmental impact by reducing e-waste and new production. Yet the RTR legislation may also trigger a price response in the product market as manufacturers try to mitigate the profit loss. This paper employs an analytical model to study the pricing, welfare, and environmental implications of RTR. We find that, as the RTR legislation continually lowers the independent repair cost, manufacturers may initially cut the new product price and then raise it. This nonmonotone price adjustment may further induce a nonmonotone change in consumer surplus, social welfare, and the environmental impact. Strikingly, the RTR legislation can potentially lead to a lose–lose–lose outcome that compromises manufacturer profit, reduces consumer surplus, and increases the environmental impact despite repair being made easier and more affordable.

  abstract     = {Willingness to vaccinate and test are critical in the COVID-19 pandemic. We study the effects of two measures to increase the support of vaccination and testing: defaults and monetary compensations. Some organizations, such as restaurants, fire departments, hospitals, or governments in some countries, have used these measures. Yet there is the concern that compensations could erode intrinsic motivation and decrease vaccination intentions. We show that, in the early stages of the pandemic, both approaches, compensations and defaults, significantly increased COVID-19 test demand and vaccine intentions. Compensations for vaccines, however, need to be large enough because low compensations can backfire. We estimate heterogeneous treatment effects to document which groups are more likely to respond to these measures. The results show that defaults and avoidance of small compensations are especially important for individuals who are more skeptical of the vaccine, measured by their trust in the vaccine and their political views. Hence, both measures could be used in a targeted manner to achieve stronger results. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

At odds with traditional decision-making models with risk aversion, the winner-take-all condition results in substantially more entry than the expected-payoff-equivalent market entry game. We explore three candidate explanations for excess entry: blind spot, illusion of control, and joy of winning, none of which receive empirical support. We provide a novel theoretical explanation for excess entry based on cumulative prospect theory and test it empirically. Our results suggest that excess entry into highly competitive environments is not caused by a genuine preference for competing, but is instead driven by probability weighting.

We build a simple framework to formalize correspondence bias and test its predictions in an online experiment. Consistent with correspondence bias, subjects are, on average, willing to pay to receive the dictator-game givings of an individual with whom they are randomly assigned to play a game that encourages cooperation rather than one with whom they play a game that encourages selfish behavior. We show, further, that experiencing both games oneself, as opposed to playing one and observing the other, reduces the bias, and receiving information about how each of the players behaved in both games eliminates it.

  abstract     = {The strength of weak ties and brokerage theory both rely on the argument that weak bridging ties deliver novel information to create “vision advantages” for actors in brokerage positions. However, our conceptualization of novelty is itself fundamentally underdeveloped. We, therefore, develop a theory of how three distinct types of novelty—diversity, non-redundancy, and uniqueness—combine with network structure to create vision advantages in social networks. We test this theory using panel data on an evolving corporate email network. Three main results emerge from our analysis. First, we confirm the diversity-bandwidth tradeoff (DBT) at the heart of the vision advantage. As brokers’ networks become more diverse, their channel bandwidth contracts, creating countervailing effects on access to novel information. Second, we uncover a mechanism driving the DBT, which helps explain differences in vision advantages across strong and weak ties. Strong, cohesive ties deliver greater information diversity and non-redundancy, whereas weak bridging ties contribute the most unique information (the information that is most different from what other contacts deliver). Third, we find network diversity (in contrast to network constraint) to be positively associated with longitudinal entropy, a measure of the accumulation of novel information over time. This suggests that weak bridging ties, which provide the most unique information through low bandwidth, structurally diverse channels, contribute the most to one’s aggregation of novel information over time. Collectively, these results take a step toward resolving a long-standing debate in network theory about whether strong, cohesive networks or weak bridging networks contribute more to vision advantages.

  abstract     = {A quantum computer exhibits quantum advantage when it can perform a calculation that a classical computer is unable to complete. It follows that a company with a quantum computer would be a monopolist in the market for such a calculation if its only competitor was a company with a classical computer. Conversely, economic outcomes are unclear if quantum computers do not exhibit a quantum advantage, but classical and quantum computers have different cost structures. We model a Cournot duopoly where a quantum computing company competes against a classical computing company. The model features an asymmetric variable cost structure between the two companies and the potential for an asymmetric fixed cost structure, where each firm can invest in scaling its hardware to expand its respective market. We find that even if (1) the companies can complete identical calculations, and thus there is no quantum advantage, and (2) it is more expensive to scale the quantum computer, the quantum computing company may be more profitable and also invest more in market creation due to efficiency gains from using quantum algorithms. Finally, we provide examples of settings where the classical computer can also perform a calculation, but not in a cost-effective enough manner to be commercially viable. In such a setting, the quantum computing company becomes a monopolist despite exhibiting no quantum advantage. Taken together, quantum computers may not need to display a quantum advantage to be able to generate a quantum economic advantage for the companies that deploy them. This paper was accepted by D. J.

In particular, if attention is scarce, increased competition reduces the quality of services because business-stealing incentives induce platforms to increase addictiveness.

Each agent geometrically discounts additional units by a constant factor. We show that when goods are complements, the incentive problem—measured as the ratio of second-best to first-best social surplus—becomes less severe as the degree of complementarity increases. In contrast, if goods are substitutes and each agent’s distribution exhibits linear virtual types, then this ratio is a constant. If the bilateral trade setup arises from prior vertical integration between a buyer and a supplier, with the vertically integrated firm being a buyer facing an independent supplier, then the ratio of second-best to first-best social surplus is, in general, not monotone in the degree of complementarity when products are substitutes and is increasing when products are complements. Extensions to profit maximization by a market maker and a discrete public good problem show that the broad insight that complementarity of goods mitigates the incentive problem generalizes to these settings.

  abstract     = {The Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism is frequently used in experimental research to measure willingness-to-pay (WTP). The mechanism is very appealing given its incentive compatibility property. However, a growing body of experimental evidence finds that WTP is sensitive to the underlying price distribution of the BDM mechanism. The literature suggests that these findings can be rationalized only if subjects have context-dependent preferences. Under context-dependent preferences, the use of the BDM mechanism momentarily changes subjects’ preferences; subjects do not have incentives to report their intrinsic valuation, which is what the BDM attempts to measure, but instead they report the amount they are willing to pay after their preferences have momentarily changed. This lack of incentive compatibility would raise serious concerns about the validity of the BDM as an elicitation procedure; indeed, virtually all studies that use the BDM mechanism choose that elicitation procedure precisely for its incentive compatibility property. In this paper, we propose that an assumption of context dependence is not necessary to rationalize the aforementioned experimental findings. We provide an alternative plausible theory and experimental evidence to support it. Our theory relies on the premise that subjects need to exert effort to learn their preferences. We find that the price distribution of the BDM mechanism influences the subject’s incentives to exert effort. The results presented here are particularly appealing to the experimental research: our theory is consistent with the experimental findings that WTP is sensitive to the price distribution of the BDM mechanism while preserving the incentive compatibility property.

  abstract     = {Long wait times for patients are an important health policy issue in many countries, especially developing countries in which there is generally poorer health infrastructure, appointments are not very common, and the opportunity cost of competing life priorities is high. In this research, we examine via field experiments in health clinics in India whether providing numeric versus alphanumeric wait tokens can affect pain perceptions of patients and whether the type of tokens can also affect their wait-time perception and visit satisfaction. Our research provides initial evidence that alphanumeric tokens, in most cases, lead to lower pain perception, lower wait-time perception, and higher satisfaction levels with the healthcare system compared with numeric tokens. However, this is not always true; we also demonstrate boundary conditions when numeric tokens perform better and when the differences between tokens are attenuated. We conducted field experiments in three separate clinics and vary the type of tokens (numeric versus alphanumeric) used to test multiple token operationalizations in varied healthcare contexts. We explain our findings using the cognitive strategy of wait-time perception and discuss why this strategy is helpful for a developing country. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.

  abstract     = {The limits of arbitrage explain how a speculative bubble is sustained; they do not explain how likely one is to occur. To do that, you need a theory about the thing that sporadically causes arbitrageur constraints to bind. I propose a first such theory, which is based on social interactions between speculators. The theory says that bubbles should be more likely in assets where increases in past returns make excited-speculators relatively more persuasive to their peers. I empirically verify this ex ante prediction about bubble likelihoods and show that it is robust to some ex post disagreement about bubble definitions.

  abstract     = {Dealers can choose between two intermediation methods: providing immediacy to customers using their own inventory and making matches between customers’ order flows. We show that dealers have an incentive to prioritize inventory turnover for immediacy provision rather than making matches between customers. Compared with a counterfactual scenario without this incentive, dealers in equilibrium provide immediacy to more customers in order to extract extra rents. Compared with the counterfactual, this incentive decreases equilibrium price for immediacy but increases the bid–ask spread. The incentive to prioritize immediacy provision lowers welfare for assets with high substitutability but raises welfare for assets with low substitutability. Our analysis has potential policy implications for the Volcker rule, which can be viewed as the counterfactual. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

  abstract     = {We examine the impact of social investing on charitable donations using a unique data set consisting of investment behaviors and donation transactions for more than 10,000 customers of an investment app platform. We find that investors switching to a recently introduced social fund reduced their donations, mainly in charities supporting causes similar to those of the social fund. However, 79\% of the investors that switched to the social fund did not donate before switching, so the social fund attracted more people to fund social causes. Still, because of the substitution effect, we estimate social funds have a positive effect on society only if their annual contributions to social causes are greater than 3.2\% of the balance invested.

  abstract     = {We study mismarking of newly purchased odd lot and two classes of round lot structured product positions in mutual funds. Such mismarking artificially inflates net asset values and overstates cumulative returns. Applied to funds launched after January 2010, a simulation-tested mismarking fund filter identifies 12 Highly Questionable funds managing $75 billion. The performance of these funds matches closely the predicted pattern of mismarking: extremely high alpha and skewness, particularly immediately after launch. We show that structured product mismarking can seriously inflate return-since-inception metrics. We also provide evidence consistent with return smoothing for one quarter of the sample structured product funds. The inflated performance metrics benefit fund managers through significantly higher Sharpe ratios, Morningstar ratings, and asset growth but cause material losses to later investor cohorts.

  abstract     = {Return on investment (ROI) and residual income (RI) are two important accounting measures that are commonly used to evaluate managers’ performance, and evidence suggests that both ROI and RI can help motivate long-term investments. Research is limited, though, regarding whether ROI and RI differentially affect managers’ actions, and, more specifically, research has not examined the effects of ROI and RI on risk-taking. We conduct an experiment to examine the separate and interactive effects of individuals’ risk preferences and ROI and RI performance measures on risk-taking in capital investment decisions. We predict and find that the use of ROI as a performance measure leads to riskier choices, as compared with RI, and that this effect is concentrated in relatively more risk-averse individuals. We also provide process evidence that reveals some of the ways in which ROI and RI performance measures affect decision making. Collectively, our results contribute to literature examining the effects of accounting information and performance measures on managers’ risk-taking behaviors.

  abstract     = {We analyze a large-scale survey of small business owners, managers, and employees in the United States to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on those businesses. We explore two waves of the survey that were fielded on Facebook in April 2020 and December 2020. We document five facts about the impact of the pandemic on small businesses. (1) Larger firms, older firms, and male-owned firms were more likely to remain open during the early stages of the pandemic with many of these heterogeneities persisting through the end of 2020. (2) At businesses that remained open, concerns about demand shocks outweighed concerns about supply shocks though the relative importance of supply shocks grew over time. (3) In response to the pandemic, almost a quarter of the firms reduced their prices with price reductions concentrated among businesses facing financial constraints and demand shocks; almost no firms raised prices. (4) Only a quarter of small businesses had access to formal sources of financing at the start of the pandemic, and access to formal financing affected how firms responded to the pandemic. (5) Increased household responsibilities affected the ability of managers and employees to focus on their work, whereas increased business responsibilities impacted their ability to take care of their household members. This effect persisted through December 2020 and was particularly strong for women and parents of school-aged children. We discuss how these facts inform our understanding of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and how they can help design policy responses to similar shocks.

  abstract     = {Despite the substantial economic impact of the restaurant industry, large-scale empirical research on restaurant survival has been sparse. We investigate whether consumer-posted photos can serve as a leading indicator of restaurant survival above and beyond reviews, firm characteristics, competitive landscape, and macroconditions. We employ machine learning techniques to extract features from 755,758 photos and 1,121,069 reviews posted on Yelp between 2004 and 2015 for 17,719 U.S. restaurants. We also collect data on restaurant characteristics (e.g., cuisine type, price level) and competitive landscape as well as entry and exit (if applicable) time from each restaurant’s Yelp/Facebook page, own website, or Google search engine. Using a predictive XGBoost algorithm, we find that consumer-posted photos are strong predictors of restaurant survival. Interestingly, the informativeness of photos (e.g., the proportion of food photos) relates more to restaurant survival than do photographic attributes (e.g., composition, brightness). Additionally, photos carry more predictive power for independent, young or mid-aged, and medium-priced restaurants. Assuming that restaurant owners possess no knowledge about future photos and reviews, photos can predict restaurant survival for up to three years, whereas reviews are only predictive for one year. We further employ causal forests to facilitate the interpretation of our predictive results. Among photo content variables, the proportion of food photos has the largest positive association with restaurant survival, followed by proportions of outside and interior photos. Among others, the proportion of photos with helpful votes also positively relates to restaurant survival. This paper was accepted by Juanjuan Zhang, marketing.

  abstract     = {We propose a new data-driven approach for addressing multistage stochastic linear optimization problems with unknown distributions. The approach consists of solving a robust optimization problem that is constructed from sample paths of the underlying stochastic process. We provide asymptotic bounds on the gap between the optimal costs of the robust optimization problem and the underlying stochastic problem as more sample paths are obtained, and we characterize cases in which this gap is equal to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sample path approach for multistage stochastic linear optimization that offers asymptotic optimality guarantees when uncertainty is arbitrarily correlated across time. Finally, we develop approximation algorithms for the proposed approach by extending techniques from the robust optimization literature and demonstrate their practical value through numerical experiments on stylized data-driven inventory management problems.

  abstract     = {Regulators frequently relax accounting rules during a financial crisis as a means of regulatory forbearance. The new accounting options provide banks with an opportunity for an accrual-based increase in their regulatory capital. The use of such an accounting option helps reduce the costs of government interventions such as bailouts and avoid the dilution of existing shareholders’ ownership rights. We examine the introduction of the reclassification option for financial assets during the 2008 financial crisis and study the position of accrual-based options in the pecking order of banks’ recapitalization measures. The findings suggest that the accrual-based increase in regulatory capital is temporary and does not provide permanent relief. Consistent with the long-term costs of accrual-based measures, investors perceive the accounting choice as a negative signal. If banks do not complement their use of the accounting option by other corrective actions that result in a real capital increase and a liquidity injection, they continue to suffer from low capitalization and financial difficulties in the following years. Ultimately, government interventions in accounting regulation are unlikely to offer a sustainable solution to capital shortfalls in the banking sector if they are not supported by the concurrent enforcement of real corrective actions.

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel approach to measure the founding strategic differentiation of startups and its relationship to follow-on performance. We use natural language processing and historical websites to estimate the similarity between the founding website of an individual startup, the historical website of public firms at the startup’s founding year, and the founding website of other startups founded in the same year. We propose that distance in the value proposition stated in these websites represents differentiation in the market. Startup differentiation is estimated as the average text-based distance from the five closest incumbents (public firms). We implement this approach using a large sample of startups from Crunchbase. Our measure predicts a meaningful increase in early-stage financing and equity outcomes, unconditionally and controlling for cohort and industry fixed effects. The positive benefits of equity outcomes only evidence themselves after year 6 of age, suggesting more differentiated firms may take longer to prove themselves. Using out-of-sample tests, we also demonstrate that our measure is economically important, predicting 30\% of the total variation in the receipt of early-stage financing and 20\% of variation in equity outcomes. Public datasets of our differentiation score and scraped website data are provided, together with open-source code to replicate our approach in other settings.

Moreover, in the cross-section of equity returns, investors demand a risk premium for stocks that perform poorly in times of high uncertainty and elevated risk aversion. In a model with endogenously time-varying RA, uncertainty shocks lead to large falls in investment and equity prices that closely match state-dependent data responses.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the prevalence of potential anticompetitive effects of vertical mergers using a novel data set on U.S. and international buyer-seller relationships and across a large range of industries. We find that relationships are more likely to break when suppliers vertically integrate with one of the buyers’ competitors than when they vertically integrate with an unrelated firm. This relationship holds for both domestic and cross-border mergers and for domestic and international relationships. It also holds when instrumenting mergers using exogenous downward pressure on the supplier’s stock prices, suggesting that reverse causality is unlikely to explain the result. In contrast, the relationship vanishes when using rumored or announced but not completed integration events. Firms experience a substantial drop in sales when one of their suppliers integrates with one of their competitors. This sales drop is mitigated if the firm has alternative suppliers in place. These findings are consistent with anticompetitive effects of vertical mergers, such as vertical foreclosure, rising input costs for rivals, or self-foreclosure.

  abstract     = {The growing influence of internet platforms acting as content aggregators is one of the most important challenges facing the media industry. We develop a simple model to understand the impact of third-party content bundling by a social platform that has a monopoly on showing user-generated content to consumers. In our model, consumers can access news either directly through a newspaper’s website or indirectly through a platform, which also offers social content. We show that content bundling, when unilaterally implemented by the platform, tends to harm publishers and to increase the dispersion of quality across outlets, with initially high-quality outlets investing more and low-quality ones investing less. With many heterogenous newspapers, the result is robust even if each newspaper can prevent the platform from using its content. When content bundling follows an agreement between the platform and publisher, its effects are reversed, as publishers’ profits go up while quality dispersion goes down. In a setup with heterogeneous consumers, we also show that the platform’s ability to personalize the mix of content it shows to users induces publishers to invest more in the quality of their content.

  abstract     = {We study how daily labor supply responds to unanticipated earnings shocks among Singapore’s taxi drivers using a novel identification strategy that uses idiosyncratic variation in booking cancellations and passenger no-shows (CNS) that drivers repeatedly receive. Our results provide new and more compelling evidence in support of the income-targeting model of labor supply. Not only are the average responses on the extensive margin consistent with the income-targeting model, but the responses on the intensive margin and the heterogeneous responses at different income levels and across driver characteristics are as well. We find that drivers work longer and earn more per hour following CNS, and the effects are robust after controlling for rich fixed effects, market supply and demand conditions, and drivers’ sunk cost of time. The CNS effects on ending a shift exhibit a U-shaped pattern, are strongest when cumulative income is close to the average shift income, and become insignificant when the income level is too low or too high. The effects are most pronounced in the first hour of CNS and fade away quickly afterward. Drivers achieve higher productivity by reducing break time, taking more jobs, driving faster, driving to places with more earning opportunities, and having more time with passengers on board. Drivers choose the response strategies that are complementary to their abilities and circumstances such as schedule flexibility and potential for productivity improvement: those with flexible working schedules tend to prolong their shifts, whereas those with flexible earnings rates tend to increase their subsequent productivity. Our novel identification strategy strengthens the empirical literature on daily labor supply, and our findings of heterogeneity effects offer new insights on income-targeting behaviors.

  abstract     = {Uncertainty may exist about the desirability of trade in bilateral bargaining. For instance, buyers may not know their value perfectly and sellers may not be fully aware of their cost structure. We endogenize the expected surplus of trade by considering information gathering before price negotiation between a seller and a buyer. We show that prebargaining information acquisition can reverse standard findings in canonical bargaining models, regarding how the bargaining primitives may influence the equilibrium expected payoffs and the negotiated price. In particular, a higher bargaining power can result in a lower expected payoff, because the other party’s reduced incentive to acquire information would reduce the total pie to be split between the parties. In the same vein, the seller’s expected payoff can decrease as its material cost becomes lower or its outside option improves, and the buyer can be hurt by a higher value from the transaction or from its outside option. Similarly, the seller/buyer may become worse off by having more information if that induces the counter party to acquire less information. In addition, the expected negotiated price may decrease with the seller’s relative bargaining power, its material/opportunity cost, or the buyer’s incremental value. We also examine the robustness of the basic results under joint information acquisition or noncredible communication. Moreover, we show that a shopping intermediary may prefer to decrease the seller’s bargaining power or increase the buyer’s cost of gathering information. We discuss how our findings can shed light on practice and empirical research. This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing. Funding: This workwas supported by Hong Kong RGC [DAG Grant].},

  abstract     = {We study the effects of positive and negative advertising in presidential elections. We develop a model to disentangle these effects on voter turnout and candidate choice. The central empirical challenges are highly correlated and endogenous advertising quantities that are measured with error. To address these challenges, we construct a large set of potential instruments, including interactions with incumbency that we demonstrate provide the critical identifying variation, and apply machine-learning causal inference methods. Using data from the 2000 and 2004 U.S. presidential elections, we find that positive and negative ads play fundamentally different roles. Negative ads are more effective at driving relative candidate shares, whereas positive ads stimulate turnout. These results indicate that a candidate geographically targeting tone trades off local relative share gains and local increases in turnout for localities with a strong base. Counterfactual simulations, where the candidates adjust the quantity of positive and negative advertising while budgets remain fixed, indicate that ad tone alone can impact the outcome of close elections. Our analysis also provides potential explanations as to why past studies have produced mixed findings on both ad-tone and turnout effects. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.

  abstract     = {This paper studies outcomes of the deferred acceptance algorithm in large random matching markets where priorities are generated either by a single lottery or by independent lotteries. In contrast to prior work, my model permits students to submit lists of varying lengths and schools to vary in their popularity and number of seats. In a limiting regime where the number of students and schools grow while the length of student lists and number of seats at each school remain bounded, I provide exact expressions for the number of students who list l schools and match to one of their top k choices, for each k ≤ l . These expressions provide three main insights. First, there is a persistent tradeoff between using a single lottery and independent lotteries. For students who submit short lists, the rank distribution under a single lottery stochastically dominates the corresponding distribution under independent lotteries. However, the students who submit the longest lists are always more likely to match when schools use independent lotteries. Second, I compare the total number of matches in the two lottery systems, and find that the shape of the list length distribution plays a key role. If this distribution has an increasing hazard rate, then independent lotteries match more students. If it has a decreasing hazard rate, the comparison reverses. To my knowledge, this is the first analytical result comparing the size of stable matchings under different priority rules. Finally, I study the fraction of assigned students who receive their first choice. Under independent lotteries, this fraction may be arbitrarily small, even if schools are equally popular. Under a single lottery, we provide a tight lower bound on this fraction which depends on the ratio r of the popularity of the most to least popular school. When each school has a single seat, the fraction of assigned students who receive their first choice is at least r / ( 1 + r ) . This guarantee increases to 2 / ( 1 + r ) as the number of seats at each school increases. This paper was accepted by Gabriel Weintraub, revenue management and market analytics.

  abstract     = {Clinical practice guidelines do not sufficiently address the needs of patients with chronic conditions as these guidelines focus on single disease management and ignore unique patient-specific conditions. As a result, a nonpersonalized approach to the management of the patients with chronic conditions leads to adverse events and increases the financial burden on the healthcare system as over 150 million Americans experience chronic conditions. To this end, we develop a stochastic modeling framework to personalize the disease screening decisions for patients with or at risk for developing a chronic condition and provide an exact solution algorithm. We consider the optimal management of the screening decisions for an index disease (e.g., breast cancer, colorectal cancer, human immunodeficiency virus, etc.) while accounting for the existence of a chronic condition (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, etc.). Our modeling framework is particularly useful for the cases where the chronic condition affects the risk of the index disease. In a case study using real breast cancer epidemiology data, we demonstrate how our modeling framework can be used to personalize breast cancer screening for women with type 2 diabetes. In addition to providing a personalized breast cancer screening schedule for women with diabetes, we find some important policy insights that were not previously recognized by the medical community. More specifically, we find that compared with women without diabetes, women with diabetes should be screened less aggressively, but screening should end at similar ages. We also find that adherence to the optimal screening policy is more crucial for women with diabetes compared with nondiabetic women. Our main insight on screening recommendations also has important resource implications as it leads to fewer screening mammograms. That is, compared with the current national breast cancer screening guidelines, the optimal breast cancer screening policy for women with diabetes could save the healthcare system approximately 2.6 million mammograms annually.

  abstract     = {Hospitalists are medical doctors that specialize in the care of hospitalized patients, a role that until recently belonged to primary care physicians. We develop an operational model of hospitalist-patient interactions with rounding and responding service modes, optimizing hospitalist caseload and case-mix to achieve the maximal reduction in patient length of stay (LOS). We show that hospitalists are effective at reducing LOS for patients with complex conditions, corroborating intuitive reasoning. However, the optimal hospitalist case-mix also includes “simple” patients with few interventions and short LOS, as they can effectively reduce discharge delays. This actionable insight is particularly salient for small community hospitals with simple, short-stay patients, where hospitalists may be undervalued due to the prevailing belief that they are primarily effective for complex patients. We conduct a comparative case study of a small community hospital and a large academic hospital, drawing a stark contrast between the two in terms of ideal caseload and patient coverage. Despite the fact that the academic hospital treats higher complexity patients, hospitalists at the community hospital should actually have a lower caseload than hospitalists at the academic hospital due to shorter stays in the community hospital. We find that both hospitals are understaffed but for different reasons: the academic hospital needs to staff more hospitalists to reduce the current caseload of its hospitalists, whereas the community hospital needs to staff more hospitalists to expand its hospitalist coverage to more patients. We estimate that these hospitals can save on average $1.5 million annually by implementing the optimal staffing policies. This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.

  abstract     = {We develop a game-theoretic model to study the incentive for competing manufacturers to share supplier audit information. Based on the audit information, each manufacturer decides whether to source from a common supplier who has uncertain responsibility violation risk or to switch to a backup supplier who has no responsibility violation risk but charges a higher price. When supplier responsibility violation occurs, some consumers boycott the manufacturers involved. Audit information allows a manufacturer to reduce the uncertainty about the risk of the common supplier. We show that audit information sharing may make the manufacturers’ sourcing strategies more or less differentiated. As a result, the information-sharing decision is not monotone in the model parameters. We fully characterize the manufacturers’ equilibrium audit information-sharing and sourcing decisions and establish conditions under which audit information sharing induces the manufacturers to adopt more or less responsible sourcing strategies. We also show that a manufacturer could be better off when the cost premium of sourcing from the backup supplier or the risk of the common supplier becomes higher or the audit information becomes less accurate.

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen considerable debate about the practicability of a global quantity/price commitment to control carbon emissions and tackle environmental issues. In this paper, we study the impact of the cap-and-trade policy (quantity commitment) and the carbon tax policy (price commitment) on a firm’s technology investment and production decisions. The main feature captured in our model is that there exist correlated uncertainties between the sales market (demand uncertainty) and the permit trading market (permit price volatility) under the cap-and-trade policy. The correlation relationship stands on the following intuition. The demands for final products affect firms’ production output, which generates the needs of emission permits and influences the permit price. We show that under the cap-and-trade policy, with the uncertainty of the future emission price, the firm could flexibly adjust its production quantity to enhance its profit, resulting in low incentives to invest in clean technology. However, as the (positive) correlation between the sales market and the permit trading market increases, the production flexibility is constrained so that the firm has to increase its technology investment to hedge against the future risk of a high emission price. Making a comparison between the cap-and-trade and carbon tax policies, we find that when the correlation coefficient is moderate, the carbon tax policy generates a multiwin situation (i.e., more technology investment, higher expected profit and consumer surplus, and fewer carbon emissions). Case studies are provided to illustrate the implications and model variants are examined to check the robustness of the main results. Overall, our analysis sheds light on recent debate over carbon pricing and identifies the important role of correlated uncertainties in carbon policy design.

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has killed millions and gravely disrupted the world’s economy. A safe and effective vaccine was developed remarkably swiftly, but as of yet, uptake of the vaccine has been slow. This paper explores one potential explanation of delayed adoption of the vaccine, which is data privacy concerns. We explore two contrasting regulations that vary across U.S. states that have the potential to affect the perceived privacy risk associated with receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The first regulation—an “identification requirement”—increases privacy concerns by requiring individuals to verify residency with government approved documentation. The second regulation—“anonymity protection”—reduces privacy concerns by allowing individuals to remove personally identifying information from state-operated immunization registry systems. We investigate the effects of these privacy-reducing and privacy-protecting regulations on U.S. state-level COVID-19 vaccination rates. Using a panel data set, we find that identification requirements decrease vaccine demand but that this negative effect is offset when individuals are able to remove information from an immunization registry. Our results remain consistent when controlling for CDC-defined barriers to vaccination, levels of misinformation, vaccine incentives, and states’ phased distribution of vaccine supply. These findings yield significant theoretical and practical contributions for privacy policy and public health. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the effect of the expiry of recording copyright on the supply of music—in the form of rereleases, availability on streaming platforms, and concert performances—by artists popular in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. We find that recording copyright expiry has different effects on a song’s availability in different distribution channels. The lapsing of copyright leads to a large increase in the number of rereleases in physical formats, holding constant artist, age, and year fixed effects. However, when a song’s original recording copyright expires, it becomes less likely to be performed in concert. Moreover, copyright status is not associated with differences in availability on the digital streaming platform Spotify. These results show that copyright expiry has nuanced effects on availability and can lead to different and even opposite effects on availability of a product across different distribution channels. They also show that within the context of digital distribution, the impact of copyright on availability differs based on the business model of a platform.

  abstract     = {A major challenge in obtaining evaluations of products or services on e-commerce platforms is eliciting informative responses in the absence of verifiability. This paper proposes the square root agreement rule (SRA): a simple reward mechanism that incentivizes truthful responses to objective evaluations on such platforms. In this mechanism, an agent gets a reward for an evaluation only if the answer matches that of a peer agent, where this reward is inversely proportional to a popularity index of the answer. This index is defined to be the square root of the empirical frequency at which any two agents performing the same evaluation agree on the particular answer across evaluations of similar entities operating on the platform. Rarely agreed-on answers thus earn a higher reward than answers for which agreements are relatively more common. We show that in the many tasks regime, the truthful equilibrium under SRA is strictly payoff-dominant across large classes of natural equilibria that could arise in these settings, thus increasing the likelihood of its adoption. Although there exist other mechanisms achieving such guarantees, they either impose additional assumptions on the response distribution that are not generally satisfied for objective evaluations or they incentivize truthful behavior only if each agent performs a prohibitively large number of evaluations and commits to using the same strategy for each evaluation. SRA is the first known incentive mechanism satisfying such guarantees without imposing any such requirements. Moreover, our empirical findings demonstrate the robustness of the incentive properties of SRA in the presence of mild subjectivity or observational biases in the responses. These properties make SRA uniquely attractive for administering reward-based incentive schemes (e.g., rebates, discounts, reputation scores, etc.) on online platforms.

  abstract     = {A common pattern of control in firms is for management to retain a broad set of rights, whereas the remaining stakeholders’ contracts provide them with targeted veto rights over specific classes of decisions. We explain this pattern of control sharing as an efficient organizational response that balances the need to encourage management to account for stakeholders’ interests against the need to prevent self-interested stakeholders from blocking valuable proposals. Enforceable obligations of good faith and fair dealing play an essential role in facilitating undivided management control of many decisions. With these legal protections (but not without them), shared control is more likely when the parties are more symmetrically informed and hence, better able to bargain to efficient decisions.

  abstract     = {Firm-induced migration typically entails firms relocating workers to fill value-creating positions at destination locations. But such relocated workers are often exposed to external employment opportunities at their destinations, possibly triggering turnover. We conceptualize the firm-induced migration path , consisting of the relocated workers’ place of origin and destination, as relevant in determining worker performance and turnover postrelocation. Using a unique data set from a large Indian technology firm that hires talent from both large cities and smaller towns, we document robust econometric patterns by exploiting the firm’s randomized assignment of workers to production centers across the country. These production centers are located in the largest technology cluster in India (Bangalore), smaller technology clusters, and noncluster locations. We find that the firm-induced migration path shapes both worker performance and turnover. Compared with workers from large cities, workers from smaller towns achieve higher performance when relocated to Bangalore than to other production centers, but are also more likely to join competing firms. Fine-grained data on employment and human-capital-augmentation opportunities at workers’ destination locations, and on socioeconomic conditions in workers’ places of origin, help us rule in an abductive explanation: across firm-induced migration paths, differences in external labor-market opportunities between workers’ places of origin and their destinations, as well as intrafirm skill-development opportunities at the destination, are related to heterogeneous human-capital outcomes.

  abstract     = {We study the value of divergence in values and preferences in organizations by combining three stages of a decision process—ex ante information acquisition, interim project choice, and ex post project execution—into a tractable model. A key insight is that our unified model provides predictions different from models without the execution decision stage. We consider an organization that consists of a decision maker who selects a project and an implementer who acquires costly information before project choice and executes the selected project. They have intrinsic and possibly divergent preferences over projects. We show that, although the implementer’s dual role generates a disadvantage of designing conflicts in terms of the implementation motivation, it simultaneously boosts the implementer’s motivation for information acquisition to influence the decision maker’s project choice more under divergent preferences. Our results provide managerial insights that designing conflicts is beneficial only in environments where additional information is sufficiently precise and must be accompanied by a manager who is balanced and incorporating feedback.

  abstract     = {Morals constrain self-serving behavior. Yet, self-regulation failures in the face of monetary temptation are common at the workplace. To limit such failures, organizations can design environments that limit the temptation to behave self-servingly, nudging workers to uphold their morals. In a series of experiments where participants may be tempted to take excessive pay after exerting effort, we study whether a simple intervention—asking individuals to state the wage they believe should be paid ex ante, before facing the temptation to take excessive compensation—prevents self-serving behavior. In contrast to lay beliefs and the predictions from prior work, we find that such an intervention is not effective, leading to self-serving behavior. However, a more realistic elicitation procedure of the appropriate wage mitigates this effect. These findings contribute to work on the malleability of moral behavior showing that simple interventions thought to effectively mitigate self-serving behavior can prompt individuals to stretch their moral boundaries. They also stress the importance of properly testing interventions that might seem intuitive. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

We show that estimated discount factors in the choice list are biased by both kinds of reference points and propose a model to jointly account for both.

  abstract     = {Several corporations have committed to procuring a percentage of their electricity demand from renewable sources by a future date. Long-term financial contracts with renewable generators based on a fixed strike price, known as virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), are popular to meet such a target. We formulate rolling power purchases using a portfolio of VPPAs as a Markov decision process, accounting for uncertainty in generator availability and in the prices of electricity, renewable energy certificates, and VPPAs. Obtaining an optimal procurement policy is intractable. We consider forecast-based reoptimization heuristics consistent with practice that limit the sourcing of different VPPA types and the timing of new agreements. We extend these heuristics and introduce an information-relaxation based reoptimization heuristic, both of which allow for full sourcing and timing flexibilities. The latter heuristic also accounts for future uncertainties when making a decision. We assess the value of decision flexibility in rolling power purchases to meet a renewable target by numerically comparing the aforementioned policies and variants thereof on realistic instances involving a novel strike price stochastic process calibrated to data. Policies with full timing flexibility and no sourcing flexibility reduce procurement costs significantly compared with one with neither type of flexibility. Introducing sourcing flexibility in the former policies results in further significant cost reduction, thus providing support for using VPPA portfolios that are both dynamic and heterogeneous. Computing near-optimal portfolios of this nature entails using our information-relaxation based reoptimization heuristic because portfolios constructed via forecast-based reoptimization exhibit higher suboptimality.

We find that violations of standards of care are more severe in religiously affiliated homes.

Fewer complaints increase the time that religiously affiliated homes operate without monitoring, which allows violations to escalate before they are detected. Our findings highlight an understudied process in the literature on organizational wrongdoing: Although much attention has been devoted to how inspector bias can lead to incorrect conclusions about the true rates of wrongdoing across organizations, religious affiliation can lead to similarly incorrect conclusions—but through an internal organizational process.

By further disentangling a global common component from our rare disaster index, we find evidence supporting theories that emphasize globally shared disaster risk as the important driving force of asset price fluctuations.

We construct an aggregate index of manager expectations and show that, as a forecast of Chinese monetary policy, it compares favorably with both market- and model-based alternative projections. We also show that fund managers act on these expectations and correctly anticipating shifts in Chinese monetary policy improves fund performance. Our results imply that manager skill is an important determinant of fund returns, providing the first evidence from China on a question for which studies of asset management in other countries have reached conflicting conclusions.

  abstract     = {Recent studies have proposed a large set of powerful anomaly-based factors in the stock market. This study examines the role of investor inattention in the corresponding anomalies underlying these factors and other underreaction-related anomalies. Using media coverage as a proxy for investor attention, we show that the anomalies underlying many recently proposed prominent factors are much more pronounced among firms with low media coverage in portfolio-formation periods. In addition, we find many other prominent anomalies that previous literature has attributed to underreaction also tend to perform much better among firms with low media coverage. The average Fama-French five-factor alpha spread of these anomalies is about 0.97\% per month among firms with low news coverage and only 0.24\% per month among firms with high news coverage. Moreover, most of the alpha spread comes from the short leg of the anomalies and from the firms that are more difficult to arbitrage. Overall, our evidence indicates that investor inattention at least partially drives many of the recently proposed factors. This paper was accepted by Haoxiang Zhu, finance. Funding: L.

  abstract     = {Using annual survey-based investor relations (IR) data for a panel of European companies, we document that the supply and effectiveness of IR varies with country- and firm-level demand. Relative to their industry peers, firms from insider-oriented countries have larger IR staff, which predicts better IR rankings. Better IR is associated with greater visibility, information assimilation, and valuation, with visibility and assimilation being significantly greater for firms from insider-oriented countries. Within such countries, firms with greater outsider orientation have higher capital market benefits. Furthermore, using Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II as a shock to analyst coverage, we find an incrementally larger association between IR and visibility in insider-oriented countries after 2017. Overall, the evidence suggests that the supply of IR in insider-oriented markets has reached a high level, acting as a viable mechanism to improve firms’ information environment. However, within those countries, IR demand still varies significantly, with outsider-oriented firms showing greater IR effectiveness. This paper was accepted by Brian Bushee, accounting.

  abstract     = {This study uses an information-asymmetry framework to examine the effect of initiation of credit default swaps (CDS) trading on firm dividend payout policy. We find evidence that CDS initiation is associated with increasing dividends, which is consistent with firms distributing excess free cash flow to mitigate exacerbated manager-equityholder agency conflicts resulting from reduced monitoring by banks following CDS initiation. Additional findings support this explanation by showing that the dividend increases are concentrated among borrowing firms with higher agency cost before CDS initiation, among firms whose lead arranger banks have a relatively less strong reputation in the loan-syndication market, and among firms whose loans are subject to less intense monitoring features—that is, less restrictive loan covenants—following CDS initiation. Additional analyses also suggest that inferences are robust to controlling for the potential effects of CDS initiation on capital structure. This paper was accepted by Brain Bushee, accounting.

  abstract     = {This paper examines how a manager uses voluntary disclosure to influence corporate control by a short-term shareholder. Because a short-term shareholder intervenes excessively, the manager’s disclosure strategy is determined by the trade-off between excessive and insufficient intervention. In equilibrium, when shareholder short-termism is not too high, the manager discloses both good and bad news and withholds intermediate news. Alternatively, when shareholder short-termism is high, the manager only discloses good news and withholds bad news. In both equilibria, withholding information is value-enhancing for the nondisclosing firms. We also show that the likelihood of disclosure weakly decreases as the shareholder is more short-term-oriented. Moreover, nondisclosing firms are more likely to face shareholder intervention than disclosing firms. This paper was accepted by Brian Bushee, accounting.
