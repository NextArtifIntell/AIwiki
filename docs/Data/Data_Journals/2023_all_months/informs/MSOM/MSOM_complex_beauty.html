  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by a platelet inventory management problem, we study a fixed lifetime perishable inventory management problem under a general demand process. Determining an optimal ordering policy for perishable inventory systems is particularly challenging because of the well-known “curse of dimensionality.” Approximation policies with worst-case performance bounds have been developed in the literature for perishable inventory systems. However, using real data, we observe that the existing policies tend to underorder when the unit shortage penalty is high, which is an important concern for critical perishable products, such as lifesaving blood products. We seek to address this problem in this paper. Methodology/results : We present a new approximation policy for perishable inventory systems, which we call a truncated balancing (TB) policy . In particular, we first define a new balancing ordering quantity and prove a novel lower bound on the optimal ordering quantity. We then define our TB policy such that the maximum between the balancing ordering quantity and the lower bound is ordered at each period. We prove that when first in, first out is an optimal issuing policy, (1) our proposed TB policy admits a worst-case performance bound of two, and (2) it is asymptotically optimal when the unit shortage penalty goes to infinity. Finally, we present a calibrated numerical study based on real data from our partner hospital and show that our proposed policy performs significantly better than the existing policies in practical scenarios with reasonably high shortage penalties. Managerial implications : Our analysis offers managerial insights for perishable inventory management, especially for systems with an imbalance in underage and overage cost parameters. When the unit shortage penalty is high, simply balancing the underage and overage costs can lead to underordering, whereas our proposed policy effectively addresses this drawback.

  abstract     = {Problem description : In many markets with demand uncertainties, competing retailers may share inventories for common products that they offer consumers. This paper examines how competitors’ product sharing affects their inventory and service-quality decisions. The existing literature has mainly focused on inventory sharing among independent retailers who do not compete with each other. Our research aims to fill the gap in this literature by investigating the tradeoffs of inventory sharing between retailers who directly compete for customers based on service quality. Methodology/results : We develop a game-theoretical model in which two retailers selling a common product from the same manufacturer compete for customers by offering differentiated services together with the product. Each retailer faces stochastic demand that increases in its service quality and decreases in the competitor’s service quality. When a retailer runs out of stock of the product, it may replenish its inventory directly from the manufacturer and/or request the competitor’s excess inventory if they have an inventory-sharing agreement. We find that inventory sharing may soften or intensify service competition, depending on the transfer price for the shared inventory. Specifically, when retailers agree to share inventory, their service levels decrease in the transfer price if their preseason inventory levels are exogenous, but are nonmonotone in the transfer price if the retailers endogenously choose inventory levels. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the retailers’ equilibrium inventory levels will increase in the transfer price and can be higher or lower than their levels in the case without inventory sharing. We also find that with exogenous inventory, the retailers prefer to share inventory at the highest nonmoot transfer price, whereas with endogenous inventory, the retailers may prefer not to share inventory, even at the optimal transfer price, when the level of competition and the preorder cost are high. Finally, we show that with service competition, inventory sharing cannot achieve full coordination under any transfer price. Managerial implications : When deciding whether to share inventory with competitors, managers should consider not only the benefits of inventory pooling, but also the strategic effect of sharing on the firms’ inventory choices and service levels.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Guided delegation, a practice in which companies provide guidelines when delegating supplier management to tier 1 firms, is a common practice in managing complex supply chains. We study the benefits and risks of this approach in a three-tier supply chain setting consisting of a buying firm, a tier 1 contract manufacturer, and tier 2 suppliers, where responsibility risk stems from the tier 2 suppliers. We analyze the buyer’s profit and the supply chain’s responsibility risk under a guided-delegation model, in which the buyer specifies an authorized tier 2 supplier for the tier 1 manufacturer as a guideline and may audit the tier 1 firm for compliance. We compare this model with a full-delegation model, in which the buyer fully delegates tier 2 supplier selection to the tier 1 firm. Methodology/results : We formulate a Stackelberg game for the buyer’s contract design problem. We show that guided delegation does not always yield its expected results of lower supply chain risk and greater buyer profit. In instances where compliance auditing is financially more attractive to the buyer than paying a premium for tier 1’s responsible sourcing, guided delegation can result in higher profit but increased risk because compliance auditing cannot completely eliminate the risk. Additionally, when tier 1 anticipates buyer audits and demands higher wholesale prices to offset potential penalties, guided delegation may lead to decreased risk but lower profit for the buyer. Our analysis shows that delegating audit responsibilities to tier 1 often does not improve the buyer’s profit, and in situations where it does, it invariably raises the supply chain risk. Managerial implications : Our research identifies the potential downsides of guided delegation, offering insight for external stakeholders on where to focus efforts to avoid these pitfalls. It suggests that the intended benefits of guided delegation can only be realized when paired with compliance auditing.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the problem of modeling purchase of multiple products and using it to display optimized recommendations for online retailers and e-commerce platforms. Rich modeling of users and fast computation of optimal products to display given these models can lead to significantly higher revenues and simultaneously enhance the user experience. Methodology/results : We present a parsimonious multi-purchase family of choice models called the BundleMVL-K family and develop a binary search based iterative strategy that efficiently computes optimized recommendations for this model. We establish the hardness of computing optimal recommendation sets and derive several structural properties of the optimal solution that aid in speeding up computation. This is one of the first attempts at operationalizing multi-purchase class of choice models. We show one of the first quantitative links between modeling multiple purchase behavior and revenue gains. The efficacy of our modeling and optimization techniques compared with competing solutions is shown using several real-world data sets on multiple metrics such as model fitness, expected revenue gains, and run-time reductions. For example, the expected revenue benefit of taking multiple purchases into account is observed to be ∼ 5 % in relative terms for the Ta Feng and UCI shopping data sets compared with the multinomial choice model for instances with ∼1,500 products. Additionally, across six real-world data sets, the test log-likelihood fits of our models are on average 17% better in relative terms. Managerial implications : Our work contributes to the study of multi-purchase decisions, analyzing consumer demand, and the retailers optimization problem. The simplicity of our models and the iterative nature of our optimization technique allows practitioners meet stringent computational constraints while increasing their revenues in practical recommendation applications at scale, especially in e-commerce platforms and other marketplaces.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Energy storage has become an indispensable part of power distribution systems, necessitating prudent investment decisions. We analyze an energy storage facility location problem and compare the benefits of centralized storage (adjacent to a central energy generation site) versus distributed storage (localized at demand sites). This problem encompasses optimizing storage capacities across all locations, with the objective of minimizing the total storage investment and energy generation costs. Methodology/results : We employ a stylized model that captures essential features of an energy distribution system, including convex costs, stochastic demand, storage efficiency, and line losses. Using dynamic programming, we optimize storage operations and derive value function properties that are key to analyzing the storage investment decisions. We discern fundamental differences between centralization/localization decisions at the capacity investment stage and the centralization/localization decisions at the storage operations level. Operationally, centrally stored energy offers more flexibility, which is consistent with the conventional understanding of inventory pooling. However, we find that localized storage often emerges as the preferred option at the investment stage under various circumstances. Managerial implications : Storage investment should first be made at the demand locations with positive minimum demand regardless of the level of demand variability. Subsequent storage investment should consider the tradeoffs between centralized versus localized investment. Operationally, the relative magnitudes of storage and line losses drive different optimal storage policies. Despite the differences, these policies are guided by common principles such as pooling inventory and balancing local storage levels.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In many resource scheduling problems for services with scheduled starting and completion times (e.g., airport gate assignment), a common approach is to maintain appropriate buffer between successive services assigned to a common resource. With a large buffer, the chances of a “crossing” (i.e., a flight arriving later than the succeeding one at the gate) will be significantly reduced. This approach is often preferred over more sophisticated stochastic mixed-integer programming methods that track the arrival of all the flights to infer the number of “conflicts” (i.e., a flight arriving at a time when the assigned gate becomes unavailable). We provide a theoretical explanation, from the perspective of robust optimization for the good performance of the buffering approach in minimizing not only the number of crossings but also the number of conflicts in the operations. Methodology/results : We show that the buffering method inherently minimizes the worst-case number of “conflicts” under both robust and distributionally robust optimization models using down-monotone uncertainty sets. Interestingly, under down-monotone properties, the worst-case number of crossings is identical to the worst-case number of conflicts. Using this equivalence, we demonstrate how feature information from flight and historical delay information can be used to enhance the effectiveness of the buffering method. Managerial implications : The paper provides the first theoretical justification on the use of buffering method to control for the number of conflicts in resource assignment problem.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Firms seek to use the contest format to source solutions from a broader network of outside solvers. We study the application of the contest approach in multistage settings and show how and when screening of contestants between stages can produce improved contest outcomes. Methodology/results: We present an application-driven game-theoretic model to capture imperfections in screening using the true-positive rate (sensitivity) and the true-negative rate (specificity). Specifically, we consider a two-stage contest with a screening decision by the firm between the stages. Solvers face uncertainty about their probability of fit, and the final quality of the solution is dependent on the performance across both stages. We identify two mechanisms through which screening induces greater effort, namely the encouragement effect and the competitive contest effect, and characterize how screening should be tuned to the problem setting. We find that filtering out true negatives in contests with exogenous solvers’ probability of fit is optimal for solution-seeking firms. Our results indicate that in case of problems with endogenous probability of fit and less up-front complexity, coarse (imperfect) screening is beneficial in order to manage competition and stimulate greater effort, but it behooves the firm to resort to more accurate screening otherwise. We also derive nuanced results for the case when a seeker faces screening constraints and must balance screening sensitivity and specificity. Managerial implications: Our work provides firms an additional degree of freedom in terms of specific and sensitive screening to design and run contests and to better engage outside solvers. We derive actionable results and translate them into a managerial framework to help fine-tune the screening mechanism for improved contest performance.

An efficient algorithm for this scheduling problem is well known. We consider the corresponding cooperative game, where the manufacturers are players that want to join forces. We show that collaboration is profitable. Yet, the stability of the cooperation depends on the cost allocation scheme; we focus on the core of the game. Methodology/results : We prove that the PMS game is totally balanced and its core is infinitely large, by developing a sophisticated methodology of linear complexity that finds a line segment in its symmetric core. We call this segment the basic core of the game. Managerial implications : This PMS game has the potential for various applications both in traditional industry and in distributed computing systems in the hi-tech industry. The formation of a partnership among entrepreneurs, companies, or manufacturers necessitates not only a plan for joining forces toward the achievement of the ultimate goals, but also an acceptable agreement regarding the cost allocation among the partners. Core allocations guarantee the stability of the partnership as no subset of players can gain by defecting from the grand coalition.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : With the rapid growth of the gig economy, on-demand staffing platforms have emerged to help companies manage their temporary workforce. This emerging business-to-business context motivates us to study a new form of supply chain coordination problem. We consider a staffing platform managing an on-demand workforce to serve multiple firms facing stochastic labor demand. Before demand realization, each individual firm can hire permanent employees, whereas the platform determines a compensation rate for potential on-demand workers. After knowing the realized demand, firms in need can request on-demand workers from the platform, and then, the platform operator allocates the available on-demand workforce among the firms. We explore how to maximize and distribute the benefits of an on-demand workforce through coordinating self-interested parties in the staffing system. Methodology/results : We combine game theory and online optimization techniques to address the challenges in incentivizing and coordinating the online workforce. We propose a novel and easily implementable fill rate-based allocation and coordination mechanism that enables the on-demand workforce to be shared optimally when individual firms and the platform operator make decisions in their own interest. We also show that the proposed mechanism can be adapted to the cases when contract terms need to be identical to all firms and when actual demand is unverifiable. Managerial implications : The proposed contract mechanism is in line with the performance-based contracting commonly used in on-demand staffing services. Our results suggest that under an appropriately designed performance-based mechanism, individual firms and the platform operator can share the maximum benefits of on-demand staffing.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Customer reviews are essential to online marketplaces. However, reviews typically vary; ratings of a product or service are rarely the same. In many service marketplaces, including the ones for solar panel installations, supply-side participants are active. That is, a seller must make a proposal to serve each customer. In such marketplaces, it is not clear how (or if) the dispersion in customer reviews affects the seller activity level and number of matches in the marketplace. Our paper examines this by considering both ratings and text reviews. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that empirically studies how the review dispersion affects a seller’s activity level and the number of matches in an online marketplace with active sellers. Distinct from literature, we examine the relationship between the review dispersion and supply-side activities in an online service marketplace. Methodology/results : We collaborated with one of the largest online solar marketplaces in the United States that connects potential solar panel adopters with installers. We obtained a unique data set from the marketplace for 2013 − 2018. We complement this with public data sets. Our analysis uses traditional econometrics methods, a clustering method, and the deep-learning-based natural-language-processing model BERT developed by Google AI. We find that the dispersion in customer reviews has a significant and inverted U-shaped relationship with an installer’s marketplace activity level. Intuitively, a marketplace operator would favor having more sellers with perfect ratings. In contrast, we identify a significant and inverted U-shaped relationship between the market-level review dispersion and transactions. Managerial implications : Our paper provides key insights to marketplace operators and sellers. We find that in contrast to general belief, an operator can improve its market transactions by keeping/promoting sellers with low ratings or avoiding (negative) review filtering. Furthermore, sellers’ implementation of “rating gating” to avoid negative reviews may backfire for them by reducing their matches.

We consider the environmental implications of this choice, distinguishing between responsiveness achieved via three pathways: responsive offshore supply chains increase speed by using expedited production and distribution methods; responsive nearshore supply chains increase speed by reducing the physical distance between source and destination for all production; and hybrid nearshore supply chains produce in multiple locations simultaneously, increasing speed by reducing distance on some portion of production. Methodology/results : Using a model wherein responsiveness increases fixed and marginal costs, decreases leadtimes, and changes the per-unit environmental impact of production and distribution, we identify several results. First, all types of responsiveness can decrease environmental impact relative to an efficient supply chain, showing any form of responsiveness has potential to improve sustainability. Second, despite this, all types of responsiveness can also increase environmental impact relative to an efficient supply chain, particularly if demand variability is high. This is precisely when responsiveness is most profitable to the firm, indicating a tension between firm and environmental preferences. Third, a win-win outcome in which responsiveness both maximizes firm profit and minimizes environmental impact is most likely to occur when demand variability is high and unsatisfied customers substitute with a product that generates high environmental impact. Fourth, the firm may have incentive to choose a supply chain that does not minimize (and may maximize) environmental impact, especially at low-to-moderate demand variability. Managerial implications : While responsive supply chains can improve sustainability, they also generate the potential for misalignment of profit and environmental performance. We discuss the implications of this for firms and for policymakers seeking to encourage firms to use supply chains that generate the least environmental impact.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Strategic inventory refers to the inventory held by firms purely out of strategic considerations other than operational reasons (e.g., economies of scale). In this paper, we investigate the roles of strategic inventory in a system with two parallel supply chains under both full bargaining and partial bargaining, which differ in whether inventory is included in the bargaining terms. Methodology/results : (i) Under full bargaining , horizontal competition can induce an asymmetric equilibrium, whereby only one of the chains carries strategic inventory and benefits from it when the holding cost is small. The whole system, however, is worse off. (ii) Under partial bargaining , regardless of whether there is horizontal competition, the retailer in a supply chain always carries inventory when his bargaining power is small and the inventory holding cost is low. Furthermore, with horizontal competition, inventory hurts (improves) the system performance when the inventory holding cost is small (above a threshold and not too big). (iii) Full bargaining can be inferior to partial bargaining when there is horizontal competition. Managerial implications : The conventional wisdom about strategic inventory should be taken with caution. Specifically, the traditional role of strategic inventory empowering the retailer in a supply chain is completely dominated by the full bargaining framework, yet it is still present if inventory is not bargained. The inventory driven by horizontal competition plays a different strategic role of signaling to the competitor to avoid an otherwise adverse quantity competition if both retailers carried high inventory. Furthermore, despite the full cooperation nature of the full bargaining framework, it is not always in the retailer’s interest to give up the decision power on inventory (partial bargaining) and include it in the negotiation process (full bargaining).

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Inventory commitment and monetary compensation are widely recognized as effective strategies in monopoly settings when customers are concerned about stockouts. To attract more customer traffic, a firm reveals its inventory availability information to customers before the sales season or offers monetary compensation to placate customers if the product is out of stock. This paper investigates these two strategies when retailers compete on both price and inventory availability. Methodology/results : We develop a game-theoretic framework to analyze the strategic interactions among the retailers and customers and draw the following insights. First, both inventory commitment and monetary compensation may lead to a prisoner’s dilemma. Although these strategies are preferred regardless of the competitor’s price and inventory decisions, the equilibrium profit of each retailer could be lower in the presence of inventory commitment or monetary compensation because they intensify the competition between the retailers. Second, we find that market competition may hurt social welfare compared with a centralized setting by reducing the product availability in equilibrium. The inventory commitment and monetary compensation strategies further intensify the competition between the retailers, therefore causing an even lower social welfare. Managerial implications : Our study shows that, although inventory commitment and monetary compensation improve retailers’ profit and social welfare under monopoly, these strategies should be used with caution under competition.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Education technology innovations, such as massive open online course (MOOC) platforms, could potentially enable a more inclusive learning environment by delivering education to traditionally disadvantaged learners, like women. However, inclusivity does not necessarily translate into equal treatment on the platform. We investigate whether female and male learners benefit equally from forum discussions—typically the only form of interaction available—in online learning platforms. Methodology/results : Utilizing a large-scale, interaction-level data set on 174 courses on Coursera, we uncover an economically sizable and statistically significant disparity between male and female learners in receiving responses to their posts in MOOC discussion forums. On average, female learners’ questions are 3.11 percentage points less likely to receive responses from teaching staff than male learners’ questions, which equals 15.2% of the female group average. We also find significant gender disparity in staff response quality and sentiments. We investigate possible mechanisms behind the gender disparity using new techniques, including textual analysis tools. We show that the disparity is not because of content differences in male and female learners’ posts, nor is it attributable to their linguistic styles or the reputation of the posters. Instead, our results are most consistent with a male-driven gender homophily mechanism; although female staff members are gender neutral in their interactions with learners, male staff members systemically prefer responding to posts from male learners. We additionally show that receiving staff response leads to significant improvement in course passing rates, particularly for female learners. Therefore, the unequal access to information through course forums unfavorably hinders female learners’ performance. Managerial implications : Our results provide operational and organizational suggestions to platforms and content providers, including degendering user identifiers, implementing a content-focused post recommendation system, incorporating a gender-neutral user reputation system, promoting the recruiting of female teaching staff, and providing staff training that highlights the importance of gender-neutral interactions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Modern technologies have made it viable for firms to lower the costs of switching on and off production in response to market changes. In this paper, we explore how production start–stop flexibility impacts joint operating policies, financing, and investment timing decisions. Methodology/results : We develop a continuous-time, optimal stopping model in which equity holders of the firm make operational decisions regarding pausing and restarting production as well as when to default. The degree of production flexibility is measured by switching costs. On the one hand, production flexibility influences the trade-off between tax shields and default costs for the capital structure decision; on the other hand, debt levels impact the equity holders’ incentive to use flexibility by pausing and restarting operations. We find that optimal debt usage is not monotone in production flexibility. Specifically, when switching costs are in a low region, the optimal debt level decreases slowly as switching costs increase. As switching costs increase into an intermediate region, the optimal debt level decreases sharply because the firm needs to reduce its debt to ensure the equity holders maintain flexible operating policies. However, when switching costs exceed a threshold, the cost of compromising the use of debt becomes excessive, and the firm substantially increases its debt to gain the full benefit of the tax shield; in so doing, the equity holders forgo flexibility and maintain production continuously until default. This financing strategy affects the firm’s investment timing decision, which also exhibits a nonmonotone pattern. Managerial implications : When a firm optimizes the debt usage and investment timing, the incentive of utilizing flexibility embedded in the production technology by the equity holders needs to be taken into account. Our findings also reveal new benefits and guidance for the potential design of incentive contracts to mitigate agency costs. Funding: Q.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Social media has become an indispensable platform for disseminating quality information to consumers across various service sectors. Recently, it has extended its influence to healthcare services, which traditionally relied on government report cards to disclose standardized quality information to the public. This article explores the impact of social media on consumer demand for healthcare services and compares its effectiveness with government report cards. Methodology/results : We analyze quality ratings of U.S. nursing homes collected from two information channels: (1) consumer ratings on Yelp and (2) government ratings on Nursing Home Compare, both of which adopt a five-star quality rating scale and are accessible on the Internet. We employ the method of difference-in-differences with continuous treatment intensity and instrumental variables to analyze the data. Using nursing home resident admissions as a proxy for consumer demand, we find that higher Yelp ratings led to higher consumer demand, particularly among Medicare-covered consumers. Furthermore, the effect of Yelp ratings was primarily driven by extreme ratings (one-star or five-star), as opposed to neutral ratings. We also find that Yelp ratings exerted a stronger effect on consumer demand than government ratings. This dominance of Yelp ratings over government ratings was observed primarily in markets with high Yelp penetration or markets with low and medium consumer education levels. Although higher Yelp ratings were associated with increased net incomes, we find little evidence that nursing homes made quality improvement in response to their Yelp ratings. Managerial implications : We recommend that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recognize social media platforms as valuable sources of information and collaborate with reputable platforms, such as Yelp, to promote public awareness of government report cards like Nursing Home Compare. Moreover, we advise nursing home operators to proactively manage their reputation on social media by promptly addressing consumer complaints and implementing quality improvement measures. Funding: Y.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Smart contract improves the supply chain efficiency by enabling the supplier’s commitment to postshipment financing decisions, which mitigates the bank’s lending risk exposure and thereby reduces the financing cost. This paper investigates how smart contract adoption could facilitate trade finance activities and create value for supply chain firms. Academic/practical relevance : As the emerging blockchain technology could potentially reshape the trade financing landscape, understanding the impact of smart contract adoption and its interaction with trade finance activities is practically relevant and of great importance. Methodology : We develop a two-stage game-theoretic model and adopt supply chain finance theory to characterize the strategic interactions between supply chain firms in the presence of both operational risk (demand uncertainty) and financial risks (credit and liquidity risks). Results : We find that the value of smart contract depends critically on the trade finance structures, including both preshipment and postshipment financing schemes. Under the baseline trade finance model (with purchase order financing as preshipment financing and factoring as postshipment financing), smart contract alleviates the supplier’s overpricing behavior caused by commitment frictions and helps restore the supply chain efficiency. When buyer direct financing serves as an alternative preshipment financing, smart contract might discourage the retailer from offering buyer direct financing, which significantly hurts the supplier and thus reduces the supply chain profit. When invoice trading serves as the alternative postshipment financing, the supplier always chooses invoice trading over factoring because of its trading flexibility, which in turn, makes the commitment frictions ubiquitous and unresolvable (namely, commitment trap ). As a result, invoice trading could unexpectedly lead to a lower supplier’s profit. Luckily, such an adoption dilemma can be resolved by smart contract adoption in conjunction with factoring. Managerial implications : Our findings provide guidelines for and insights into when smart contract should be adopted and its interactions with different trade finance schemes. In particular, smart contract adoption does not always benefit the supply chain.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The paper focuses on an innovative bank-intermediated trade finance contract, which we call dynamic trade finance (DTF, under which banks dynamically adjust loan interest rates as an order passes through different steps in the trade process). We examine the value of DTF, the impact of process uncertainties, and the associated information frictions on this value and the strategic interaction between DTF and FinTech. Academic/practical relevance : As more than 30% of global trade involves bank-intermediated trade finance, examining contract innovation in trade finance (DTF) and its strategic interaction with FinTech is of practical importance. Also, analyzing trade finance in the presence of process dynamics and information frictions complements the existing academic literature. Methodology : We construct a parsimonious model of a supply chain process consisting of two steps. The duration of each step is uncertain, and the process may fail at either step. Information delay may also occur when verifying the process passing a step. The seller borrows from a bank to finance this two-step process either through uniform financing (the interest rate remains constant throughout the process) or DTF (the interest rates are adjusted according to a precommitted schedule as the process passes each step). When lending, the bank faces a regulatory capital requirement (the bank is required to hold capital reserve when issuing risky loans) or information asymmetry (the seller/borrower possesses more accurate information about the trade process than the bank). Results : The value of DTF lies in its ability to reduce transactional deadweight loss (under the regulatory capital requirement) and screening (separate high-quality borrowers from the low-quality ones under information asymmetry). This value is greater for more reliable or lengthier trade processes, yet DTF’s ability to screen is stronger when the process is less reliable. The severity of information delay hurts the value of DTF convexly. FinTech that expedites information transmission and verification and enables automatic execution complements DTF, and those that segment customers more efficiently could substitute DTF. Managerial implications : Our results shed light on how the underlying trade process dynamics and the type of information frictions involved affect the optimal deployment of contract innovations (DTF) and FinTech in trade finance.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: For many supply chains, deep-tier suppliers, due to their small size and lack of access to capital, are most vulnerable to disruptions. We study the use of advance payment (AP) as a financing instrument in a multitier supply chain to mitigate the supply disruption risk in a traditional system (with limited visibility) and a blockchain-enabled system (with perfect visibility). The main goal of this paper is to shed light on how blockchain adoption impacts agents’ operational and financial decisions as well as profit levels in a multitier supply chain. Academic/practical relevance: Traditionally, because of the limited visibility in the deep tiers, powerful downstream manufacturers’ financing schemes offered to their immediate upstream suppliers are not effective in instilling capital into the deep tiers. Advancements in blockchain technology improve the supply chain visibility and enable the manufacturer to better devise deep-tier financing to improve supply chain resilience. Methodology: We develop a three-tier supply chain model and take a game-theoretic approach to compare how blockchain-enabled deep-tier financing schemes affect a financially constrained supply chain’s optimal risk-mitigation and financial strategies. Results: We find that although improved visibility via blockchain adoption can help the manufacturer make informed supply chain financing decisions, whether it can benefit all supply chain members depends on the financing schemes in use. Blockchain-enabled delegate financing increases risk-mitigation investments and benefits all three tiers of the supply chain only when the tier 2 supplier is severely capital-constrained with the working capital below a threshold. Because delegate financing endows the intermediary tier 1 supplier with leverage over the manufacturer, the inefficiency inhibits an all-win outcome when the tier 2 supplier is not severely capital-constrained. Blockchain-enabled cross-tier direct financing exhibits a compelling performance as it always leads to win-win-win outcomes (and is thus ubiquitously implementable) regardless of the suppliers’ working capital profile. Managerial implications: Our insights help firms assess opportunities and challenges associated with enhancing supply chain visibility via blockchain adoption.

Academic/practical relevance : Extant research on mobile payment has ignored the role of governments as important stakeholders in the mobile financial ecosystem. Our research contributes to the literature by examining the role of governments as business partners in MPS launches and the effect of government involvement on MNO user bases. Methodology : Using a unique proprietary data set from the mobile network industry, we design a quasi-experiment to examine the causal effects of government involvement in MPS on MNOs’ total mobile connections. More importantly, we adopt a changes-in-changes (CIC) estimation approach to further establish nonlinear treatment effects of government involvement based on MNO size and MPS type. Results : We find that government involvement expands MNO user bases beyond MPS launches. Such effects increase with MNO size and MPS variety, favoring larger MNOs and, to a certain degree, MNOs with diverse offerings of government-involved MPS. Government involvement in MPS launches also directly benefits MNOs with microloan services. In addition, government regulations and policies to encourage financial inclusion can also expand MNO user bases. Managerial implications : Governments play a critical role in promoting technologies and financial services both as a regulator and as a business partner. To improve market performance, MNOs should take advantage of the scale and scope of government services by partnering with government agencies in launching MPS. MNOs should also embrace government policies and regulations to increase user bases.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In a Markovian queueing system with strategic customers, a reward is gained from completing service, and a loss is incurred while waiting to be served. The common assumption in the queueing literature is that such loss is a function of the customer’s waiting time. This paper takes a different and novel approach in that it models the customer’s loss incurred because of negative network effects while waiting with others, which increases as the exposure to others increases. Methodology : Waiting time is complemented by two innovative measures that capture negative effects on a tagged customer joining an M/M/ c queue: the total number of customers the tagged customer meets and person-time exposure to these customers while waiting to be served. Threshold joining strategies inducing M/M/ c / n –type queues are studied in this context. Results : The distributions of exposure size and exposure time of a customer joining the queue at a given position are analytically derived. Equilibria under conditions of no reneging are identified as threshold strategies. If the customer’s loss function is concave (such as an exponential model for the chance of infection during a pandemic), there is an equilibrium threshold strategy under which customers do not renege from the queue, even if reneging is allowed. The price of anarchy caused by lack of coordination among the individuals acting is identified. Unlike the equilibrium threshold built under the restrictive assumption that all potential customers have the same utility function, a novel safe threshold concept is introduced, a queue size at which a customer who joins the facility and stays until completing service has positive expected utility regardless of the actions of the other customers. Managerial implications : The implications of negative network effects caused by congestion in a queueing system are of interest to queue managers and, in particular, affect the optimal size of the waiting area. Safe and equilibrium thresholds are contrasted with the socially optimal threshold set by a regulator, and the safe threshold is suggested as a managerial tool to design the waiting room size.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : With the rise of renewables and the decline of fossil fuels, electricity markets are shifting toward a capacity mix in which low-cost generators (LCGs) are dominant. Within this transition, policymakers have been considering whether current market designs are still fundamentally fit for purpose. This research analyses a key aspect: the design of real-time imbalance pricing mechanisms. Currently, markets mostly use either single pricing or dual pricing as their imbalance pricing mechanisms. Single-pricing mechanisms apply identical prices for buying and selling, whereas dual-pricing mechanisms use different prices. The recent harmonization initiative in Europe sets single pricing as the default and dual pricing as the exception. This leaves open the question of when dual pricing is advantageous. We compare the economic efficiency of two dual-pricing mechanisms in current practice with that of a single-pricing design and identify conditions under which dual pricing can be beneficial. We also prove the existence of an optimal pricing mechanism. Methodology/results : We first analytically compare the economic efficiency of single-pricing and dual-pricing mechanisms. Furthermore, we formulate an optimal pricing mechanism that can deter the potential exercise of market power by LCGs. Our analytical results characterize the conditions under which a dual pricing is advantageous over a single pricing. We further compare the economic efficiency of these mechanisms with respect to our proposed optimal mechanism through simulations. We show that the proposed pricing mechanism would be the most efficient in comparison with others and discuss its practicability. Managerial implications : Our analytical comparison reveals market conditions under which each pricing mechanism is a better fit and whether there is a need for a redesign. In particular, our results suggest that existing pricing mechanisms are adequate at low/moderate market shares of LCGs but not for the high levels currently envisaged by policymakers in the transition to decarbonization, where the optimal pricing mechanism will become more attractive.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The effect of the minimum wage is an important yet controversial topic that has received attention for decades. Our study is the first to take an operational lens and empirically study the impact of the minimum wage on firms’ scheduling practices. Methodology/results : Using a highly granular data set from a chain of fashion retail stores, we estimate that a $1 increase in the minimum wage, although having a negligible impact on the total labor hours used by the stores, leads to a 27.7% increase in the number of workers scheduled per week, but a 19.4% reduction in weekly hours per worker. For an average store in California, these changes translate into four extra workers and five fewer hours per worker per week. Such scheduling adjustment not only reduces the total wage compensation per worker but also reduces workers’ eligibility for benefits. We also show that the minimum wage increase reduces the consistency of weekly and daily schedules for workers. For example, the absolute (relative) deviation in weekly hours worked by each worker increases by up to 32.9% (6.6%) and by up to 9.7% (2.1%) in daily hours, as the minimum wage increases by $1. Managerial implications : Our study empirically identifies and highlights a new operational mechanism through which increasing the minimum wage may negatively impact worker welfare. Our further analysis suggests that the combination of the reduced hours, lower eligibility for benefits, and less consistent schedules (that resulted from the minimum wage increase) may substantially hurt worker welfare, even when the overall employment at the stores stay unchanged. By better understanding the intrinsic tradeoff of firms’ scheduling decisions, policy makers can better design minimum wage policies that will truly benefit workers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Suppliers are increasingly involved in innovation activities that contribute to a firm’s product quality and introduce risks to firms’ quality control, leading to quality failures and recalls. This quality trade-off suggests the possibility of a nonlinear relationship between supplier innovation and product recalls, which is the focus of this research. Recall literature focuses on firms’ internal drivers of recalls, whereas anecdotal evidence increasingly points to the role of external drivers, such as suppliers. We contribute to the literature by examining supplier innovation as an external driver leading to recalls via quality and risk spillovers. Methodology/results : We collect and assemble a unique panel data set of consumer product recalls from firms and their supply bases (i.e., first tier suppliers). We estimate econometric models to examine the nonlinear relationship between supply base innovation, measured by research and development (R&amp;D) intensity of the supply bases, and the likelihood of product recalls. We find a quadratic (i.e., U-shaped) relationship between the probability of recalls and supply base R&amp;D intensity. We also find that this nonlinear relationship is critically related to three specific sources of risk: radicalness of supplier innovation, technological distance between firms and their suppliers, and complexity of supply base. Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that firms should be mindful of the quality trade-offs in encouraging supplier innovation to reduce product recalls. Further, to minimize recall risks, firms should better evaluate and manage the risks associated with external supplier knowledge that is novel and different and closely work with global suppliers to reduce coordination challenges in knowledge transfer and integration.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Firms often delay the decision to recall faulty medical devices long after they become aware of a defect, thereby putting public safety at heightened risk. However, the factors contributing to these delays are not well-understood. To help address this gap, we examine whether and how CEO stock ownership influences the speed with which faulty medical devices are recalled and whether this influence varies with recall severity. We then examine whether the stock market penalizes firms differently based on recall decision-making speed and whether this penalty also varies with recall severity. Methodology/results : We collect data on 2,144 medical device recalls across 50 public medical device firms from 2002 to 2015. We use accelerated failure time models to test the effects of CEO stock ownership on the time-to-recall and event study methodology to examine how the time-to-recall influences stock market returns. Supplementary analyses shed further light on underlying mechanisms. Robustness checks demonstrate consistent results, including coarsened exact matching, reverse causality tests, Cox proportional hazard models, generalized linear regression models, and a mediation analysis. Firms whose CEOs possess greater ownership stakes recall medical devices more slowly, and this recall-slowing effect is accentuated for high-severity recalls. Delaying recalls magnifies the stock market penalty attributable to the recall, particularly for high-severity recalls. Managerial implications : Our study highlights an ownership characteristic of firms that are more likely to delay recalling faulty medical devices. Boards of directors can use insights from our study as they oversee product-quality decisions and determine the level and form of CEO compensation, and the FDA can use our findings to identify firms that might warrant extra scrutiny and better allocate its limited monitoring resources.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Motivated by ride-hailing platforms such as Uber, Lyft and Didi, we study the problem of matching riders with self-interested drivers over a spatial network. We focus on the performance impact of two operational platform controls—demand-side admission control and supply-side repositioning control—considering the interplay with two practically important challenges: (i) spatial demand imbalances prevail for extended periods of time; and (ii) self-interested drivers strategically decide whether to join the network, and, if so, whether to reposition when not serving riders. Methodology/results: We develop and analyze the steady-state behavior of a novel game-theoretic fluid model of a two-location, four-route loss network. First, we fully characterize and compare the steady-state system equilibria under three control regimes, from minimal control to centralized control. Second, we provide insights on how and why platform control impacts equilibrium performance, notably with new findings on the role of admission control: the platform may find it optimal to strategically reject demand at the low-demand location even if drivers are in excess supply, to induce repositioning to the high-demand location. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for this policy. Third, we derive upper bounds on the platform’s and drivers’ benefits caused by increased platform control; these are more significant under moderate capacity and significant cross-location demand imbalance. Managerial implications: Our results contribute important guidelines on the optimal operations of ride-hailing networks. Our model can also inform the design of driver compensation structures that support more centralized network control.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : U.S. nonprofits declare three types of expenses in their IRS 990 forms: program spending to meet beneficiaries’ needs; fundraising spending to raise donations; and administration spending to build and maintain capacity. Charity watchdogs, however, expect nonprofits to prioritize program spending over other categories. We study when such expectations may lead to the “starvation cycle” or underspending on administration and fundraising. Methodology/results : We characterize optimal budget allocations to program, fundraising, and administration spending categories using a two-period model, which also includes the nonprofit’s capacity, return on program spending (the net value of program spending to beneficiaries), and beneficiaries’ uncertain future needs. We find that the nonprofit’s capacity plays a significant role in the optimal allocation. The nonprofit should (a) at high capacity, spend only the necessary amount on administration to maintain its current capacity; (b) at moderate capacity, maintain its current capacity while limiting program spending in favor of fundraising; and (c) at low capacity, increase administration spending to expand its future capacity. When we compare the optimal allocations prescribed by our model to the actual spending levels reported by a foodbank network, we find that the foodbank underspends on administration and fundraising, suggesting the forces that lead to the starvation cycle may be in play. Another possibility is that the nonprofit’s own estimate of its return on program spending is higher than our estimate—At higher estimates of return on program, the gap between our prescribed solutions versus actual spending levels decreases. Managerial implications : Our paper introduces an important discussion on nonprofits’ starvation cycle and finds conditions that justify prioritizing administration and fundraising expenses. It also highlights that watchdogs should consider nonprofits’ return on program spending in addition to their capacity and future needs when evaluating them. Funding: T. O.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Qualcomm, the largest cellphone chipmaker in the world, had adopted a cross-licensing agreement with its clients, downstream cellphone manufacturers. It requires cellphone manufacturers to allow each other to use their patents for free. This cross-licensing practice has received considerable scrutiny and attention around the world. We study the impacts of cross-licensing in a supply chain in which an upstream supplier requires its downstream competing manufacturers to cross-license, where they are asymmetric in their innovation capabilities. Methodology/results : We build a stylized model of a supply chain consisting of one supplier and two competing manufacturers and conduct game-theoretic analysis. We find that the supplier always prefers adopting cross-licensing ex post after manufacturers’ investments are sunk, but it may prefer committing to no cross-licensing ex ante. Specifically, the supplier should commit to not using cross-licensing if the inferior manufacturer’s cost of innovation is high or the effectiveness of cross-licensing is high. Furthermore, cross-licensing may increase innovation, the superior manufacturer’s profit, and social welfare under certain conditions. Interestingly, when the superior manufacturer’s cost advantage is intermediate, the inferior manufacturer’s innovation level first increases and then decreases in the effectiveness of cross-licensing. In addition, the inferior manufacturer’s profit also first increases and then decreases as the effectiveness level of cross-licensing increases. The cross-licensing policy benefits consumers when its effectiveness level is low and the superior manufacturer’s innovation cost is either high or low. Managerial implications : Our results provide guidance on when a supplier should adopt the cross-licensing strategy. For policy makers, our findings show that cross-licensing can be beneficial for consumers and the society. In particular, to increase social welfare, policy makers may consider encouraging cross-licensing with low effectiveness level when the superior manufacturer’s innovation cost is either low or high.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study an optimal contract design problem for a national brand (NB) manufacturer, which sells her product via a retailer. The retailer may introduce his store brand (SB) with private cost information. The manufacturer estimates that the retailer’s SB cost may be high or low with certain probabilities and offers a menu of two-part tariff contracts to screen the retailer’s cost information. Methodology/results : Following the mechanism design theory, we formulate the problem as a two-stage screening game to analyze the strategic interaction between the two players under asymmetric information. Despite the complexity resulting from type-dependent reservation profit of the retailer, we derive the NB manufacturer’s optimal contracts analytically. We prove that there exists a unique threshold such that when the NB cost is below the threshold, the manufacturer offers both types of retailers incentive-compatible contracts; when the NB cost is above the threshold, the manufacturer offers a menu of contracts to shut down the low-type retailer and engage the high-type retailer only. Managerial implications : We find that when the NB product becomes more competitive (i.e., a higher quality or a lower cost), both the NB manufacturer and the retailer are better off. This result implies that under asymmetric information, the retailer has incentive to enhance the NB product quality or reduce its cost. Additionally, the private information is valuable to both members only when a contract without shutdown is offered. Moreover, such information is more valuable to both players when the NB product becomes more competitive. However, when SB quality improves or when SB cost decreases, the value of information may increase or decrease to both supply chain members. Finally, we derive a surprising result that under asymmetric information, the expected consumer surplus may increase because of a lower SB quality or a higher low-type SB cost. Funding: G.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Prior studies have identified the role of downstream retailers’ strategic inventory in mitigating double marginalization within decentralized supply chains. Our work adds to this literature by introducing two relevant features that naturally appear in a dynamic environment: network externality and copycatting . We demonstrate how strategic inventory and network externality can be used to manage competition from within and outside the supply chain. Methodology/results : We develop a game-theoretical model to capture the strategic interaction within a brand-name supply chain, which enjoys positive externalities from early-period sales but faces competition from copycats in later periods. We show that copycats, on the one hand, deter the retailer’s strategic inventory by exerting external competition and on the other hand, can amplify the benefit of the retailer’s strategic inventory in allaying internal double marginalization and enhancing the supply chain’s external competitiveness. We further show that network externality, on the one hand, brings immediate gains to the supply chain’s external battle with copycats and on the other hand, creates internal inefficiency in the form of cross-period double marginalization best exhibited under the supplier’s dynamic contract. When network externality and strategic inventory are optimized jointly, we find that they are always complementary in increasing the supplier’s payoff but can be substitutive to the retailer under a large inventory cost and weak network externality. Managerial implications : Our work provides firms ways of managing decentralized supply chains in the face of copycats. We propose strategic inventory and network externality to combat copycats and provide normative guidance on their operating mechanisms. Funding: C.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Dual sourcing and contingent sourcing are important risk-mitigation strategies to manage supply chain risks, including transportation-related losses of inbound orders. Contingent sourcing as a means of managing transportation risk is made possible by shipment information realized at in-transit inspection points or through shipment monitoring technologies. We examine the impact of contingent sourcing and shipment information in a setting where a buyer can source from two competing suppliers. One supplier (unreliable) has a long transportation lead time and is prone to in-transit yield loss; the other supplier (reliable) has a short, but nonzero, lead time with no yield loss. Methodology/results : We analyze a multistage game-theoretical model in which the two suppliers compete on wholesale prices and then, the buyer determines initial order quantities. Later, the buyer can place an emergency order with the reliable supplier based on shipment information, which reveals (possibly imperfectly) the status of the in-transit order from the unreliable supplier. We show that the buyer will adopt one of four possible sourcing strategies: (1) initially source only from the unreliable supplier but resort to the reliable supplier contingent on the updated shipment information, (2) diversify its initial order across the two suppliers but resort to the reliable supplier if needed, (3) diversify its initial order and not engage in contingent sourcing, or (4) sole source from the reliable supplier. Interestingly, contingent sourcing may or may not benefit the buyer because it may soften the competition between suppliers. Moreover, the buyer’s profit may not be monotonic in the accuracy of shipment information. Managerial implications : The buyer must design its supply base so that the unreliable supplier is particularly cost efficient if the buyer is to benefit from the possibility of contingent sourcing. The buyer may not always benefit from operational improvements that enhance shipment information accuracy because they may soften supplier competition.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Nonstationarity of the random environment is a critical yet challenging concern in decision-making under uncertainty. We illustrate the challenge from the nonstationarity and the solution framework using the portfolio selection problem, a typical decision problem in a time-varying financial market. Methodology/Results : This paper models the nonstationarity by a regime-switching ambiguity set. In particular, we incorporate the time-varying feature of the stochastic environment into the traditional Wasserstein ambiguity set to build our regime-switching ambiguity set. This modeling framework has strong financial interpretations because the financial market is exposed to different economic cycles. We show that the proposed distributional optimization framework is computationally tractable. We further provide a general data-driven portfolio allocation framework based on a covariate-based estimation and a hidden Markov model. We prove that the approach can include the underlying distribution with a high probability when the sample size is larger than a quantitative bound, from which we further analyze the quality of the obtained portfolio. Extensive empirical studies are conducted to show that the proposed portfolio consistently outperforms the equally weighted portfolio (the 1/ N strategy) and other benchmarks across both time and data sets. In particular, we show that the proposed portfolio exhibited a prompt response to the regime change in the 2008 financial crisis by reallocating the wealth into appropriate asset classes on account of the time-varying feature of our proposed model. Managerial implications : The proposed framework helps decision-makers hedge against time-varying uncertainties. Specifically, applying the proposed framework to portfolio selection problems helps investors respond promptly to the regime change in financial markets and adjust their portfolio allocation accordingly.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In an environment where consumers’ rising valuation of Instagrammable memories drives their spending from products to experiences, retailers offer experiences to attract consumers back to their stores. Yet, it is not obvious under which settings consumers can benefit from these experiences and raise retailers’ profits. Methodology/results : We use a random utility model for consumer choice in both monopoly and duopoly settings. For the latter, we pose a game-theoretic model to analyze the equilibrium prices, profits, and consumer welfare for various problem cases. We show that medium-quality experiences can lower the product sales and store traffic below the level when no experience is offered. Sufficiently low- or high-quality experiences overcome this issue, making the consumers better off. Yet, the former presents the only profitable option when a single retailer in the market offers an experience. In contrast, when both retailers adopt experiences, low-quality experiences may not be profitable, and the retailers would need to adopt even higher-quality experiences, which lead to a “win-win-win” outcome for the two retailers and consumers. A fee structure for the experience elevates retailer profits but can turn stores into outlets where consumers visit to purchase experiences and not products. When experiential retailing is the common practice in the market, it enables “win-win-win” outcomes when free experiences fail. Managerial implications : Being the first to study this new retail format, our results contribute to the ongoing debate on the settings under which experiential offerings are beneficial for the retailers and consumers and highlight that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. Our results show that experiences affect main product sales in nonobvious ways, especially in competitive markets. In a (post-)pandemic world where retailers try to attract consumers back to stores, we offer insights that can guide retailers in the process.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by several practical selling scenarios that require previous purchases to unlock future options, we consider a multistage assortment optimization problem, where the seller makes sequential assortment decisions with commitment and the customer makes sequential choices to maximize her expected utility. Methodology/results : We start with the two-stage problem and formulate it as a dynamic combinatorial optimization problem. We show that this problem is polynomial-time solvable when the customer is fully myopic or fully forward-looking. In particular, when the customer is fully forward-looking, the optimal policy entails that the assortment in each stage is revenue-ordered, and a product with higher revenue always leads to a wider range of future options. Moreover, we find that the optimal assortment in the first stage must be smaller than the optimal assortment when there is no second stage and the optimal assortment in the second stage must be larger than the optimal assortment when there is no first stage. When the customer is partially forward-looking, we show that the problem is NP-hard in general. In this case, we establish the polynomial-time solvability under certain conditions. In addition, we propose a 2-approximation algorithm in the general setting. We further extend these results to the multistage problem with an arbitrary number of stages, for which we derive generalized structural properties and efficient algorithms. Managerial implications : Firms can benefit from our study and improve their sequential assortment strategies when their interaction with each customer consists of multiple stages.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Consider consumers who prefer to consume a good later rather than earlier. If the price is constant, then we would expect consumers to wait to buy the good. That does not hold if consumers are concerned that others will buy the good early, so that a shortage will later occur. When will consumers arrive when they fear a shortage? What is the profit-maximizing policy of a monopolist? Might the firm lose profits by offering advance sales? The timing of consumer arrivals is much studied. Little consideration, however, has addressed how anticipated shortages affect arrival times. The application is important: managers want to know when consumers will arrive, when they should make the product available, and what price to charge to maximize profits. Methodology/results: We use game theory. We analyze analytically outcomes when a single item is for sale: we give closed solutions for the equilibrium customer behavior and profit-maximizing firm strategy and conduct sensitivity analysis. For generalization concerning more than one unit, we give some analytical results and provide many numerical solutions. When the price is constant over time, then even with no operating cost of doing so, offering advance sales reduces profits. If, however, the firm must offer both advance sales and later sales, then the profit-maximizing price induces all arrivals at the same time (either early or late, depending on the parameters). An increase in the number of units offered for sale increases the profit-maximizing price and increases the firm’s expected profit. The equilibrium strategy of consumers can generate some unexpected behavior. The arrival rate may increase with the price of the good. For a given price, an increase in the number of units for sale increases the number of consumers who arrive early. Managerial implications: The firm should offer the good only at the time consumers most desire it, and not earlier. Additionally, the profit-maximizing price can be derived from our analysis. This price is not the price which maximizes the expected number of arrivals. Funding: This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation [Grant 852/22].

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We study a dynamic finishing-stage planning problem of a pork producer who at the beginning of each week gets to see how many market-ready hogs she has available for sale and the current market prices. Then, she must decide which hogs to sell to a meatpacker and on the open market and which hogs to hold until the following week. The farmer is contracted to deliver a fixed quantity of hogs to the meatpacker each week priced according to a contractually predetermined market index. If the farmer underdelivers to the meatpacker, she pays a contractually predetermined unit penalty also linked to a market index. Biosecurity protocols prevent the farmer from buying hogs on the open market and selling them to the meatpacker. The farmer can, however, use the open market to sell hogs for prevailing market prices. Methodology/Results : We treat the problem as a dynamic, multiitem, nonstationary inventory problem with multiple sources of uncertainty. The optimal policy is a threshold policy with multiple price-dependent thresholds. The computational complexity required to evaluate the thresholds is the biggest impediment to using the optimal policy as a decision-support tool. So, we utilize an approximate dynamic programming approach that exploits the optimal policy structure and produces a sharp heuristic that is easy to implement. Managerial implications : Numerical experiments calibrated to a pork producer’s data reveal that the optimal policy with the heuristically estimated thresholds substantially improves the existing practice (around 25% on average). The success of the proposed model is attributed to recognizing the value of holding underweight hogs and effectively hedging supply uncertainty and future prices—an insight missed in the planning actions of the current practice.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: “Long tail” products with intermittent demand often tie up valuable warehouse space and capital investment for many companies. Furthermore, the paucity of demand data poses additional challenges for model estimation and performance evaluation. Traditional inventory solutions are not designed for products with intermittent demand. In this paper, we propose a new framework to optimize the choice of “replenishment timing” and “replenishment quantity” for managing the inventory metrics of long tail products, when evaluated over a finite horizon. Methodology/results: Our analysis is motivated by a recent interesting observation that the gambler’s fallacy phenomenon actually holds in a finite number of coin tosses. We use this phenomenon to analyze the inventory problem for intermittent demand to demonstrate that classical inventory models using KPIs such as fill rate, average cost per cycle, or average cost per unit, etc., must necessarily “bias” the underlying demand distribution to account for the finite horizon effect. We provide the exact closed-form expressions of the biased distribution to account for this effect in performance evaluation. The results show that the choice of replenishment timing and replenishment quantity is essential to superior performance on several key inventory metrics. Managerial implications: For long tail products, the belief that it is less likely for another demand to arrive shortly after a preceding one (the gambler’s fallacy), turns out to be true when performance is tabulated over a finite horizon, even if demands across time are independent. So it pays to delay the replenishment of depleted stocks to save on holding cost and warehouse space. Managers can optimize the replenishment timing, besides choosing the replenishment quantity, to optimize the performance metrics of several classes of inventory problems. This is especially useful for companies managing a large number of long tail products.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Although in-kind donations contribute to charity’s triple bottom line (i.e., generating additional revenue for the charity, contributing to social welfare, and reducing environmental waste through rechanneling used items), inappropriate material donations impose additional costs to sort, process, or discard them. Minimizing the amount of undesired in-kind donations, however, is a challenge given charities’ sensitive relationship with their donors. This paper examines the effectiveness of behavioral interventions on improving the quality of in-kind donations gifted by individuals. Methodology/results: We conducted a field experiment to implement interventions motivated by two well-established behavioral mechanisms: information disclosure and social norm . We studied the reaction of 763 donors who were scheduled to make an in-kind donation at a local charity between October 31 and November 11, 2020. Our results show that using the social norm intervention effectively improved the quality of in-kind donations, whereas information disclosure, which is commonly used in practice as the industry standard intervention, was ineffective. We also conducted two postexperiment analyses. First, we collected additional data on 1,301 in-kind donations whose donors had received the social norm intervention during February 2021. Results show that the impact of the social norm intervention is stable over different time periods. Second, we studied the spillover effect of these interventions for a period of 12 months and did not find a negative long-term impact on in-kind donations. Managerial implications: A conservative estimation shows that implementing the social norm intervention reduced the junk donations received by 50% without having a negative spillover effect on donors’ in-kind donations or imposing any direct operating cost. Consequently, this field evidence provides an effective, cost-efficient, and scalable solution for charities to address the quality problem of in-kind donations. In addition, our results challenge the industry conventional practice of incorporating information disclosure in their communications with donors. Funding: This work was supported by Virginia G.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We study a repeated interaction between a manufacturer and a retailer, where the retailer may share with the manufacturer past sales information. In our model, such information cannot improve the latter’s predictive capabilities of future demand, but it does allow him to infer past demand. Academic/practical relevance : Our main research questions are under what conditions the retailer and the manufacturer benefit from sharing such past sales information and how dynamic interaction and past sales information affect the efficiency of the distribution channel. Methodology : We model a repeated relationship between a manufacturer and a retailer, where demand fluctuates in an independent and identically distributed manner between periods. In each period, the retailer privately observes the current demand, and the manufacturer offers a menu of contracts to elicit the retailer to reveal its private information. The manufacturer may observe sales information that reveals past demand at the end of each period if the retailer chooses to share such information. Results : We find that even without sharing sales information, repeated interaction by itself enhances efficiency and profits for both firms. Past sales information further improves the channels’ efficiency and increases the manufacturer’s expected profit. Yet, past sales information increases (decreases) the retailer’s per-period expected profit when the retailer places a low (high) value on its future profits. Managerial implications : Our results provide a new strategic reasoning for sharing past sales information—as a way to increase trust in repeated vertical relationships. Furthermore, when the retailer can share a noisy signal regarding past demand, this may facilitate the exchange of sales information. We also consider the case of a financially constrained retailer and demonstrate that financial constraints may benefit the retailer as they limit the market power of the manufacturer. In contrast, the manufacturer and the channel’s efficiency are always worse off when the retailer is financially constrained.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Consumers often try a few varieties of an experience product before establishing a shopping routine. In retailing, a sample box typically refers to a package of multiple trial-sized varieties within a product category. Sample boxes potentially create value by helping consumers resolve their uncertainties regarding these varieties earlier and at a lower cost. In this paper, we study how firms and consumers share this added value under different market scenarios. We also derive the optimal pricing of sample boxes in product categories for which consumers make ongoing purchases over time. Academic/practical relevance : We thus extend the literature by proposing a framework that integrates sequential search and seller-induced learning. Methodology : We analyze a firm’s pricing decisions when consumers either purchase full-sized options sequentially or bypass that process via a sample box. We use dynamic programming to analyze consumers’ search problem (in the absence of a sample box) and nonlinear optimization to analyze the firm’s problem. Results : As anticipated, the informational value of a sample box yields an optimal price premium relative to the prices of individual products. Despite this price premium, we show that the firm’s expected profit may decrease because a sample box accelerates consumer learning, and thus, it may help consumers settle upon an outside option earlier. We establish that a firm can reverse the potential adverse profit impact of selling sample boxes by introducing an optimally specified future credit. Managerial implications : Offering sample boxes is a common practice in retailing. Contrasting the resulting expected profits with and without the sample box option, our results highlight that managers may be ill-advised to offer a sample box in the absence of the future credit mechanism. This study is the first to address the pricing of sample boxes and show the optimality of offering credit toward a subsequent purchase.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper focuses on subscription box services in which a provider selects the assortment of products to include in the box by taking into account the customer’s preferences. Customers interested in purchasing a product choose between engaging in active search (i.e., visit physical stores) or subscribing to a box delivery service. We study the subscription box company’s problem of selecting the optimal contents of the box to maximize expected revenue (by driving demand from customers). Methodology/results : Because a product may be both available at a store and included in the box, the assortment in a box affects the set of stores that a customer would visit under active search and, therefore, the customer’s subscription decision. We model such interaction by applying a cross-nested logit framework that correlates the contents in the box with the products available at the stores. We find that the box should include a collection of popular subsets of the store products for customers that experience a relatively low or relatively high search cost. If a preview of the box is available, we find that, for customers with intermediate values of the search cost, it may be optimal to include a so-called utility loss leader, that is, a product with relatively low valuation, to entice customers to subscribe to the box delivery service and therefore increase the likelihood of a sale. We use rational expectations to model a setting in which a preview of the box is not available. In such cases, it is never optimal to include a utility loss leader in the box. Managerial implications : Our model captures the impact of product overlap across different shopping channels on customer choice and the subscription box company assortment decision. We derive insights on how the subscription service provider should determine the contents of the box in anticipation of the customer’s search behavior. We also examine the decision of offering exclusive products in addition to branded items. Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2023.1204 .},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) represent undesirable complications that occur during a hospital stay. HACs can compromise patient safety and care outcomes and result in unnecessary socio-economic costs. Although hospitals are expected to reduce the incidence of HACs, few studies have examined the implications of HACs on other clinical outcomes and measures of hospital performance. This study contributes to the literature by exploring the relationship between exposure to a set of target HACs, length of stay (LOS) performance, and 30-day readmission risk. Methodology/results : To estimate the effects of HACs, we conduct econometric analyses using patient-visit-level data for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia patients hospitalized in the U.S. state of Florida during 2010–2014. We define LOS performance as the deviation of LOS from the Geometric Mean LOS (GMLOS), a standard LOS set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. First, we find that exposure to HACs leads to a 37% increase in the odds of readmission and a 79% increase in LOS. Second, an increase in LOS is associated with a decrease in readmission risk, and this decrease is stronger for patients exposed to HACs. Third, LOS performance mediates the HACs-readmission risk relationship, such that the increase in the readmission risk of a HAC patient can be fully suppressed by the patient’s LOS. Fourth, we find that for patients exposed to HACs, the benefits of a longer LOS are almost entirely capitalized when the LOS becomes 65% longer than the GMLOS. Managerial implications : We demonstrate that, when addressing the consequences of HACs, clinicians also face indirectly a trade-off between reducing readmissions and controlling costs. We proffer LOS as a potential mechanism under hospitals’ control for mitigating the adverse effects of HACs on readmission risk. Thus, this study offers guidance to clinicians having to decide when to discharge patients with exposure to HACs.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In the blood-donor-management problem, the blood bank incentivizes donors to donate, given blood inventory levels. We propose a model to optimize such incentivization schemes under the context of random demand, blood perishability, observation period between donations, and variability in donor arrivals and dropouts. Methodology/results : We propose an optimization model that simultaneously accounts for the dynamics in the blood inventory and the donor’s donation process, as a coupled queueing network. We adopt the Pipeline Queue paradigm, which leads us to a tractable convex reformulation. The coupled setting requires new methodologies to be developed upon the existing Pipeline Queue framework. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the optimal policy by comparing it with the commonly adopted and studied threshold policy. Our optimal policy can effectively reduce both shortages and wastage. Managerial implications : Our model is the first to operationalize a dynamic donor-incentivization scheme, by determining the optimal number of donors of different donation responsiveness to receive each type of incentive. It can serve as a decision-support tool that incorporates practical features of blood supply-chain management not addressed thus far, to the best of our knowledge. Simulations on existing policies indicate the dangers of myopic approaches and justify the need for smoother and forward-looking donor-incentivization schedules that can hedge against future demand variation. Our model also has potential wider applications in supply chains with perishable inventory.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This study addresses three important questions concerning personalized healthcare: (1) Are outcome differences between hospitals heterogeneous across patients with different features? (2) If they are, how do the best quality hospitals identified using patient-centric information differ from those identified using population-average information? (3) How much will hospitals’ pay-for-performance reimbursements change if their performance is measured based on patient-centric information? Methodology/results : Using patient-level data from 35 hospitals for six cardiovascular surgeries in New York State, we identify patient groups that exhibit significant differences in outcomes with a recently developed instrumental variable tree approach. We find outcome differences between hospitals are heterogeneous not only across procedure types, but also along other dimensions such as patient age and comorbidities. For around 80% of patients, the best quality hospitals indicated by patient-centric information are different from those indicated as best according to population-average information. Managerial implications : We compare potential outcomes when patients are treated at the best quality hospitals based on the two types of information and find complications could be reduced by using patient-centric information instead of population-average information. We also use our model to illustrate how patient-centric information can enhance pay-for-performance programs offered by payers and guide hospitals in targeting quality-improvement efforts.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Algorithm-enabled decision support has an increasingly important role in supporting the day-to-day operations of healthcare organizations. Yet, fully realizing the value of algorithmic decision support lies critically in the opportunity to re-engineer the related processes and redefine roles in ways that make organizations more effective. We study how and when algorithm-enabled process innovation (AEPI) creates value in light of dynamic operational environments (i.e., workload) and behavioral responses to algorithmic predictions (i.e., algorithmic accuracy). Our context is an AEPI effort around a rule-based decision-support algorithm for early detection of sepsis—a costly condition that is the leading cause of death for hospitalized patients. We collaborated with a large U.S.-based hospital system and examined whether AEPI developed for sepsis care (sepsis AEPI) impacts patient mortality and when this impact is stronger or weaker. Methodology/results : We utilize a rich set of clinical and nonclinical data in empirically examining the impact of sepsis AEPI on patient mortality. We leverage the staggered implementation of sepsis AEPI across hospital units and conduct our estimation on a carefully matched sample. The matching utilizes data on patient vitals and the logic behind the algorithm to create a robust comparison group consisting of patient visits for which sepsis AEPI would have triggered an alert if it had been in place. Our empirical analysis shows that sepsis AEPI reduces the likelihood of death from sepsis (45% relative reduction in mortality risk due to sepsis). A higher-than-usual workload and an increase in the average number of inaccurate alert experience at a hospital unit (e.g., an oncology unit, which provides care for cancer patients), in general, reduces the effectiveness of AEPI. We also identify diminishing mortality benefits over prolonged periods of adoption; evaluation of the moderators over time helps explain this diminishing impact. Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that streamlining sepsis-care processes through a predictive algorithm (i.e., algorithm-based monitoring of real-time patient data and providing predictions, streamlined communication channels for coordinating care for a patient with sepsis prediction, and a more standardized process for sepsis diagnosis and treatment) can reduce the loss of life from sepsis. For the 3,739 sepsis patients in our study period, AEPI’s benefits would translate to 181 lives saved. We show that such value, however, is sensitive to operational and behavioral factors as the algorithm becomes a routine part of the day-to-day operations of the hospital.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Patient-level data from 72 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hospitals in Ontario, Canada from 2013 to 2017 show that over 60% of patients exceeded their wait time targets. We conduct a data-driven analysis to quantify the reduction in the patient fraction exceeding (FET) target for MRI services through geographic virtual resource-sharing while limiting incremental driving time. We present a data-driven method to solve the geographic pooling problem of partitioning 72 hospitals with heterogeneous patients with different wait time targets located in a two-dimensional region into a set of clusters. Methodology/results : We propose an “augmented-priority rule,” which is a sequencing rule that balances the patient’s initial priority class and the number of days until her wait time target. We then use neural networks to predict patient arrival and service times. We combine this predicted information and the sequencing rule to implement “advance scheduling,” which informs the patient of her treatment day and location when requesting an MRI scan. We then optimize the number of geographic resource pools among the 72 hospitals using genetic algorithms. Our resource-pooling model lowers the FET from 66% to 36% while constraining the average incremental travel time below three hours. In addition, our model shows that only 10 additional scanners are needed to achieve 10% FET, whereas 50 additional scanners would be needed without resource sharing. Over 70% of the hospitals are not worse off financially. Each individual hospital, measured over at least two weeks, achieves a higher machine utilization and a lower FET. Managerial implications : Our paper provides a practical, data-driven geographical resource-sharing model that hospitals can readily implement. Our method achieves a near-optimal solution with low computational complexity. Using smart data-driven scheduling, a little extra capacity placed at the right location is all we need to achieve the desired FET under geographic resource-sharing.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies the deceased-donor liver allocation policies in the United States. In the transplant community, broader organ sharing is believed to mitigate geographic inequity (intergeographic variation in transplant rates, patient survival rates, waiting times, and offers) in organ access, and recent policies are moving in that direction in principle. The liver-allocation policy has gone through two major modifications in the last 10 years. Despite these overhauls, geographic inequity persists. Methodology/results : In this study, we develop a patient’s dynamic choice model to analyze the patient’s strategic response to a policy change. We use this to evaluate several (existing and proposed) organ-allocation policies. On historical data, we show that our model’s predictions are more precise than the existing liver simulated allocation model. It more accurately captures (1) a patient’s change in organ offer acceptance probability (with their sickness level) and (2) the behavioral change of a patient in terms of organ offer acceptance probability with a change in policy. Next, we study the current acuity circles policy (a one-size-fits-all variant of broader sharing) and conclude that it results in lower efficiency (more offer refusals and a lower transplant benefit) than the previous share 35 policy and performs similarly on geographic equity measures. Finally, we show that broader sharing in its current form may not be the best strategy to balance geographic equity and efficiency. The intuition is that, by indiscriminately enlarging the pool of supply locations from where patients can receive offers, they tend to become more selective, resulting in more offer rejections and less efficiency. We illustrate that a policy that equalizes the supply (deceased donors)-to-demand (waiting list patients) ratios across geographies is better than acuity circles in achieving geographic equity at the lowest trade-off on efficiency metrics. Managerial implications : The key message to policymakers is that they should move away from the one-size-fits-all approach and focus on matching supply and demand to develop organ-allocation policies that score well in terms of efficiency and geographic equity.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the estimation of the probability distribution of individual patient waiting times in an emergency department (ED). Whereas it is known that waiting-time estimates can help improve patients’ overall satisfaction and prevent abandonment, existing methods focus on point forecasts, thereby completely ignoring the underlying uncertainty. Communicating only a point forecast to patients can be uninformative and potentially misleading. Methodology/results : We use the machine learning approach of quantile regression forest to produce probabilistic forecasts. Using a large patient-level data set, we extract the following categories of predictor variables: (1) calendar effects, (2) demographics, (3) staff count, (4) ED workload resulting from patient volumes, and (5) the severity of the patient condition. Our feature-rich modeling allows for dynamic updating and refinement of waiting-time estimates as patient- and ED-specific information (e.g., patient condition, ED congestion levels) is revealed during the waiting process. The proposed approach generates more accurate probabilistic and point forecasts when compared with methods proposed in the literature for modeling waiting times and rolling average benchmarks typically used in practice. Managerial implications : By providing personalized probabilistic forecasts, our approach gives low-acuity patients and first responders a more comprehensive picture of the possible waiting trajectory and provides more reliable inputs to inform prescriptive modeling of ED operations. We demonstrate that publishing probabilistic waiting-time estimates can inform patients and ambulance staff in selecting an ED from a network of EDs, which can lead to a more uniform spread of patient load across the network. Aspects relating to communicating forecast uncertainty to patients and implementing this methodology in practice are also discussed. For emergency healthcare service providers, probabilistic waiting-time estimates could assist in ambulance routing, staff allocation, and managing patient flow, which could facilitate efficient operations and cost savings and aid in better patient care and outcomes.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services launched the Primary Care First (PCF) initiative in January 2021. The initiative builds upon prior innovative payment models and aims at incentivizing a redesign of primary care delivery, including new modes of delivery, such as remote care. To achieve this goal, the initiative blends capitation and fee-for-service (FFS) payments and includes performance-based adjustments linked to service quality and health outcomes. We analyze a model motivated by this new payment system, and its impact on the different stakeholders, and derive insights on how to design it to reach the best possible outcome. Methodology/results : We propose an analytical model that captures patient heterogeneity in terms of health complexity, provider choice of care-delivery mode (referral to a specialist, in-person visit, or remote care), and quality of service (health outcomes and wait time). We analyze the provider decision on the mode of care delivery under both FFS and PCF and study whether PCF can be designed to yield a socially optimal outcome. We characterize analytically when patients, payer, and providers are better off under PCF and show that, in many cases, PCF can be designed to yield a socially optimal outcome. We numerically calibrate our model for 14 states in the United States. We observe that the average health status in a state is a source of heterogeneity that crucially drives the performance of PCF. We find that the model motivated by the current PCF implementation results in too much adoption of referral care and too little adoption of remote care. In addition, states with poor average health status may use more in-person care than socially optimal under a baseline (low) level of capitation. Moreover, relying on high levels of capitation leads to low adoption of in-person care. Managerial implications : Our results have health policy implications by shedding light on how PCF might impact patients, payer, and providers. Under the current performance-based adjustments, low levels of capitation should be preferred. PCF has the potential to be designed to achieve socially optimal outcomes. However, the fee per visit may need to be tailored to the local population’s health status. Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2023.1207 .},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the use of nonmonetary incentives based on reciprocity to facilitate capacity sharing between two service providers that have limited and substitutable service capacity. Academic/practical relevance : We propose a parsimonious game theory framework, in which two firms dynamically choose whether to accept each other’s customers without the capability to perfectly monitor each other’s capacity utilization state. Methodology : We solve the continuous-time imperfect-monitoring game by focusing on a class of public strategy, in which firms’ real-time capacity-sharing decision depends on an intuitive and easy-to-implement accounting device, namely the current net number of transferred customers. We refer to such an equilibrium as a trading-favors equilibrium. We characterize the condition in which capacity sharing takes place in such an equilibrium. Results : We find that some degree of efficiency loss (as compared with a central planner’s solution) is necessary to induce reciprocity. The efficiency loss is small when the two firms have similar traffic intensity even if they are different in service-capacity scale, whereas the efficiency loss can be considerably large when the two firms have significantly different traffic intensities. The trading-favors mechanism, surprisingly, can outperform the perfect-monitoring benchmark when the two firms exhibit high asymmetry in terms of service-capacity scale or traffic intensity because the smaller firm tends to deviate from collaboration. Managerial implications : Firms should consider engaging in nonmonetary reciprocal capacity sharing if regulations, transaction costs, or other market and operational frictions make it difficult to use a capacity-sharing contract based on monetary payments. The trading-favors collaboration can improve the firms’ payoff close to the centralized upper bound when the firms have similar traffic intensities. However, when their traffic intensities are highly different, firms are better off with a monetary-payment contract to induce more capacity sharing and are worse off investing in increasing their visibility to each other’s real-time available capacity, namely investing in perfect monitoring.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Employers across many sectors of the economy have been fast to adopt variable work scheduling policies. The cost of this flexibility for employers is usually borne by employees, for whom unstable work schedules create several disruptions. In the context of home healthcare, we examine how employer-driven volatility in nurses’ schedules impacts their decision to voluntarily leave their job. Methodology/results : Using an instrumental variables approach, we causally identify the effect of schedule volatility on nurses’ voluntary turnover. We begin by constructing an operational measure of schedule volatility using time-stamped work log data from one of the largest home health agencies in the United States. Because this measure may be endogenous to the worker’s decision to quit, we instrument for schedule volatility using paid days off taken by other nurses in the same branch. We find that higher levels of schedule volatility substantially increase a worker’s likelihood of quitting. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation increase in schedule volatility increases the average worker’s propensity to quit on a given day by more than threefold. Translated into yearly terms, 30 days of high schedule volatility over the course of the year increases the average worker’s probability of quitting that year by 20%. Our policy simulations of counterfactual scheduling policies suggest that excess schedule volatility can explain a significant portion of voluntary turnover, and some interventions have the potential to substantially reduce workers’ daily propensity to quit. Managerial implications : This work contributes to the understanding of the extent to which employees value control over their own work schedules and are averse to volatile work schedules that are dictated by employers. Especially in the current environment where there is a growing emphasis on work-life balance and employee-driven flexibility, finding a way to support stable schedules could be important for employers to attract and retain workers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Shared micromobility vehicles provide an eco-friendly form of short-distance travel within an urban area. Because customers pick up and drop off vehicles in any service region at any time, such convenience often leads to a severe imbalance between vehicle supply and demand in different service regions. To overcome this, a micromobility operator can crowdsource individual riders with reward incentives in addition to engaging a third-party logistics provider (3PL) to relocate the vehicles. Methodology/results : We construct a time-space network with multiple service regions and formulate a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program considering uncertain customer demands. In the first stage, the operator decides the initial vehicle allocation for the regions, whereas in the second stage, the operator determines subsequent vehicle relocation across the regions over an operational horizon. We develop an efficient solution approach that incorporates scenario-based and time-based decomposition techniques. Our approach outperforms a commercial solver in solution quality and computational time for solving large-scale problem instances based on real data. Managerial implications : The budgets for acquiring vehicles and for rider crowdsourcing significantly impact the vehicle initial allocation and subsequent relocation. Introducing rider crowdsourcing in addition to the 3PL can significantly increase profit, reduce demand loss, and improve the vehicle utilization rate of the system without affecting any existing commitment with the 3PL. The 3PL is more efficient for mass relocation than rider crowdsourcing, whereas the latter is more efficient in handling sporadic relocation needs. To serve a region, the 3PL often relocates vehicles in batches from faraway, low-demand regions around peak hours of a day, whereas rider crowdsourcing relocates a few vehicles each time from neighboring regions throughout the day. Furthermore, rider crowdsourcing relocates more vehicles under a unimodal customer arrival pattern than a bimodal pattern, whereas the reverse holds for the 3PL.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Gig economy companies benefit from labor flexibility by hiring independent workers in response to real-time demand. However, workers’ flexibility in their work schedule poses a great challenge in terms of planning and committing to a service capacity. Understanding what motivates gig economy workers is thus of great importance. In collaboration with a ride-hailing platform, we study how on-demand workers make labor decisions; specifically, whether to work and work duration. Our model revisits competing theories of labor supply regarding the impact of financial incentives and behavioral motives on labor decisions. We are interested in both improving how to predict the behavior of flexible workers and understanding how to design better incentives. Methodology/results: Using a large comprehensive data set, we develop an econometric model to analyze workers’ labor decisions and responses to incentives while accounting for sample selection and endogeneity. We find that financial incentives have a significant positive influence on the decision to work and on the work duration—confirming the positive income elasticity posited by the standard income effect. We also find support for a behavioral theory as workers exhibit income-targeting behavior (working less when reaching an income goal) and inertia (working more after working for a longer period). Managerial implications: We demonstrate via numerical experiments that incentive optimization based on our insights can increase service capacity by 22% without incurring additional cost, or maintain the same capacity at a 30% lower cost. Ignoring behavioral factors could lead to understaffing by 10%–17% below the optimal capacity level. Lastly, our insights inform the design of platform strategy to manage flexible workers amidst an intensified competition among gig platforms. Funding: This study was supported by The Jay H.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Whereas firms are increasingly relying on sourcing globally as a key constituent of their supply chain strategy, there is no empirical evidence on whether investors of these firms adequately reflect firms’ global sourcing strategy (GSS) in their stock-valuation process. In this paper, we empirically test whether stock market participants are efficient in doing so. Methodology/results : Using the empirical asset-pricing framework, we find that information concerning firms’ GSS strongly predicts their future stock returns. We compile a transaction-level imports database for U.S.-listed firms and construct measures for five widely studied GSS aspects in the operations management literature: the extent of global sourcing, supplier relationship strength, supplier concentration, sourcing lead time, and sourcing countries’ logistical efficiency. For each measure, we examine returns of a zero-cost investment strategy of buying from the highest and selling from the lowest quintile of that measure. Collectively, these investment strategies yield an average annual four-factor alpha of 6%–9.6% (6%–13.9%) with value (equal)-weighted portfolios. Their return predictability is incremental over other operations- and cost arbitrage–motivated predictors, such as inventory turnover, cash conversion cycle, and gross profitability; is persistent across different supply chain positions; and is robust to alternate risk models, subsamples, and empirical specifications. Together, our results indicate that the GSS measures embody independent information about firms’ future profitability, and this information is mispriced by market participants, leading to predictable returns. In accordance with this mechanism, we find that the GSS measures strongly predict both firms’ future earnings and the surprise in market reactions around the earnings announcement days. Managerial implications : The robust return predictability of our GSS measures suggests that investors are not fully incorporating GSS-related information in their stock valuation frameworks. Therefore, our results call for greater investor education on global sourcing and better dissemination of global-sourcing information so as to mitigate valuation inefficiency.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Cloud computing is recognized as a critical driver of information technology–enabled innovations. The operations management (OM) community, however, has not been exposed enough to the essential operations problems that arise from the management of cloud value chains. Academic/practical relevance : In this paper, we examine recent research on cloud value chains and explore future research opportunities from an OM perspective. In particular, we focus on major operations management challenges facing a cloud provider in three problem domains: (1) cloud computing resource management, (2) pricing in the cloud computing marketplaces, and (3) capacity planning and management of cloud supply chains. Methodology : We describe prevalent business models and management practices in the cloud value chains, discuss recent research from OM that falls into each of the three problem domains mentioned, and point out opportunities for future research. Results : We note that cloud computing operations are driven by demand that exhibits distinct characteristics, including complex workflow, demand redundancy, multifeatured characteristics, multidimensional resource requirement, and nonstationarity. On the supply side, cloud computing operations also exhibit distinct characteristics, including heterogeneous resources, packing constraints, preconfigured (“bundled”) supply, technology risks, and cost uncertainty. These characteristics of demand and supply are not all prevalent in other operations. Managerial implications : Cloud computing operations not only share many features with classic OM problems, but also bring new challenges and innovative business models. Thus, OM tools and research have the potential to provide vital insights into cloud computing operations and impact management practices in the cloud industry, which, in turn, can stimulate much innovative research from the OM perspective.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We study the dynamic fulfillment problem in e-commerce, in which incoming (multi-item) customer orders must be immediately dispatched to (a combination of) fulfillment centers that have the required inventory. Methodology/results: A prevailing approach to this problem, pioneered by Jasin and Sinha in 2015 , has been to write a “deterministic” linear program that dictates, for each item in an incoming multi-item order from a particular region, how frequently it should be dispatched to each fulfillment center (FC). However, dispatching items in a way that satisfies these frequency constraints, without splitting the order across too many FCs, is challenging. Jasin and Sinha in 2015 identified this as a correlated rounding problem and proposed an intricate rounding scheme that they proved was suboptimal by a factor of at most ≈ q / 4 on a q -item order. This paper provides, to our knowledge, the first substantially improved scheme for this correlated rounding problem, which is suboptimal by a factor of at most 1 + ln ( q ) . We provide another scheme for sparse networks, which is suboptimal by a factor of at most d if each item is stored in at most d FCs. We show both of these guarantees to be tight in terms of the dependence on q or d . Our schemes are simple and fast, based on an intuitive idea; items wait for FCs to “open” at random times but observe them on “dilated” time scales. This also implies a new randomized rounding method for the classical Set Cover problem, which could be of general interest. Managerial implications: We numerically test our new rounding schemes under the same realistic setups as Jasin and Sinha and find that they improve runtimes, shorten code, and robustly improve performance. Our code is made publicly available online. History: This paper was selected for Fast Track in the M&amp;SOM Journal from the 2022 MSOM Supply Chain Management SIG Conference.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by our collaboration with an online dating company, we study how a platform should dynamically select the set of potential partners to show to each user in each period in order to maximize the expected number of matches in a time horizon, where a match is formed only after two users like each other, possibly in different periods. Academic/practical relevance : Increasing match rates is a prevalent objective of online platforms. We provide insights into how to leverage users’ preferences and behavior toward this end. Our proposed algorithm was piloted by our collaborator, a major online dating company in the United States. Methodology : Our work combines several methodologies. We model the platform’s problem as a dynamic optimization problem. We use econometric tools and exploit a change in the company’s algorithm in order to estimate the users’ preferences and the causal effect of previous matches on the like behavior of users, as well as other parameters of interest. Leveraging our data findings, we propose a family of heuristics to solve the platform’s problem and use simulations and field experiments to assess their benefits. Results : We find that the number of matches obtained in the recent past has a negative effect on the like behavior of users. We propose a family of heuristics to decide the profiles to show to each user on each day that accounts for this finding. Two field experiments show that our algorithm yields at least 27% more matches relative to our industry partner’s algorithm. Managerial implications : Our results highlight the importance of correctly accounting for the preferences, behavior, and activity metrics of users on both ends of a transaction to improve the operational efficiency of matching platforms. In addition, we propose a novel identification strategy to measure the effect of previous matches on the users’ preferences in a two-sided matching market, the result of which is leveraged by our algorithm. Our methodology may also be applied to online matching platforms in other domains.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online retailers provide recommendations of ancillary services when a customer is making a purchase. Our goal is to predict the net present value (NPV) of these services, estimate the probability of a customer subscribing to each of them depending on what services are offered to them, and ultimately prescribe the optimal personalized service recommendation that maximizes the expected long-term revenue. Methodology/results : We propose a novel method called cluster-while-classify (CWC), which jointly groups observations into clusters (segments) and learns a distinct classification model within each of these segments to predict the sign-up propensity of services based on customer, product, and session-level features. This method is competitive with the industry state of the art and can be represented in a simple decision tree. This makes CWC interpretable and easily actionable. We then use double machine learning (DML) and causal forests to estimate the NPV for each service and, finally, propose an iterative optimization strategy—that is, scalable and efficient—to solve the personalized ancillary service recommendation problem. CWC achieves a competitive 74% out-of-sample accuracy over four possible outcomes and seven different combinations of services for the propensity predictions. This, alongside the rest of the personalized holistic optimization framework, can potentially result in an estimated 2.5%–3.5% uplift in the revenue based on our numerical study. Managerial implications : The proposed solution allows online retailers in general and Wayfair in particular to curate their service offerings and optimize and personalize their service recommendations for the stakeholders.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Traffic congestion is a serious global issue. A potential solution, which requires zero investment in infrastructure, is to convince solo car users to carpool. Academic/practical relevance : In this paper, we leverage the Waze Carpool service and run the largest ever digital field experiment to nudge commuters to carpool. Methodology : Our field experiment involves more than half a million users across four U.S. states between June 10 and July 3, 2019. We identify users who can save a significant commute time by carpooling through the use of a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane, users who can still use an HOV lane but have a low time saving, and users who do not have access to an HOV lane on their commute. We send them in-app notifications with different framings: mentioning the HOV lane, highlighting the time saving, emphasizing the monetary welcome bonus (for users who do not have access to an HOV lane), and a generic carpool invitation. Results : We find a strong relationship between the affinity to carpool and the potential time saving through an HOV lane. Managerial implications : Specifically, we estimate that mentioning the HOV lane increases the click-through rate (i.e., proportion of users who clicked on the button inviting them to try the carpool service) and the onboarding rate (i.e., proportion of users who signed up and created an account with the carpool service) by 133%–185% and 64%–141%, respectively, relative to a generic invitation. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for carpool platforms and public policy.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Estimating customer demand for revenue management solutions faces two main hurdles: unobservable no-purchases and nonhomogenous customer populations with varying preferences. We propose a novel and practical estimation and segmentation methodology that overcomes both challenges simultaneously. Academic/practical relevance : We combine the estimation of discrete choice modeling under unobservable no-purchases with a data-driven identification of customer segments. In collaboration with our industry partner, Oracle Hospitality Global Business Unit, we demonstrate our methodology in the hotel industry setting where increased competition has driven hoteliers to look for more innovative revenue management practices, such as personalized offers for their guests. Methodology : Our methodology predicts demand for multiple types of hotel rooms based on guest characteristics, travel attributes, and room features. Our framework combines clustering techniques with choice modeling to develop a mixture of multinomial logit discrete choice models and uses Bayesian inference to estimate model parameters. In addition to predicting the probability of an individual guest’s room type choice, our model delivers additional insights on segmentation with its capability to classify each guest into segments (or a mixture of segments) based on their characteristics. Results : We first show using Monte Carlo simulations that our method outperforms several benchmark methods in prediction accuracy, with nearly unbiased estimates of the choice model parameters and the size of the no-purchase incidents. We then demonstrate our method on a real hotel data set and illustrate how the model results can be used to drive insights for personalized offers and pricing. Managerial implications : Our proposed framework provides a practical approach for a complicated demand estimation problem and can help hoteliers segment their guests based on their preferences, which can serve as a valuable input for personalized offer selection and pricing decisions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the problem of demand learning and pricing for retailers who offer assortments of substitutable products that change frequently, for example, due to limited inventory, perishable or time-sensitive products, or the retailer’s desire to frequently offer new styles. Academic/practical relevance : We are one of the first to consider the demand learning and pricing problem for retailers who offer product assortments that change frequently, and we propose and implement a learn-then-earn algorithm for use in this setting. Our algorithm prioritizes a short learning phase, an important practical characteristic that is only considered by few other algorithms. Methodology : We develop a novel demand learning and pricing algorithm that learns quickly in an environment with varying assortments and limited price changes by adapting the commonly used marketing technique of conjoint analysis to our setting. We partner with Zenrez, an e-commerce company that partners with fitness studios to sell excess capacity of fitness classes, to implement our algorithm in a controlled field experiment to evaluate its effectiveness in practice using the synthetic control method. Results : Relative to a control group, our algorithm led to an expected initial dip in revenue during the learning phase, followed by a sustained and significant increase in average daily revenue of 14%–18% throughout the earning phase, illustrating that our algorithmic contributions can make a significant impact in practice. Managerial implications : The theoretical benefit of demand learning and pricing algorithms is well understood—they allow retailers to optimally match supply and demand in the face of uncertain preseason demand. However, most existing demand learning and pricing algorithms require substantial sales volume and the ability to change prices frequently for each product. Our work provides retailers who do not have this luxury a powerful demand learning and pricing algorithm that has been proven in practice.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Healthcare systems in resource-limited settings rely on diagnostic networks in which medical samples (e.g., blood, sputum) and results need to be transported between geographically dispersed healthcare facilities and centralized laboratories. Academic/practical relevance: Existing sample transportation (ST) systems typically operate fixed schedules, which do not account for demand variability and lead to unnecessary transportation visits as well as delays. Methodology: We design an optimized sample transportation (OST) system that comprises two components: (i) a new approach for timely collection of information on transportation demand (samples and results) using low-cost technology based on feature phones, and (ii) an optimization-based solution approach to the problem of routing and scheduling courier trips in a multistage transportation system. Results: Our solution approach performs well in a range of numerical experiments. Furthermore, we implement OST in collaboration with Riders For Health, who operate the national ST system in Malawi. Based on analysis of field data describing over 20,000 samples and results transported during July–October 2019, we show that the implementation of OST routes reduced average ST delays in three districts of Malawi by approximately 25%. In addition, the proportion of unnecessary trips by ST couriers decreased by 55%. Managerial implications: Our approach for improving ST operations is feasible and effective in Malawi and can be applied to other resource-limited settings, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The undesirable but inevitable consequence of running promotions is that consumers can be trained to time their purchases strategically. In this paper, we study randomized promotions, where the firm randomly offers discounts over time, as an alternative strategy of intertemporal price discrimination. Methodology/results : We consider a base model where a monopolist sells a single product to a market with a constant stream of two market segments. The segments are heterogeneous in both their product valuations and patience levels. The firm precommits to a price distribution, and in each period, a price is randomly drawn from the committed distribution. We characterize the optimal price distribution as a randomized promotion policy and show that it serves as an intertemporal price discrimination mechanism such that high-valuation customers would make a purchase immediately at a regular price upon arrival, and low-valuation customers would wait for a random promotion. Compared against the optimal cyclic pricing policy, which is optimal within the strategy space of all deterministic pricing policies, the optimal randomized pricing policy beats it if low-valuation customers are sufficiently patient and the absolute discrepancy between high and low customer valuations is large enough. We extend the model in three directions. First, we consider the case where a portion of customers are myopic and would never wait. We show that the existence of myopic customers is detrimental to the firm’s profitability, and the expected profit from an optimal randomized pricing policy decreases as the proportion of myopic customers in the population increases. Second, we consider Markovian pricing policies where prices are allowed to be intertemporally correlated in a Markovian fashion. This additional maneuver allows the firm to reap an even higher profit when low-valuation customers are sufficiently patient by avoiding consecutive promotions but, on average, running the promotion more frequently with a smaller discount size. Lastly, we consider a model with multiple customer segments and show that a two-point price distribution remains optimal, and our conclusion from the two-segment base model still holds under certain conditions that are adopted in the literature. Managerial implications : Our results imply that the firm may want to deliberately randomize promotions in the presence of forward-looking customers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Dynamic forecasting models in auctions have fallen short on two dimensions: (i) the lack of an equilibrium model for final bids and (ii) the lack of a winner’s curse (i.e., a tendency to overpay conditional on winning the auction) adjustment to allow bidders to account for a common value component in the auction item. In this paper, we develop a methodology to accurately predict equilibrium stage bids from the initial bidding dynamics and quantify the impact of the winner’s curse. This methodology allows us to conduct policy simulations to optimize auction design parameters. Methodology/Results : Dynamic auctions typically have a stage of high exploratory activity, followed by an inactivity period, and then an equilibrium stage of last-minute bids with sharp jumps. With a Kalman filter approach, we use exploratory stage bids to predict an auction item’s valuation distribution. We feed this prediction into an equilibrium model and apply item-specific adjustments for winner’s curse, bidder heterogeneity, and inactivity period. We use the resulting equilibrium model to predict the equilibrium stage bids. Our methodology improves the forecast of equilibrium stage bids by 11.33%, on average, compared with a state-of-the-art benchmark. This improvement is even higher (18.99%) for common value auctions. We also find that (i) significantly more (respectively, fewer) bidders internalize the winner’s curse in common value (respectively, private value) auctions; (ii) bidders in common value auctions decrease their bids by 6.03% because of the winner’s curse; and (iii) the inactivity period has a lesser impact on the equilibrium stage bids in private value auctions. Managerial implications : Our proposed methodology is intended to facilitate the need in academia and practice for real-time bid predictions that encompass different levels of the common value component in auctions. Using our methodology, auction platforms can support their choice of minimum bid increment policies and decide how to allocate resources across different auctions to mitigate the adverse effects of the winner’s curse.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : How to use social media to predict style color and jeans fit sales for a retailer. Academic/practical relevance: Neither retail practice nor the academic literature provides a method for using social media to predict style color and jeans fit sales for a retailer. We present and validate a systematic approach for doing that. Methodology : Demand forecasting in the fashion industry is challenging due to short product lifetimes, long manufacturing lead times, and constant innovation of fashion products. We investigate the value of social media information for color trends and jeans fit forecasting. We partner with three multinational retailers, two apparel and one footwear, and combine their proprietary data sets with web-crawled publicly available data on Twitter and the Google Search Volume Index. We implement a variety of machine learning models to develop forecasts that can be used in setting the initial shipment quantity for an item, arguably the most important decision for fashion retailers. Results : Our findings show that fine-grained social media information has significant predictive power in forecasting color and fit demands months in advance of the sales season, and therefore greatly helps in making the initial shipment quantity decision. The predictive power of including social media features, measured by the improvement of the out-of-sample mean absolute deviation over current practice ranges from 24% to 57%. Managerial implications : To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore and demonstrate the value of social media information in fashion demand forecasting in a way that is practical and operable for fashion retailers. With consistent results across all three retailers, we demonstrate the robustness of our findings over market and geographic heterogeneity, and different forecast horizons. Moreover, we discuss potential mechanisms that might be driving this significant predictive power. Our results suggest that changes in fashion demand are driven more by “bottom-up” changes in consumer preferences than by “top-down” influence from the fashion industry.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A blockchain payment system, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, validates electronic transactions and stores them in a chain of blocks without a central authority. Miners with computing power compete for the rights to create blocks according to a preset protocol, referred to as hashing or mining, and, in return, earn fees paid by users who submit transactions. Because of security concerns caused by decentralization, a transaction is confirmed after a number of additional blocks are subsequently extended to the block containing it. This confirmation latency introduces an intricate interplay between miners and users. This paper provides approximate system equilibria and studies optimal designs of a blockchain. Methodology/results : The hashing process is essentially a single-server queue with batch services based on a fee-based priority discipline, and confirmation latency adds complexity to the equilibrium behavior and optimal design. We analyze how miners’ participation decisions interact with users’ participation and fee decisions and identify optimal designs when the goal is to maximize the throughput or social welfare. We validate our model and conduct numerical studies using data from Bitcoin. Managerial implications : By incorporating security issues, we uncover the interdependence of the decisions between users and miners and the driver for nonzero entrance fees in practice. We show that miners and users may end up in either a vicious or virtuous cycle, depending on the initial system state. By allowing the entrance fee to be a design parameter, we are able to establish that it is optimal to simply run a blockchain system at its full capacity and a block size as small as possible.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper provides a theoretical investigation into the value and design of a traceability-driven blockchain under different supply chain structures. Methodology/results : We use game theory to study the quality contracting equilibrium between one buyer and two suppliers and identify two fundamental functionalities of a traceability-driven blockchain. In serial supply chains, the ability to trace the sequential production process creates value by mitigating double moral hazard. In this case, traceability always improves product quality and all firms’ profits and naturally creates a win-win. In parallel supply chains, the ability to trace the product origin enables flexible product recall, which can reduce product quality. In this case, traceability can benefit the buyer while hurting the suppliers, creating an incentive conflict. Managerial implications : Firms operating in different kinds of supply chains could face unique challenges when they adopt and design a traceability-driven blockchain. First, in serial supply chains, any firm can be the initiator of the blockchain, whereas in parallel supply chains, it may be critical for the buyer to take the lead in initiating the blockchain and properly compensate the suppliers. Second, in serial supply chains, a restricted data permission policy where each supplier shares their own traceability data with the buyer but not with each other can improve the supply chain profit, whereas in parallel supply chains, it is never optimal to restrict a firm’s access to the traceability data. Third, the suppliers’ incentive to enhance the governance of data quality is more aligned with the supply chain optimum in serial supply chains compared with parallel supply chains. Funding: M.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Delay announcements have become an essential tool in service system operations: They influence customer behavior and network efficiency. Most current delay announcement methods are designed for relatively simple environments with a single service station or stations in tandem. However, complex service systems, such as healthcare systems, often have fork-join (FJ) structures. Such systems usually suffer from long delays as a result of both resource scarcity and process synchronization, even when queues are fairly short. These systems may thus require more accurate delay estimation techniques than currently available. Methodology/results : We analyze a network comprising a single-server queue followed by a two-station FJ structure using a recursive construction of the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the joint delay distribution, conditioning on customers’ movements in the network. Delay estimations are made at the time of arrival to the first station. Using data from an emergency department, we examine the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed approach, explore different model structures, and draw insights regarding the conditions under which the FJ structure should be explicitly modeled. We provide evidence that the proposed methodology is better than other commonly used queueing theory estimators such as last-to-enter-service (which is based on snapshot-principle arguments) and queue length, and we replicate previous results showing that the most accurate estimations are obtained when using our model result as a feature in state-of-the-art machine learning estimation methods. Managerial implications : Our results allow management to implement individual, real-time, state-dependent delay announcements in complex FJ networks. We also provide rules of thumb with which one could decide whether to use a model with an explicit FJ structure or to reduce it to a simpler model requiring less computational effort.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study scheduling multi-class impatient customers in parallel server queueing systems. At the time of arrival, customers are identified as being one of many classes, and the class represents the service and patience time distributions as well as cost characteristics. From the system’s perspective, customers of the same class at time of arrival get differentiated on their residual patience time as they wait in queue. We leverage this property and propose two novel and easy-to-implement multi-class scheduling policies. Academic/practical relevance : Scheduling multi-class impatient customers is an important and challenging topic, especially when customers’ patience times are nonexponential. In these contexts, even for customers of the same class, processing them under the first-come, first-served (FCFS) policy is suboptimal. This is because, at time of arrival, the system only knows the overall patience distribution from which a customer’s patience value is drawn, and as time elapses, the estimate of the customer’s residual patience time can be further updated. For nonexponential patience distributions, such an update indeed reveals additional information, and using this information to implement within-class prioritization can lead to additional benefits relative to the FCFS policy. Methodology : We use fluid approximations to analyze the multi-class scheduling problem with ideas borrowed from convex optimization. These approximations are known to perform well for large systems, and we use simulations to validate our proposed policies for small systems. Results : We propose a multi-class time-in-queue policy that prioritizes both across customer classes and within each class using a simple rule and further show that most of the gains of such a policy can be achieved by deviating from within-class FCFS for at most one customer class. In addition, for systems with exponential patience times, our policy reduces to a simple priority-based policy, which we prove is asymptotically optimal for Markovian systems with an optimality gap that does not grow with system scale. Managerial implications : Our work provides managers ways of improving quality of service to manage parallel server queueing systems. We propose easy-to-implement policies that perform well relative to reasonable benchmarks. Our work also adds to the academic literature on multi-class queueing systems by demonstrating the joint benefits of cross- and within-class prioritization. Funding: A.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Approximately 11,000 alleged illicit massage businesses (IMBs) exist across the United States hidden in plain sight among legitimate businesses. These illicit businesses frequently exploit workers, many of whom are victims of human trafficking, forced or coerced to provide commercial sex. Academic/practical relevance: Although IMB review boards like Rubmaps.ch can provide first-hand information to identify IMBs, these sites are likely to be closed by law enforcement. Open websites like Yelp.com provide more accessible and detailed information about a larger set of massage businesses. Reviews from these sites can be screened for risk factors of trafficking. Methodology : We develop a natural language processing approach to detect online customer reviews that indicate a massage business is likely engaged in human trafficking. We label data sets of Yelp reviews using knowledge of known IMBs. We develop a lexicon of key words/phrases related to human trafficking and commercial sex acts. We then build two classification models based on this lexicon. We also train two classification models using embeddings from the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and the Doc2Vec model. Results: We evaluate the performance of these classification models and various ensemble models. The lexicon-based models achieve high precision, whereas the embedding-based models have relatively high recall. The ensemble models provide a compromise and achieve the best performance on the out-of-sample test. Our results verify the usefulness of ensemble methods for building robust models to detect risk factors of human trafficking in reviews on open websites like Yelp. Managerial implications : The proposed models can save countless hours in IMB investigations by automatically sorting through large quantities of data to flag potential illicit activity, eliminating the need for manual screening of these reviews by law enforcement and other stakeholders.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Participant retention is one of the significant issues faced by clinical studies. This paper analyzes the economic impact of combining two mechanisms (monetary payments to participants and effort exerted during a clinical study) observed in practice to improve retention. Methodology/results : Given an incentive scheme, under full information and information asymmetry regarding participants’ characteristics, we model the problem of identifying optimal payment and effort to improve retention for a clinical study using a nonlinear integer program. We propose polynomial-time algorithms to solve the problem under full information for a participant-specific linear payment scheme and two commonly observed incentive schemes: Fixed Payment (FP) and Logistics Reimbursement (RE). We also provide exact methods to solve the problem under information asymmetry for the FP and RE schemes. We conduct a comprehensive computational study to gain insights into the relative performance of these schemes. Under full information, the participant-specific scheme can reduce the retention cost by about 46%, on average, compared with that under the RE and FP schemes. Information asymmetry causes the RE scheme to be more favorable than the FP scheme in a wider variety of clinical studies. Further, the value of acquiring participants’ characteristics information is significant under the FP scheme compared with that under the RE scheme. Managerial implications : The determination of monetary payments is ad hoc in practice. Further, an economic analysis of the two mechanisms for improving retention in clinical studies is absent. Given the participants and the clinical study characteristics under full information and information asymmetry, our analysis enables a decision maker to identify an optimum incentive scheme, monetary payment, and effort level for improving retention. Further, our analysis allows a clinical study decision maker to assess budget requirements to improve retention and adapt the incentive payments to Institutional Review Board guidelines, if any.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic poses a series of unprecedented challenges, including predicting new cases and deaths, understanding true prevalence beyond what tests are able to detect, and allocating different vaccines across various regions. In this paper, we describe our efforts to tackle these issues and explore the impact on combating the pandemic in terms of case and death prediction, true prevalence, and fair vaccine distribution. Methodology/results : We present the methods we developed for predicting cases and deaths using a novel machine-learning-based aggregation method to create a single prediction that we call MIT-Cassandra. We further incorporate COVID-19 case prediction to determine true prevalence and incorporate this prevalence into an optimization model for efficiently and fairly managing the operations of vaccine allocation. We study the trade-offs of vaccine allocation between different regions and age groups, as well as first- and second-dose distribution of different vaccines. This also allows us to provide insights into how prevalence and exposure of the disease in different parts of the population can affect the distribution of different vaccine doses in a fair way. Managerial implications : MIT-Cassandra is currently being used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is consistently among the best-performing methods in terms of accuracy, often ranking at the top. In addition, our work has been helping decision makers by predicting how cases and true prevalence of COVID-19 will progress over the next few months in different regions and utilizing the knowledge for vaccine distribution under various operational constraints.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Under the prevailing fee-for-service (FFS) payments, hospitals receive a fixed payment, whereas physicians receive separate fees for each treatment or procedure performed for a given diagnosis. Under FFS, incentives of hospitals and physicians are misaligned, leading to large inefficiencies. Bundled payments (BP), an alternative to FFS unifying payments to the hospital and physicians, are expected to encourage care coordination and reduce ever increasing healthcare costs. However, as hospitals differ in their relationships with physicians in influencing care (level of physician integration), the expected effects of bundling in hospital systems with a varying level of physician integration remains unclear. Academic/practical relevance : There is a lack of both academic and practical understanding of hospitals’ and physicians’ bundling incentives. Our study builds on and expands the recent operations management literature on alternative payment models. Methodology : We formulate game-theoretic models to study (1) the impact of the level of integration between the hospital and physicians in the uptake of BP and (2) the consequences of bundling with respect to overall care quality and costs/savings across the spectrum of integration levels. Results : We find that (1) hospitals with low to moderate levels of physician integration have more incentives to bundle as compared with hospitals with high physician integration; (2) to engage physicians, hospitals need to financially incentivize them, a mechanism that was not available in traditional FFS-based payment models; (3) when feasible, BP is expected to reduce care intensity, and this reduction in care intensity is expected to result in quality improvement and cost savings in hospital systems with low to moderate level of physician integration; (4) however, when bundling happens in hospital systems with a relatively higher level of physician integration, BP may lead to underprovisioning of care and ultimately quality reduction; (5) in an environment where hospitals are also held accountable for quality, the incentives for bundling will be higher for involved parties, yet quality vulnerabilities due to bundling can be exacerbated. Managerial implications : Our findings have important managerial implications for policy makers, payers such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and hospitals: (1) policy makers and payers should be aware of and account for potential negative effects of current BP design on a subset of hospital systems, including a possible quality reduction; (2) in deciding whether to enroll in BP, hospitals should consider their level of physician integration and possible implications for quality. Based on our findings, we expect that a widespread use of BP may trigger further market concentration via hospital mergers or service-line closures.

Methodology : Leveraging a topic modeling technique and network analysis, we provide insight into how BA topics change over time. Results : We provide an in-depth analysis of 320 articles from the University of Texas at Dallas journal list and a basic topic model and network analyses for an additional 6,515 relevant articles from PubMed published in top-tier journals across 69 medical subcategories. Our study bridges research in operations management, information systems, healthcare, and analytics by providing a definition of BA in healthcare and a road map for future research. Managerial implications : Our study provides a single source of information into operations- and analytics-related issues, such as wait times, admissions, hospital performance, etc., that scholars and administrators might use to rethink how specific processes are handled in hospitals. In addition, this work highlights how operations management research has addressed clinically important issues such as patient satisfaction, doctor ratings, readmission rates, mortality, efficiency, cost of care, and compliance with protocols of care, as all are represented in our sample.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Mobile money systems—platforms built and managed by mobile network platform operators (MMPOs) to allow money to be stored as digital currency—connect millions of poor and “unbanked” people to the formal financial system. Unfortunately, low service levels because of the suboptimal management of cash and digital currency (e-float) inventory impede the development of these ecosystems. Accordingly, we seek to answer the question of how agents should manage inventories of cash and e-float. Academic/practical relevance : This paper extends inventory theory to the mobile money context, unique in that sales of cash generate inventory of e-float and vice versa. In doing so, we address a key pain point for an emerging sector that improves lives at the base of the pyramid. Methodology : We develop an analytical heuristic to determine initial stocking levels for cash and e-float and analyze its performance on simulated and actual data. Results : By partnering with an MMPO, we tested the performance of the heuristic inventory policy with data from more than 35 million transactions. The heuristic captured 99.9998% of the optimal profit on simulated data and, on actual data, we found that following the recommendations could increase agents’ profits by an average of 15.4%. Managerial implications : We develop a pragmatic inventory policy that performs nearly optimally. We also analyze under which conditions the performance deteriorates and examine heterogeneity among agents with respect to the heuristic’s impact on their performance. Thus, we equip MMPOs with guidance as to whom to target and how. By contributing to service level and profit improvements, this work can make mobile money a more effective financial inclusion tool in the developing world as well as improve the livelihoods of agents.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We ask whether and how a charitable organization’s front-line staff members can be effectively positioned to encourage donors to donate more (in compliance with the eligibility rules) during their in-person interactions. Academic/practical relevance : Specifically, we consider how charitable organizations can use microlevel data on worker-donor interactions to improve donation outcomes, via understanding of workers’ experiences and donors’ characteristics. Methodology : Using a unique data set at the worker-donor interaction level, we analyze the role of nurses’ experiences in driving charitable productivity and explore the downstream effects of the donation volume outcome. Results : We find that the effect of the charitable worker on charitable productivity strongly depends on the worker’s experiences that entail sharing knowledge about a donor’s donation options, rather than the worker’s experiences that are primarily focused on collecting donations. Moreover, worker experience can encourage donors that have lower self-efficacy over performing their donation to choose higher donation volumes. A worker’s experience with donors with lower self-efficacy furthermore benefits charitable productivity when interacting with those donors. Higher donations induced by an experienced worker from the previous session are correlated with higher donation volumes in the focal session if the donor returns to donate. Managerial implications : When taking the insights on staff-donor interactions into account, improved matching between workers and donors can provide economically significant benefits for the blood bank. Understanding worker experience in the staff-donor interactions and leveraging big data in staffing decisions can help charitable organizations improve their productivity simply from the personnel end.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a revenue management problem that arises from the selling of high-speed train tickets in China. Compared with traditional network revenue management problems, the new feature of our problem is the assign-to-seat restriction. That is, each request, if accepted, must be assigned instantly to a single seat throughout the whole journey, and later adjustment is not allowed. When making decisions, the seller needs to track not only the total seat capacity available, but also the status of each seat. Methodology/results : We build a modified network revenue management model for this problem. First, we study a static problem in which all requests are given. Although the problem is NP-hard in general, we identify conditions for solvability in polynomial time and propose efficient approximation algorithms for general cases. We then introduce a bid-price control policy based on a novel maximal sequence principle. This policy accommodates nonlinearity in bid prices and, as a result, yields a more accurate approximation of the value function than a traditional bid-price control policy does. Finally, we combine a dynamic view of the maximal sequence with the static solution of a primal problem to propose a “re-solving a dynamic primal” policy that can achieve uniformly bounded revenue loss under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data document the advantage of our proposed policies on resource-allocation efficiency. Managerial implications : The results of this study reveal connections between our problem and traditional network revenue management problems. Particularly, we demonstrate that by adaptively using our proposed methods, the impact of the assign-to-seat restriction becomes limited both in theory and practice. Funding: S.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online retailers often receive customer orders comprising several products of differing origins. To fulfill these orders, retailers must ship multiple parcels from different locations and—unless they are grouped somewhere along the supply chain—these may reach the customer’s doorstep one by one. Academic/practical relevance : We conjecture here that receiving products sequentially instead of all together affects a consumer’s reaction to her purchases, possibly influencing—for good or ill—her decision to return products, as well as her overall service satisfaction. We use two-year granular data from an online fashion marketplace to test this hypothesis and characterize consumer behavioral responses to delivery consolidation and examine how it impacts supply chain stakeholders. Methodology : To achieve causal inference, we exploit the fact that the couriers used by the focal marketplace gather together certain parcels for reasons related more to the timing of their arrival than their actual customers, thereby exogenously consolidating the delivery of some orders. We construct a balanced sample of matched twin multiproduct orders that are alike in all respects except their delivery: consolidated (all parcels delivered jointly) versus otherwise (split). Results : We find that delivery consolidation benefits the marketplace and all its suppliers. By eliminating the stress associated with split deliveries, delivery consolidation pleases consumers as it leads to fewer returns and higher overall satisfaction. Managerial implications : Delivering all products in an order together, even if later, reduces the probability of a return, which improves the financial performance of the marketplace and its suppliers and reduces reverse logistics. Our results suggest that in our context, delivery speed matters less than the convenience of receiving all ordered goods in a single delivery, and we provide directions for adapting logistics strategies accordingly. Our empirical findings also imply that the return decisions of multiple products purchased at once should not be considered to be independent. Finding tractable ways of modeling this feature will be necessary in further driving retail practice through theoretical research that accounts for the behavioral implications of delivery consolidation when optimizing fulfillment decisions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this work, we examine how ridesharing platforms affect changes in short-term vehicle purchasing. On the one hand, if the introduction of such platforms motivates owners to use the idle capacity of their existing vehicles to accrue rents, vehicle sales might fall. On the other hand, if the platform induces would-be drivers to purchase new vehicles in order to participate, vehicle sales might rise. Academic/practical relevance : Whereas operations management researchers have begun to broach this subject analytically, this work provides empirical evidence of the impact of ridesharing platforms on new vehicle ownership. Further, we assess heterogeneity in the effect across vehicle type and location. Methodology : We examine this tension using a unique data set of new vehicle registrations in China. In doing so, we exploit the variation in the timing of Uber entry using a difference-in-difference approach. Results : Findings suggest Uber entry is associated with a significant short-term increase in private new vehicle ownership, indicating that consumers actively change their stock of held resources to capture excess rents offered by the platform. These effects exclusively manifest among vehicle brands that qualify for the platform. Further, inasmuch as sales of vehicles with smaller displacement increase more than large-displacement vehicles, results indicate that the effect of Uber entry varies considerably across vehicle types. Finally, results indicate that the effects are stronger in locations where established public transportation options are weaker. Managerial implications : Results provide initial evidence that manufacturers can benefit from the emergence of the sharing economy, especially manufacturers whose products align with the needs of platform participants. For policy makers, our findings further undercut claims made by platforms that the individuals working on them are exploiting already existing resources, suggesting some form of nascent professionalism on the part of platform workers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Early research has documented significant growth in ride-hailing services worldwide and allied benefits. However, growing evidence of their negative externalities is leading to significant policy scrutiny. Despite demonstrated socioeconomic benefits and consumer surplus worth billions of dollars, cities are choosing to curb these services in a bid to mitigate first order urban mobility problems. Existing studies on the congestion effects of ride-hailing are limited, report mixed evidence, and exclusively focus on the United States, where the supply consists primarily of part-time drivers. Methodology/results : We study how the absence of ride-hailing services affects congestion levels in three major cities in India, a market where most ride-hailing drivers participate full time. Using rich real-time traffic and route trajectory data from Google Maps, we show that in, all three cities, periods of ride-hailing unavailability due to driver strikes see a discernible drop in travel time. The effects are largest for the most congested regions during the busiest hours, which see 10.1%–14.8% reduction in travel times. Additionally, we provide suggestive evidence for some of the mechanisms behind the observed effects, including deadheading elimination, substitution with public transit, and opening up of shorter alternative routes. Managerial implications : These results suggest that despite their paltry modal share, ride-hailing vehicles are substituting more sustainable means of transport and are contributing significantly to congestion in the cities studied. The reported effect sizes quantify the maximum travel time gains that can be expected on curbing them.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Expansions in product assortment by online retailers often engender operational challenges. In undertaking such expansions, retailers exercise a strategic choice between expanding assortment width or depth. Our understanding of how this choice affects the order fulfillment process is limited. Thus, we examine the impact of these dimensions of assortment strategy on order delivery timeliness. Academic/practical relevance : Order delivery timeliness is a critical measure of operational success in online retail. We contribute to theory and practice by adopting a multidimensional perspective of retailer assortment strategy and studying the relative impact of assortment width and depth on order delivery timeliness. Methodology : Employing a data set comprising more than 200 million orders, we study the effects of assortment strategy on delivery timeliness using an instrumental variable approach. We then utilize a two-stage model to estimate the impact of delivery performance on sales. Further, we employ a matched difference-in-differences and a novel Bayesian structural time-series model to confirm this relationship. Results : We find that assortment width has a greater negative impact on order delivery timeliness compared with assortment depth. A one-standard-deviation increase in assortment width increases average delivery times by 0.55 days. Further, we find this effect to be positively moderated (i.e., worsened) by the average size of orders and to be negatively moderated (i.e., improved) by the logistic service provider’s (LSP) experience. Finally, a one-day increase in delivery times for 10% of the orders results in a 2.7% reduction in sales. Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that online retailers focused on ensuring timely deliveries should be wary of widening product assortments, especially when facing larger average order sizes. We also find that experienced logistic service providers can help mitigate the dilatory effects of assortment width expansions. However, the benefits of experienced LSPs are limited for retailers deepening their assortments. History: This paper has been accepted as part of the 2018 MSOM Data Driven Research Challenge.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine the impact of logistics performance metrics such as delivery time and customer’s requested delivery speed on logistics service ratings and third-party sellers’ sales on an e-commerce platform. Academic/practical relevance : Although e-commerce retailers like Amazon have recently invested heavily in their logistics networks to provide faster delivery to customers, there is scant academic literature that tests and quantifies the premise that convenient and fast delivery will drive sales. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on whether this relationship holds in practice by analyzing a mechanism that connects delivery performance to sales through logistics ratings. Prior academic work on online ratings in e-commerce platforms has mostly analyzed customers’ response to product functional performance and biases that exist within. Our study contributes to this stream of literature by examining customer experience from a service quality perspective by analyzing logistics service performance, logistics ratings, and its impact on customer purchase probability and sales. Methodology : Using an extensive data set of more than 15 million customer orders on the Tmall platform and Cainiao network (logistics arm of Alibaba), we use the Heckman ordered regression model to explain the variation in customers’ rating of logistics performance and the likelihood of customers posting a logistics rating. Next, we develop a generic customer choice model that links the customer’s likelihood of making a purchase to the logistics ratings provided by prior customers. We implement a two-step estimation of the choice model to quantify the impact of logistics ratings on customer purchase probability and third-party seller sales. Results : We surprisingly find that even customers with no promise on delivery speed are likely to post lower logistics ratings for delivery times longer than two days. Although these customers are not promised an explicit delivery deadline, they seem to have a mental threshold of two days and expect deliveries to be made within that time. Similarly, we find that priority customers (those with two-day and one-day promise speed) provide lower logistics ratings for delivery times longer than their anticipated delivery date. We estimate that reducing the delivery time of all three-day delivered orders on this platform (which makeup ≈ 35% of the total orders) to two days would improve the average daily third-party seller sales by 13.3% on this platform. The impact of delivery time performance on sales is more significant for sellers with a higher percentage of three-day delivered orders and a higher spend per order. Managerial implications : Our study emphasizes that delivery performance and logistics ratings, which measure service quality, are essential drivers of the customer purchase decision on e-commerce platforms. Furthermore, by quantifying the impact of delivery time performance on sales, our study also provides a framework for online retailers to assess if the increase in sales because of improved logistics performance can offset the increase in additional infrastructure costs required for faster deliveries. Our study’s insights are relevant to third-party sellers and e-commerce platform managers who aim to improve long-term online customer traffic and sales.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Do the benefits of operational transparency depend on when the work is done? Academic/practical relevance : This work connects the operations management literature on operational transparency with the psychology literature on the peak-end effect. Methodology : This study examines how customers respond to operational transparency with parcel delivery data from the Cainiao Network, the logistics arm of Alibaba. The sample comprises 4.68 million deliveries. Each delivery has between 4 and 10 track-package activities, which customers can check in real time, and a delivery service score, which customers leave after receiving the package. Instrumental-variable regressions quantify the causal effect of track-package-activity times on delivery scores. Results : The regressions suggest that customers punish early idleness less than late idleness, leaving higher delivery service scores when track-package activities cluster toward the end of the shipping horizon. For example, if a shipment takes 100 hours, then delaying the time of the average action from hour 20 to hour 80 increases the expected delivery score by approximately the same amount as expediting the arrival time from hour 100 to hour 73. Managerial implications : Memory limitations make customers especially sensitive to how service operations end.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : For grocery retailers, managing perishable food that is nearing expiry is a major challenge. Donating food to food banks is socially responsible, as it improves local communities and reduces waste generation. It also diverts food to a secondary, quality-differentiated market. Academic/practical relevance : In this paper, we quantify the economic impacts of this secondary market for food by examining donation and pricing behaviors for competing retailers. Methodology : We use a structural model of price-discriminating oligopoly retailers to study the effect of food donations on store and category-level demand and equilibrium prices. Empirically, we estimate the food donation effect using a unique data set of food donations and sales for several categories of perishable foods across two major retail chains that compete in the same market. Results : The competitive effects of food donations follow from the price-discrimination logic. First, food donations create a direct demand effect. Donations raise the average quality of products on display, shifting demand curves inward and rotating them clockwise (e.g., more inelastic). Second, food donations create a market enhancement effect, softening price competition and raising equilibrium prices among competing retailers. Managerial implications : Food donations increase food prices and store profits, tying the socially responsible option to an economic benefit.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online platforms that provide on-demand services are often threatened by the phenomenon of leakage , where customer-provider pairs may decide to transact “off-platform” to avoid paying commissions to the platform. This paper investigates properties of services that make them vulnerable or resistant to leakage. Academic/practical relevance: In practice, much attention has been given to platform leakage, with platforms experimenting with multiple approaches to alleviate leakage and maintain their customer and provider bases. Yet, there is a current dearth of studies in the operations literature that systematically analyze the key factors behind platform leakage. Our work fills this gap and answers practical questions regarding the sustainability of platform. Methodology : We develop two game-theoretical models that capture service providers’ and customers’ decisions whether to conduct transactions on or off the platform. In the first (“perfect information”) model, we assume that customers are equipped with information to select their desired providers on the platform, whereas in the second (“imperfect information”) model, we assume customers are randomly matched with available providers by the platform. Results : For profit maximizing platforms, we show that leakage occurs if and only if the value of the counterparty risk from off-platform transactions exceeds a threshold. Across both models, platforms tend to be more immunized against leakage as provider pool sizes increase, customer valuations for service increase, their waiting costs decrease, or variability in service times are reduced. Finally, by comparing the degree of leakage between both settings, we find that neither model dominates the other across all parameter combinations. Managerial implications : Our results provide guidance to existing platform managers or entrepreneurs who are considering “platforming” their services. Namely, based on a few key features of the operating environment, managers can assess the severity of the threat of platform leakage for their specific business context. Our results also suggest how redesigning the waiting process, reducing service time variability, upskilling providers can reduce the threat of leakage. They also suggest the conditions under which revealing provider quality information to customers can help to curb leakage. Funding: J.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Initial product design decisions are critically important for mobile apps, which show a relatively short time from launch to peak usage, thus providing a narrow window for success and no time for course correction based on market reaction. Mobile apps are designed using a highly modular architecture based on software development kits (SDKs), with SDK choices being sequentially determined along three dimensions— multiplicity (total number of SDKs), compatibility (SDK co-occurrence frequency), and novelty (SDK degree of newness to the developer). We evaluate the consequence of these decisions on initial market success in the context of mobile gaming app design. Academic/practical relevance : The resulting conceptual framework aids developers in determining the modularity of digital product development. Methodology : We formulate an instrumental variables least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model to estimate relationships of interest using a proprietary data set extracted from the application programming interface server of a leading mobile apps intelligence firm. Results : We find a negative impact of SDK multiplicity on initial success. High SDK compatibility can mitigate this negative effect, whereas high SDK novelty can exacerbate the negative effect of multiplicity. Post hoc analysis shows that business-to-consumer (B2C) communication features can also mitigate this negative impact. Managerial implications : Prior product modularity research has predominantly focused on physical products or relied on single-dimensional modularity measures. Our study conceptualizes modularity as multidimensional and investigates how these multidimensional SDK-based modularity choices impact the performance of a key category of digital products—mobile apps. We demonstrate that increasing multiplicity, essential in certain markets, negatively affects initial success. However, firms can enhance SDK compatibility, reduce SDK novelty, and use B2C communication channels to mitigate this negative impact.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the economic rationale for certified pre-owned (CPO) programs and characterize the mechanism through which they influence secondary markets to create value for durable goods firms and consumers. Academic/practical relevance : Our study on understanding the market impact of CPO programs is highly relevant for industry given their prevalence in practice. Our work also contributes to the adverse selection literature in the context of the “lemons problem” by uncovering the mechanism underpinning CPO programs and how they improve market efficiency. Methodology : We use a game-theoretic durable goods model that captures CPO program features to identify how CPO programs improve market efficiency. We further investigate how CPO program size, as determined by program qualification criteria, plays a role in improving market efficiency. Results : We show that the mechanism underpinning CPO programs consists of two mutually reinforcing effects: a more effective segmentation of used product buyers through high- and low-quality product differentiation and a higher trade-in discount to used product owners. The former effect generates a higher revenue, which, in turn, allows for a higher trade-in discount. This translates to more high-quality products being traded in, more new products being purchased, and more used products being sold in the secondary market (i.e., increased market efficiency). We also show that these two effects are strengthened as the CPO program size increases. Finally, we test hypotheses deriving from our theoretical results in the context of the U.S. automotive industry. Our empirical findings are consistent with the conclusions of our theoretical work. Managerial implications : Durable goods firms can proactively manage their CPO programs by appropriately setting trade-in discounts and managing price discrimination between CPO and non-CPO products. CPO program qualification criteria can be used to alter CPO program size and, hence, the level of market efficiency improvement induced by these choices.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the rostering decisions—that is, the assignment of workers scheduled for a shift to units—of a long-term care facility. The facility’s objective is to minimize the monthly inconsistency level, a widely promoted quality metric representing the number of different caregivers working in each unit over one month. Methodology/results : We introduce simple rostering heuristics that prioritize either part-time or full-time workers and present a stochastic model of the repeated rostering problem to compare the performance of different strategies analytically. Our analysis shows that in order to minimize the inconsistency level, part-time workers should receive higher priority than full-time workers for assignment to their home units. We also establish an analytical upper bound for a threshold on the time horizon above which a policy giving assignment priority to part-time workers is guaranteed to outperform one giving priority to full-time workers. Using data from more than 15,000 shifts worked by nursing assistants at three nursing homes, we compare the actual rosters to the hindsight optimal consistency-maximizing schedules, demonstrating a significant opportunity for improvement. We then compare the performance of our rostering heuristics via trace-based simulation of the historical schedules. This reinforces the superiority of prioritizing part-time workers, yielding reductions in the inconsistency level between 20% and 30% compared with the historical rosters. Managerial implications : Contrary to popular guidance, our results show that managers should focus on part-time workers and assign them as consistently as possible. Even if some full-time workers are always assigned to their home units (because of preferences or work rules), assignment flexibility among the remaining full-time workers still enables significant improvements in the consistency of care. This flexibility among full-time workers helps because their higher work frequency tends to make a reassignment away from their home unit contribute less to inconsistency, because they are able to work multiple shifts in these nonhome units.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a two-sided market competition problem where two platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, compete on both supply and demand sides and study the impact of precommitments in a variety of practically motivated instruments on the equilibrium outcomes. Academic/practical relevance: We extend a set of classic oligopoly pricing results to account for two-sided competition under demand uncertainty. Methodology: We investigate multi-stage competition games. Results: We start with a sufficiently low demand uncertainty. First, we show that a precommitment made on the less competitive (demand or supply) side (on price or wage) has a less intense outcome than no commitment (i.e., spot-market price and wage competition). Then we show that, somewhat surprisingly, if the competition intensities of both sides are sufficiently close, the commission precommitment, where the platforms first compete in setting their commission rates and then their prices, is less profitable than no precommitment at all, and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that the capacity precommitment, in which the platforms first commit to a matching capacity and then set price and wage simultaneously subject to the precommitted capacity, leads to the most profitable outcome of all competition modes and extends the celebrated Kreps-Scheinkman equivalency to the two-sided market (without demand uncertainty). Then we extend the comparisons of various competition modes to account for a relatively high demand uncertainty. We show that the comparison between the spot-market price and wage competition and the commission precommitment stays the same as that with a sufficiently low demand uncertainty. In addition, the more flexible competition modes, such as no commitment and commission precommitment, benefit from higher demand uncertainty (with a fixed mean demand) because of their operational flexibility in response to the market changes. Further, a relatively high demand uncertainty may undermine or enhance the value of the wage precommitment, as opposed to no commitment. Finally, we also account for platforms with asymmetric parameters and matching friction and find that our main insights tend to be robust. Managerial implications : Our results caution platforms that a precommitment to the wrong instrument can be worse than no commitment at all. Moreover, the regulation of classifying gig workers as employees, despite many of its benefits to workers, may lead to a less competitive market outcome and, surprisingly, hurt gig workers by paying them lower wages.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we explore how a firm’s concern about profit distribution and the size of downstream firms in supply chains affect corporate social responsibility (CSR) investment strategy. Methodology/results : In a supply chain consisting of one supplier and one manufacturer, both players decide whether to invest to reduce CSR violations, and they negotiate over a wholesale price. Distributive comparison behavior makes the manufacturer compare the profit with his equitable payoff, which is determined by the supplier’s profit. Advantageous (resp. disadvantageous) inequality occurs when the manufacturer’s profit is higher (resp. lower) than the manufacturer’s equitable payoff. We compare this supply chain to the one without distributive comparison behavior. We find that when advantageous inequality occurs, or when neither inequality occurs and the manufacturer’s sensitivity to the supplier’s profit is low, the manufacturer’s distributive comparison behavior makes the manufacturer less (resp. supplier more) likely to invest in CSR, which we call negative (resp. positive) impacts of distributive comparison behavior; otherwise, it makes the manufacturer more (resp. supplier less) likely to invest. In most cases, the weak bargaining power of the small manufacturer leads to larger positive or smaller negative impacts of distributive comparison behavior. Also, the low efficiency of the small manufacturer to reduce CSR violations leads to smaller negative impacts of distributive comparison behavior. Managerial implications : Our results show that governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) should investigate firms’ distributive comparison behavior in supply chains. When downstream firms show the aversion to lower (resp. higher) profits than ones from upstream firms, the measures to monitor and support upstream (resp. downstream) firms’ CSR investments should be taken to avoid CSR violations. In the supply chains with small downstream firms, extra efforts should be made to induce firms’ distributive comparison behavior. Funding: M.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies an entrepreneur’s pricing strategy in a reward-based crowdfunding campaign under asymmetric product quality information. We propose two signaling mechanisms and investigate how entrepreneurs can leverage their pricing strategy to signal a high-quality project. Academic/practical relevance : This problem is relevant to practice, as asymmetric quality information is a significant concern in reward-based crowdfunding. High-quality entrepreneurs seek credible mechanisms to signal the quality of projects to customers. Methodology : We develop a stylized game-theoretic signaling model with funding and regular selling periods that captures asymmetric quality information between an entrepreneur and customers. Results : We propose a new theory on quality signaling in crowdfunding. We show that contingent access to the regular selling market after running a successful crowdfunding campaign allows high-quality entrepreneurs to signal their quality through low funding prices (one-price signaling). A high-quality entrepreneur can increase his funding price and still signal his high-quality level if he commits to the future regular selling price (two-price signaling). We show that the distinct feature of crowdfunding, that is, the probabilistic nature of crowdfunding, plays different roles in one- and two-price signaling. It is the driving force for the separating equilibrium in one-price signaling, and in two-price signaling, it affects how the entrepreneur should manipulate his funding and regular selling prices to reduce signaling cost. Managerial implications : Entrepreneurs should be mindful of pricing in funding and regular selling periods because it could play an essential role in signaling quality information. Our findings suggest practical tools for quality signaling in crowdfunding. We also investigate when price commitment is the most beneficial for a high-quality entrepreneur, looking for potential signaling mechanisms. Funding: W.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We seek to provide an interpretable framework for segmenting users in a population for personalized decision making. Methodology/results : We propose a general methodology, market segmentation trees (MSTs), for learning market segmentations explicitly driven by identifying differences in user response patterns. To demonstrate the versatility of our methodology, we design two new specialized MST algorithms: (i) choice model trees (CMTs), which can be used to predict a user’s choice amongst multiple options, and (ii) isotonic regression trees (IRTs), which can be used to solve the bid landscape forecasting problem. We provide a theoretical analysis of the asymptotic running times of our algorithmic methods, which validates their computational tractability on large data sets. We also provide a customizable, open-source code base for training MSTs in Python that uses several strategies for scalability, including parallel processing and warm starts. Finally, we assess the practical performance of MSTs on several synthetic and real-world data sets, showing that our method reliably finds market segmentations that accurately model response behavior. Managerial implications : The standard approach to conduct market segmentation for personalized decision making is to first perform market segmentation by clustering users according to similarities in their contextual features and then fit a “response model” to each segment to model how users respond to decisions. However, this approach may not be ideal if the contextual features prominent in distinguishing clusters are not key drivers of response behavior. Our approach addresses this issue by integrating market segmentation and response modeling, which consistently leads to improvements in response prediction accuracy, thereby aiding personalization. We find that such an integrated approach can be computationally tractable and effective even on large-scale data sets. Moreover, MSTs are interpretable because the market segments can easily be described by a decision tree and often require only a fraction of the number of market segments generated by traditional approaches.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a customer-to-customer (C2C) platform that provides an inspection service. Uncertain about product authenticity, a seller sells a product through the platform. Before purchasing, a buyer obtains a signal of the product authenticity from the product’s price set by the seller. The platform’s inspection service can detect a counterfeit with a probability. If the product passes the inspection, the platform sends it to the buyer and charges the seller a commission fee. Otherwise, the platform returns it to the seller and charges the seller a penalty fee. Methodology/results : We develop a two-stage game-theoretical model. In the first stage, the platform designs a contract specifying the commission and penalty fees. In the second stage, the seller signals the product authenticity by setting a price and the buyer decides whether to purchase it. This results in a contract design problem that governs a signaling game. We find that the effect of inspection is beyond merely detecting counterfeits. The inspection, even an imperfect one, changes the signaling game’s structure and incentivizes the seller whose product is likely authentic to sell through the platform. This can only be achieved by carefully choosing the commission and penalty fees. Moreover, a larger platform’s expected profit does not imply a larger commission fee or price in equilibrium. Under some mild conditions, the optimal commission increases but the optimal penalty decreases as the platform’s inspection capability improves. Managerial implications : The inspection service is not widely available among leading C2C platforms as it is considered imperfect and costly. Our study suggests that its benefit may be underestimated in practice. Moreover, the inspection can eliminate the seller’s information rent and generate more revenue for the platform. This paper provides guidance on how to set commission and penalty fees when the inspection service is provided. Funding: L.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the mechanism design problem of finding an optimal pay-as-bid mechanism in which a platform chooses an assortment of suppliers to balance the tradeoff between two objectives: providing enough variety to accommodate heterogeneous buyers, yet at low prices. Academic/practical relevance : Modern buying channels, including e-commerce and public procurement, often consist of a platform that mediates transactions. Frequently, these platforms implement simple and transparent mechanisms to induce suppliers’ direct participation, which typically results in pay-as-bid (or first-price) mechanisms where suppliers set their prices. Methodology : We introduce a novel class of assortment mechanisms that we call k -soft reserves ( k -SRs): If at least k suppliers choose a price below the soft-reserve price, then only those suppliers are added to the assortment; otherwise, all the suppliers are added. Results : We show the optimality of k -SRs for a class of stylized symmetric models to derive the intuition behind these mechanisms. Then, through extensive numerical simulations, we provide evidence of the robustness of k -SRs in more general and realistic settings.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : On-demand delivery has become increasingly popular around the world. Motivated by a large grocery chain store who offers fast on-demand delivery services, we model and solve a stochastic dynamic driver dispatching and routing problem for last-mile delivery systems where on-time performance is the main target. The system operator needs to dispatch a set of drivers and specify their delivery routes facing random demand that arrives over a fixed number of periods. The resulting stochastic dynamic program is challenging to solve because of the curse of dimensionality. Methodology/results : We propose a novel structured approximation framework to approximate the value function via a parametrized dispatching and routing policy. We analyze the structural properties of the approximation framework and establish its performance guarantee under large-demand scenarios. We then develop efficient exact algorithms for the approximation problem based on Benders decomposition and column generation, which deliver verifiably optimal solutions within minutes. Managerial implications : The evaluation results on a real-world data set show that our framework outperforms the current policy of the company by 36.53% on average in terms of delivery time. We also perform several policy experiments to understand the value of dynamic dispatching and routing with varying fleet sizes and dispatch frequencies.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the robust formulation of an inventory model with positive fixed ordering costs, where the unfulfilled demand is either backlogged or lost, the lead time is allowed to be positive, the demand is potentially intertemporally correlated, and the information about the demand distribution is limited. Methodology/results : We propose a robust cycle-based policy that manages inventory by dividing the planning horizon into nonoverlapping inventory cycles, where an order is placed at the beginning of each cycle. Our policy selects the lengths and order quantities for all inventory cycles to minimize the worst-case total cost incurred over the planning horizon. When the uncertain demand belongs to a general polyhedral uncertainty set, the decisions in our policy can be computed by solving linear programs (LPs) for the backlogging model with any lead time and the lost-sales model with zero lead time; however, the number of LPs that need to be solved grows exponentially in the length of the planning horizon. In the special case where the uncertain demand belongs to a box uncertainty set, the decisions in our policy can be computed using a dynamic programming (DP) recursion whose complexity grows polynomially in the length of the planning horizon. We also propose a one-cycle look-ahead heuristic to handle large problem instances with a general polyhedral uncertainty set. This heuristic can be applied for both the backlogging and lost-sales models with any lead time, and it only requires solving LPs whose number grows quadratically in the length of the planning horizon. Results from extensive computational experiments clearly show that both a rolling-cycle implementation of our policy and the one-cycle look-ahead heuristic have very strong empirical performance. Managerial implications : Our robust cycle-based policy and the one-cycle look-ahead heuristic are conceptually simple and can accommodate multiple realistic features in inventory management problems. They provide a very effective approach to robust inventory management, especially in the lost-sales setting. Funding: Y. Chen was supported by a start-up grant from Nanyang Technological University.

In each period, when the early-bird discount seat is stocked out, an early-bird customer who comes for the discounted seat either purchases the regular-price seat as a substitute (called buy-up substitution ) or simply leaves. Methodology/Results : The optimal inventory level of the discounted seats reserved for the early-bird sale is a critical decision for the airline company to maximize its revenue. The airline company learns about the demands for both discounted and regular-price seats and the buy-up substitution probability from historical sales data, which, in turn, are affected by past inventory allocation decisions. In this paper, we investigate two information scenarios based on whether lost sales are observable, and we provide the corresponding Bayesian updating mechanism for learning about demand parameters and substitution probability. We then construct a dynamic programming model to derive the Bayesian optimal inventory level decisions in a multiperiod setting. The literature finds that the unobservability of lost sales drives the inventory manager to stock more (i.e., the Bayesian optimal inventory level should be kept higher than the myopic inventory level) to observe and learn more about demand distributions. Here, we show that when the buy-up substitution probability is known, one may stock less, because one can infer some information about the primary demand for the discounted seat from the customer substitution behavior. We also find that to learn about the unknown buy-up substitution probability drives the inventory manager to stock less so as to induce more substitution trials. Finally, we develop a SoftMax algorithm to solve our dynamic programming problem. We show that the obtained stock more (less) result can be utilized to speed up the convergence of the algorithm to the optimal solution. Managerial Implications : Our results shed light on the airline seat protection level decision with learning about demand parameters and buy-up substitution probability. Compared with myopic optimization, Bayesian inventory decisions that consider the exploration-exploitation tradeoff can avoid getting stuck in local optima and improve the revenue. We also identify new driving forces behind the stock more (less) result that complement the Bayesian inventory management literature. Funding: Z.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a single-server queueing system where service quality is either high or low. The server, who knows its exact quality level, can signal this quality information to customers by revealing or concealing its queue length. Based on this queue disclosure action and the observed queue length in the case of a revealed queue, customers decide whether to join the system. Academic/practical relevance : The queue disclosure action is regarded as a signal indicating the service quality. Methodology : We develop a signaling game and adopt the sequential equilibrium concept to solve it. We further apply the perfect sequential equilibrium as an equilibrium-refinement criterion. Results : In our baseline model, where all of the customers are uninformed of service quality, the pure-strategy perfect sequential equilibrium is always a pooling one, except at several discrete values of market size (measured by the potential arrival rate). When the market size is below a certain threshold, both high- and low-quality servers adopt queue concealment; otherwise, both types of servers adopt queue revelation. We also consider a general scenario in which the market is composed of both quality informed and uninformed customers. Under this setting, when the server conceals the queue, we can fully characterize customers’ equilibrium queueing strategies and the corresponding effective arrival rates. The unique sequential equilibrium outcome is still a pooling one when the market size is either below a lower threshold or above an upper threshold. A separating equilibrium can occur only when the market size falls between two thresholds; under that circumstance, the uninformed customers can infer the server’s quality from its queue disclosure behavior. Managerial implications : Under separating sequential equilibria, uninformed customers can fully infer the quality information and thus behave in an informed way. Unlike studies where queue disclosure is not regarded as a quality signal, our study reveals that the signaling effect of queue disclosure increases (decreases) the effective arrival rate of the high-quality (low-quality) server and also increases the customers’ total utility when the server is of low quality.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the adherence to the recommendations of a decision support system (DSS) for clearance markdowns at Zara, the Spanish fast fashion retailer. Our focus is on behavioral drivers of the decision to deviate from the recommendation, and the magnitude of the deviation when it occurs. Academic/practical relevance : A major obstacle in the implementation of prescriptive analytics is users’ lack of trust in the tool, which leads to status quo bias. Understanding the behavioral aspects of managers’ usage of these tools, as well as the specific biases that affect managers in revenue management contexts, is paramount for a successful rollout. Methodology : We use data collected by Zara during seven clearance sales campaigns to analyze the drivers of managers’ adherence to the DSS. Results : Adherence to the DSS’s recommendations was higher, and deviations were smaller, when the products were predicted to run out before the end of the campaign, consistent with the fact that inventory and sales were more salient to managers than revenue. When there was a higher number of prices to set, managers of Zara’s own stores were more likely to deviate from the DSS’s recommendations, whereas franchise managers did the opposite and showed a weak tendency to adhere more often instead. Two interventions aimed at shifting salience from inventory and sales to revenue helped increase adherence and overall revenue. Managerial implications : Our findings provide insights on how to increase voluntary adherence that can be used in any context in which a company wants an analytical tool to be adopted organically by its users. We also shed light on two common biases that can affect managers in a revenue management context, namely salience of inventory and sales, and cognitive workload.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the setting where a retailer with many physical stores and an online presence seeks to fulfill online orders using an omnichannel fulfillment program, such as buy-online ship-from-store. These fulfillment strategies try to minimize cost while fulfilling orders within acceptable service times. We focus on single-item orders. Typically, all online orders for the item are sent to a favorable set of locations to be filled. Failed trials are sent back for further stages of trial fulfillment until the process times out. The multistage order fulfillment problem is thus an interplay of the pick-failure probabilities at the stores where they may be shipped from and the picking, shipping, and cancellation costs from these locations. Methodology : We model the problem as one of sequencing the stores from which an order is attempted to be picked and shipped in the most cost-effective way over multiple stages. We solve the fulfillment problem optimally by taking into account the changing pick-failure probabilities as a result of other online order fulfillment trials by casting it as a network flow problem with convex costs. We incorporate this as the second stage of a two-stage online order acceptance problem and generalize earlier results to the case with pick failures at stores. Results : We investigate the real-world performance of our methods and models on real order data of several of the top U.S. retailers that use our collaborating e-commerce solutions provider to optimize their fulfillment strategies. Academic/Practical Relevance : Our work enables retailers to incorporate pick failure in their order management systems for ship-from-store programs. Our new online order-acceptance policies that take into account pick failures can thus create significant savings for omnichannel retailers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Managers in ad agencies are responsible for delivering digital ads to viewers on behalf of advertisers, subject to the terms specified in the ad campaigns. They need to develop bidding policies to obtain viewers on an ad exchange and allocate them to the campaigns to maximize the agency’s profits, subject to the goals of the ad campaigns. Academic/practical relevance : Determining a rigorous solution methodology is complicated by uncertainties in the arrival rates of viewers and campaigns, as well as uncertainty in the outcomes of bids on the ad exchange. In practice, ad hoc strategies are often deployed. Our methodology jointly determines optimal bidding and viewer-allocation strategies and obtains insights about the characteristics of the optimal policies. Methodology : New ad campaigns and viewers are treated as Poisson arrivals, and the resulting model is a Markov decision process, where the state of the system is the number of undelivered impressions in queue for each campaign type in each period. We develop solution methods for bid optimization and viewer allocation and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to the key problem parameters. Results : We solve for the optimal dynamic, state-dependent bidding and allocation policies as a function of the number of ad impressions in queue, for both the finite horizon and steady-state cases. We show that the resulting optimization problems are strictly concave in the decision variables and develop and evaluate a heuristic method that can be applied to large problems. Managerial implications : Numerical analysis of our heuristic solution shows that its errors are generally small and that the optimal dynamic, state-dependent bidding policies obtained by our model are significantly better than optimal static policies. Our proposed approach is managerially attractive because it is easy to implement in practice. We identify the capacity of the impression queue as an important managerial control lever and show that it can be more effective than using higher bids to reduce delay penalties. We quantify potential operational benefits from the consolidation of ad campaigns, as well as merging ad exchanges.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In brick-and-mortar fashion retail stores, inventory stockouts are frequent. When a specific size of a fashion product is out of stock, the unmet demand might not be completely lost because of spillovers to adjacent sizes of the same style or to other styles. Little research has been done to study consumer response to stockouts of fashion products because researchers had limited access to proprietary data of fashion retailers and because it is challenging to estimate stockout-based demand spillover patterns using existing approaches due to the enormous number of stockkeeping units (SKUs) and frequent stockouts in fashion retail stores. To fill this void in the literature, we empirically estimate the stockout-based demand spillover effect in a fashion retail setting. Methodology/results : We obtain a large-scale data set from a fashion retail chain selling world-renowned sportswear brands. The retail stores in the sample are dedicated to products of a single brand. Using around 1.5 million granular and real-time sales and inventory records of 217 stores, 503 men’s footwear products, and 4,024 SKUs over a two-year period, we develop a difference-in-differences framework to estimate the stockout-based cross-size demand spillover effect. We demonstrate the validity of this framework by conducting a pretrend test and a placebo test. We find that roughly 51.7% of the unmet demand of an out-of-stock SKU spills over to adjacent sizes of the same style when they are in stock: 25.1% to the adjacent-larger size and 26.6% to the adjacent-smaller size. The cross-size demand spillover effect is larger in regular stores than in flagship stores, larger for casual sports shoes than for specialized sports shoes, and larger for low-price products than for high-price products. Adapting an existing attribute-based demand model to our setting, we estimate that roughly 20.2% of the unmet demand of an out-of-stock SKU spills over to different styles when they are in stock. Taken together, these estimations suggest that about 28.1% of the unmet demand of an out-of-stock SKU becomes lost sales. We further find that when stockouts are widespread among SKUs, stockout-based demand spillovers are significantly reduced, resulting in much increased lost sales. Managerial implications : First, we empirically quantify the stockout-based cross-size demand spillover effect and its impact on lost sales in a brick-and-mortar fashion retail setting. Second, our simulation analysis shows that incorporating the cross-size demand spillover effect into the sportswear retail chain’s proactive transshipment decision can substantially reduce its transshipment cost and improve its profitability.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Retailers have become increasingly interested in personalizing their products and services such as promotions. For this, we need new personalized demand models. Unfortunately, social data are not available to many retailers because of cost and privacy issues. Thus, we focus on the problem of detecting customer relationships from transactional data and using them to target promotions to the right customers. Academic/practical relevance : From an academic point of view, this paper solves the novel problem of jointly detecting customer trends and using them for optimal promotion targeting. Notably, we estimate the causal customer-to-customer trend effect solely from transactional data and target promotions for multiple items and time periods. In practice, we provide a new tool for Oracle Retail clients that personalizes promotions. Methodology : We develop a novel customer trend demand model distinguishing between a base purchase probability, capturing factors such as price and seasonality, and a customer trend probability, capturing customer-to-customer trend effects. The estimation procedure is based on regularized bounded variables least squares and instrumental variable methods. The resulting customer trend estimates feed into the dynamic promotion targeting optimization problem, formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer optimization model. Though it is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard, we propose a greedy algorithm. Results : We prove that our customer-to-customer trend estimates are statistically consistent and that the greedy optimization algorithm is provably good. Having access to Oracle Retail fashion client data, we show that our demand model reduces the weighted-mean absolute percentage error by 11% on average. Also, we provide evidence of the causality of our estimates. Finally, we demonstrate that the optimal policy increases profits by 3%–11%. Managerial implications : The demand model with customer trend and the optimization model for targeted promotions form a decision-support tool for promotion planning. Next to general planning, it also helps to find important customers and target them to generate additional sales.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online retailers disclose product availability to influence customer decisions as a form of pressure selling designed to compel customers to rush into a purchase. Can the revelation of this information drive sales and profitability? We study the effect of disclosing product availability on market outcomes—product sales and returns—and identify the contexts where this effect is most powerful. Academic/practical relevance : Increasing sell-out is key for online retailers to remain profitable in the presence of thin margins and complex operations. We provide insights into how their information-disclosure policy—something they can tailor at virtually no cost—can contribute to this important objective. Methodology : We collaborate with an online retailer to procure a year of transaction data on 190,696 products that span 1,290 brands and 472,980 customers. To causally identify our results, we use a generalized difference-in-differences design with matching that exploits one policy of the firm: it discloses product availability only for the last five units. Results : The disclosure of low product availability increases hourly sales—they grow by 13.6%—but these products are more likely to be returned—product return rates increase by 17.0%. Because returns are costly, we also study net sales—product hourly sales minus hourly returns—which increase by 12.5% after the retailer reveals low availability. Managerial implications : The positive effects on sales and profitability amplify over wide assortments and when low-availability signals are abundantly visible and disclosed for deeply discounted products whose sales season is about to end. In addition, we propose a data-driven policy that exploits these results by using machine learning to prescribe the timing of disclosure of scarcity signals in order to boost sales without spiking returns.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We present a data-driven study of the secondary ticket market. In particular, we are primarily concerned with accurately estimating price sensitivity for listed tickets. In this setting, there are many issues including endogeneity, heterogeneity in price sensitivity for different tickets, binary outcomes, and nonlinear interactions between ticket features. Our secondary goal is to highlight how this estimation can be integrated into a prescriptive trading strategy for buying and selling tickets in an active marketplace. Academic/practical relevance : We present a novel method for demand estimation with heterogeneous treatment effect in the presence of confounding. In practice, we embed this method within an optimization framework for ticket reselling, providing the ticket reselling platform with a new framework for pricing tickets on its platform. Methodology : We introduce a general double/orthogonalized machine learning method for classification problems. This method allows us to isolate the causal effects of price on the outcome by removing the conditional effects of the ticket and market features. Furthermore, we introduce a novel loss function that can be easily incorporated into powerful, off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms, including gradient boosted trees. We show how, in the presence of hidden confounding variables, instrumental variables can be incorporated. Results : Using a wide range of synthetic data sets, we show this approach beats state-of-the-art machine learning and causal inference approaches for estimating treatment effects in the classification setting. Furthermore, using National Basketball Association ticket listings from the 2014–2015 season, we show that probit models with instrumental variables, previously used for price estimation of tickets in the resale market, are significantly less accurate and potentially misspecified relative to our proposed approach. Through pricing simulations, we show our proposed method can achieve an 11% return on investment by buying and selling tickets, whereas existing techniques are not profitable.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Fulfillment flexibility, the ability of distribution centers (DCs) to fulfill demand originating from other DCs, can help e-retailers reduce lost sales and improve service quality. Because the cost of full flexibility is prohibitive, we seek to understand the value of partially flexible fulfillment networks under simple and effective fulfillment policies. Academic/practical relevance : We propose a general method for understanding the practical value of (partial) fulfillment flexibility using a data-driven model, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulations. Our method applies to settings with local fulfillment (i.e., order fulfillment from the originating DC) prioritization and possible customer abandonment, two features that are new to the fulfillment literature. We then apply this method for a large e-retailer. We also introduce a new class of spillover limit fulfillment policies with attractive theoretical and practical features. Methodology : Our analysis uses dynamic and stochastic optimization, applied probability, and numerical simulations. Results : We derive optimal fulfillment policies in stylized settings, as well as bounds on the performance under an optimal policy using theoretical analysis, to provide guidelines on which policies to test in numerical simulations. We then use simulations to estimate for our industrial partner that a proposed fulfillment network with additional flexibility equates to a profit improvement on the order of tens of millions of U.S. dollars. Managerial implications : We provide an approach for e-retailers to understand when fulfillment flexibility is most valuable. We find that fulfillment flexibility provides the most benefit for our collaborator when gross profits are high relative to fulfillment costs or centrally held inventory is low.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a practice-motivated multiperiod stochastic commodity procurement problem under price uncertainty with forward and spot purchase options. Existing approaches are based on parametric price models, which inevitably involve price model misspecification and generalization error. Academic/practical relevance : We propose a nonparametric, data-driven approach (DDA) that is consistent with the optimal procurement policy structure but without requiring the a priori specification and estimation of stochastic price processes. In addition to historical prices, DDA is able to leverage real-time feature data, such as economic indicators, in solving the problem. Methodology : This paper provides a framework for prescriptive analytics in dynamic commodity procurement, with optimal purchase policies learned directly from data as functions of features, via mixed integer linear programming (MILP) under cost minimization objectives. Hence, DDA focuses on optimal decisions rather than optimal predictions. Furthermore, we combine optimization with regularization from machine learning (ML) to extract decision-relevant data from noise. Results : Based on numerical experiments and empirical data, we show that there is a significant value of feature data for commodity procurement when procurement policy parameters are learned as functions of features. However, overfitting deteriorates the performance of data-driven solutions, which asks for ML extensions to improve out-of-sample generalization. Compared with an internal best-practice benchmark, DDA generates savings of on average 9.1 million euros per annum (4.33%) for 10 years of backtesting. Managerial implications : A practical benefit of DDA is that it yields simple but optimally structured decision rules that are easy to interpret and easy to operationalize. Furthermore, DDA is generalizable and applicable to many other procurement settings.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The main goal of many nonprofit or nongovernmental organizations is to increase the number of customers who receive service (i.e., service coverage) and social welfare. However, the limited number of employees, volunteers, and service locations results in long service wait. In addition, getting customers living in remote areas to receive services by traveling long distances is difficult. We propose an innovative distance-based service priority policy that would reduce the service waiting time for customers who must travel farther for the service by giving them higher service priority, thereby providing them with a new incentive to seek service. Methodology/results : Using a game-theoretic queueing model, we show that the proposed policy can significantly attract more customers to a service. The increase can be up to 50% compared with the ordinary first-come-first-served service discipline. The policy can also achieve higher social welfare, however, that may come at the cost of reduced customer welfare. We therefore propose a possible remedy for a social planner to coordinate welfare under such circumstance. It ensures all stakeholders, including the service provider, customers, and society, can benefit from the policy at the same time. Finally, we compare our distance-based service priority policy with two existing strategies from the literature—namely, the price discrimination strategy and the probabilistic priority strategy. Managerial implications : Our proposed policy can play a pivotal role in a nonprofit service provider’s mission to increase service coverage and social welfare, especially when customers’ travel costs to obtain service are significant. Furthermore, our policy may create fewer implementation and fairness concerns compared with related strategies. Funding: Z.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Customer joining behavior is of major concern for service systems where the service capacity is uncertain. Academic/practical relevance : It remains unclear whether customer inference of uncertain service capacity can lead to follow the crowd (FTC) behavior. Management can release capacity information, but how it affects system performance needs to be understood. Methodology : We use a single-server queue to analyze the joining behavior of customers who infer the actual service capacity based on the queue length upon arrival. We also characterize the impact of capacity information disclosure both analytically and numerically. Results : We find that when other customers’ tendency to join the service increases, a tagged customer can make more accurate inferences of service capacity based on queue length. This inference effect arises together with the congestion effect and can lead to FTC when it outweighs the latter. When multiple equilibria exist, we characterize the conditions under which the inference effect is significant at the aggregate customer level so that the joining equilibrium with a larger joining threshold is Pareto-optimal. Managerial implications : Management needs to be careful in setting the information disclosure policy, as the key problem parameters may affect its impact on system throughput and social welfare in opposite directions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Bargaining situations are ubiquitous in economics and management. We consider the problem of bargaining for a fair ex ante distribution of random profits arising from a cooperative effort of a fixed set of risk-averse agents. Our approach integrates optimal managerial decision making into bargaining situations with random outcomes and explicitly models the impact of risk aversion. The proposed solution rests on a firm axiomatic foundation and yet allows to compute concrete bargaining solutions for a wide range of practically relevant problems. Methodology/results : We model risk preferences using coherent acceptability functionals and base our bargaining solution on a set of axioms that can be considered a natural extension of Nash bargaining to our setting. We show that the proposed axioms fully characterize a bargaining solution, which can be efficiently computed by solving a stochastic optimization problem. We characterize special cases where random payoffs of players are simple functions of overall project profit. In particular, we show that, for players with distortion risk functionals, the optimal bargaining solution can be represented by an exchange of standard options contracts with the project profit as the underlying asset. We illustrate the concepts in the paper with a detailed example of risk-averse households that jointly invest into a solar plant. Managerial implications : We demonstrate that there is no conflict of interest between players about management decisions and that risk aversion facilitates cooperation. Furthermore, our results on the structure of optimal contracts as a basket of option contracts provides valuable guidance for negotiators.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online retailers are on a consistent drive to increase on-time delivery and reduce customer lead time. However, in reality, an increasing share of consumers places orders early. Academic/practical relevance : Such advance demand information can be deployed strategically to reduce costs and improve the customer service experience. This requires inventory and allocation policies that make optimal use of this information and that induce consumers to place their orders early. An increasing number of online retailers not only offer customers a choice of lead time but also, actively back-order missing items from a consumer basket. Methodology: We develop new allocation policies that commit to a customer order upon arrival of the order rather than at the moment the order is due. We provide analytical results for the performance of these allocation policies and evaluate their behavior with real data from a large food retailer. Results : Our policy leads to a higher fill rate at the expense of a slight increase in average delay. The analysis based on real-life data suggests a sizeable impact that should impact current best practices in online retail. Managerial implications: With the changing landscape in online retail, customers increasingly place baskets of orders that they would like to receive at a planned and confirmed moment in time. Especially in grocery, this has grown fast. This fundamentally changes the strategic management of inventory. We demonstrate that online retailers should commit early to customer orders to enhance the customer service experience and eventually, to also create opportunities for reducing the cost of operations.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We compare several approaches for generating a prioritized list of items to be counted in a retail store, with the objective of detecting inventory record inaccuracy and unknown out of stocks. Academic/practical relevance : We consider both “rule-based” approaches, which sort items based on heuristic indices, and “model-based” approaches, which maintain probability distributions for the true inventory levels updated based on sales and replenishment observations. Methodology: Our study evaluates these approaches on multiple metrics using data from inventory audits we conducted at European home and personal care retailer dm-drogerie markt. Results : Our results support arguments for both rule-based and model-based approaches. We find that model-based approaches provide versatile visibility into inventory states and are useful for a broad range of objectives but that rule-based approaches are also effective as long as they are matched to the retailer’s goal. We find that “high-activity” rule-based policies, which favor items with high sales volumes, inventory levels, and past errors, are more effective at detecting inventory discrepancies. The best policies uncover over twice the discrepancies detected by random selection. A “low-activity” rule-based policy based on low recorded inventory levels, on the other hand, is more effective at detecting unknown out of stocks. The best policy detects over eight times the unknown out of stocks found by random selection. Managerial implications: Our findings provide immediate guidance to our retail partner on appropriate methods for detecting inventory record inaccuracy and unknown out of stocks. Our approach can be replicated at other retailers interested in customized optimization of their counting programs.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Classical models of queueing systems with rational and strategic customers assume queues to be either fully visible or invisible, while service parameters are known with certainty. In practice, however, people only have “partial information” on the service environment, in the sense that they are not able to fully discern prevalent uncertainties. This is because assessing possible delays and rewards is costly, as it requires time, attention, and cognitive capacity, which are all limited. On the other hand, people are also adaptive and endogenously respond to information frictions. Methodology : We develop an equilibrium model for a single-server queueing system with customers having limited attention. Following the theory of rational inattention, we assume that customers optimize their learning strategies by deciding the type and amount of information to acquire and act accordingly while internalizing the associated costs. Results : We establish the existence and uniqueness of a customer equilibrium when customers allocate their attention to learn uncertain queue lengths and delineate the impact of service characteristics. We provide a complete spectrum of the impact of information costs on throughput and show numerically that throughput might be nonmonotone. This is also reflected in social welfare if the firm’s profit margin is high enough, although customer welfare always suffers from information costs. Managerial implication s : We identify service settings where service firms and social planners should be most cautious for customers’ limited attention and translate our results to advisable strategies for information provision and service design. For example, we recommend firms to avoid partial hindrance of queue-length information when a low-demand service is not highly valued by customers. For a popular service that customers value reasonably highly, however, partial hindrance of information is particularly advisable. Academic/practical relevance : We propose a microfounded framework for strategic customer behavior in queues that links beliefs, rewards, and information costs. It offers a holistic perspective on the impact of information prevalence (and information frictions) on operational performance and can be extended to analyze richer customer behavior and complex queue structures, rendering it a valuable tool for service design.

The regulations are intended to deliver minimum earnings while preserving the flexibility of the independent contractor model of work. Academic/practical relevance : This kind of regulation has the potential to impact marketplace stability, which we define as the ability of platforms to keep wages bounded while maintaining the current flexible (free-entry) work model. Methodology : We build a theoretical model to study the marketplace implications of this kind of regulation and identify precise conditions under which a utilization-based minimum earnings rule causes marketplace instability. We then calibrate our model using publicly available data, showing the extent to which the law can (or cannot) increase earnings while preserving both worker flexibility and marketplace stability. Results : For reasonable ranges of supply and demand elasticity, the law’s ability to increase earnings while maintaining the free-entry work model is quite limited, and even when earnings increases are achievable, they cause significant increases in driver idleness. Managerial implications : Given the law’s potential to cause instability, affected ride-hailing companies may need to respond to the law by reducing driver flexibility to limit supply.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Unexpected failures of equipment can have severe consequences and costs. Such unexpected failures can be prevented by performing preventive replacement based on real-time degradation data. We study a component that degrades according to a compound Poisson process and fails when the degradation exceeds the failure threshold. An online sensor measures the degradation in real time, but interventions are only possible during planned downtime. Academic/practical relevance : We characterize the optimal replacement policy that integrates real-time learning from the online sensor. We demonstrate the effectiveness in practice with a case study on interventional x-ray machines. The data set of this case study is available in the online companion. As such, it can serve as a benchmark data set for future studies on stochastically deteriorating systems. Methodology : The degradation parameters vary from one component to the next but cannot be observed directly; the component population is heterogeneous. These parameters must therefore be inferred by observing the real-time degradation signal. We model this situation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) so that decision making and learning are integrated. We collapse the information state space of this POMDP to three dimensions so that optimal policies can be analyzed and computed tractably. Results : The optimal policy is a state dependent control limit. The control limit increases with age but may decrease as a result of other information in the degradation signal. Numerical case study analyses reveal that integration of learning and decision making leads to cost reductions of 10.50% relative to approaches that do not learn from the real-time signal and 4.28% relative to approaches that separate learning and decision making. Managerial implications : Real-time sensor information can reduce the cost of maintenance and unplanned downtime by a considerable amount. The integration of learning and decision making is tractably possible for industrial systems with our state space collapse. Finally, the benefit of our model increases with the amount of data available for initial model calibration, whereas additional data are much less valuable for approaches that ignore population heterogeneity.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We investigate the participation, competition, and welfare at platforms that focus on customer-intensive discretionary services, such as healthcare, legal, and business consulting. Academic/practical relevance : Such platforms have recently emerged in practice to provide a venue for independent professionals and service seekers to match online. Methodology : We develop a strategic queueing model, where the platform sets the commission rate, upon which service providers decide participation, service quality, and price, and consumers make service acquisition. Results : First, our study reveals that with heterogeneous consumers, the participating service providers may engage in both price and service competitions if the number of them is either small or large. They compete for attractive consumers in the former and for market share in the latter. In these regions, more service providers joining the platform can result in a lower service price and a higher service quality. Whereas, if the number of participating service providers is intermediate, only service competition arises, so that a higher service quality is associated with a higher service price. Second, we find that in our main model, the platform may set the commission rate sufficiently high to limit the number of participating service providers, so as to prevent intense price competition. In contrast, if the platform also controls the service price, it may set a higher service price and a lower commission rate, which boosts the participation of service providers and improves their service quality. As a result, platform price intervention may not only benefit the platform and the service providers, but also the consumers. Managerial implications : These insights not only complement prior literature, but are also useful for understanding and the design of such service platforms in practice. Funding: X.

Academic/practical relevance : Our model explains the patterns of backer/donor arrival and pledging observed on crowdfunding platforms, such as Kickstarter. This model can be used to calibrate the revenue impact from using prespecified pledge levels or campaign durations. Methodology : We develop a theoretical model of the dynamics of the pledging process within the campaign duration, which employs a continuous-time, finite-horizon framework with two types of backer populations. Our model follows a diffusion-based approach and incorporates the structure of empirical observations. Results : We show that when campaign creators must follow an external standard for either the pledge level or the campaign duration, they should match low pledge levels with long campaign durations and high pledge levels with short campaign durations. We show that the optimal duration of a campaign, when not fixed by external constraints, depends on the composition of the backer population. Shorter campaigns are attuned to independent backers, and longer campaigns cater to herding backers. Managerial implications : Our analysis provides creators of crowdfunding campaigns with straightforward prescriptions for how to set the optimal pledge level and campaign duration. Platform managers could use the analysis to calibrate the arrival process of backers and creators’ campaign parameters. Funding: This work was supported by the Fishman-Davidson Center.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In today’s highly dynamic and competitive app markets, a significant portion of development takes place after the initial product launch via the addition of new features and the enhancement of existing products. In managing the sequential innovation process in mobile app development, two key operational questions arise. (i) What features and attributes should be added to existing products in successive versions? (ii) How should these features and attributes be implemented for greater market success? We investigate the implications of three different types of mobile app development activities on market performance. Academic/practical relevance : Our study contributes to the operations management literature by providing an empirically based understanding of sequential innovation and its market performance implications in mobile app development, an important industry in terms of size, scope and potential. Methodology : Using a novel data set of mobile apps in the Productivity category, we leverage text-mining and information retrieval techniques to study the rich information in the release notes of apps. We then characterize product development activities at each version release and link these activities with app performance in a dynamic estimation model. We also incorporate an instrumental variables analysis to substantiate our findings. Results : We find that greater update dissimilarity (i.e., dissimilarity of the features and attributes of a new update from those of previous updates) is associated with higher performance, especially in mature apps. We also find that the greater the product update market orientation (i.e., the greater the similarity of the focal firm’s new features and attributes with respect to the recent additions of its competitors), the higher is the market performance. This finding suggests that the market rewards those developers who have a responsive policy to their competitors’ product innovation efforts. Our results also suggest that a rapid introduction of updates dampens the potential market benefits that the mobile app developers might gain from market orientation. We find no evidence of a beneficial effect of product update scope (i.e., incorporating features and attributes from other product subcategories) on market performance. Managerial implications : Our study offers managerial insights into mobile app development by exploring the sequential innovation characteristics that are associated with greater market success in pursuing and implementing new features and attributes.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the problem of resolving ad hoc unpredictable congestion in environments where customers have private time valuations. We investigate the design of fair, efficient, budget-balanced, and implementable bidding mechanisms for observable queues. Academic/practical relevance : Our primary motivation comes from merging in algorithmic traffic, i.e., a driver wishing to merge in a relatively dense platoon of vehicles in a coordinated and efficient way, using intervehicle communication and micropayments, akin to an arriving customer trading for position in a single-server observable queue. Methodology : We analyze the performance of a mechanism where the queue joiner makes sequential take-it-or-leave-it bids from tail to head (T2H) of a platoon, with the condition that the vehicle can advance to the next position only if it wins the bid. This mechanism is designed so that it is implementable, balances the budget, and imposes no negative externalities. Results : We compared this mechanism with head to tail (H2T) bidding, which favors the merging driver but potentially causes uncompensated externalities. Assuming i.i.d. time valuations, we obtain the optimal bids, value functions, and expected social welfare in closed form in both mechanisms. Moreover, if the time valuation of the merging driver is not high, we show that the expected social welfare of T2H is close to a partial information social optimum and that the expected social welfare of H2T is lower than that of T2H as long as the platoon is not too short. Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that mechanisms based on sequential take-it-or-leave-it bids from T2H of an observable queue have good social welfare performance, even if the corresponding bids are not chosen optimally, as long as the time valuation of the arriving customer is not high. Nevertheless, the tension between individual incentives and social welfare seems hard to resolve, highlighting the role of platforms to enforce the cooperation of involved parties.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : It is common practice for firms to deploy strategies based on customer segmentation (by clustering customers into different segments) and price discrimination (by offering different prices to different customer segments). Price discrimination, although seemingly beneficial, can hurt firms in competitive environments. Academic/practical relevance : It is thus critical for firms to understand when to engage in price discrimination and how to support discriminatory pricing practices with appropriate inventory management strategies. This paper tackles this overarching question through operational lenses by studying the joint impact of price discrimination and the allocation of limited inventory across customer segments. Methodology : We develop a Bertrand competition game featuring capacity restrictions, quality differentiation, and customer heterogeneity. Results : We characterize (pure- or mixed-strategy) Nash equilibria for a single-stage game reflecting uniform pricing and for a two-stage inventory-price game reflecting discriminatory pricing along with endogenous inventory allocation. Managerial implications : We identify three sources of market friction in price competition enabling firms to earn higher profits: capacity limitations, quality differentiation, and customer heterogeneity. Price discrimination eliminates the market frictions from customer heterogeneity, but strategic inventory allocation restores (or strengthens) the market frictions from capacity limitations. As such, price discrimination is only beneficial when combined with optimal inventory allocation across segments. We discuss relevant real-world examples featuring regional price discrimination along with strategic inventory allocation, including fast fashion and vaccines. Otherwise, uniform pricing may outperform discriminatory pricing. Our results thus underscore the critical role of inventory allocation in the design of competitive pricing strategies.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The uncertainty around trade and foreign economic policy contributes to supply chain risk. Academic/practical relevance : Whether such policy uncertainty will bring some production back to the United States or only redistribute the global supply chains among foreign sources is theoretically ambiguous and warrants an empirical analysis. In this paper, we study the relationship between trade and foreign economic policy uncertainty and the supply chain networks of American firms. Methodology : We use firm-level global supply chain data, transaction-level shipping container data, and policy uncertainty indexes constructed from leading media outlets to study how policy uncertainty correlates with changes in supply chain networks. Results : When U.S. trade policy uncertainty rises, firms with majority domestic sales decrease their supplier base abroad, whereas firms with majority foreign sales increase the number of foreign suppliers. Firms also substitute among foreign countries in response to their respective economic policy uncertainty—shifting suppliers from countries with higher uncertainty to ones with lower uncertainty. Firms requiring more specific inputs, producing more differentiated products, having higher market shares, and more central to the production network are more sensitive to policy uncertainty. Managerial implications : Supply chain restructuring following higher policy uncertainty puts the market value at risk. Managers should consider customers’ locations when making global supply chain restructuring decisions. Funding: B.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Bleed–feed is a novel technology that allows biomanufacturers to skip intermediary bioreactor setups. However, the specific time at which bleed–feed is performed is critical for success. The process is stringently regulated, and its implementation involves unique tradeoffs in operational decision making. Our analysis formalizes the operational challenges related to bleed–feed decisions, and our results inform biomanufacturers and policymakers on the potential impact of this technology on current practice. Academic/practical relevance : Operations management (OM) methodologies have not yet been widely adopted in the biomanufacturing industry. This research presents one of the first attempts to demonstrate how OM can complement biomanufacturing to improve operational decisions. We present a practically relevant problem and a rigorous solution approach that is relevant to both OM and biomanufacturing. Methodology : We develop a finite-horizon, discrete-time Markov decision processes model and analyze the structural characteristics of optimal bleed–feed policies. Moreover, we characterize the behavior of the value function as a function of regulatory restrictions. As a salient feature, the MDP model captures both the biological dynamics of fermentation and the operational tradeoffs in biomanufacturing. Results : We show that optimal bleed–feed policies have a three-way control-limit structure under mild conditions that were validated with industry data. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the marginal benefits of bleed–feed diminish as additional bleed–feeds are performed. As a practically relevant benchmark, we consider a risk-averse heuristic and identify sufficient conditions for its optimality. Managerial implications : Our analysis (supported with an industry case study) shows that bleed–feed implementation can provide benefits. Real-world implementation at MSD resulted in an 82.5% improvement in the batch yield per setup (using one bleed–feed). We find that low-risk fermentation systems benefit the most from bleed–feed implementation. We also find that the performance gap between optimal policies and the risk-averse heuristic is higher when the failure risks or the critical biomass levels are lower.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The cost for developing a new drug ranged from $1 billion to more than $2 billion between 2010 and 2019. In addition to high development costs, the efficacy of the candidate drug, patient enrollment, the market exclusivity period (MEP), and the planning horizon are uncertain. Moreover, slow enrollment leads to increased costs, canceled clinical trials, and lost potential revenue. Many firms, hoping to detect efficacy versus futility of the candidate drug early to save development costs, plan interim analyses of patient-response data in their clinical trials. Academic/practical relevance : The problem for optimizing patient-enrollment rates has an uncertain planning horizon. We developed a continuous-time dynamic programming (DP) model with learning of a drug’s efficacy and MEP to assist firms in developing optimal enrollment policies in their clinical trials. We also established the optimality equation for this DP model. Through a clinical trial for testing a cancer drug developed by a leading pharmaceutical firm, we demonstrate that our DP model can help firms effectively manage their trials with a sizable profit gain (as large as $270 million per drug). Firms can also use our model in simulation to select their trial design parameters (e.g., the sample sizes of interim analyses). Methodology : We update a drug’s efficacy by Bayes’ rules. Using the stochastic order and the likelihood-ratio order of distribution functions, we prove the monotonic properties of the value function and an optimal policy. Results : We established that the value of the drug-development project increases as the average response from patients using the candidate drug increases. For drugs having low annual revenue or a strong market brand or treating rare diseases, we also established that the optimal enrollment policy is monotonic in the average patient response. Moreover, the optimal enrollment rate increases as the variance of the MEP decreases. Managerial implications : Firms can use the properties of the value function to select late-stage clinical trials for their drug-development project portfolios. Firms can also use our optimal policy to guide patient recruitment in their clinical trials considering competition from other drugs in the marketplace.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies an appointment system where a finite number of customers are scheduled to arrive in such a way that (1) the expected waiting time of each individual customer cannot exceed a given threshold; and (2) the appointment times are set as early as possible (without breaking the waiting time constraint). Methodology/results : First, we show that, under the service-level constraint, a prospective schedule can be obtained from a sequential scheduling approach. In particular, we can schedule the appointment time of the next customer based on the scheduled appointment times of the previous customers. Then, we use a transient queueing-analysis approach and apply the theory of majorization to analytically characterize the structure of the optimal appointment schedule. We prove that, to keep the expected waiting time of each customer below a certain threshold, the minimum inter-appointment time required increases with the arrival sequence. We further identify additional properties of the optimal schedule. For example, a later arrival has a higher chance of finding an empty system and is more likely to wait less than the duration of his expected service time. We show the convergence of the service-level-constrained system to the D/M/1 queueing system as the number of arrivals approaches infinity and propose a simple, yet practical, heuristic schedule that is asymptotically optimal. We also develop algorithms that can help system managers determine the number of customers that can be scheduled in a fixed time window. We compare the service-level-constrained appointment system with other widely studied systems (including the equal-space and cost-minimization systems). We show that the service-level-constrained system leads to a lower upper bound on each customer’s waiting time; ensures a fair waiting experience among customers; and performs quite well in terms of system overtime. Finally, we investigate various extended settings of our analysis, including customer no-shows; mixed Erlang service times; multiple servers; and probability-based service-level constraints. Managerial implications : Our results provide guidelines on how to design appointment schedules with individual service-level constraints. Such a design ensures fairness and incorporates the threshold-type waiting perception of customers. It is also free from cost estimation and can be easily applied in practice. In addition, under the service-level-constrained appointment system, customers with later appointment times can have better waiting experiences, in contrast to the situation under other commonly studied systems.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In what kinds of business method innovation do firms in the manufacturing and trade sectors engage? Does engaging in business method innovation create value for these firms? The present paper answers these questions using empirical evidence. Methodology/results : Using text analysis of business method patents, we show that business method innovation in the U.S. manufacturing and trade sectors is aimed primarily at improving the business operations that support the sales of tangible products—that is, how the firm targets customers, manages product delivery, or enhances the product through service offerings. We then evaluate the effect of having business method innovation, as evidenced by patents, on a firm’s value. Leveraging the exogenous shock of the State Street ruling, which first recognized business methods as a patentable category of innovation, we identify a set of firms that possess business method patents and a matched set of comparable firms without such patents. Then, using a difference-in-differences with firm fixed effects model on the matched sample, we show that the valuation of the former set of firms increased by 9% after State Street , as measured by Tobin’s q . We further show that (1) business method innovators in the manufacturing sector gained a 7% increase, whereas business method innovators in the trade sectors gained a 25% increase; and (2) only firms with broader innovation scope—that is, business method innovations covering the range of customer targeting, product delivery, and service support of products—experienced a significant (18%) value bump. Managerial implications : This research provides evidence that business method innovation in the manufacturing and trade sectors primarily involves innovating in business operations that support product sales.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Firms heavily invest in big data technologies to collect consumer data and infer consumer preferences for price discrimination. However, consumers can use technological devices to manipulate their data and fool firms to obtain better deals. We examine how a firm invests in collecting consumer data and makes pricing decisions and whether it should disclose its scope of data collection to consumers who can manipulate their data. Methodology/results : We develop a game-theoretic model to consider a market in which a firm caters to consumers with heterogeneous preferences for a product. The firm collects consumer data to identify their types and issue an individualized price, whereas consumers can incur a cost to manipulate data and mimic the other type. We find that when the firm does not disclose its scope of data collection to consumers, it collects more consumer data. When the firm discloses its scope of data collection, it reduces data collection even when collecting more data is costless. The optimal scope of data collection increases when it is more costly for consumers to manipulate data but decreases when consumer demand becomes more heterogeneous. Moreover, a lower cost for consumers to manipulate data can be detrimental to both the firm and consumers. Lastly, disclosure of data collection scope increases firm profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that a firm should adjust its scope of data collection and prices based on whether the firm discloses the data collection scope, consumers’ manipulation cost, and demand heterogeneity. Public policies should require firms to disclose their data collection scope to increase consumer surplus and social welfare. Even without such a mandatory disclosure policy, firms should voluntarily disclose their data collection scope to increase profit. Moreover, public educational programs that train consumers to manipulate their data or raise their awareness of manipulation tools can ultimately hurt consumers and firms. Funding: X.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We investigate variations of the bullwhip effect across foreign subsidiaries and explore how it is affected by various features of foreign subsidiaries. Academic/practical relevance : During the era of global supply chain restructuring, researchers and executives of multinational firms should understand variations of the foreign subsidiary’s bullwhip effect, given that its reduction is a key strategy for coordinating supply chains. Methodology : Our work is based on a balanced panel data set of Korean-owned subsidiaries that provides distinguishable information on subsidiary purchases. It enables us to estimate an alternative measure for the bullwhip effect by the ratio of purchase volatility to demand volatility and compare it with the traditional measure of the ratio of production volatility to demand volatility. Results : Our alternative measure differs significantly from the traditional measure and better reflects the prevalence of the bullwhip effect across foreign subsidiaries. Using this new measure, we find that the bullwhip effect is strongly affected by country-specific factors and foreign subsidiary-specific factors. These findings support not only previous analytical findings on the bullwhip effect but also provide new remedies to reduce the bullwhip effect. Managerial implications : Our study advises managers of multinational firms. First, although locating foreign subsidiaries in developing countries tends to reduce production costs, it could instead increase the bullwhip effect, especially for politically unstable countries or those with lower import penetration. Second, we provide empirical evidence that relocating a subsidiary to a country close to its main suppliers or to one that incurs lower transportation costs will reduce the bullwhip effect. Finally, deploying expatriate managers and wholly owning the subsidiary are recommended strategies to reduce the bullwhip effect of foreign subsidiaries.
