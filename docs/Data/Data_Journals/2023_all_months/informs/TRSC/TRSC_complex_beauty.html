  abstract     = {We consider the problem of performing condition-based maintenance on a set of geographically distributed assets via a single maintenance resource that travels between the assets’ locations. That is, we dynamically determine the optimal positioning of the maintenance resource and the optimal timing of condition-based maintenance interventions that the maintenance resource performs. These decisions are made as a function of the conditions of the assets and the current location of the maintenance resource to minimize total expected costs, which include downtime, travel, and maintenance expenses. This holistic approach enables us to study unique trade-offs, namely, maintaining an asset early if the maintenance resource is currently close by, or alternatively, optimally repositioning the maintenance resource or having it idle in key locations in anticipation of asset deterioration. We model the location of the maintenance resource and assets using a graph representation and the assets’ deterioration process as a discrete-time Markov chain. We formulate a Markov decision process to obtain the optimal policy for the maintenance resource (i.e., where to travel, idle, or repair). We explore the properties of the optimal policies (analytically and numerically) and how they are affected by the graph structure. Finally, we develop and analyze some implementation-friendly heuristic policies. Funding: This research was supported by Pitt Momentum Fund Award (3463) and NSF [Grant CMMI-2002681].

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of determining the strategic location of charging stations and their capacity levels under stochastic electric vehicle flows and charging times taking into account the route choice response of users. The problem is modeled using bilevel optimization, where the network planner or leader minimizes the total infrastructure cost of locating and sizing charging stations while ensuring a probabilistic service requirement on the waiting time to charge. Electric vehicle users or followers, on the other hand, minimize route length and may be cooperative or noncooperative. Their choice of route in turn determines the charging demand and waiting times at the charging stations and hence, the need to account for their decisions by the leader. The bilevel problem reduces to a single-level mixed-integer model using the optimality conditions of the follower’s problem when the charging stations operate as M/M/c queues and the followers are cooperative. To solve the bilevel model, a decomposition-based solution methodology is developed that uses a new logic-based Benders algorithm for the location-only problem. Computational experiments are performed on benchmark and real-life highway networks, including a new eastern U.S. network. The impact of route choice response, service requirements, and deviation tolerance on the location and sizing decisions are analyzed. The analysis demonstrates that stringent service requirements increase the capacity levels at open charging stations rather than their number and that solutions allowing higher deviations are less costly. Moreover, the difference between solutions under cooperative and uncooperative route choices is more significant when the deviation tolerance is lower.

  abstract     = {Free-floating vehicle sharing systems such as car or bike sharing systems offer customers the flexibility to pick up and drop off vehicles at any location within the business area and, thus, have become a popular type of urban mobility. However, this flexibility has the drawback that vehicles tend to accumulate at locations with low demand. To counter these imbalances, pricing has proven to be an effective and cost-efficient means. The fact that customers use mobile applications, combined with the fact that providers know the exact location of each vehicle in real-time, provides new opportunities for dynamic pricing. In this context of modern vehicle sharing systems, we develop a profit-maximizing dynamic pricing approach that is built on adopting the concept of customer-centricity. Customer-centric dynamic pricing here means that, whenever a customer opens the provider’s mobile application to rent a vehicle, the price optimization incorporates the customer’s location as well as disaggregated choice behavior to precisely capture the effect of price and walking distance to the available vehicles on the customer’s probability for choosing a vehicle. Two other features characterize the approach. It is origin-based, that is, prices are differentiated by location and time of rental start, which reflects the real-world situation where the rental destination is usually unknown. Further, the approach is anticipative, using a stochastic dynamic program to foresee the effect of current decisions on future vehicle locations, rentals, and profits. We propose an approximate dynamic programming-based solution approach with nonparametric value function approximation. It allows direct application in practice, because historical data can readily be used and main parameters can be precomputed such that the online pricing problem becomes tractable. Extensive numerical studies, including a case study based on Share Now data, demonstrate that our approach increases profits by up to 8\% compared with existing approaches from the literature.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the estimation and compression of ride demand from origin-destination (OD) trip event data. By representing the OD event data as a three-way tensor (origin, destination, and time), we model the data as a Poisson process with an intensity tensor that can be decomposed according to a Tucker decomposition. We establish and justify a specific form of nonnegative Tucker-like tensor decomposition that represents OD demand via K latent origin spatial factors and K latent destination spatial factors. We then provide a computational and memory efficient algorithm for performing this decomposition and demonstrate its use for real-time compression and estimation of OD ride demand. Two case studies based on New York City (NYC) taxi and Washington DC (DC) taxi were implemented. Results from the case studies demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in data compression and short-term forecast for ride demand. Furthermore, we found that the learned latent spatial factors are interpretable and localized to specific areas for both NYC and DC cases. Hence, this method can be used to understand OD trip data through latent spatial factors and be used to identify spatio-temporal patterns for OD trip and travel demand generation mechanism in general.

  abstract     = {An alternative approach for real-time network-wide traffic control in cities that has recently gained attention is perimeter flow control. Many studies have shown that this method is more efficient than state-of-the-art adaptive signal control strategies for heterogeneously congested urban networks. The basic concept of such an approach is to partition heterogeneous cities into a small number of homogeneous regions (zones) and apply perimeter control to the interregional flows along the boundaries between regions. The transferring flows are controlled at the traffic intersections located at the borders between regions so as to distribute the congestion in an optimal way and minimize the total delay of the system. The focus of current work is the mathematical formulation of the original nonlinear problem in a linear parameter-varying (LPV) form so that optimal control can be applied in a (rolling horizon) model predictive concept. This work presents the mathematical analysis of the optimal control problem as well as the approximations and simplifications that are assumed in order to derive the formulation of a linear optimization problem. Numerical simulation results for the case of a macroscopic environment (plant) are presented in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Results for the closed-loop model predictive control scheme are presented for the nonlinear case, which is used as “benchmark,” as well as the linear case. Furthermore, the developed scheme is applied to a large-scale microsimulation of a European city with more than 500 signalized intersections in order to better investigate its applicability to real-life conditions. The simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme compared with fixed-time control because all of the performance indicators are significantly improved.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the worldwide development of shared mobility, we investigate a vehicle routing problem with time windows and deadlines called the first-mile ridesharing problem (FMRSP). The FMRSP involves routing a fleet of vehicles, each servicing customers within specific time windows. The FMRSP generalizes the well-known vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), additionally imposing that each vehicle route arrives at the destination before the earliest deadline associated with the set of customers served by the route. The FMRSP is also related to the VRPTW and release dates, where in addition to time window constraints, a release date is associated with each customer defining the earliest time that the order is available to leave the depot for delivery. For the FMRSP, we present an exact method based on a branch-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm combining state-of-the-art techniques and an innovative pricing algorithm. The pricing algorithm is based on a bidirectional bucket graph-based labeling algorithm, in which the backward extension of a label is computed in a constant time. Effective dominance rules used to speed up the computation are also described. Extensive computational studies demonstrate that our proposed BPC algorithm can solve optimality-modified Solomon benchmark instances involving up to 100 customers and real-world instances involving up to 290 customers.

  abstract     = {We study a multimodal journey planning scenario consisting of a public transit network and a transfer graph that represents a secondary transportation mode (e.g., walking, cycling, e-scooter). The objective is to compute Pareto-optimal journeys with respect to arrival time and the number of used public transit trips. Whereas various existing algorithms can efficiently compute optimal journeys in either a pure public transit network or a pure transfer graph, combining the two increases running times significantly. Existing approaches, therefore, typically only support limited walking between stops by either imposing a maximum transfer distance or requiring the transfer graph to be transitively closed. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel preprocessing technique called unlimited transfers (ULTRA): given an unlimited transfer graph, which may represent any non–schedule based transportation mode, ULTRA computes a small number of transfer shortcuts that are provably sufficient for computing a Pareto set of optimal journeys. These transfer shortcuts can be integrated into a variety of state-of-the-art public transit algorithms, establishing the ULTRA-query algorithm family. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ULTRA improves these algorithms from limited to unlimited transfers without sacrificing query speed. This is true not just for walking, but also for faster transfer modes, such as bicycle or car. Compared with the state of the art for multimodal journey planning, the fastest ULTRA-based algorithm achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude.

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting of bus travel time and its uncertainty is critical to service quality and operation of transit systems: it can help passengers make informed decisions on departure time, route choice, and even transport mode choice, and it also support transit operators on tasks such as crew/vehicle scheduling and timetabling. However, most existing approaches in bus travel time forecasting are based on deterministic models that provide only point estimation. To this end, we develop in this paper a Bayesian probabilistic model for forecasting bus travel time and estimated time of arrival (ETA). To characterize the strong dependencies/interactions between consecutive buses, we concatenate the link travel time vectors and the headway vector from a pair of two adjacent buses as a new augmented variable and model it with a mixture of constrained multivariate Gaussian distributions. This approach can naturally capture the interactions between adjacent buses (e.g., correlated speed and smooth variation of headway), handle missing values in data, and depict the multimodality in bus travel time distributions. Next, we assume different periods in a day share the same set of Gaussian components, and we use time-varying mixing coefficients to characterize the systematic temporal variations in bus operation. For model inference, we develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to obtain the posterior distributions of model parameters and make probabilistic forecasting. We test the proposed model using the data from two bus lines in Guangzhou, China. Results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models that overlook bus-to-bus interactions, in terms of both predictive means and distributions. Besides forecasting, the parameters of the proposed model contain rich information for understanding/improving the bus service, for example, analyzing link travel time and headway correlation using covariance matrices and understanding time-varying patterns of bus fleet operation from the mixing coefficients.

  abstract     = {Many warehouses involved in e-commerce order fulfillment use robotic mobile fulfillment systems. Because demand and variability can be high, scheduling orders, robots, and storage pods in interaction with manual workstations are critical to obtaining high performance. Simultaneously, the scheduling problem is extremely complicated because of interactions between decisions, many of which must be taken timely because of short planning horizons and a constantly changing environment. This paper models all such scheduling decisions in combination to minimize order fulfillment time. We propose two decision methods for the above scheduling problem. The models batch the orders using different batching methods and assign orders and batches to pods and workstations in sequence and robots to jobs. Order picking and stock replenishment operations are included in the models. We conduct numerical experiments based on a real-world case to validate the efficacy and efficiency of the model and algorithm. Instances with 14 workstations, 400 orders, 300 stock-keeping units (SKUs), 160 pods, and 160 robots can be solved to near optimality within four minutes. Our methods can be applied to large instances, for example, using a rolling horizon. Because our model can be solved relatively fast, it can be used to take managerial decisions and obtain executive insights. Our results show that making integrated decisions, even when done heuristically, is more beneficial than sequential, isolated optimization. We also find that positioning pick stations close together along one of the system’s long sides is efficient. The replenishment stations can be grouped along another side. Another finding is that SKU diversity per pod and SKU dispersion over pods have strong and positive impacts on the total completion time of handling order batches.

  abstract     = {We consider a problem from the context of energy-efficient underground railway timetabling, in which an existing timetable draft is improved by slightly changing departure and running times. In practice, synchronization between accelerating and braking trains to utilize regenerative braking plays a major role for the energy efficiency of a timetable. Because deviations from a planned timetable may lead to unnecessarily high energy consumption during actual operation, we include operational uncertainties in our model to create a timetable that remains energy efficient, even if deviations from the nominal timetable occur. To solve the problem, we use a scenario expansion model in conjunction with a Benders decomposition approach. As an alternative to solving the Benders subproblems, we present a heuristic sparse cut that can be computed efficiently. The resulting sparse-cut heuristic produces high-quality solutions on a set of real-world instances stemming from the Nürnberg underground system, outperforming the integrated mixed-integer programming approach as well as the basic Benders approach. Additionally, we evaluate two static recovery strategies—shortening dwell times as well as shortening dwell and running times—to determine the cost and benefit of handling delays using a simple static rule. In our experiments, we are able to reduce the energy consumption by up to 9.4\% and confirm that delay recovery via shortening dwell times is an energy-efficient and effective way to increase punctuality at low cost in terms of energy.

  abstract     = {Operators who deploy large fleets of electric vehicles often face a challenging charge scheduling problem. Specifically, time-ineffective recharging operations limit the profitability of charging during service operations such that operators recharge vehicles off duty at a central depot. Here, high investment cost and grid capacity limit available charging infrastructure such that operators need to schedule charging operations to keep the fleet operational. In this context, flexible service operations, that is, allowing delayed or expedited vehicle departures, can potentially increase charger utilization. Beyond this, jointly scheduling charging and service operations promises operational cost savings through better utilization of time-of-use energy tariffs and carefully crafted charging schedules designed to minimize battery wear. Against this background, we study the resulting joint charging and service operations scheduling problem accounting for battery degradation, nonlinear charging, and time-of-use energy tariffs. We propose an exact branch-and-price algorithm, leveraging a custom branching rule and a primal heuristic to remain efficient during the branch-and-bound phase. Moreover, we develop an exact labeling algorithm for our pricing problem, constituting a resource-constrained shortest path problem that considers variable energy prices and nonlinear charging operations. We benchmark our algorithm in a comprehensive numerical study and show that it can solve problem instances of realistic size with computational times below one hour, thus enabling its application in practice. Additionally, we analyze the benefit of jointly scheduling charging and service operations. We find that our integrated approach lowers the amount of charging infrastructure required by up to 57\% besides enabling operational cost savings of up to 5\%.

  abstract     = {The distribution of passenger vehicles is a complex task and a high cost factor for automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). On the way from the production plant to the customer, vehicles travel long distances on different carriers, such as ships, trains, and trucks. To save costs, OEMs and logistics service providers aim to maximize their loading capacities. Modern auto carriers are extremely flexible. Individual platforms can be rotated, extended, or combined to accommodate vehicles of different shapes and weights and to nest them in a way that makes the best use of the available space. In practice, finding feasible combinations is done with the help of simple heuristics or based on personal experience. In research, most papers that deal with auto carrier loading focus on route or cost optimization. Only a rough approximation of the loading subproblem is considered. In this paper, we present two different methodologies to approximate realistic load factors considering the flexibility of modern auto carriers and their height, length, and weight constraints. Based on our industry partner’s process, the vehicle distribution follows a first in, first out principle. For the first approach, we formulate the problem as a mixed integer, quadratically constrained assignment problem. The second approach considers the problem as a two-dimensional nesting problem with irregular shapes. We perform computational experiments using real-world data from a large German automaker to validate and compare both models with each other and with an approximate model adapted from the literature. The simulation results for the first approach show that, on average, for 9.37\% of all auto carriers, it is possible to load an additional vehicle compared with the current industry solution. This translates to 1.36\% less total costs. The performance of the nesting approach is slightly worse, but as it turns out, it is well-suited to check load combinations for feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Eco-labels are a way to benchmark transportation shipments with respect to their environmental impact. In contrast to an eco-labeling of consumer products, emissions in transportation depend on several operational factors like the mode of transportation (e.g., train or truck) or a vehicle’s current and potential future capacity utilization when new orders are added for consolidation. Thus, satisfying eco-labels and doing this cost efficiently is a challenging task when dynamically routing orders in an intermodal network. In this paper, we model the problem as a multiobjective sequential decision process and propose a reinforcement learning method: value function approximation (VFA). VFAs frequently simulate trajectories of the problem and store observed values (violated eco-labels and costs) for states aggregated to a set of features. The observations are used for improved decision making in the next trajectory. For our problem, we face two additional challenges when applying a VFA, the multiple objectives and the “delayed” realization of eco-label satisfaction due to future consolidation. For the first, we propose different feature sets dependent on the objective function’s focus: costs or eco-labels. For the latter, we propose enhancing the suboptimal decision making and observed pessimistic primal values within the VFA trajectories with optimistic dual decision making when all information of a trajectory is known ex post. This enhancement is a general methodological contribution to the literature of approximate dynamic programming and will likely improve learning for other problems as well. We show the advantages of both components in a comprehensive study for intermodal transport via trains and trucks in Europe.

  abstract     = {The design of network-wide traffic management schemes or transport policies for urban areas requires computationally efficient traffic models. The macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is a promising tool for such applications. Unfortunately, empirical MFDs are not always available, and semi-analytical estimation methods require a reduction of the network to a corridor that introduces substantial inaccuracies. We propose a semi-analytical methodology to estimate the MFD for realistic urban networks without the information loss induced by the reduction of networks to corridors. The methodology is based on the method of cuts but applies to networks with irregular topologies, accounts for different spatial demand patterns, and determines the upper bound of network flow. Therefore, we consider both flow conservation and the effects of spillbacks at the network level. Our framework decomposes a given network into a set of corridors, creates a hypernetwork, including the impacts of source terms, and then treats the dependencies across corridors (e.g., because of turning flows and spillbacks). Based on this hypernetwork, we derive the free-flow and capacity branch of the MFD. The congested branch is estimated by considering gridlock characteristics and utilizing recent advancements in MFD research. We showcase the applicability of the proposed methodology in a case study with a realistic setting based on the Sioux Falls network. We then compare the results to the original method of cuts and a ground truth derived from the cell transmission model. This comparison reveals that our method is more than five times more accurate than the state of the art in estimating the network-wide capacity and jam density. Moreover, the results clearly indicate the MFD’s dependency on spatial demand patterns. Compared with simulation-based MFD estimation approaches, the potential of the proposed framework lies in the modeling flexibility, explanatory value, and reduced computational cost. Funding: G.

  abstract     = {Network optimization or network design with an embedded traffic assignment (TA) to model user equilibrium principle, sometimes expressed as bilevel problems or mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), is at the heart of transportation planning and operations. For applications to large-scale multimodal networks with high dimensional decision variables, the problem is nontrivial, to say the least. General-purpose algorithms and problem-specific bilevel formulations have been proposed in the past to solve small problems for demonstration purposes. Research gap, however, exists in developing efficient solution methods for large-scale problems in both static and dynamic contexts. This paper proposes an efficient gradient estimation method called Iterative Backpropagation (IB) for network optimization problems with an embedded static TA model. IB exploits the iterative structure of the TA solution procedure and simultaneously calculates the gradients while the TA process converges. IB does not require any additional function evaluation and consequently scales very well with higher dimensions. We apply the proposed approach to origin-destination (OD) estimation, an MPEC problem, of the Hong Kong multimodal network with 49,806 decision variables, 8,797 nodes, 18,207 links, 2,684 transit routes, and 165,509 OD pairs. The calibrated model performs well in matching the link counts. Specifically, the IB-gradient based optimization technique reduces the link volume squared error by 98\%, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) from 95.29\% to 21.23\%, and the average GEH statistics from 24.18 to 6.09 compared with the noncalibrated case. The framework, even though applied to OD estimation in this paper, is applicable to a wide variety of optimization problems with an embedded TA model, opening up an efficient way to solve large-scale MPEC or bilevel problems.

  abstract     = {Knowledge of the connected vehicle (CV) penetration rate is crucial for realizing numerous beneficial applications during the prolonged transition period to full CV deployment. A recent study described a novel single-source data penetration rate estimator (SSDPRE) for estimating the CV penetration rate solely from CV data. However, despite the unbiasedness of the SSDPRE, it is only a point estimator. Consequently, given the typically nonlinear nature of transportation systems, model estimations or system optimizations conducted with the SSDPRE without considering its variability can generate biased models or suboptimal solutions. Thus, this study proposes a probabilistic penetration rate model for estimating the variability of the results generated by the SSDPRE. An essential input for this model is the constrained queue length distribution, which is the distribution of the number of stopping vehicles in a signal cycle. An exact probabilistic dissipation time model and a simplified constant dissipation time model are developed for estimating this distribution. In addition, to improve the estimation accuracy in real-world situations, the braking and start-up motions of vehicles are considered by constructing a constant time loss model for use in calibrating the dissipation time models. VISSIM simulation demonstrates that the calibrated models accurately describe constrained queue length distributions and estimate the variability of the results generated by the SSDPRE. Furthermore, applications of the calibrated models to the next-generation simulation data set and a simple CV-based adaptive signal control scheme demonstrate the readiness of the models for use in real-world situations and the potential of the models to improve system optimizations.

  abstract     = {Emerging autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to bring about a revolution in both the automotive industry and transportation systems. Introducing AVs into the existing mobility system with human-driven vehicles (HVs) yields mixed traffic with the following new features: in-vehicle compensation on value of time for AV users, distinct road capacities for pure AV and HV flows, and stochastic road capacity for the inseparable AV-HV traffic pattern. In this paper, we aim to investigate equilibrium traffic dynamics for the morning commuting problem where AVs and HVs coexist in a transportation corridor by considering these new features, and also explore several novel mixed AV-HV traffic management strategies. The AV-HV traffic pattern could be either separable (i.e., pure AV flow and pure HV flow depart from home in different periods) or inseparable, depending on the user profile condition. In addition to deriving departure time equilibriums for scenarios with separable traffic flows, significant effort is put into the scenario with an inseparable AV-HV traffic pattern, where stochastic road capacity is taken into account. Based on these equilibrium traffic analyses, we propose and explore some new traffic management strategies, including AV certificate of entitlement management scheme for scenarios with separable traffic flows and departure-period management (DPM) scheme and lane management policies for the scenario with an inseparable AV-HV traffic pattern. Eligibilities for applying these strategies are analytically derived and extensively discussed, and numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate our theoretical findings and reveal the underlying impacts of road capacity randomness. Some lessons learned from the numerical experiments are (i) overlooking the impact of road capacity uncertainty will lead to an overestimation of system performance and even yield biased policymaking, (ii) the full dedicated-lane policy is the preferred option for the medium-level AV situation and partial dedicated-lane policies are more attractive choices for the early AV era or a market with a high AV share, and (iii) the DPM scheme could be a better substitute for partially dedicated-lane policies.

In a distributed queueing system, servers are shared among multiple queues, and they travel between queues in response to stochastic and time-varying demands. Although server traveling can improve service levels and shorten queue lengths, server routing and scheduling is complicated. We propose a dynamic programming model to solve this special routing-scheduling problem with time-varying demand, stochastic travel time, and queue-length constraints. In order to tackle large-scale practical instances, we design a dynamic programming-based rollout heuristic algorithm. Experiments on large-scale airports and scenic spots show that our approach reduces the total working periods of servers/employees without violating queue-length constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing benchmark methods and the practical schedules of a scenic spot.

Such tasks must be performed within time windows and require a team of workers with different skill levels. The goal is to find a feasible plan that minimizes the sum of the tasks completion times. We formalize a variation of the workforce scheduling and routing problem, integrating team formation, hierarchical skills with downgrading, multiple trips, and different execution modes. We propose a solution approach based on branch-and-price-and-check and test it on real-world instances from a major European hub airport. We propose a model based on the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition.

  abstract     = {Benders decomposition is one of the most applied methods to solve two-stage stochastic problems (TSSP) with a large number of scenarios. The main idea behind the Benders decomposition is to solve a large problem by replacing the values of the second-stage subproblems with individual variables and progressively forcing those variables to reach the optimal value of the subproblems, dynamically inserting additional valid constraints, known as Benders cuts. Most traditional implementations add a cut for each scenario (multicut) or a single cut that includes all scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel Benders adaptive-cuts method , where the Benders cuts are aggregated according to a partition of the scenarios, which is dynamically refined using the linear program-dual information of the subproblems. This scenario aggregation/disaggregation is based on the Generalized Adaptive Partitioning Method (GAPM), which has been successfully applied to TSSPs. We formalize this hybridization of Benders decomposition and the GAPM by providing sufficient conditions under which an optimal solution of the deterministic equivalent can be obtained in a finite number of iterations. Our new method can be interpreted as a compromise between the Benders single-cuts and multicuts methods, drawing on the advantages of both sides, by rendering the initial iterations faster (as for the single-cuts Benders) and ensuring the overall faster convergence (as for the multicuts Benders). Computational experiments on three TSSPs [the Stochastic Electricity Planning, Stochastic Multi-Commodity Flow, and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) Facility Location] validate these statements, showing that the new method outperforms the other implementations of Benders methods, as well as other standard methods for solving TSSPs, in particular when the number of scenarios is very large. Moreover, our study demonstrates that the method is not only effective for the risk-neutral decision makers, but also that it can be used in combination with the risk-averse CVaR objective.

  abstract     = {Our study introduces the hub network design problem with congestion, capacity, and stochastic demand considerations (HNDC), which generalizes the classical hub location problem in several directions. In particular, we extend state-of-the-art by integrating capacity acquisition decisions and congestion cost effect into the problem and allowing dynamic routing for origin-destination (OD) pairs. Connecting strategic and operational level decisions, HNDC jointly decides hub locations and capacity acquisitions by considering the expected routing and congestion costs. A path-based mixed-integer second-order cone programming (SOCP) formulation of the HNDC is proposed. We exploit SOCP duality results and propose an exact algorithm based on Benders decomposition and column generation to solve this challenging problem. We use a specific characterization of the capacity-feasible solutions to speed up the solution procedure and develop an efficient branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the master problem. We conduct extensive computational experiments to test the proposed approach’s performance and derive managerial insights based on realistic problem instances adapted from the literature. In particular, we found that including hub congestion costs, accounting for the uncertainty in demand, and whether the underlying network is complete or incomplete have a significant impact on hub network design and the resulting performance of the system.

A bilevel design and pricing model is proposed to capture the dynamic decision process between a biofuel producer as a Stackelberg leader and farmers as Stackelberg followers. The bilevel optimization model is transformed into a tractable single-level formulation by using optimality constraints. Other unique characteristics of our problem at hand include the incorporation of the harvesting time and frequency decisions in the biomass supply chain network design problem for the first time and consideration of the uncertainty in switchgrass yield in a robust optimization setting to take into account the risk-averse behavior of the farmers (suppliers). To efficiently solve the model, we propose a Benders decomposition algorithm enhanced by surrogate constraints, strengthened Benders cuts, and in-out cut loop stabilization. The numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm is significantly superior to the branch-and-cut approach of CPLEX in terms of run times and gaps.

  abstract     = {It is well-known that the cost of parcel delivery can be reduced by designing routes that take into account the uncertainty surrounding customers’ presences. Thus far, routing problems with stochastic customer presences have relied on the assumption that all customer presences are independent from each other. However, the notion that demographic factors retain predictive power for parcel-delivery efficiency suggests that shared characteristics can be exploited to map dependencies between customer presences. This paper introduces the correlated probabilistic traveling salesman problem (CPTSP). The CPTSP generalizes the traveling salesman problem with stochastic customer presences, also known as the probabilistic traveling salesman problem (PTSP), to account for potential correlations between customer presences. I propose a generic and flexible model formulation for the CPTSP using copulas that maintains computational and mathematical tractability in high-dimensional settings. I also present several adaptations of existing exact and heuristic frameworks to solve the CPTSP effectively. Computational experiments on real-world parcel-delivery data reveal that correlations between stochastic customer presences do not always affect route decisions, but could have a considerable impact on route cost estimates.

  abstract     = {In the traveling salesman problem with drones (TSP-mD), a truck and multiple drones cooperate to serve customers in the minimum amount of time. The drones are launched and retrieved by the truck at customer locations, and each of their flights must not consume more energy than allowed by their batteries. Most problem settings in the literature restrict the feasible truck routes to cycles (i.e., closed paths), which never visit a node more than once. Revisiting a node, however, may lower the time required to serve all the customers. Additionally, we observe that optimal solutions for the TSP-mD may retraverse arcs (i.e., optimal truck routes may contain the same arcs multiple times). We refer to such solutions as arc retraversing and include them in our solution space by modeling the truck route as a closed walk. We describe Euclidean instances where all the optimal solutions are arc retraversing. The necessity of arc retraversals does not seem to have been investigated in previous studies, and those that allow node revisits seem to assume that there always exists an optimal solution without arc retraversals. We prove that under certain conditions, which are commonly met in the literature, this assumption is correct. When these conditions are not met, however, excluding arc-retraversing solutions might result in an increase of the optimal value; we identify cases where a priori and a posteriori upper bounds hold on such increase. Finally, we prove that there is no polynomial-time heuristic that can approximate the metric TSP-mD within a constant factor, unless P = NP . We identify a (nonconstant) approximation factor explicitly when the truck can visit all the nodes.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new family of formulations with route-based variables for the split delivery vehicle routing problem with and without time windows. Each formulation in this family is characterized by the maximum number of different demand quantities that can be delivered to a customer during a vehicle visit. As opposed to previous formulations in the literature, the exact delivery quantities are not always explicitly known in this new family. The validity of these formulations is ensured by an exponential set of nonrobust constraints. Additionally, we explore a property of optimal solutions that enables us to determine a minimum delivery quantity based on customer demand and vehicle capacity, and this number is often greater than one. We use this property to reduce the number of possible delivery quantities in our formulations, improving the solution times of the computationally strongest formulation in the family. Furthermore, we propose new variants of nonrobust cutting planes that strengthen the formulations, namely limited-memory subset-row covering inequalities and limited-memory strong k -path inequalities. Finally, we develop a branch-cut-and-price (BCP) algorithm to solve our formulations enriched with the proposed valid inequalities, which resorts to state-of-the-art algorithmic enhancements. We show how to effectively manage the nonrobust cuts when solving the pricing problem that dynamically generates route variables. Numerical results indicate that our formulations and BCP algorithm establish new state-of-the-art results for the variant with time windows, as many benchmark instances with 50 and 100 customers are solved to optimality for the first time. Several instances of the variant without time windows are solved to proven optimality for the first time.

  abstract     = {In many major cities, metro lines constitute the backbone of urban public transport, providing an efficient and greener alternative to private mobility. An important feature that distinguishes metro lines from other public transport means, such as buses, is that metros are typically tightly resource constrained. The trains operating on a particular line are often specifically fitted for that line, making any capacity expansion extremely costly and time-consuming. Therefore, researchers and operators alike are seeking ways to make better use of existing resources. One possible way of doing so is by adapting timetables to forecasted demand while accounting for limited vehicle capacities. Thus, we consider a demand-driven nonperiodic timetabling problem for a two-directional metro line that minimizes the total passenger waiting time through the efficient scheduling of the available trains. Considering that passengers board trains using a well-mixed policy, we explicitly account for train capacities on a moment-to-moment basis. Last, we consider that trains are allowed to short turn. In this respect, we assume that trains must pass by a given station before short turning and are only allowed to idle after having short turned. We devise a polynomial time algorithm for assessing the total passenger waiting time generated by a given timetable and an effective lower bound that is evaluated in linear time. These are used in a variable neighborhood search algorithm, which is embedded in an iterated local search metaheuristic. Classical local search-based neighborhoods are not effective for our problem because they do not explicitly handle the vehicle scheduling decisions. To handle this challenge, we proposed three tailored neighborhoods. We validate our heuristic on the uncapacitated version of the problem. Considering a benchmark of 48 artificial instances with up to 20 stations, our heuristic achieved an average gap of 0.67\% and found eight new best solutions. We also validated our heuristic on three sets of instances based on realistic lines from Milan, Madrid, and Beijing. Furthermore, we demonstrate the operational advantages of our optimized timetables in the capacitated version of the problem by comparing them with regular timetables and with exact solutions obtained for the uncapacitated case. Furthermore, we conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to the capacity of the trains and investigate the impact of a priority boarding policy.

Although drone traffic management is mostly absent, as drone use increases, aerial conflicts are likely to also increase. This paper studies the problem of planning drone delivery service through an urban air traffic network space. The urban air traffic network is assumed to mostly be the airspace above existing roads and is modeled as a transportation network with multiple flight levels. Drone flights are modeled as individual trip requests with origins, destinations, and time windows. We present a novel integer linear programming formulation for this drone delivery service planning problem. The main contribution of this paper is developing a branch-and-price algorithm to solve the formulation, as the number of decision variables grows quickly with the problem size. We investigate three variations of branch-and-price, including branching on trajectory assignment variables, branching rules related to served requests, and a primal heuristic to quickly find integer feasible solutions. Numerical results show the limits of the integer linear programming formulation and the benefits of the primal heuristic in finding a good feasible solution.

The system under consideration adopts a technology that combines multiple drones to form a collective drone (c-drone) capable of transporting heavier items. The innovative concept is expected to add further flexibility in vehicle assignment decisions. An especially difficult challenge to address is the collaboration among drones because it requires temporal synchronization between their delivery tours. To better model the reality, we also consider that drone power consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight. We first develop a two-index mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation from which a simple branch and cut is developed to solve small-size instances to optimality. To efficiently handle larger problem instances, we propose a ruin-and-recreate metaheuristic with problem-tailored removal and insertion operators, in which an efficient move evaluation procedure based on the topological sort is designed to deal with the complexity of the synchronization constraints. Computational experiments demonstrate the validity of the developed MILP model and the performance of the proposed metaheuristic. Sensitivity analyses based on the classification and regression tree are performed to investigate the benefits of using c-drones and the important factors affecting the efficiency of the new transportation system.

As a result, the delivery capacity of the platform is uncertain. To reduce the uncertainty, the platform can offer a reward to couriers that agree to be available to make deliveries for a specified period of time, that is, to become scheduled couriers. We consider a scheduling problem that arises in such an environment, that is, in which a mix of scheduled and ad hoc couriers serves dynamically arriving pickup and delivery orders. The platform seeks a set of shifts for scheduled couriers so as to minimize total courier payments and penalty costs for expired orders. We present a prescriptive machine learning method that combines simulation optimization for off-line training and a neural network for online solution prescription. In computational experiments using real-world data provided by a crowdsourced delivery platform, our prescriptive machine learning method achieves solution quality that is within 0.2\%–1.9\% of a bespoke sample average approximation method while being several orders of magnitude faster in terms of online solution generation.

  abstract     = {Ride-pooling, which accommodates multiple passenger requests in a single trip, has the potential to substantially enhance the throughput of mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems. This paper investigates MoD systems that operate mixed fleets composed of “basic supply” and “augmented supply” vehicles. When the basic supply is insufficient to satisfy demand, augmented supply vehicles can be repositioned to serve rides at a higher operational cost. We formulate the joint vehicle repositioning and ride-pooling assignment problem as a two-stage stochastic integer program, where repositioning augmented supply vehicles precedes the realization of ride requests. Sequential ride-pooling assignments aim to maximize total utility or profit on a shareability graph: a hypergraph representing the matching compatibility between available vehicles and pending requests. Two approximation algorithms for midcapacity and high-capacity vehicles are proposed in this paper; the respective approximation ratios are 1 / p 2 and ( e − 1 ) / ( 2 e + o ( 1 ) ) p ln p , where p is the maximum vehicle capacity plus one. Our study evaluates the performance of these approximation algorithms using an MoD simulator, demonstrating that these algorithms can parallelize computations and achieve solutions with small optimality gaps (typically within 1\%). These efficient algorithms pave the way for various multimodal and multiclass MoD applications.

  abstract     = {In unsplittable network flow problems, certain nodes must satisfy a combinatorial requirement that the incoming arc flows cannot be split or merged when routed through outgoing arcs. This so-called no-split no-merge requirement arises in unit train scheduling where train consists should remain intact at stations that lack necessary equipment and manpower to attach/detach them. Solving the unsplittable network flow problems with standard mixed-integer programming formulations is computationally difficult due to the large number of binary variables needed to determine matching pairs between incoming and outgoing arcs of nodes with no-split no-merge constraint. In this paper, we study a stochastic variant of the unit train scheduling problem where the demand is uncertain. We develop a novel decision diagram (DD)-based framework that decomposes the underlying two-stage formulation into a master problem that contains the combinatorial requirements and a subproblem that models a continuous network flow problem. The master problem is modeled by a DD in a transformed space of variables with a smaller dimension, leading to a substantial improvement in solution time. Similar to the Benders decomposition technique, the subproblems output cutting planes that are used to refine the master DD. Computational experiments show a significant improvement in solution time of the DD framework compared with that of standard methods.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the distributionally robust fair transit resource allocation model (DrFRAM) under the Wasserstein ambiguity set to optimize the public transit resource allocation during a pandemic. We show that the proposed DrFRAM is highly nonconvex and nonlinear, and it is NP-hard in general. Fortunately, we show that DrFRAM can be reformulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) by leveraging the equivalent representation of distributionally robust optimization and monotonicity properties, binarizing integer variables, and linearizing nonconvex terms. To improve the proposed MILP formulation, we derive stronger ones and develop valid inequalities by exploiting the model structures. Additionally, we develop scenario decomposition methods using different MILP formulations to solve the scenario subproblems and introduce a simple yet effective no one left-based approximation algorithm with a provable approximation guarantee to solve the model to near optimality. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and apply them to real-world data provided by the Blacksburg Transit.

  abstract     = {In the e-commerce era, efficient order fulfillment processes in distribution centers have become a key success factor. One novel technology to streamline these processes is robot-assisted order picking. In these systems, human order pickers are supported by autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), which carry bins for collecting picking orders, autonomously move through the warehouse, and wait in front of a shelf containing a requested stock keeping unit (SKU). Once a picker has approached a waiting AMR and placed the requested SKU into the respective bin, AMR and picker may separate and move toward other picking positions. In this way, pickers continuously move between different waiting AMRs without having to return to the depot. This paper treats the coordination of multiple AMRs and multiple pickers to minimize the makespan. We present a heuristic method for the deterministic case that can handle the requirements of large e-commerce fulfillment centers and successfully solves instances with more than one thousand picking positions. Based on the obtained solutions, the performance of our picking system is compared with the traditional warehouse setup without AMR support and to another work policy using fixed pairings of picker and AMR per order. We find that largely improved makespans can be expected. In addition, we analyze the effects of stochastic picking times, speed differences between AMRs and pickers, and a zoning strategy. The ripple effect caused by stochastic picking times, in which a single delay may cascade through a tightly synchronized schedule and deteriorate picking performance, can be effectively mitigated by separating the workforce into smaller subgroups. Another important finding is that pickers and AMR should have approximately the same travel speed because slower AMRs deteriorate system performance. Finally, zoning slightly decreases the flexibility of the system and should be used if dictated by organizational reasons.

  abstract     = {In European air traffic management (ATM), it is an important decision how much capacity to provide for each airspace, and it has to be made weeks or even months in advance of the day of operation. Given the uncertainty in demand that may materialize until then along with variability in capacity provision (e.g., due to weather), Airspace Users could face high costs of displacements (i.e., delays and reroutings) if capacity is not provided where and when needed. We propose a new capacity sharing scheme in which some proportion of overall capacities can be flexibly deployed in any of the airspaces of the same alliance (at an increased unit cost). This allows us to hedge against the risk of capacity underprovision. Given this scheme, we seek to determine the optimum budget for capacities provided both locally and in cross-border sharing that results in the lowest expected network costs (i.e., capacity and displacement costs). To determine optimum capacity levels, we need to solve a two-stage newsvendor problem: We first decide on capacities to be provided for each airspace, and after uncertain demand and capacity provision disruptions have materialized, we need to decide on the routings of flights (including delays) as well as the sector opening scheme of each airspace to minimize costs. We propose a simulation optimization approach for searching the most cost-efficient capacity levels (in the first stage), and a heuristic to solve the routing and sector opening problem (in the second stage), which is N P -hard. We test our approach in a large-sized simulation study based on real data covering around 3,000 flights across Western European airspace. We find that our stochastic approach significantly reduces network costs against a deterministic benchmark while using less computational resources. Experiments on different setups for capacity sharing show that total variable costs can be reduced by more than 8\% if capacity is shared across borders: even though we require that no airspace can operate lower capacities under capacity sharing than without (this is to avoid substitution of expensive air traffic controllers with those in countries with a lower wage level). We also find that the use of different technology providers is a major obstacle to reap the benefits from capacity sharing and that sharing capacities across airspaces of the same country may instead be preferred.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to operate on mobility-on-demand (MoD) platforms because AV technology enables flexible self-relocation and system-optimal coordination. Unlike the existing studies, which focus on MoD with pure AV fleet or conventional vehicles (CVs) fleet, we aim to optimize the real-time fleet management of an MoD system with a mixed autonomy of CVs and AVs. We consider a realistic case that heterogeneous boundedly rational drivers may determine and learn their relocation strategies to improve their own compensation. In contrast, AVs are fully compliant with the platform’s operational decisions. To achieve a high level of service provided by a mixed fleet, we propose that the platform prioritizes human drivers in the matching decisions when on-demand requests arrive and dynamically determines the AV relocation tasks and the optimal commission fee to influence drivers’ behavior. However, it is challenging to make efficient real-time fleet management decisions when spatiotemporal uncertainty in demand and complex interactions among human drivers and operators are anticipated and considered in the operator’s decision making. To tackle the challenges, we develop a two-sided multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach in which the operator acts as a supervisor agent on one side and makes centralized decisions on the mixed fleet, and each CV driver acts as an individual agent on the other side and learns to make decentralized decisions noncooperatively. We establish a two-sided multiagent advantage actor-critic algorithm to simultaneously train different agents on the two sides. For the first time, a scalable algorithm is developed here for mixed fleet management. Furthermore, we formulate a two-head policy network to enable the supervisor agent to efficiently make multitask decisions based on one policy network, which greatly reduces the computational time. The two-sided multiagent DRL approach is demonstrated using a case study in New York City using real taxi trip data. Results show that our algorithm can make high-quality decisions quickly and outperform benchmark policies. The efficiency of the two-head policy network is demonstrated by comparing it with the case using two separate policy networks. Our fleet management strategy makes both the platform and the drivers better off, especially in scenarios with high demand volume.

  abstract     = {Connected technologies have engendered a paradigm shift in mobility systems by enabling digital platforms to coordinate large sets of vehicles in real time. Recent research has investigated how a small number of connected vehicles may be coordinated to reduce total system cost. However, platforms may coordinate vehicles to optimize a fleet-wide objective which is neither user nor system optimal. We study the behavior of optimized fleets in mixed traffic and find that, at small penetrations, fleets may worsen system cost relative to user equilibrium, and provide a concrete example of this paradox. Past a critical penetration level, however, optimized fleets reduce system cost in the network, up to achieving system optimal traffic flow, without need for an external subsidy. We introduce two novel notions of fleet-optimal mixed equilibria: critical fleet size for user equilibrium (CFS-UE) and critical fleet size for system optimum (CFS-SO). We demonstrate on the Sioux Falls and Pittsburgh networks that 33\% and 83\% of vehicles, respectively, must participate in the fleet to achieve system optimum. In Pittsburgh, we find that, although fleets permeate the network, they accumulate on highways and major arterials; the majority of origin-destination pairs are either occupied exclusively by users or by the fleet. Critical fleet size offers regulators greater insight into where fleet and system interests align, transportation planners a novel metric to evaluate road improvements, and fleet coordinators a better understanding of their efforts to optimize their fleet.

  abstract     = {Childhood vaccines play a vital role in social welfare, but in hard-to-reach regions, poor transportation, and a weak cold chain limit vaccine availability. This opens the door for the use of vaccine delivery by drones (uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs) with their fast transportation and reliance on little or no infrastructure. In this paper, we study the problem of strategic multimodal vaccine distribution, which simultaneously determines the locations of local distribution centers, drone bases, and drone relay stations, while obeying the cold chain time limit and drone range. Two mathematical optimization models with complementary strengths are developed. The first model considers the vaccine travel time at the aggregate level with a compact formulation, but it can be too conservative in meeting the cold chain time limit. The second model is based on the layered network framework to track the vaccine flow and travel time associated with each origin-destination (OD) pair. It allows the number of transshipments and the number of drone stops in a vaccine flow path to be limited, which reflects practical operations and can be computationally advantageous. Both models are applied for vaccine distribution network design with two types of drones in Vanuatu as a case study. Solutions with drones using our parameter settings are shown to generate large savings, with differentiated roles for large and small drones. To generalize the empirical findings and examine the performance of our models, we conduct comprehensive computational experiments to assess the sensitivity of optimal solutions and performance metrics to key problem parameters.

  abstract     = {Management of humanitarian logistics operations is one of the most critical planning problems to be addressed immediately after a disaster. The response phase covers the first 12 hours after the disaster and is prone to uncertainties because of debris and gridlock traffic influencing the dispatching operations of relief logistics teams in the areas affected. Moreover, the teams have limited time and resources, and they must provide equitable distribution of supplies to affected people. This paper proposes an adjustable robust optimization approach for the associated humanitarian logistics problem. The approach creates routes for relief logistics teams and decides the service times of the visited sites to distribute relief supplies by taking the uncertainty in travel times into account. The associated model allows relief logistics teams to adjust their service decisions according to the revealed information during the process. Hence, our solutions are robust for the worst-case realization of travel times, but still more flexible and less conservative than those of static robust optimization. We propose novel reformulation techniques to model these adjustable decisions. The resulting models are computationally challenging optimization problems to be solved by exact methods, and, hence, we propose heuristic algorithms. The state-of-the-art heuristic, which is based on clustering and a dedicated decision-rule algorithm, yields near-optimal results for medium-sized instances and is scalable even for large-sized instances. We have also shown the effectiveness of our approach in a case study using a data set obtained from an earthquake that hit the Van province of Turkey in 2011.

  abstract     = {The rise of on-demand mobility technologies over the past decade has sparked interest in the integration of traditional transit and on-demand systems. One of the main reasons behind this is the potential to address a fundamental trade-off in transit: the ridership versus coverage dilemma. However, unlike purely fixed systems or purely on-demand systems, integrated systems are not well understood; their planning and operational problems are significantly more challenging, and their broader implications are the source of a heated debate. Motivated by this debate, we introduce the dynamicity gap, a general concept that quantifies the attainable benefit of allowing (but not requiring) dynamic components in the response strategy to a multistage optimization problem. Although computing the dynamicity gap exactly may be intractable, we develop an analytical framework with which to approximate it as a function of problem input parameters. The framework allows us to certify the value of dynamism (i.e., a dynamicity gap greater than one) for certain combinations of problem input parameters. We showcase our approach with two sets of computational experiments, from which we gain both qualitative and quantitative insights about the settings in which the integration of transit and on-demand systems may certifiably be a worthwhile investment.

  abstract     = {Shared mobility services involving electric autonomous shuttles have increasingly been implemented in recent years. Because of various restrictions, these services are currently offered on fixed circuits and operated with fixed schedules. This study introduces a service variant with flexible stopping patterns and schedules. Specifically, in the electric dial-a-ride problem on a fixed circuit (eDARP-FC), a fleet of capacitated electric shuttles operates on a given circuit consisting of a recharging depot and a sequence of stations where passengers can be picked up and dropped off. The shuttles may perform multiple laps, between which they may need to recharge. The goal of the problem is to determine the vehicles’ stopping sequences and schedules, including recharging plans, so as to minimize a weighted sum of the total passenger excess time and the total number of laps. The eDARP-FC is formulated as a nonstandard lap-based mixed integer linear programming and is shown to be NP-Hard. Efficient polynomial time algorithms are devised for two special scheduling subproblems. These algorithms and several heuristics are then applied as subroutines within a large neighborhood search metaheuristic. Experiments on instances derived from a real-life system demonstrate that the flexible service results in a 32\%–75\% decrease in the excess time at the same operational costs.

  abstract     = {We study the operational problem of shared autonomous electric vehicles that cooperate in providing on-demand mobility services while maximizing fleet profit and service quality. Therefore, we model the fleet operator and vehicles as interactive agents enriched with advanced decision-making aids. Our focus is on learning smart charging policies (when and where to charge vehicles) in anticipation of uncertain future demands to accommodate long charging times, restricted charging infrastructure, and time-varying electricity prices. We propose a distributed approach and formulate the problem as a semi-Markov decision process to capture its stochastic and dynamic nature. We use cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning with reshaped reward functions. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model are upgraded through deep learning. A mean-field approximation deals with environment instabilities, and hierarchical learning distinguishes high-level and low-level decisions. We evaluate our model using various numerical examples based on real data from ShareNow in Berlin, Germany. We show that the policies learned using our decentralized and dynamic approach outperform central static charging strategies. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis for different fleet characteristics to demonstrate the proposed model’s robustness and provide managerial insights into the impacts of strategic decisions on fleet performance and derived charging policies.

  abstract     = {The rise of battery-powered vehicles has led to many new technical and methodological hurdles. Among these, the efficient planning of an electric fleet to fulfill passenger transportation requests still represents a major challenge. This is because of the specific constraints of electric vehicles, bound by their battery autonomy and necessity of recharge planning, and the large scale of the operations, which challenges existing optimization algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a scalable column generation approach for routing and scheduling in this context. Our algorithm relies on four main ingredients: (i) a multigraph reformulation of the problem based on a characterization of nondominated charging arcs, (ii) an efficient bidirectional pricing algorithm using tight backward bounds, (iii) sparsification approaches permitting to decrease the size of the subjacent graphs dramatically, and (iv) a diving heuristic, which locates near-optimal solutions in a fraction of the time needed for a complete branch-and-price. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous algorithms for this setting, leading to accurate solutions for problems counting several hundreds of requests.

  abstract     = {Car use restrictions have been adopted in some mega cities that experience rapid car ownership increase and worsening traffic congestion. Although easy to implement and considered fair, most implementations of this travel demand management policy do not offer travelers the flexibility to choose the days that they cannot use their cars. In this paper, we study a flexible car use restriction policy under which a private car cannot be driven on a certain day of a week, but the day can be chosen by its owner. Under this flexible policy, individuals face a dilemma between driving in congestion and traveling without a car, each incurring a cost of its own. The resulting equilibrium solutions under these two competing choices were derived, and a series of laboratory experiments were carried out to validate the theoretical results. The experimental results are found to be in agreement with the theoretical results. Moreover, our analysis shows that the flexible car use restriction policy reduces the average travel cost with a lesser increase in average driving cost when compared with the traditional car use restriction policy.

Three representative dynamical systems are used to formulate the day-to-day departure time choice of commuters, and a Walrasian toll charge scheme is utilized to control the evolutionary process of traffic flows. The toll charge scheme is anonymous; that is, toll charges are identical for all user classes, and the scheme’s implementation does not need to resort to information on the values of travel time and schedule delays. We find that the system optimum (SO) flow pattern can be achieved at the stationary state under the implementation of the toll charge scheme. The equivalence between the stationary state and the SO, the existence of the toll charge for achieving the SO, and the convergence of day-to-day traffic flows to the SO under the implementation of the toll charge scheme are theoretically proved. The distributions of traffic flows and toll charges at the SO state during morning rush hour are analytically shown. The application of the toll charge scheme to a network with multiple trip origins is presented. The effectiveness of the toll charge scheme for achieving the SO is also examined by numerical analyses.

  abstract     = {Parking plays a central role in transport policies and has wide-ranging consequences: While the average time spent searching for parking exceeds dozens of hours per driver every year in many Western cities, the associated cruising traffic generates major externalities, by emitting pollutants and contributing to congestion. However, the laws governing the parking search time remain opaque in many regards, which hinders any general understanding of the problem and its determinants. Here, we frame the problem of parking search in a very generic, but mathematically compact formulation that puts the focus on the role of the street network and the unequal attractiveness of parking spaces. This problem is solved in two independent ways, valid in any street network and for a wide range of drivers’ behaviours. Numerically, this is done by means of a computationally efficient and versatile agent-based model. Analytically, we leverage the machinery of Statistical Physics and Graph Theory to derive a generic mean-field relation giving the parking search time as a function of the occupancy of parking spaces; an expression for the latter is obtained in the stationary regime. We show that these theoretical results are applicable in toy networks as well as in complex, realistic cases such as the large-scale street network of the city of Lyon, France. Taken as a whole, these findings clarify the parameters that directly control the search time and provide transport engineers with a quantitative grasp of the parking problem. Besides, they establish formal connections between the parking issue in realistic settings and physical problems.

  abstract     = {This work addresses a soft-clustered vehicle routing problem that extends the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem with one additional constraint, that is, customers are partitioned into clusters and all customers of the same cluster must be served by the same vehicle. Its potential applications include parcel delivery in courier companies and freight transportation. Due to its NP-hard nature, solving it is computationally challenging. This paper presents an efficient bilevel memetic search method to do so, which explores search space at both cluster and customer levels. It integrates three distinct modules: a group matching-based crossover (to generate promising offspring solutions), a bilevel hybrid neighborhood search (to perform local optimization), and a tabu-driven population reconstruction strategy (to help the search escape from local optima). Extensive experiments on three sets of 390 widely used public benchmark instances are conducted. The results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better overall performance than state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution quality and computation time. In particular, it is able to find 20 new upper bounds for large-scale instances while matching the best-known upper bounds for all but four of the remaining instances. Ablation studies on three key algorithm modules are also performed to demonstrate the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed ideas and strategies.

  abstract     = {Less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers transport freight shipments from origins to destinations by consolidating freight using a network of terminals. As daily freight quantities are uncertain, carriers dynamically decide freight routes on the day of operations. We introduce the dynamic freight routing problem (DFRP) and model this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). To overcome the curses of dimensionality of the MDP model, we introduce an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) solution approach that uses a lookup table to store value function approximations and present and compares a number of aggregation approaches that use features of the postdecision states (PDSs) to aggregate the PDS space and reduce the number of entries in the lookup table. Furthermore, because the decision subproblems are integer programs (IPs), we present a framework for integrating lookup tables into the decision subproblem IPs. This framework consists of (1) a modeling approach for the integration of lookup table value function approximations into subproblem IPs to form extended subproblem IPs; (2) a solution approach, PDS-IP-bounding, which decomposes the extended subproblem IPs into many smaller IPs and uses dynamic bounds to reduce the number of small IPs that have to be solved; and (3) an adaptation of the ϵ-greedy exploration-exploitation algorithm for the IP setting. Our computational experiments show that despite the DFRP having high-dimensional PDS vectors, a two-dimensional aggregation of the space can produce policies that outperform standard myopic policies. Moreover, they demonstrate that the PDS-IP-bounding algorithm provides computational advantages over solving the extended subproblem IPs using a commercial solver. Funding: A.

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) promises considerable advantages over conventional manufacturing to meet the growing demand for customized products and faster delivery times. Consider a mobile mini-factory, that is, a vehicle equipped with an AM facility, which can simultaneously produce and transport the final products to the customers. The overlapping of production and transportation processes allows potential savings on customer delivery lead times and inventory holding costs, thereby facilitating on-demand fulfillment of the orders of intricate products. Based on this situation and motivated by a recent Amazon patent, we introduce a novel routing optimization problem called Simultaneous Production and Transportation Problem (SPTP) in this study. Given a set of customers and their respective orders with associated production time and delivery due dates, SPTP minimizes the trip time for the AM installed vehicle while meeting the customers’ stipulated due dates for all deliveries. We formulate the problem using a mixed integer linear program, discuss several valid inequalities to strengthen the formulation, and discuss a cutting-plane-based exact solution approach. We also design a variable neighborhood search metaheuristic to solve larger instances of SPTP very efficiently. The effectiveness of the exact and heuristic solution approaches is demonstrated using extensive computational experiments. The study also explores the interaction between production and travel times in SPTP and how the problem compares with the traveling salesman problem and the single machine scheduling problem, each of which may be viewed as special cases of SPTP. Further, the problem involves a trade-off between the total trip time and the tardiness of the deliveries. Therefore, an extension of the proposed formulation is also proposed with interesting managerial insights on identifying appropriate trip time-tardiness combinations using an illustrative example.

  abstract     = {Given a set of customer orders each comprising one or more individual items to be picked, the order batching problem (OBP) in warehousing consists of designing a set of picking batches such that each customer order is assigned to exactly one batch, all batches satisfy the capacity restriction of the pickers, and the total distance traveled by the pickers is minimal. In order to collect the items of a batch, the pickers traverse the warehouse using a predefined routing strategy. We propose a branch-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm for the exact solution of the OBP investigating the routing strategies traversal, return, midpoint, largest gap, combined, and optimal. The column-generation pricing problem is modeled as a shortest path problem with resource constraints (SPPRC) that can be adapted to handle the implications from nonrobust valid inequalities and branching decisions. The SPPRC pricing problem is solved by means of an effective labeling algorithm that relies on strong completion bounds. Capacity cuts and subset-row cuts are used to strengthen the lower bounds. Furthermore, we derive two BPC-based heuristics to identify high-quality solutions in short computation times. Extensive computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The BPC is faster by two orders of magnitude compared with the state-of-the-art exact approach and can solve to optimality hundreds of instances that were previously unsolved. The BPC-based heuristics are able to significantly improve the gaps reported for the state-of-the-art heuristic and provide hundreds of new best-known solutions.

  abstract     = {Logistics service providers use transportation assets to offer services to their customers. To cope with demand variability, they may acquire additional assets on a one-off (spot) basis. The planner’s problem is to determine the optimal level of assets acquired upfront, such that their cost is minimized, for a given planning horizon. Our formulation captures a nontrivial complication: Although ordering quantities are pertinent to asset acquisition, customer demand is in the form of service requests. Not only does each request have a stochastic duration, but also the total number of requests per customer is uncertain. We introduce a two-stage newsvendor model where demand for spot assets is derived through optimal cutting-stock patterns. Leveraging results from bin-packing, we propose polynomial algorithms that have worst-case guarantees for upper and lower bounds. Our method finds optimal solutions to instances intractable by commercial solvers. We investigate demand variability by means of a factorial experiment. We find that, whereas variability in the number of requests leads to higher costs, variability in each request’s duration can reduce costs. Finally, we demonstrate the modularity of our approach with two extensions: asset routing and outsourcing. Our results provide a practical approach to transportation asset acquisition and offer insights on the differing impact of demand uncertainty on the total acquisition cost.

Planners’ preferences often include nonmonetary aspects for which both the mathematical formulation and the assignment of appropriate penalty costs can be difficult. We address this problem by using machine learning to learn and predict planners’ preferences. We train a random forest classifier on planner feedback regarding duties from their daily work in railway crew scheduling. Our data set contains over 16,000 duties that planners labeled as good or bad. The trained model predicts the probability that a duty is perceived as bad by the planners. We present a novel approach to replace the large construct of penalty terms in a crew scheduling optimization model by a single term that penalizes duties proportionally to the predicted probability of being assessed as unfavorable by a planner. By integrating this probability into the optimization model, we generate schedules that include more duties with preferred characteristics. We increase the mean planner acceptance probability by more than 12\% while only facing a marginal increase in costs compared with the original approach that utilizes a set of multiple penalty terms. Our approach combines machine learning to detect complex patterns regarding favorable duty characteristics and optimization to create feasible and cost-efficient crew schedules.

  abstract     = {Airlines are known to compete for passengers, and airline profitability heavily depends on the ability to estimate passenger demand, which in turn depends on flight schedules, fares, and the number of seats available at each fare, across all airlines. Interestingly, such competitive interactions and passenger substitution effects may not be limited to the planning stages. Existing regulations in some countries and regions impose monetary compensations to passengers in case of disruptions, altering the way they perceive the utility of other travel alternatives after the disruption starts. These passenger rights regulations may act as catalysts of passengers’ response to recovered schedules. Ignoring such passenger response behavior under operational disruptions may lead airlines to develop subpar recovery schedules. We develop a passenger response model and embed it into a novel integrated optimization approach that recovers airline schedules, aircraft, and passenger itineraries while endogenizing the impacts of airlines&#39; decisions on passenger compensation and passenger response. We also develop an original solution approach, involving exact linearization of the nonlinear passenger cost terms, combined with delayed constraint generation for ensuring aircraft maintenance feasibility and an acceleration technique that penalizes deviations from planned schedules. Computational results on real-world problem instances from two major European airlines are reported, for scenarios involving disruptions, such as delayed flights, airport closures, and unexpected grounding of aircraft. Our approach is found to be tractable and scalable, producing solutions that are superior to airline’s actual decisions and highly robust in the face of passenger response uncertainty. Of particular relevance to the practitioners, our simulation results highlight that accounting for passengers’ disruption response behaviors, even in a highly approximate manner, yields significant benefits to the airline compared with not accounting for them at all, which is the current state-of-the-art.

  abstract     = {Origin-destination (OD) demands for a city or a region are essential input to many transportation applications. For a real-world transportation network, the OD demand matrix may present certain quasi-sparsity property, that is, most OD pairs have small demands, whereas only a small portion of OD pairs have large demands. In this paper, we formally define quasi-sparsity and propose a quasi-sparsity–based OD (QSOD) estimation framework to explore such a property for OD demand estimation. We study two QSOD models, that is, the fixed-mapping QSOD model and the bilevel QSOD model, by applying the compressed sensing technique. We theoretically and numerically show that under certain conditions the estimated OD matrix shares the same quasi-sparsity feature with the prior OD matrix, and the estimated demands of most OD pairs (of a large-size network) will be equal to either their prior values or zeros (or a very small value). Results show that the QSOD framework has the capability in keeping OD quasi-sparsity consistency and is computationally less demanding compared with existing methods. The practical implications of the QSOD framework are also discussed. Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grants CMMI-1825053 and DMS-1814894].

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an ex post path choice estimation framework for urban rail systems using an aggregated time-space hypernetwork approach. We aim to infer the actual passenger flow distribution in an urban rail system for any historical day using the observed automated fare collection (AFC) data. By incorporating a schedule-based dynamic transit network loading (SDTNL) model, the framework captures the crowding correlation among stations and the interaction between the path choice and passenger left behind, which is important for the path choice estimation in a “near-capacity” operated urban rail system. The path choice estimation is formulated as an optimization problem, which aims to minimize the difference between the model-derived and observed information with path choice parameters as decision variables. The original problem is intractable because of nonlinear (logit model) and nonanalytical (SDTNL) constraints. A solution procedure is proposed to decompose the original problem into three tractable subproblems, which can be solved efficiently. Solving the decomposed problem is equivalent to finding a fixed point. We prove that the solution to the original problem is the same as the decomposed problem (i.e., the fixed point) when passenger path choices follow the predefined behavior model. If this condition does not hold, the solution of the original problem is proved to be an “almost fixed point” for the decomposed problem. The model is validated using both synthetic and real-world AFC data from a major urban railway system. The analysis with synthetic data validates the model’s effectiveness in estimating path choice parameters and left behind probabilities, which outperforms state-of-art simulation-based optimization methods and probabilistic models in both accuracy and efficiency. The analysis using actual data shows that the estimated path shares are more reasonable than the baseline uniform path shares and survey-derived path shares. The model estimation is robust to different initial parameter values and AFC data from various dates. Funding: The project is partially funded by the TRENoP Strategic Research funding at KTH.

In contrast to existing approaches, the mode and route decisions of passengers are modeled depending on the line plan and commercial solvers can be applied to solve the corresponding MILP. The model aims at finding line plans that maximize the profit for the railway operator while estimating the corresponding passenger demand with aggregate choice models. Hence, the resulting line plans are not only profitable for operators but also attractive to passengers. By suitable preprocessing we are able to apply any aggregate choice model for mode choices using linear constraints. We provide and test means to improve the computational performance. Our experiments on the Intercity network of the Randstad, a metropolitan area in the Netherlands, show that models which assume a fixed passenger assignment to modes cannot attract the passenger numbers they were designed for and therefore lead to inferior profit compared with our new model.

  abstract     = {This paper studies how to integrate rider mode preferences into the design of on-demand multimodal transit systems (ODMTSs). It is motivated by a common worry in transit agencies that an ODMTS may be poorly designed if the latent demand, that is, new riders adopting the system, is not captured. This paper proposes a bilevel optimization model to address this challenge, in which the leader problem determines the ODMTS design, and the follower problems identify the most cost efficient and convenient route for riders under the chosen design. The leader model contains a choice model for every potential rider that determines whether the rider adopts the ODMTS given her proposed route. To solve the bilevel optimization model, the paper proposes an exact decomposition method that includes Benders optimal cuts and no-good cuts to ensure the consistency of the rider choices in the leader and follower problems. Moreover, to improve computational efficiency, the paper proposes upper and lower bounds on trip durations for the follower problems, valid inequalities that strengthen the no-good cuts, and approaches to reduce the problem size with problem-specific preprocessing techniques. The proposed method is validated using an extensive computational study on a real data set from the Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority, the transit agency for the broader Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The study considers the impact of a number of factors, including the price of on-demand shuttles, the number of hubs, and access to transit systems criteria. The designed ODMTSs feature high adoption rates and significantly shorter trip durations compared with the existing transit system and highlight the benefits of ensuring access for low-income riders. Finally, the computational study demonstrates the efficiency of the decomposition method for the case study and the benefits of computational enhancements that improve the baseline method by several orders of magnitude.

  abstract     = {Delay imposed on buses is witnessed at isolated signalized intersections, as part of the delay is created due to bus and car interactions at the signalized approaches. Inexpensive solutions that do not involve new infrastructure are the most desired. Toward reducing person delay, presignal lights are installed at the upstream of the intersection. Presignal is a control tool that can manage the interaction and space conflict between cars and buses at the mixed lanes, located after the presignals, approaching the intersection. This paper presents an optimal presignal control policy that determines signal settings based on minimization of total person-time spent. The developed model is comprised of a simplified signalized intersection with one approach, where two presignal lights are located: one for bus lane and one for car lane. A continuous-time model is first developed to describe the queue dynamics for the mixed lanes after the presignals and the bus and car lanes before the presignals. The optimal solutions are derived analytically via the Pontryagin maximum principle, and the optimal presignal control policy is determined and synthesized. The derived analytical solutions are verified through the use of the optimal control software, DIDO, which uses an advanced optimization method and solves complex dynamic optimization problems without prior knowledge of the analytical computations or the solution. Several examples are used to test and analyze the derived solutions. Finally, the microscopic simulation software AIMSUN is used to test, assess, and evaluate the performance of the proposed optimal control policy in a more realistic traffic condition, where stochastic arrivals are incorporated.

  abstract     = {We propose an analytic solution to the problem of finding optimal driving strategies that minimize total tractive energy consumption for a fleet of trains traveling on the same track in the same direction subject to clearance-time equality constraints that ensure safe separation and compress the headway timespan. We assume the track is divided into sections by a set of trackside signals at fixed positions. For each intermediate signal there is an associated signal segment consisting of the two adjacent sections. Successive trains are safely separated only if the leading train leaves the signal segment before the following train enters. Although the fleet can be safely separated by a complete set of clearance times and associated clearance-time inequality constraints the problem of finding optimal schedules with safe separation rapidly becomes intractable as the number of trains and signals increases. The main difficulty is in distinguishing between active equality constraints and inactive inequality constraints. The curse of dimensionality means it is not feasible to check every different combination of active constraints, find the optimal strategies for each train, optimize the corresponding prescribed times and calculate the cost. Nevertheless we can formulate and solve an alternative problem with active clearance-time equality constraints for successive trains defined at selected signals. We show that this problem can be formulated as an unconstrained convex optimization and propose a solution algorithm that finds the optimal schedule and the associated optimal strategies for each train. Finally we find optimal schedules for a case study using realistic parameters on a busy metropolitan line.},

  abstract     = {Puzzle-based storage (PBS) systems store unit loads at very high density, without consuming space for transport aisles. In such systems, each load is stored on a moving device (conveyor module or transport vehicle), making these systems very expensive to build and maintain. This paper studies a new type of PBS system where loads are moved by a small number of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). The AMRs (or vehicles) can travel freely underneath loads and lift a specific load and carry it to a neighboring vacant space. These systems are hard to analyze, as all the AMRs can move simultaneously with or without loads. We formulate an integer linear programming model that minimizes the retrieval time and the number of load and vehicle movements. The proposed model can handle single-load movements as well as block movements, multiple input/output points, and various constraints on simultaneous vehicle movements. The integer linear programming formulation can solve relatively small problems (a grid with up to about 50 cells) and a sufficient number of empty cells. For larger systems or those with few empty cells, a three-phase heuristic (3PH) is developed, which significantly outperforms the heuristic methods known to date and solves large instances sufficiently fast. The 3PH and an additional hybrid heuristic yield relatively small gaps from a lower bound provided by the integer linear programming model. We find that increasing the number of vehicles has a diminishing return effect on the retrieval times. Using a relatively small number of vehicles makes retrieval times only slightly longer than those obtained when having a vehicle under each load (which is equivalent to the traditional PBS systems). With single-load movement, more vehicles are needed compared with block movement to reach short retrieval times. Also, the marginal contribution of extra empty slots appears to decrease rapidly, which implies high storage densities can be obtained in practice.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates a new variant of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) applied in cold chain transportation, which quantifies the effect of time on the quality of perishable products. Multiple commodities with incompatibility constraints are considered, where some types of products cannot be transported in a vehicle simultaneously because of their different properties and requirements for storage temperatures. The aim is to determine vehicles’ pickup and delivery routes as well as their departure times from the depot such that the travel cost and refrigeration cost of vehicles and the quality decay cost of products are minimized. We formulate this problem as a set partitioning model, which is solved exactly by a tailored branch-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm. To tackle the asymmetry issue arising from the pricing problem of the B&amp;P framework, we develop a novel asymmetric bidirectional labeling algorithm. Benchmark instance sets based on real-world statistical data and classic PDPTW instance sets are first generated for this problem. Numerical results show that our B&amp;P algorithm can solve most instances to optimality in an acceptable time frame. Moreover, our results demonstrate that integrating the refrigeration and quality decay costs into the objective function can significantly lower the total cost of cold chain transportation activities, compared with the widely adopted objective function minimizing only the travel cost.

  abstract     = {Neighborhood search is a cornerstone of state-of-the-art traveling salesman and vehicle routing metaheuristics. Whereas neighborhood exploration procedures are well-developed for problems with individual services, their counterparts for one-to-one pickup-and-delivery problems are more scarcely studied. A direct extension of classic neighborhoods is often inefficient or complex because of the necessity of jointly considering service pairs. To circumvent these issues, we introduce major improvements to existing neighborhood searches for the pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem and new large neighborhoods. We show that the classic R elocate P air neighborhood can be fully explored in O ( n 2 ) instead of O ( n 3 ) time. We adapt the 4-O pt and B alas –S imonetti neighborhoods to consider precedence constraints. Moreover, we introduce an exponential-size neighborhood called 2 k -O pt , which includes all solutions generated by multiple nested 2-O pts and can be searched in O ( n 2 ) time using dynamic programming. We conduct extensive computational experiments, highlighting the significant contribution of these new neighborhoods and speedup strategies within two classical metaheuristics. Notably, our approach permits us to repeatedly solve small pickup-and-delivery problem instances to optimality or near-optimality within milliseconds, and therefore, it represents a valuable tool for time-critical applications, such as meal delivery or mobility on demand.

We propose an integer programming formulation using a small number of decision variables and several sets of valid inequalities. These inequalities focus on ensuring the vehicles’ capacity limits and that vehicles return to their initial depot. As we show that the new constraints do not guarantee these aspects, our branch-and-cut framework also includes an efficient feasibility check for candidate solutions and explicit feasibility cuts. The algorithm that also uses a comparably simple, yet effective heuristic to compute high-quality initial solutions is tested on the MDSDVRP and two well-known special cases, the split-delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP) and the multi-depot traveling salesman problem (MDTSP). The results show that the new inequalities tighten the linear programming relaxation, increase the performance of the branch-and-cut algorithm, and reduce the number of required feasibility cuts. We report the first proven optimal results for the MDSDVRP and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art for the MDTSP while being competitive on the SDVRP.

  abstract     = {In business-to-consumer (B2C) parcel delivery, the presence of the customer at the time of delivery is implicitly required in many cases. If the customer is not at home, the delivery fails—causing additional costs and efforts for the parcel service provider as well as inconvenience for the customer. Parcel service providers typically report high failed-delivery rates, as they have limited possibilities to arrange a delivery time with the recipient. We address the failed-delivery problem in B2C parcel delivery by considering customer-individual availability profiles (APs) that consist of a set of time windows, each associated with a probability that the delivery is successful if conducted in the respective time window. To assess the benefit of APs for delivery tour planning, we formulate the vehicle routing problem with availability profiles (VRPAP) as a mixed integer program, including the trade-off between transportation and failed-delivery costs. We provide analytical insights concerning the model’s cost-savings potential by determining lower and upper bounds. In order to solve larger instances, we develop a novel hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (HALNS). The HALNS is highly adaptable and also able to solve related time-constrained vehicle routing problems (i.e., vehicle routing problems with hard, multiple, and soft time windows). We show its performance on these related benchmark instances and find a total of 20 new best-known solutions. We additionally conduct various experiments on self-generated VRPAP instances to generate managerial insights.

  abstract     = {We study a new variant of the well-studied vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), called the fragility-constrained VRPTW, which assumes that (1) the capacity of a vehicle is organized in multiple identical stacks; (2) all items picked up at a customer are either “fragile” or not; (3) no nonfragile items can be put on top of a fragile item (the fragility constraint); and (4) no en route load rearrangement is possible. We first characterize the feasibility of a route with respect to this fragility constraint. Then, to solve this new problem, we develop an exact branch-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm that includes a labeling algorithm exploiting this feasibility characterization to efficiently generate feasible routes. This algorithm is benchmarked against another BPC algorithm that deals with the fragility constraint in the column generation master problem through infeasible path cuts. Our computational results show that the former BPC algorithm clearly outperforms the latter in terms of computational time and that the fragility constraint has a greater impact on the optimal solution cost (compared with that of the VRPTW) when vehicle capacity decreases, stack height increases, and for a more balanced mix of customers with fragile and nonfragile items.

  abstract     = {Schedule coordination is the primary form of demand management used at busy airports. At its core, slot allocation involves a highly complex combinatorial problem. In response, optimization models have been developed to minimize the displacement of flight schedules from airline requests, subject to physical and administrative constraints. Existing approaches, however, may not result in the best itineraries for passengers. This paper proposes an original passenger-centric approach to airport slot allocation to maximize available itineraries and minimize connecting times. Because of the uncertainty regarding passenger demand, the proposed approach combines predictive analytics to forecast passenger flows in flight networks from historical data and prescriptive analytics to optimize airport slot assignments in view of flight-centric and passenger-centric considerations. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization model. To solve it, we propose an approximation scheme that alternates between flight-scheduling and passenger-accommodation modules and embed it into a large-scale neighborhood search algorithm. Using real-world data from the Singapore Changi and Lisbon Airports, we show that the proposed model and algorithm return solutions in acceptable computational times. Results suggest that slot-allocation outcomes can be made much more consistent with passenger flows at a relatively small cost in terms of flight displacement. Ultimately, this paper provides a new paradigm that can create more attractive flight schedules by bringing together airport-level considerations, airline-level considerations, and, for the first time, passenger-level considerations.

  abstract     = {The growth in air traffic (before the Covid-19 pandemic) made airport time slots an increasingly scarce resource (and it is believed that this growth will continue after recovery). It is widely acknowledged that the grandfathering schemes used nowadays lead to inefficient allocations and that auctions would be a means to allocate valuable airport time slots efficiently. It has, however, also been pointed out that the design of such slot auctions is challenging due to the various constraints that need to be considered. The present paper proposes a market design for the sales of airport time slots at EU airports that complies with the Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), most notably the reference value systems at level 3 airports. These guidelines need to be considered but lead to significant additional complexity in the market design. Capacity constraints are defined for overlapping time windows, which render the maximum welfare flight scheduling problem NP-hard. Auction formats with good incentive properties such as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism or core-selecting auctions require an exact solution to the allocation problem. Given its hardness, it is far from obvious that the allocation problem can be solved to optimality sufficiently fast for practically relevant sizes of real-world problems. We introduce a mathematical model formulation for the maximum welfare flight scheduling problem that complies with all specified IATA constraints and evaluate it on near real-world data sets of flight requests for a full season of a major international airport. We show that the allocation can be computed within minutes and that all the payment computations for the winners can be done in less than two hours on average for realistic problem sizes. The consideration of values of airlines within the proposed auction mechanism leads to significant welfare gains of more than 35\% as compared with benchmarks resulting from different standard objectives. These include the maximization of the number of movements, the minimization of the number of movements for which deviations from requested times occur, and the minimization of the total deviation of scheduled from requested times. Whereas the results indicate that auctions can be solved quickly for realistic problem sizes and promise significant welfare gains under the standard independent private values assumptions, the implementation of auctions in the field leads to additional serious challenges. For example, the regulator might have to impose allocation constraints to mitigate the market power of incumbent airlines. In addition, the valuation of slots and the interdependencies of the slot assignment with those at other coordinated airports need careful attention.

  abstract     = {Performance aspects such as travel time, punctuality, and robustness are conflicting goals of utmost importance for railway transports. To successfully plan railway traffic, it is therefore important to strike a balance between planned travel times and expected delays. In railway operations research, a lot of attention has been given to construct models and methods to generate robust timetables—that is, timetables with the potential to withstand design errors, incorrect data, and minor everyday disturbances. Despite this, the current state of practice in railway planning is to construct timetables manually, possibly with support of microsimulation for robustness evaluation. This paper aims to narrow the gap between the state-of-the-art optimization-based research approaches and the current state of practice to construct timetables by combining simulation and optimization. The paper proposes a combined simulation-optimization approach for double-track lines, which generalizes previous work to allow full flexibility in the order of trains by including a new and more generic model to predict delays. By utilizing delay data from simulation, the approach can make socioeconomically optimal modifications of a given timetable by minimizing predicted disutility—the weighted sum of scheduled travel time and total predicted delay. In a large simulation experiment on the heavily congested Swedish Western Main Line, it is demonstrated that compared with a real-life, manually constructed timetable, large reductions of delays as well as improvements in punctuality could be obtained for a small cost of marginally longer travel times. The cost of scheduled in-vehicle travel time and mean delay was reduced by 5\% on average, representing a large improvement for a highly utilized railway line. Furthermore, a separate scaling experiment indicates that the approach can also be suitable for larger problems.

  abstract     = {For vehicle and crew scheduling in public bus transport, two concepts are intensively studied to reduce resource usage and minimize operational costs: Integrated, that is, simultaneous scheduling of vehicles and drivers, and resource scheduling with simultaneous trip shifting, that is, slightly modifying departure and arrival times of particular trips without changing their duration. Applying these two concepts can lead to highly cost-efficient and tight schedules. Unfortunately, such schedules are more susceptible to delays during operations. Furthermore, shifting of particular trips may have an unwanted impact on the original timetable structure as, for example, headways between consecutive trips of a line might be changed. In this work, we develop an integrated vehicle and crew scheduling approach with the possibility to shift scheduled trips controllably within small defined time windows. It is a Lagrangian heuristic based on column generation. In addition to minimizing planned costs, the approach aims at two further objectives: building robust schedules by minimizing the expected overall propagation of delays through the transport network and minimizing timetable alteration. To reduce the possible propagation of delays, the mutual dependencies between vehicle and crew schedules are taken into account during integrated scheduling. To increase both robustness and cost-efficiency, the possibility to shift trips within small defined time windows is used. Robust and cost-efficient vehicle itineraries and crew duties are generated in the column-generation pricing problems. Computational experiments on data sets from the real world show that resource usage can be further reduced compared with pure cost-efficient integrated scheduling, whereas resource schedules remain robust and timetable alterations can be minimized.

  abstract     = {Shared autonomous electric vehicle systems will be a promising alternative for sustainable urban mobility. This study investigates an integrated optimization problem for shared autonomous electric vehicle systems that determines the long-term charging facility deployment at the planning level (e.g., the sizing and configurations of charging facilities), while the vehicle assignment, relocation, and charging decisions in the short term are also optimized at the operational level. A two-stage stochastic integer program is formulated to capture the demand uncertainty, in which an event-activity space-time-battery network is proposed for tracking the charging choices and battery states of vehicles and determining the optimal operational decisions. For dealing with a large number of scenarios in the stochastic program, the sample average approximation scheme is applied as the sampling strategy. An accelerated two-phase Benders decomposition-based algorithm is proposed for solving the two-stage program. The modeling and algorithm approach is tested on a large-scale case in Shanghai City in China. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can always find high-quality solutions in an efficient way. Numerical results indicate that deployment of both normal- and fast-charging infrastructure can increase the system profit and improve its operational performance.

  abstract     = {Microscopic traffic flow models enable predictions of traffic operations, which allows traffic engineers to assess the efficiency and safety effects of roadway designs. Modeling vehicle trajectories inside intersections is challenging because there is an infinite number of possible paths in a two-dimensional space, and drivers can simultaneously adapt their speeds as well. To date, human driver models for simultaneous longitudinal and lateral vehicle control based on the infrastructure characteristics and interactions with other drivers inside an intersection are still lacking. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it proposes an integrated microscopic traffic flow model to describe human-driven vehicle maneuvers under interactions. Drivers plan their heading and acceleration in the predicted future to minimize costs representing undesirable situations. The model works with a joint optimization for an interaction cost term. The weights associated with the interaction cost reflect how selfish or altruistic drivers are. Second, the proposed model endogenously gives the order of vehicles in case of crossing paths. Third, the paper develops a clustered validation method for microscopic traffic flow models with interacting vehicles, which account for interdriver variations. Results show that the model can accurately describe vehicle passing orders of interacting maneuvers, paths, and speeds against empirical data. The model can be applied to assess various intersection designs.

This algorithm combines a large neighborhood search, the resolution of a route-based model, and the progressive shrinkage of the planning window. It is applied to a real case from the area of Lyon in France, including 34 schools and 575 heterogeneous users served by a heterogeneous fleet of reconfigurable vehicles. On average, we show that in addition to the 10\% of saving that can be expected by sharing vehicle routes between schools, 7\% of additional savings can be achieved by school bell adjustment. This cost saving also decreases average user ride times and the number of vehicles required, creating longer routes that are more attractive for driver services.

  abstract     = {With the rising urbanization and booming e-commerce, traditional last-mile delivery systems fail to satisfy the need for faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly deliveries. Several new approaches are put forward as an alternative to classical delivery systems in this regard, yet none of them offers the same level of flexibility, capacity, reliability, and managerial control by itself. This paper proposes a new last-mile delivery model that combines several new approaches and technologies to address this issue. More precisely, we suggest using public transit as a backbone network completed by automated service points, crowd-shipping, and backup transfers with zero-emission vehicles to provide a low-cost and environmentally friendly express delivery service. The design problem for the envisioned system is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program, and a branch-and-price (BP) algorithm is devised to solve it. Taking advantage of the nearly decomposable structure that would emerge in possible real-world applications, our study presents the first example of using decomposition branching in a BP framework to enhance computational efficiency. Extensive computational studies and simulations with real-world data reveal valuable managerial insights for the proposed system and attest to the efficacy of the suggested methodology.

Specifically, given a set of MFs, a planning horizon, and a service region, our models aim to find the number of MFs to use (i.e., fleet size) within the planning horizon and a route and time schedule for each MF in the fleet. The objective is to minimize the fixed cost of establishing the MF fleet plus a risk measure (expectation or mean conditional value at risk) of the operational cost over all demand distributions defined by an ambiguity set. In the first model, we use an ambiguity set based on the demand’s mean, support, and mean absolute deviation. In the second model, we use an ambiguity set that incorporates all distributions within a 1-Wasserstein distance from a reference distribution. To solve the proposed DRO models, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm. In addition, we derive valid lower bound inequalities that efficiently strengthen the master problem in the decomposition algorithm, thus improving convergence. We also derive two families of symmetry-breaking constraints that improve the solvability of the proposed models. Finally, we present extensive computational experiments comparing the operational and computational performance of the proposed models and a stochastic programming model, demonstrating when significant performance improvements could be gained, and derive insights into the MFRSP.

  abstract     = {We consider the capacitated multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows (CMTVRPTW), where vehicles are allowed to make multiple trips. The ability to perform multiple trips is necessary for some real-world applications where the vehicle capacity, the trip duration, or the number of drivers or vehicles is limited. However, it substantially increases the solution difficulty in view of the additional trip scheduling aspect. We propose an exact price-cut-and-enumerate method (EPCEM) that solves a novel superstructure-based formulation inspired by Paradiso et al. (2020) . The EPCEM obtains a tight lower bound by an alternating column and row generation method and computes a valid upper bound in the early stage of the algorithm. It obtains an optimal solution and further proves its optimality by a new multiphase sift-and-cut method. Computationally, the EPCEM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art exact method that only proves optimality for 9 of the 27 test instances with 50 customers. In particular, the EPCEM solves all test instances with up to 70 customers to optimality for the first time and obtains near-optimal solutions with an average optimality gap of no more than 0.3\% for instances with 80 to 100 customers. From a practical point of view, solving the CMTVRPTW by the EPCEM yields a solution that, on average, uses at least 45\% fewer vehicles and increases the travel cost by no more than 7\% compared with the solution to the standard CVRPTW.

  abstract     = {Two-echelon distribution systems are often considered in city logistics to maintain economies of scale and satisfy the emission zone requirements in the cities. In this work, we formulate the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands as a chance-constrained stochastic optimization problem, where the total demand of the customers in each second-echelon route should fit within the second-echelon vehicle capacity with a high probability. We propose two efficient solution procedures based on column generation. Key to the efficiency of these procedures is the underlying labeling algorithm to generate new columns. We propose a novel labeling algorithm based on simultaneous construction of second-echelon routes and a labeling algorithm that builds second-echelon routes sequentially. To further enhance the performance of the solution procedure, we use statistical inference tests to ensure that the chance constraints are met. We reduce the number of customer combinations for which the chance constraint needs to be verified by imposing feasibility bounds on the stochastic customer demands. With these bounds, the runtimes of the labeling algorithms are reduced significantly. The novel labeling algorithm, statistical inference, and feasibility bounds can also be applied to dependent, correlated, and data-driven (scenario-based) demand distributions. Finally, we show the value of the stochastic formulation in terms of improved solution cost and guaranteed feasibility of second-echelon routes.

  abstract     = {We study a new service network design problem for an urban same-day delivery system in which the number of vehicles that can simultaneously load or unload at a hub is limited. Due to the presence of both time constraints for the commodities and capacity constraints at the hubs, it is no longer guaranteed that a feasible solution exists. The problem can be modeled on a time-expanded network and formulated as an integer program. To be able to solve real-world instances, we design and implement three heuristics: (1) an integer programming–based heuristic, (2) a metaheuristic, and (3) a hybrid matheuristic. An extensive computational study using real-world instances (with different geographies, market sizes, and service offerings) from one of China’s leading comprehensive express logistics service providers demonstrates the efficacy of the three heuristics.
