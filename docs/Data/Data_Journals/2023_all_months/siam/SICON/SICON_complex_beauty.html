  abstract     = {Abstract. This article focuses on the controllability for a class of semilinear evolution equations and applications to some specific differential equations. Without assuming compactness or equicontinuity of the related semigroups, the existence of mild solutions of semilinear equations in Hilbert space is demonstrated via the noncompact measure tool and the fixed point trick. In order to study the controllability of semilinear equations, new concepts are proposed, namely, exact controllability along any -bounded Lipschitz continuous curve, and approximate controllability along any continuous curve. Furthermore, two new approximation methods, “bisection method” and “equisection method,” are introduced. The exact controllability along any -bounded Lipschitz continuous curve and the approximate controllability along any continuous curve in the sense of the graph norm of semilinear evolution equations are obtained under the asymptotic condition on the norm of the controllability Gramian inverse operator near the zero point. In fact, our conclusions show that this is not only a result control but also a process control. Finally, the results presented in this paper are employed in resistance, inductance, voltage source type electrical circuit systems, one-dimensional nonhomogeneous transport systems, as well as differential equations with delay which have important effects on economic systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The spike variation technique plays a crucial role in deriving Pontryagin’s type maximum principle of optimal controls for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs), stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and (deterministic forward) Volterra integral equations (FVIEs), when the control domains are not assumed to be convex. It is natural to expect that such a technique could be extended to the case of (forward) stochastic Volterra integral equations (FSVIEs). However, by mimicking the case of SDEs, one encounters an essential difficulty of handling an involved quadratic term. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an auxiliary process for which one can use Itô’s formula, and develop new technologies inspired by stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problems. Then the suitable representation of the above-mentioned quadratic form is obtained, and the second-order adjoint equations are derived. Consequently, the maximum principle of Pontryagin type is established. Some relevant extensions are investigated as well.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We complete the first step toward the resolution of several decades-old challenges in disturbance-robust adaptive control. For a scalar system with an unknown parameter for which no a priori bound is given, with a disturbance that is of unlimited magnitude and possibly persistent (not square integrable), and without a persistence of excitation necessarily verified by the state, we consider the problems of (practical) gain assignment relative to the disturbance. We provide a solution to these heretofore unsolved feedback design problems with the aid of infinite-dimensional nonlinear feedback employing distributed delay of the state and input itself. Specifically, in addition to (0) the global boundedness of the infinite-dimensional state of the closed-loop system when the disturbance is present, we establish (1) practical input-to-output stability with assignable asymptotic gain from the disturbance to the plant state; (2) assignable exponential convergence rate; and (3) assignable radius of the residual set. The accompanying identifier in our adaptive controller guarantees (4) boundedness of the parameter estimate even when disturbances are present; (5) an ultimate estimation error which is proportional to the magnitude of the disturbance with assignable gain when there exists sufficient excitation of the state; and (6) exact parameter estimation in finite time when the disturbance is absent and there is sufficient excitation. Among our results, one reveals a trade-off between “learning capacity” and “disturbance robustness”: the less sensitive the identifier is to the disturbance, the less likely it is to learn the parameter.},

We introduce a distance between kernels based on the Wasserstein distances between their values, study its properties, and prove that it is a metric on an appropriately defined space of kernels. We also relate it to various modes of convergence in the space of kernels. Then we consider the problem of approximating solutions to forward–backward systems, where the forward part is a Markov system described by a sequence of kernels, and the backward part calculates the values of a risk measure by operators that may be nonlinear with respect to the system’s kernels. We propose recursively approximating the forward system with the use of the integrated transportation distance between kernels and we estimate the error of the risk evaluation by the errors of individual kernel approximations. We illustrate the results on stopping problems and several well-known risk measures. Then we develop a particle-based numerical procedure, in which the approximate kernels have finite support sets. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of the approach on the financial problem of pricing an American basket option.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Despite its popularity in the reinforcement learning community, a provably convergent policy gradient method for continuous space-time control problems with nonlinear state dynamics has been elusive. This paper proposes proximal gradient algorithms for feedback controls of finite-time horizon stochastic control problems. The state dynamics are nonlinear diffusions with control-affine drift, and the cost functions are nonconvex in the state and nonsmooth in the control. The system noise can degenerate, which allows for deterministic control problems as special cases. We prove under suitable conditions that the algorithm converges linearly to a stationary point of the control problem and is stable with respect to policy updates by approximate gradient steps. The convergence result justifies the recent reinforcement learning heuristics that adding entropy regularization or a fictitious discount factor to the optimization objective accelerates the convergence of policy gradient methods. The proof exploits careful regularity estimates of backward stochastic differential equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies a general class of stochastic population processes in which agents interact with one another over a network. Agents update their behaviors in a random and decentralized manner according to a policy that depends only on the agent’s current state and an estimate of the macroscopic population state, given by a weighted average of the neighboring states. When the number of agents is large and the network is a complete graph (has all-to-all information access), the macroscopic behavior of the population can be well-approximated by a set of deterministic differential equations called a mean-field approximation. For incomplete networks such characterizations remained previously unclear, i.e., in general whether a suitable mean-field approximation exists for the macroscopic behavior of the population. The paper addresses this gap by establishing a generic theory describing when various mean-field approximations are accurate for arbitrary interaction structures. Our results are threefold. Letting be the matrix describing agent interactions, we first show that a simple mean-field approximation that incorrectly assumes a homogeneous interaction structure is accurate provided has a large spectral gap. Second, we show that a more complex mean-field approximation which takes into account agent interactions is accurate as long as the Frobenius norm of is small. Finally, we compare the predictions of the two mean-field approximations through simulations, highlighting cases where using mean-field approximations that assume a homogeneous interaction structure can lead to inaccurate qualitative and quantitative predictions.},

The second-order Hamilton–Jacobi partial differential equation (HJ PDE) is converted into a first-order HJ PDE in the dual variable, which, however, contains a correction term. Approximations to the correction term are indicated. A numerical example is included.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper addresses the problem of stochastic stabilization for the neutral stochastic delay systems (NSDSs) based on discrete observations. Specifically, we design sampled-data based controllers (SDBCs) to stabilize NSDSs. To conquer the difficulties caused by the neutral term and stochastic stabilization, we introduce a new nominal system. By using the Lyapunov function method, we discuss the stability of the nominal system and provide a stability criterion. For the part of SDBC design, there are two methods: the lifting technique method (LTM) and the input delay method (IDM). The LTM is more effective for linear delay-free systems, but there is little research on the LTM for nonlinear stochastic delay systems. In this research, we combine the LTM with the equivalence technique for NSDSs, resulting in improved results. Additionally, to overcome the difficulty caused by LTM, we propose a series of mathematical tools, such as Gronwall’s inequality of the discrete version. We compared our method with the IDM presented in X. Mao, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 61 (2016), pp. 1619–1624., and our method performs better. Finally, to showcase the efficiency and correctness of our proposed approach, we provide an application.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The present work addresses the problem of energy shaping for stochastic port-Hamiltonian systems. Energy shaping is a powerful technique that allows one to systematically find feedback laws to shape the Hamiltonian of a controlled system so that, under a general passivity condition, it converges to a desired configuration. Energy shaping has been recently generalized to consider stochastic port-Hamiltonian systems. Nonetheless, the resulting theory presents several limitations so that relevant examples, such as the additive noise case, are immediately ruled out from the possible use of energy shaping. In the current paper we continue the investigation of the properties of a weak notion of passivity for a stochastic system and derive a weak notion of convergence for the controlled system. Such weak notion of passivity is strictly related to the existence and uniqueness of an invariant measure for the system so that the theory developed has a purely probabilistic flavor. We will show how all the relevant results of energy shaping can be recover under the proposed weak setting.},

The system is controlled by the leading vehicle driving at a prescribed velocity and also determines the steady state. Thereby, we consider both the microscopic (trajectory based) and macroscopic (density based) scales. We show that the fixed point of the microscopic traffic flow model is (locally) asymptotically stable for any kernel function. To obtain global stabilization, we present Lyapunov functions for both the microscopic and the macroscopic scale and compute the explicit rates at which the vehicles influenced by the nonlocality tend toward the stationary solution. We obtain stabilization results for a constant kernel function and arbitrary initial data or concave kernels and monotone initial data. In particular, the stabilization is exponential in time.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we consider a constrained parabolic optimal control problem. The cost functional is quadratic and it combines the distance of the trajectory of the system from the desired evolution profile together with the cost of a control. The constraint is given by a term measuring the distance between the final state and the desired state towards which the solution should be steered. The control enters the system through the initial condition. We present a geometric analysis of this problem and provide a closed-form expression for the solution. This approach allows us to present the sensitivity analysis of this problem based on the resolvent estimates for the generator of the system. The numerical implementation is performed by exploring efficient rational Krylov approximation techniques that allow us to approximate a complex function of an operator by a series of linear problems. Our method does not depend on the actual choice of discretization. The main approximation task is to construct an efficient rational approximation of a generalized exponential function. It is well known that this class of functions allows exponentially convergent rational approximations, which, combined with the sensitivity analysis of the closed form solution, allows us to present a robust numerical method. Several case studies are presented to illustrate our results.},

Such uncertainty comes not only from the fact that the true probability law of the underlying stochastic process is unknown, but also from the fact that the parametric family of probability distributions to which the true law belongs is unknown. We propose a nonparametric adaptive robust control methodology to deal with such a problem. Our approach hinges on the following building concepts: first, using the adaptive robust paradigm to incorporate online learning and uncertainty reduction into the robust control problem; second, learning the unknown probability law through the empirical distribution, and representing uncertainty reduction in terms of a sequence of Wasserstein balls around the empirical distribution; third, using Lagrangian duality to convert the optimization over Wasserstein balls to a scalar optimization problem, and adopting a machine learning technique to achieve efficient computation of the optimal control. We illustrate our methodology by considering a utility maximization problem. Numerical comparisons show that the nonparametric adaptive robust control approach is preferable to the traditional robust frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In networked control systems, the sensory signals are often quantized before being transmitted to the controller. Consequently, performance is affected by the coarseness of this quantization process. Modern communication technologies allow users to obtain resolution-varying quantized measurements based on the prices paid. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint optimal controller synthesis and quantizer scheduling for a partially observed quantized-feedback linear-quadratic-Gaussian system, where the measurements are quantized before being sent to the controller. The system is presented with several choices of quantizers, along with the cost of using each quantizer. The objective is to jointly select the quantizers and synthesize the controller to strike an optimal balance between control performance and quantization cost. When the innovation signal is quantized instead of the measurement, the problem is decoupled into two optimization problems: one for optimal controller synthesis, and the other for optimal quantizer selection. The optimal controller is found by solving a Riccati equation and the optimal quantizer-selection policy is found by solving a linear program—both of which can be solved offline.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Unlike regular linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, singular LQR problems, in general, cannot be solved using a static state-feedback controller. This work is primarily focused on the design of feedback controllers which solve the singular LQR problem. We show that such problems can be solved using proportional-derivative (PD) state-feedback controllers. It is well known in the literature that the maximal rank-minimizing solution of the singular LQR linear matrix inequality (LMI) is pivotal in solving the singular LQR problem. In this paper, we first make use of this maximal rank-minimizing solution to compute the optimal trajectories. Then we provide a PD feedback controller that restricts the trajectories of the closed-loop system to these optimal ones and thus solves the singular LQR problem. While numerous solutions to this problem have been proposed over the course of the extensive research efforts in this field, a controller in the form of a PD state feedback has been long sought after. Our approach is based on the notion of weakly unobservable (slow) and strongly reachable (fast) subspaces developed in [M. Hautus and L. Silverman, Linear Algebra Appl., 50 (1983), pp. 369–402]. But, unlike in that reference, we employ these notions to the corresponding Hamiltonian system and not to the plant. This crucial extension of these well-known subspaces to the corresponding Hamiltonian system is key to the optimal PD feedback design that we propose in this paper. It is well known that an optimal state feedback for the singular LQR problem does not exist; the limiting state-feedback controller of the suboptimal ones (high gain controllers) has unbounded coefficients as optimality is approached. We show in this paper that the limiting high gain controller is in fact a PD controller.},

These systems are obtained by modifying the second order differential equation that is part of the description of conservative linear systems “out of thin air” introduced by Tucsnak and Weiss in 2003. The modified differential equation contains a new nonlinear damping term that is maximal monotone and possibly set-valued. We show that this new class of nonlinear infinite dimensional systems is incrementally scattering passive (hence well-posed). Our approach uses the theory of maximal monotone operators and the Crandall–Pazy theorem about nonlinear contraction semigroups, which we apply to a Lax–Phillips type nonlinear semigroup that represents the whole system. We illustrate our result on the n-dimensional wave equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A linear-quadratic optimal control problem for a forward stochastic Volterra integral equation (FSVIE) is considered. Under the usual convexity conditions, open-loop optimal control exists, which can be characterized by the optimality system, a coupled system of an FSVIE and a type-II backward SVIE (BSVIE). To obtain a causal state feedback representation for the open-loop optimal control, a path-dependent Riccati equation for an operator-valued function is introduced, via which the optimality system can be decoupled. In the process of decoupling, a type-III BSVIE is introduced whose adapted solution can be used to represent the adapted M-solution of the corresponding type-II BSVIE. Under certain conditions, it is proved that the path-dependent Riccati equation admits a unique solution, which means that the decoupling field for the optimality system is found. Therefore, a causal state feedback representation of the open-loop optimal control is constructed. An additional interesting finding is that when the control only appears in the diffusion term, not in the drift term of the state system, the causal state feedback reduces to a Markovian state feedback.},

We present an analysis and numerical study of an optimal control problem for the Landau–de Gennes (LdG) model of nematic liquid crystals (LCs), which is a crucial component in modern technology. They exhibit long range orientational order in their nematic phase, which is represented by a tensor-valued (spatial) order parameter . Equilibrium LC states correspond to functions that (locally) minimize an LdG energy functional. Thus, we consider an -gradient flow of the LdG energy that allows for finding local minimizers and leads to a semilinear parabolic PDE, for which we develop an optimal control framework. We then derive several a priori estimates for the forward problem, including continuity in space-time, that allow us to prove existence of optimal boundary and external “force” controls and to derive optimality conditions through the use of an adjoint equation. Next, we present a simple finite element scheme for the LdG model and a straightforward optimization algorithm. We illustrate optimization of LC states through numerical experiments in two and three dimensions that seek to place LC defects (where ) in desired locations, which is desirable in applications.},

For linear control systems, the usual state feedback stabilizability has two components: one is a continuous observation mode (i.e., to observe solutions continuously in time), and the other is a class of feedback laws (which is usually the space of all of the linear and bounded operators from a state space to a control space). This paper studies the stabilizability for abstract linear control systems, with a discrete observation mode (i.e., to observe solutions discretely in time) and two different classes of feedback laws. We first characterize these types of stabilizabilities via some weak observability inequalities for the dual systems. Then, we use these characterizations to reveal the connections between these types of stabilizabilities and those with continuous observation mode. Finally, we show some applications of the aforementioned weak observability inequalities.},

The associated optimization problem is nonconvex and nonlinear. We design an iterative algorithm based on alternating minimization, where a data compensation mechanism is used to avoid ill-conditioned problems. We also show that there is an interesting connection between the iterative algorithm and switched nonlinear systems. By analyzing the switched systems, we prove that each iteration of the algorithm is rank-preserving and thus avoids ill-conditioned problems. The solution to the optimization problem is also strictly feasible without any approximations. The optimization variables are proved to be convergent, and the limit satisfies the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. Furthermore, it is proved that the limit is almost surely a local minimizer rather than a saddle point. For the equivalent switched systems, the states of all subsystems are convergent.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper proposes and analyzes an optimal control approach for acoustic full waveform inversion (FWI) to reconstruct the speed wave parameter entering the hyperbolic acoustic PDE model in the coefficient of the second-order time derivative of the acoustic pressure. We develop a novel technique accounting for an auxiliary first-order system. In contrast to the original state equation, the underlying control parameter appears in the auxiliary system not only as the coefficient of the time derivative but also as the initial data under the image of the solution operator for a specific elliptic problem. On this basis, we construct an adjoint state explicitly using the corresponding dual semigroup, leading to necessary optimality conditions with a low adjoint regularity such that no Sobolev smoothing effect occurs in the optimal solution. The final part of the paper is devoted to the second-order analysis of the optimal control approach. We study the two- and three-dimensional case where the reconstruction is only considered in an open set strictly contained in the hold-all domain. For this case, under additional regularity and compatibility assumptions on the data, we are able to prove second-order optimality conditions yielding local optimality in an -neighborhood. A numerical test based on a synthetic configuration with nonsmooth data is provided, illustrating the performance of the control approach.},

We establish general results regarding interactions between admissible trajectories and clearance discontinuities, e.g., instantaneous increases in clearance when passing through a discontinuity, and propagation of discontinuity along optimal trajectories. Then, investigating sufficient conditions for discontinuities, we explore a common directionality condition for velocities at a point, characterized by strict positivity of the minimal Hamiltonian. Elementary consequences of this common directionality assumption are explored before demonstrating how, in concert with corresponding obstacle configurations, it gives rise to clearance discontinuities both on the surface of the obstacle and propagating out into free space. Minimal assumptions are made on the topological structure of obstacle sets.},

Some approaches to nonlinear filtering use the analysis of the underlying PDE or stochastic PDE governing the evolution of the posterior probability distribution over time, one approach, in particular, being the Yau–Yau method. In this paper, we give a maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for the Yau–Yau method. Furthermore, we propose convex filtering, intermediate between linear and nonlinear filtering, which gives criteria under which the posterior preserves log-concavity. The key tool from the PDE is a result from Korevaar, giving criteria under which a quasilinear parabolic PDE preserves convexity. A bridge between the MAP estimator and the structure of the posterior is explained. Finally, we propose a novel numerical method based on iteration and apply this method to a tracking problem.},

This paper addresses the question based on a naïve learning setting in influence systems theory: in our models individuals evolve their estimates of an unknown truth according to the weighted-average opinion dynamics. A formal mathematization is provided with rigorous theoretical analysis. We obtain various conditions for improving, optimizing, and undermining the crowd accuracy, respectively. We prove that if the wisdom of a finite-size group is improved, then the collective estimate converges to the truth as the group size increases. We show that whether social influence improves or undermines the wisdom is determined by the social power allocations in the influence system: if the influence system allocates relatively larger social power to relatively more accurate individuals, it improves the wisdom; on the contrary, if the influence system assigns less social power to more accurate individuals, it undermines the wisdom. At a population level, individuals’ susceptibilities to interpersonal influence and network centralities are both crucial. To improve the wisdom, more accurate individuals should be less susceptible and have larger network centralities. Particularly, in democratic influence networks, if relatively more accurate individuals are relatively less susceptible, the wisdom is improved; if more accurate individuals are more susceptible, the wisdom is undermined, which is consistent with the reported empirical evidence. Our investigation provides a theoretical framework for understanding the role social influence plays in the emergence of collective wisdom.},

The exact observability and approximate observability are shown by the method of characteristic and boundary reflection relations. Based on the observability, two Luenberger types of PDE observers are designed by making use of the boundary velocity and boundary displacement measurement, respectively. Some sufficient conditions are then developed to obtain the global exponential stability and global asymptotic stability of the observer error systems. Some numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies several problems related to quadratic matrix inequalities (QMIs), i.e., inequalities in the Loewner order involving quadratic functions of matrix variables. In particular, we provide conditions under which the solution set of a QMI is nonempty, convex, or bounded or has a nonempty interior. We also provide a parameterization of the solution set of a given QMI. In addition, we state results regarding the image of such sets under linear maps, which characterize a subset of “structured” solutions to a QMI. Thereafter, we derive matrix versions of the classical S-lemma and Finsler’s lemma that provide conditions under which all solutions to one QMI also satisfy another QMI. The results will be compared to related work in the robust control literature, such as the full block S-procedure and Petersen’s lemma, and it is demonstrated how existing results can be obtained from the results of this paper as special cases. Finally, we show how the various results for QMIs can be applied to the problem of data-driven stabilization. This problem involves finding a stabilizing feedback controller for an unknown dynamical system influenced by noise on the basis of a finite set of data. We provide general necessary and sufficient conditions for data-based quadratic stabilization. In addition, we demonstrate how to reduce the computational complexity of data-based stabilization by leveraging the aforementioned results. This involves separating the computation of the Lyapunov function and the controller and also leads to explicit formulas for data-guided feedback gains.},

We prove strong stationarity conditions for optimal control problems that are governed by a prototypical rate-independent evolution variational inequality, i.e., first-order necessary optimality conditions in the form of a primal-dual multiplier system that are equivalent to the purely primal notion of Bouligand stationarity. Our analysis relies on recent results on the Hadamard directional differentiability of the scalar stop operator and a new concept of temporal polyhedricity that generalizes classical ideas of Mignot. The established strong stationarity system is compared with known optimality conditions for optimal control problems governed by elliptic obstacle-type variational inequalities and stationarity systems obtained by regularization.},

The earlier introduced notion of incrementally port-Hamiltonian systems is extended to systems defined with respect to maximal cyclically monotone relations, together with their generating convex functions. This gives rise to interesting subclasses of incrementally port-Hamiltonian systems, with examples stemming from physical systems modeling as well as from convex optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how cyclical monotonicity for Dirac structures is equivalent to separability. An in-depth treatment is given of the composition of maximal monotone and maximal cyclically monotone relations, where in the latter case the resulting maximal cyclically monotone relation is shown to be computable through the use of generating functions. The results on compositionality are employed for steady-state analysis and for a convex optimization approach to the computation of the equilibria of interconnected incrementally port-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, the relation to incremental and differential passivity is discussed, and it is shown how incrementally port-Hamiltonian systems with strictly convex Hamiltonians are equilibrium independent passive.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The dynamical behavior of switched affine systems is known to be more intricate than that of the well-studied switched linear systems, essentially due to the existence of distinct equilibrium points for each subsystem. First, under arbitrary switching rules, the stability analysis must be generally carried out with respect to a compact set with nonempty interior rather than to a singleton. We provide a novel proof technique for existence and outer approximation of attractive invariant sets of a switched affine system, under the hypothesis of global uniform stability of its linearization. On the other hand, considering dwell-time switching signals, forward invariant sets need not exist for this class of switched systems, even for stable ones. Hence, more general notions of stability/boundedness are introduced and studied, highlighting the relations of these concepts to the uniform stability of the linear part of the system under the same class of dwell-time switching signals. These results reveal the main differences and specificities of switched affine systems with respect to linear ones, providing a first step for the analysis of switched systems composed by subsystems not sharing the same equilibrium. Numerical methods based on linear matrix inequalities and sum-of-squares programming are presented and illustrate the developed theory.},

A remarkable new feature in this setting is that the stopping time also impacts the dynamics of the stopped process through the dependence of the coefficients on the law. The mean field stopping problem is introduced in weak formulation in terms of the joint marginal law of the stopped underlying process and the survival process. This specification satisfies a dynamic programming principle. The corresponding dynamic programming equation is an obstacle problem on the Wasserstein space and is obtained by means of a general Itô formula for flows of marginal laws of càdlàg semimartingales. Our verification result characterizes the nature of optimal stopping policies, highlighting the crucial need to randomize stopping. The effectiveness of our dynamic programming equation is illustrated by various examples including the mean variance optimal stopping problem.},

A general stochastic large population system is considered, where the diffusion term of the dynamic of each agent can depend on the state and control. We study both the control constrained case and the unconstrained case. In the control constrained case, by using a Hamiltonian approach and convex analysis, the explicit decentralized strategies can be obtained through a projection operator. The corresponding Hamiltonian type consistency condition system is derived, which turns out to be a nonlinear mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equation with projection operator. The well-posedness of such equations is proved by using a discounting method. Moreover, the corresponding -Nash equilibrium property is verified. In the control unconstrained case, the decentralized strategies can be further represented explicitly as the feedback of the filtered state through a Riccati approach. The existence and uniqueness of a solution to a new Riccati type consistency condition system is also discussed. As an application, a general interbank borrowing and lending problem is studied to illustrate that the effect of partial information cannot be ignored.},

In our paper, we change the landscape in a completely different way for the output regulation of the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation for which the disturbances are generated from a completely unknown finite-dimensional exosystem; i.e., the frequencies of the sinusoidal signals that appear in the reference signal and disturbances are completely unknown. In addition, the number of frequencies is also assumed to be unknown yet has a known upper bound. We apply the technique of the Sylvester equation to decouple the ODE of the exosystem and the PDE of the plant first, and then adopt the adaptive observer to estimate all possible unknown frequencies that have entered into the tracking error. By designing two different adaptive observers to estimate the unknown frequencies as well as the state of the plant and exosystem, we propose two tracking error based feedback controls for achieving output regulation for this PDE.},

This paper examines the analysis and optimal control of an H(curl)-quasilinear first kind variational inequality with a bilateral vector curl-constraint, stemming from the ferromagnetic shielding phenomenon. We propose a tailored regularization approach based on the Helmholtz decomposition and a reduction of the first-order constraint to the zeroth-order one in combination with a smoothed Yosida penalization. In this way, a suitable family of approximating quasilinear variational equalities is obtained. The corresponding limiting analysis not only leads to a well-posedness result for the variational inequality but also reveals its dual formulation. Thereafter, as a second novelty, we prove a regularity result for the dual multiplier by means of the -Helmholtz decomposition in a careful combination with elliptic regularity results for Dirichlet and Neumann problems. The last part of this paper is devoted to the analysis of the corresponding optimal control, which is mainly complicated by the involving H(curl)-quasilinearity, the bilateral vector curl-constraint, and the nonsmoothness. On the basis of the proposed regularization, as the final novelty, we derive necessary optimality conditions, including a characterization of the limiting dual multiplier through -projection and cut-off type arguments.},

The agents update their estimates of the average through a nonlinear observer. We prove that utilizing a proper gradient feedback for any distributed control system that satisfies these conditions will lead to a solution of the corresponding distributed optimization problem. We show that many of the existing algorithms for solving distributed optimization are instances of this dynamics, and hence their convergence properties can follow from its properties. In this sense, the proposed method establishes a unified framework for distributed optimization in continuous time. Moreover, this formulation allows us to introduce a suit of new continuous-time distributed optimization algorithms by readily extending the graph-theoretic conditions under which such dynamics are convergent.},

By particularizing to specific instances of infinite-dimensional systems, such as time-delay or semilinear over Banach spaces, sufficient conditions are given in terms of the functions defining the dynamics. In addition, it is also shown that for semilinear systems whose nonlinear term satisfies an affine-in-the-state norm bound, it holds that iISS becomes equivalent to just 0-GUAS, a fact known to hold for bilinear systems. An additional important aspect is that the iISS notion considered is more general than the standard one.},

A natural question arises as to whether squared non-Euclidean norms may serve as Lyapunov functions in stability problems. This paper presents a novel nonpolynomial S-Lemma that leads to constructive criteria for the existence of such functions defined by weighted norms. Our generalized S-Lemma leads to new absolute stability and absolute contractivity criteria for Lur’e-type systems, including, for example, a new simple proof of the Aizerman and Kalman conjectures for positive Lur’e systems.},

A nondegenerate maximum principle is obtained based on the corresponding inward and outward pointing conditions of the higher order. Simple examples demonstrate how the new optimality conditions exclude degenerate sets of Lagrange multipliers, while the conventional approach fails to do so. The conservation law is derived as a consequence of extremality. The connection to the classical form of optimality conditions is investigated.},

In addition, it presents the advantages of neither involving second-order adjoint equations nor leading to the so-called weak version of the Pontryagin maximum principle, in which the maximization condition with respect to the control variable is replaced by the stationarity of the Hamiltonian.},

We show that the dynamics of asynchronous Q-learning with a constant step size can be naturally formulated as a discrete-time stochastic affine switching system. In particular, for a given -function parameter, the greedy policy, in the Q-learning update plays the role of the switching policy, and is the key connection between the switching system and Q-learning. Then, the evolution of the Q-learning estimation error is over- and under-estimated by trajectories of two simpler dynamical systems. Based on these two systems, we derive a new finite-time error bound of asynchronous Q-learning when a constant step size is used. In addition, the new analysis sheds light on the overestimation phenomenon of Q-learning.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Focusing on identification, support recovery, and parameter estimation of multivariate ARMA systems with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) is considered. It is assumed that sparsity appears not only in the unknown parameter matrix of the system inputs and outputs but also in the coefficients of system noises, and with exogenous inputs the system admits feedback control and thus the observation of the ARMAX system may be nonstationary. A two-stage sparse identification algorithm is introduced. First, the extended least squares (ELS) algorithm is applied to obtain an initial estimate for the unknown parameter matrix of the ARMAX system. Second, a convex optimization criterion is introduced based on norm with regularization, where adaptive weights generated from ELS algorithms are adopted in the optimization variables in the term. Third, it is proved that by optimizing the criterion, the sets of the zero and the nonzero entries of the parameter matrix, i.e., the support set of the ARMAX system, can be correctly identified with a finite number of observations, and estimates of the nonzero parameters converge to the true values with probability one. Fourth, the strictly positive realness (SPR) condition required by the ELS algorithm is relaxed by an overparametrization technique. The performance of the algorithm is testified through simulation examples.},

Our focus is on the construction of paths of strict decay which are used for building Lyapunov functions for the network and thus proving various stability properties, including input-to-state stability. Our approach is based on the study of an augmented gain operator whose fixed points are precisely the points of decay for the original gain operator. We show that plenty of such fixed points exist under a uniform version of the no-joint-increase condition. Using these fixed points to construct a path of strict decay, in general, requires specific dynamical properties of associated monotone operators. For particular types of gain operators such as max-type operators and subadditive operators, these properties follow from uniform global asymptotic stability of the system induced by the original gain operator. This is consistent with former results in the literature which can readily be recovered from our results.},

A necessary and sufficient condition to stabilize the original system in the mean-square sense is obtained based on an algebraic Riccati equation. Some necessary and sufficient stabilizability conditions based on the Lyapunov criterion are also presented. Interestingly, it is shown that the stabilization problem considered in this paper is equivalent to the stabilization problem of a particular delay-free system with control-dependent correlated noises.

We generalize in particular results known for parabolic equations posed on , for which the approximate null-controllability with uniform cost is ensured by the notion of thickness, which is stronger than the integral thickness condition considered in the present paper.

The classical convex combination condition is utilized to construct buffer-regions. In the buffer-regions, by virtue of Lie derivative of the induced single Lyapunov function along the active vector field, the position of state at the switching instant and the evolution of state during the active interval are captured in a uniformly quantitative form via switching characteristic indices for the first time. These uniform indices are revealed as the essential attribute by which the dwell-times of hysteresis switching are guaranteed. Meanwhile, the dwell-times are associated with subsystems and can be adjusted by an introduced parameter, which ensures the adjustable multiple dwell-times for every subsystem, rather than one dwell-time for the whole systems. Moreover, for switched linear systems, the explicit expression of multiple dwell-times is obtained by using the convex condition with respect to system matrices and independent of dwell-times. A numerical example substantiates the effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider distributed recursive estimation of an unknown vector parameter in the presence of impulsive communication noise. That is, we assume that interagent communication is subject to an additive communication noise that may have heavy-tails or is contaminated with outliers. To combat this effect, within the class of consensus+innovations distributed estimators, we introduce for the first time a nonlinearity in the consensus update. We allow for a general class of nonlinearities that subsumes, e.g., the sign function or componentwise saturation function. For the general nonlinear estimator and a general class of additive communication noises—that may have infinite moments of order higher than one—we establish almost sure convergence to the parameter . We further prove asymptotic normality and evaluate the corresponding asymptotic covariance. These results reveal interesting tradeoffs between the negative effect of “loss of information” due to incorporation of the nonlinearity and the positive effect of communication noise reduction. We also demonstrate and quantify benefits of introducing the nonlinearity in high-noise (low signal-to-noise ratio) and heavy-tail communication noise regimes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The long time behavior and detailed convergence analysis of Langevin equations have received increased attention in recent years. Difficulties arise from a lack of coercivity, usually termed hypocoercivity, of the underlying kinetic Fokker–Planck operator, which is a consequence of the partially deterministic nature of a second order stochastic differential equation. In this manuscript, the effect of controlling the confinement potential without altering the original invariant measure is investigated. This leads to an abstract bilinear control system with an unbounded but infinite-time admissible control operator which, by means of an artificial diffusion approach, is shown to possess a unique solution. The compactness of the underlying semigroup is further used to define an infinite-horizon optimal control problem on an appropriately reduced state space. Under smallness assumptions on the initial data, feasibility of and existence of a solution to the optimal control problem are discussed. Numerical results based on a local approximation based on a shifted Riccati equation illustrate the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the present paper we consider the problem of estimating the multidimensional power spectral density which describes a second-order stationary random field from a finite number of covariance and generalized cepstral coefficients. The latter can be framed as an optimization problem subject to multidimensional moment constraints, i.e., to search a spectral density maximizing an entropic index and matching the moments. In connection with systems and control, such a problem can also be posed as finding a multidimensional shaping filter (i.e., a linear time-invariant system) which can output a random field that has identical moments with the given data when fed with a white noise, a fundamental problem in system identification. In particular, we consider the case where the dimension of the random field is greater than two for which a satisfying theory is still missing. We propose a multidimensional moment problem which takes into account a generalized definition of the cepstral moments, together with a consistent definition of the entropy. We show that it is always possible to find a rational power spectral density matching exactly the covariances and approximately the generalized cepstral coefficients, from which a shaping filter can be constructed via spectral factorization. In plain words, our theory allows us to construct a well-posed spectral estimator for any finite dimension.},

The purpose of this paper is to study optimal control of conditional McKean–Vlasov (mean-field) stochastic differential equations with jumps (conditional McKean–Vlasov jump diffusions, for short). To this end, we first prove a stochastic Fokker–Planck equation for the conditional law of the solution of such equations. Combining this equation with the original state equation, we obtain a Markovian system for the state and its conditional law. Furthermore, we apply this to formulate a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for the optimal control of conditional McKean–Vlasov jump diffusions. Then we study the situation when the law is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. In that case the Fokker–Planck equation reduces to a stochastic partial differential equation for the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the conditional law. Finally we apply these results to solve explicitly the linear-quadratic optimal control problem of conditional stochastic McKean–Vlasov jump diffusions, and optimal consumption from a cash flow.},

Our main result reduces the path-dependent planning problem to an embedding problem, that is, constructing a McKean–Vlasov dynamics with given marginals . Some sufficient conditions on are provided to guarantee the existence of solutions. We also characterize, up to integrability, the minimum entropy solution of the planning problem. In particular, as uniqueness does not hold anymore in our path-dependent setting, one can naturally introduce an optimal planning problem which would be reduced to an optimal transport problem along controlled McKean–Vlasov dynamics.},

It provides a good understanding of various microscales involved in the problem, which can be conveniently and easily applied to get the asymptotic limit. In this article, we develop the periodic unfolding for the Heisenberg group, which has a noncommutative group structure. The concept of greatest integer part and fractional part for the Heisenberg group has been introduced corresponding to the periodic cell. Analogous to the Euclidean unfolding operator, we prove the integral equality, -weak compactness, unfolding gradient convergence, and other related properties. Moreover, we have the adjoint operator for the unfolding operator, which can be recognized as an average operator. As an application of the unfolding operator, we have homogenized the standard elliptic PDE with oscillating coefficients. We have also considered an optimal control problem with the state equation having high contrasting diffusivity coefficients. The high contrasting coefficients are an added difficulty in the analysis. Moreover, we have characterized the interior periodic optimal control in terms of the unfolding operator, which helps us to analyze the asymptotic behavior.},

Stabilization of systems is a thoroughly studied subject, and numerous methodologies that enable the determination of stabilizing controllers have been developed over the years. In this work, we present a framework that unifies these methodologies. More explicitly, we utilize equivalence relations of rational matrices, allowing us to reduce the problem of stabilizing a singular transfer function to the problem of stabilizing a nonsingular transfer function matrix of smaller dimensions, thus connecting the stabilization of singular and nonsingular MIMO transfer functions. Furthermore, it is shown that the aforementioned nonsingular matrix can always be diagonal, in which case the problem of stabilizing it is reduced to stabilizing each of its diagonal elements, which are SISO transfer functions. Finally, it is proved that using this equivalence relation, similar results hold for the case of strong stabilizing controllers, that is, stabilizing controllers that are stable themselves.},

The technique of proof is to establish a probabilistic representation of the derivative of the Markovian solution and then use this representation to obtain a priori estimates. Our study is motivated by applications to ergodic control, and we use our existence result to prove the existence of optimal controls for a class of ergodic control problems with potentially superquadratic Hamiltonians.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Given a multi-input, nonlinear, time-invariant, control-affine system and a controlled-invariant, closed, embedded submanifold , the local transverse feedback linearization (TFL) problem seeks a coordinate and feedback transformation such that, in transformed coordinates, the dynamics governing the system’s transverse evolution with respect to are linear, time-invariant, and controllable. The transformed system is said to be in the TFL normal form. Checkable necessary and sufficient conditions for this problem to be solvable are known, but, unfortunately, the literature does not present a prescription that constructs the required transformation for multi-input systems. In this article we present an algorithm that produces a virtual output of suitable vector relative degree that, using input-output feedback linearization, puts the system into TFL normal form.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies a class of quadratic optimal control problems for partially observable linear dynamical systems. In contrast to the full information case, the control is required to be adapted to the filtration generated by the observation system, which in turn is influenced by the control. The variation method fails in this case due to the fact that the filtration is not fixed. To overcome the difficulty, we use the orthogonal decomposition of the state process to write the cost functional as the sum of two parts: one is a functional of the control and the filtering process and the other part is independent of the choice of the control. The first part possesses a mathematical structure similar to the full information problem. By completing the square, it is shown that the open-loop optimal control is given by a feedback representation via the filtering process. The optimal value is also obtained explicitly.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We develop a prescribed-time mean-nonovershooting stabilizing feedback law for stochastic nonlinear systems with noise that vanishes in finite time. The prescribed time of stabilization must be strictly after the noise vanishes, but it may occur as early as the user desires after the noise vanishes. In fact, more generally, the feedback is stabilizing and mean-overshoot free for any noise that, given the prescribed time of stabilization, satisfies certain decay rate properties which require, in particular, that no noise component vanish slower than linearly in the “time to go” until the prescribed time. In contrast to the existing stochastic prescribed-time designs where only multiplicative noise is allowed, our design can deal with multiplicative and additive noise simultaneously. A new controller is designed to guarantee that the mean of the system output prescribed time tracks a given trajectory without overshooting, that the fourth moment of the tracking error between states and derivatives of the reference trajectory converges to zero in prescribed time, and that the controller and all of the states are mean-square bounded. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the prescribed-time mean-nonovershooting design.},

It is shown that this Newton differentiability allows to solve optimal control problems with -cost terms and one-sided pointwise control constraints by means of a semismooth Newton method. The superlinear convergence of the resulting algorithm is proved in the infinite-dimensional setting, and its mesh independence is demonstrated in numerical experiments.

We study a system of interconnected agents over a graph and a distributed controller, called -distributed control, which lets the agents make control decisions based on the state information within distance on the underlying graph. This controller can tune its degree of decentralization using the parameter and thus allows a characterization of the relationship between decentralization and performance. We show that under mild assumptions, including stabilizability, detectability, and a subexponentially growing graph condition, the performance difference between -distributed control and centralized optimal control becomes exponentially small in . This result reveals that distributed control can achieve near-optimal performance with a moderate degree of decentralization, and thus it is an effective controller architecture for large-scale networked systems.},

The partially observed global maximum principle is proved. To show its applications, a partially observed linear quadratic progressive optimal control problem of forward-backward stochastic differential equations with random jumps is investigated by the maximum principle and stochastic filtering.

Players observe past realizations of the environment variables and their local information. At equilibrium, if players are given the full distribution of the stochastic environment process as if it were an exogenous process, they would have no incentive to unilaterally deviate from their strategies. This notion thus generalizes what is known as the static price-taking behavior in prior literature to a stochastic and dynamic setup. We establish the existence of SEBEU, study various properties, and present explicit solutions. We obtain the -Nash equilibrium property of SEBEU when there are many players.},

When the investor aims to maximize the worst-case scenario of his/her utility derived from consumption and bequest, we propose an optimal -stopping approach to the robust optimization in a dual space with risk ambiguity. Under the -expectation framework, we consider a reflected -BSDE with an upper obstacle, which allows us to formulate a parabolic obstacle problem to the dual optimal stopping problem. From the dynamic result in the dual space, we establish the duality theorem to link between the primal problem with return ambiguity and the dual optimal stopping problem with risk ambiguity. We characterize the robust retirement time using the free boundary and derive the robust consumption and investment for a general class of utility functions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article is devoted to the study of spectral optimization for inhomogeneous plates. In particular, we consider the optimization of the first eigenvalue of a vibrating plate with respect to its thickness and/or density. We prove the existence of an optimal thickness, using fine tools hinging on topological properties of rearrangement classes. In the case of a circular plate, we provide a characterization of this optimal thickness by means of Talenti inequalities. Moreover, we prove a stability result when assuming that the thickness and the density of the plate are linearly related. This proof relies on -convergence tools applied to the biharmonic operator.},

We consider stochastic optimal control problems for systems of particles with common noise, interacting through their empirical measures. We prove that their value functions , when converted to functions of the empirical measures, converge uniformly on bounded sets in the Wasserstein space of probability measures to a limiting function which is the unique so-called -viscosity solution of the limiting Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation in the Wasserstein space. This generalizes such a result from the 2021 paper, in the sense that our drift and cost functions are allowed to be unbounded. The -viscosity solution is defined using the lifting of the function and the HJB equation to a Hilbert space of square integrable random variables. The proof of the convergence of to uses PDE viscosity solution techniques. The lifted function of is the value function of a stochastic optimal control problem in the Hilbert space and we prove that is and that the problem has an optimal feedback control. Using this we then characterize as the value function of a stochastic optimal control problem in the Wasserstein space.},

The market is ruled by an independent system operator (ISO) who has the goal of reducing the pollutant emissions of the providers in the network by encouraging the use of cleaner technologies. The problem of the ISO formulates as a contracting problem with each one of the providers, who interact among themselves by playing a stochastic differential game. The actions of the providers are not observable by the ISO which faces the moral hazard. By using the dynamic programming approach, we represent the value function of the ISO as the unique viscosity solution to the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. We prove that this solution is smooth and characterize the optimal controls for the ISO. Numerical solutions to the problem are presented and discussed. We consider also a simpler problem for the ISO, with constant production levels, that can be solved explicitly in a particular setting.},

We then propose a novel least-squares algorithm which achieves a regret of the order on linear-convex learning problems with jumps, where is the number of learning episodes; the analysis leverages the Lipschitz stability of feedback controls and concentration properties of sub-Weibull random variables.

The optimal control problem uses the external load as control variable and is constrained to normalized parametrized balanced viscosity solutions (BV solutions) of the rate-independent system. Solutions of this type appear as vanishing viscosity limits of viscously regularized versions of the original rate-independent system.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper investigates the concurrent path planning optimization and the built part structural optimization for powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes. The state of the art studies rely on existing patterns for trajectories for a fixed built shape. The shape is often optimized for its mechanical performance but rarely in a combined way with its path planning building process. In this work, a two-dimensional model (in the layer plane) of the process is proposed under a steady state assumption. Then a systematic path optimization approach, free from a priori restrictions and previously developed in [M. Boissier, G. Allaire, and C. Tournier [Struct. Multidiscip. Optim., 61 (2020), pp. 2437–2466], is coupled to a structural optimization tool, both of them based on shape optimization theory. This multiphysics optimization leads to innovative and promising results. First, they confirm that it is essential to take into account the part shape in the scanning path optimization. Second, they also give hints to some design recipes: the material and the source parameters must be related to the thickness of the bars that compose the structure. Indeed, the thickness of a bar is a key ingredient which determines the type of path pattern to scan it: straight line, Omega-pattern, and Wave-pattern.},

Based on impulsive control theory, some Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for exponential stability involving both impulsive perturbation and impulsive control are derived, respectively. Especially, the derived conditions do not impose any restriction on the magnitude relationship between the delay in continuous flow and impulsive delay in the case of impulsive perturbation. It also shows that the delay in continuous flow might have a potential effect on system stability. It may not be reasonable for existing results to assume a common threshold of impulsive strength at every impulse point, such as with in the case of impulsive perturbation. Here, based on the proposed concepts of average impulsive estimation and average positive impulsive estimation, impulsive estimation can be time-varying, and the information of impulsive delay can be integrated into it to guarantee the effect of impulse. The results of stability analysis are applied to the synchronization of complex networks with mixed delays and impulses. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the derived results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we deal with the global exact controllability to the trajectories of the Boussinesq system posed in 2D or 3D smooth bounded domains. The velocity field of the fluid must satisfy a Navier-slip-with-friction boundary condition, and a Robin boundary condition is imposed to the temperature. We assume that one can act on the velocity and the temperature on a small part of the boundary. For the proof, we first transform the boundary control problem into a distributed control problem. Then, we prove a global approximate controllability result by adapting the strategy of Coron, Marbach, and Sueur [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS), 22 (2020), pp. 1625–1673]; this relies on the controllability properties of the inviscid Boussinesq system and the analysis of appropriate asymptotic boundary layer expansions. Finally, we conclude with a local controllability result; as in many other cases, this can be established as a consequence of the null controllability of a linearized system through a fixed-point argument. Our contribution can be viewed as an extension of the results in [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS), 22 (2020), pp. 1625–1673], where thermal effects were not considered. Thus, we prove that the ideas behind the controllability properties of the Euler system and the well-prepared dissipation technique can be adapted to the present situation. Furthermore, we cover all the classical boundary conditions for the temperature, that is, those of the Robin, Neumann, and Dirichlet kinds.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. To address the issue of inaccurate distributions in discrete-time stochastic systems, a minimax linear quadratic control method using the Wasserstein metric is proposed. Our method aims to construct a control policy that is robust against errors in an empirical distribution of underlying uncertainty by adopting an adversary that selects the worst-case distribution at each time. The opponent receives a Wasserstein penalty proportional to the amount of deviation from the empirical distribution. As a tractable solution, a closed-form expression of the optimal policy pair is derived using a Riccati equation. We identify nontrivial stabilizability and observability conditions under which the Riccati recursion converges to the unique positive semidefinite solution of an algebraic Riccati equation. Our method is shown to possess several salient features, including closed-loop stability, a guaranteed-cost property, and a probabilistic out-of-sample performance guarantee.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper focuses on the model reference adaptive tracking control problem of uncertain hybrid switching Markovian systems. The stochastic multiple piecewise Lyapunov function method is set up for designing a hybrid switching signal and a piecewise dynamic switching adaptive controller. The hybrid switching signal is presented to improve the adaptive tracking capability by providing plenty of adjusting time during the stochastic switching stage. A piecewise dynamic parameter projection adaptive control technique is developed, which provides more freedom in designing a model reference adaptive law. A set of piecewise dynamic switching adaptive controllers are designed such that all the signals of the tracking error system remain within a bounded region under the proposed hybrid switching signal, and the tracking error converges to a neighborhood of zero where the radius of the neighborhood can be made arbitrarily small by choosing the regulation parameters appropriately. Finally, the developed adaptive tracking control theory of uncertain hybrid switching Markovian systems is illustrated by using a numerical example and an application example of an electro-hydraulic model.},

It is well known that, considering a time discretization with a positive step size , an error bound of size can be proved for the difference between the value function (viscosity solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation corresponding to the infinite horizon) and the value function of the discrete time problem. However, including also a spatial discretization based on elements of size , an error bound of size can be found in the literature for the error between the value functions of the continuous problem and the fully discrete problem. In this paper we revise the error bound of the fully discrete method and prove, under assumptions similar to those of the time discrete case, that the error of the fully discrete case is in fact , which gives first order in time and space for the method. This error bound matches the numerical experiments of many papers in the literature in which the behavior from the bound has not been observed.},

We study continuity properties of stochastic game problems with respect to various topologies on information structures, defined as probability measures characterizing a game. We will establish continuity properties of the value function under total variation, setwise, and weak convergence of information structures. Our analysis reveals that the value function for a bounded game is continuous under total variation convergence of information structures in both zero-sum games and team problems. Continuity may fail to hold under setwise or weak convergence of information structures; however, the value function exhibits upper semicontinuity properties under weak and setwise convergence of information structures for team problems, and upper or lower semicontinuity properties hold for zero-sum games when such convergence is through a Blackwell-garbled sequence of information structures. If the individual channels are independent, fixed, and satisfy a total variation continuity condition, then the value functions are continuous under weak convergence of priors. We finally show that value functions for players may not be continuous even under total variation convergence of information structures in general non-zero-sum games.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a Stackelberg game in discrete time where a manager (leader) hires an agent (follower) for the completion of a project. The project has two states: either uncompleted or completed. The manager gets a fixed reward upon the completion of the project. At the beginning of each stage, given that the project has not been completed, the manager proposes an amount that will be paid to the agent if the project is completed in the next period. The agent controls the level of effort which is equivalent to the probability of the project being completed in the next period. Both the manager and agent aim to maximize their own expected payoffs subject to exponential discounting. It turns out that the manager’s problem is time-inconsistent, albeit with exponential discounting. We provide the manager’s optimal Markov, optimal precommitment, and equilibrium strategies. Next, we extend our results to the problem where the project has two milestones, i.e., three states. Moreover, we show that if the manager is weakly less patient than the agent, then under optimal Markov and precommitment strategies there is no need for the manager to pay the agent upon the completion of the intermediate milestone, while that may not be the case for the equilibrium strategy.},

Perfectly orthogonal divergence-free discretizations or divergence-free reconstructions of these test functions lead to qualitatively better a priori estimates in the sense that the discrete velocities do not depend on the pressures scaled by the inverse of the viscosity. The consequences of the space discretization are also demonstrated and validated in numerical examples.},

Under a fairly weak condition, the Stackelberg equilibrium is explicitly obtained by first solving a forward stochastic LQ optimal control problem (SLQ problem) and then a backward SLQ problem. Two Riccati equations are derived for constructing the Stackelberg equilibrium. An interesting finding is that the difference of these two Riccati equations coincides with the Riccati equation associated with the zero-sum Nash stochastic LQ differential game, which implies that under the uniform convexity-concavity condition, the Stackelberg equilibrium and the Nash equilibrium are actually identical. Consequently, the Stackelberg equilibrium admits a linear state feedback representation, and the Nash game can be solved in a leader-follower manner.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a widely used form of models for ship maneuvering, whose nonlinearities entail continuous but nonsmooth second-order modulus terms. For such models bifurcations of straight motion are not amenable to standard center manifold reduction and normal forms. Based on a recently developed analytical approach, we nevertheless determine the character of local bifurcations when stabilizing the straight motion course with standard proportional control. For a specific model class we perform a detailed analysis of the linearization to determine the location of these bifurcations in the control parameter space and its dependence on selected design parameters. By computing the analytically derived characteristic parameters, we find that “safe” supercritical Andronov–Hopf bifurcations are typical. Through numerical continuation we provide a more global bifurcation analysis, which identifies the arrangement and relative location of stable and unstable equilibria and periodic orbits.},

To do that, we use a geometric object called Oseledets’ filtration of the system. Further, we show how to use the exponents and the Oseledets’ filtration to design a quantization scheme for state estimation of switched linear systems. Then, we prove that we can make this algorithm work at an average data-rate arbitrarily close to the upper bound we provided for the estimation entropy of the given system. Furthermore, we can choose the average data-rate to be arbitrarily close to the estimation entropy whenever the switched linear system is regular. We show that, under the regularity assumption, the quantization scheme is completely causal in the sense that it depends only on information that is available up to the current time instant. We show that regularity is a natural property of many practical systems, such as Markov jump linear systems, and give sufficient conditions for it.},

This paper studies the problem of exponential tracking and disturbance rejection for nonlinear reaction convection diffusion equations via Dirichlet or Neumann boundary control. Disturbances are present both in the equation and on the boundary. The tracking problem is simply a nonlinear dynamic regulator problem. If an initial condition is not compatible with a reference, the nonlinear dynamic regulator problem does not have a solution. Thus, we split the tracking problem into two problems to relax the compatibility condition. We choose one problem to be exponentially stable and leave everything else in a dynamic regulator problem. Then a controller is just a solution component of the dynamic regulator problem, while the tracking error is given by the solution of the exponentially stable problem. The controller can be obtained by integrating the dynamic regulator equation and using the reference condition. The dynamic regulator problem with the obtained controller becomes an initial boundary value problem. We then transfer the initial boundary value problem into an equivalent integral equation and prove that the integral equation has a unique global solution if the nonlinearity is globally Lipschitz. In addition, a numerical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies the convergence of a spatial semidiscretization for a backward semilinear stochastic parabolic equation. The filtration is general, and the spatial semidiscretization uses the standard continuous piecewise linear finite element method. Firstly, higher regularity of the solution to the continuous equation is derived. Secondly, the first-order spatial accuracy is derived for the spatial semidiscretization. Thirdly, an application of the theoretical results to a stochastic linear quadratic control problem is presented.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with a class of mean-field type coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MF-FBSDEs), in which the coupling appears in integral terms, terminal terms, and initial terms. Inspired by various mean-field type linear-quadratic (MF-LQ) optimal control problems, we propose a type of randomized domination-monotonicity conditions, under which and the usual Lipschitz condition we obtain a well-posedness result on MF-FBSDEs in the sense of square integrability including the unique solvability, an estimate of the solution, and the related continuous dependence property of the solution on the coefficients. The result of MF-FBSDEs in turn extends MF-LQ problems in the literature to a general situation where the initial states or the terminal states are also controlled at the same time, and gives explicit expressions of the related unique optimal controls.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we study the controllability of the nodal profile for quasilinear hyperbolic systems with initial data and nodal profile given in a neighborhood of a nonuniform steady state, and obtain the corresponding exact boundary controllability of the nodal profile and its asymptotic stability on an infinite time interval. In order to achieve this, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of a semiglobal classical solution to the one-sided mixed initial-boundary value problem of nonautonomous quasilinear hyperbolic systems and discuss the asymptotic behavior of the solution with respect to the variable. Then, under the condition that the given nodal profile and boundary functions possess a certain exponential or polynomial decaying property with respect to the variable, we can prove the exponential or polynomial stability of the solution toward this nonuniform steady state.},
