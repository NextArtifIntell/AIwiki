  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns the qualitative analysis on a reaction-diffusion SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemic model governed by the saturated incidence infection mechanism in advective environments. A variational expression of the basic reproduction number was derived and the global dynamics of the system in terms of was established: the disease-free equilibrium is unique and linearly stable if and at least an endemic equilibrium exists if . More precisely, we explore qualitative properties of the basic reproduction number and investigate the spatial distribution of the individuals with respect to the dispersal and advection. We find that the concentration phenomenon occurs when the advection is large and the infectious disease will be eradicated for the small dispersal of infected individual. Our theoretical results may shed some new insight into the infectious disease prediction and control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present an effective model of “space-coiled metacrystals” composed of a periodic array of sound rigid blocks into which long slots have been coiled up. The periodic cell of the block contains a coiled slot whose straight parts are at wavelength scale, which enables the appearance of Bragg resonances. These resonances, which prevent high transmission, compete with the Fabry–Pérot resonances of the entire slot, which foster perfect transmission. This results in complex scattering properties driven by the characteristics of the turning regions that act as atoms in a one-dimensional coiled crystal. Using appropriate scaling and combining two-scale homogenization with matched asymptotic techniques, the modeling of such metacrystals is proposed. The resulting model is validated through a comparison with full-wave numerics in both harmonic and transient regimes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The aim of this article is to advance the field of metamaterials by proposing formulas for the design of high-contrast metamaterials with prescribed subwavelength defect mode eigenfrequencies. This is achieved in two settings: (i) design of non-Hermitian static materials and (ii) design of instantly changing non-Hermitian time-dependent materials. The design of static materials is achieved via characterizing equations for the defect mode eigenfrequencies in the setting of a defected dimer material. These characterizing equations are the basis for obtaining formulas for the material parameters of the defect which admit given defect mode eigenfrequencies. Explicit formulas are provided in the setting of one and two given defect mode eigenfrequencies in the setting of a defected chain of dimers. In the time-dependent case, we first analyze the influence of time boundaries on the subwavelength solutions. We find that subwavelength solutions are preserved if and only if the material parameters satisfy a temporal Snell’s law across the time boundary. The same result also identifies the change of the time frequencies uniquely. Combining this result with those on the design of static materials, we obtain an explicit formula for the material design of instantly changing defected dimer materials which admit subwavelength modes with prescribed time-dependent defect mode eigenfrequency. Finally, we use this formula to create materials which admit spatio-temporally localized defect modes.},

In this paper, a coupled electro-calcium model was developed and implemented to computationally explore the effects of neuronal synapse loss, in particular in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. Established parameters affected by Alzheimer’s disease, such as synapse loss, calcium leaks at deteriorating synaptic contacts, and downregulation of the calcium buffer calbindin, are subject to this study. Reconstructed neurons are used to define the computational domain for a system of PDEs and ODEs, discretized by finite differences and solved with a semi-implicit second-order time integrator. The results show neuronal resilience during synapse loss. When incorporating calcium leaks at affected synapses, neurons lose their ability to produce synapse-to-nucleus calcium signals, necessary for learning, plasticity, and neuronal survival. Downregulation of calbindin concentrations partially recovers the signaling pathway to the cell nucleus. These results could define future research pathways toward stabilizing the calcium signaling pathways during Alzheimer’s disease.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Inspired by applications, we study the effect of interface slip on the effective wave propagation in poroelastic materials, which are composites consisting of elastic frames whose pore space is filled with fluid. The current literature on the homogenization for the poroelastic wave equations are all based on the no-slip interface condition posed on the microscale. However, for certain pore fluids, the no-slip condition is known to be physically invalid. In the literature, slip boundary conditions have been considered for porous materials with rigid solid frames. For these rigid porous materials, the wave can only propagate in the pore fluid and hence the equations for the microscale are posed only in the pore space. Consequently, the slip on the interface involves only the fluid velocity and the fluid stress. In contrast, for poroelastic materials, the wave can propagate not only in the pore fluid but also in the solid frame; hence the slip conditions involve the velocities on both sides of the interface, rather than just the fluid side. With this slip condition, a variational boundary value problem governing the small vibrations of a periodic mixture of an elastic solid and a slightly viscous fluid is studied in this paper. The method of two-scale convergence is used to obtain the macroscopic behavior of the solution and to identify the role played by the slip interface condition.},

In order to establish links between microscopic and macroscopic tissue properties, we perform a multiscale analysis of a model of growing plant tissue with subcellular resolution. We use homogenization to rigorously derive the corresponding macroscopic tissue-scale model. Tissue-scale mechanical properties are computed from microscopic structural and material properties, taking into account deformation by the growth field. We then consider case studies and numerically compare the detailed microscopic model and the tissue-scale model, both implemented using the finite element method. We find that the macroscopic model can be used to efficiently make predictions about several configurations of interest. Our work will help making links between microscopic measurements and macroscopic observations in growing tissues.},

The resulting higher-order interaction structure can then be encoded by means of a hypernetwork. In this paper we consider dynamical systems on hypernetworks by defining a class of admissible maps for every such hypernetwork. We explain how to classify robust cluster synchronization patterns on hypernetworks by finding balanced partitions, and we generalize the concept of a graph fibration to the hypernetwork context. We also show that robust synchronization patterns are only fully determined by polynomial admissible maps of high order. This means that, unlike in dyadic networks, cluster synchronization on hypernetworks is a higher-order, i.e., nonlinear, effect. We give a formula, in terms of the order of the hypernetwork, for the degree of the polynomial admissible maps that determine robust synchronization patterns. We also demonstrate that this degree is optimal by investigating a class of examples. We conclude by demonstrating how this effect may cause remarkable synchrony breaking bifurcations that occur at high polynomial degree.},

We study a density description of a Deffuant–Weisbuch BCM on hypergraphs. We derive a rate equation for the mean-field opinion density as the number of agents becomes infinite, and we prove that this rate equation yields a probability density that converges to noninteracting opinion clusters. Using numerical simulations, we examine bifurcations of the density-based BCM’s steady-state opinion clusters and demonstrate that the agent-based BCM converges to the density description of the BCM as the number of agents becomes infinite.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For reaction networks arising in systems biology, the capacity for two or more steady states, that is, multistationarity, is an important property that underlies biochemical switches. Another property receiving much attention recently is absolute concentration robustness (ACR), which means that some species concentration is the same at all positive steady states. In this work, we investigate the prevalence of each property while paying close attention to when the properties occur together. Specifically, we consider a stochastic block framework for generating random networks and prove edge-probability thresholds at which, with high probability, multistationarity appears and ACR becomes rare. We also show that the small window in which both properties occur only appears in networks with many species. Taken together, our results confirm that, in random reversible networks, ACR and multistationarity together, or even ACR on its own, is highly atypical. Our proofs rely on two prior results, one pertaining to the prevalence of networks with deficiency zero and the other “lifting” multistationarity from small networks to larger ones.},

Because of the significance of remediating contaminated ecosystems, many mathematical models have been developed to describe the interactions between populations and toxicants in polluted aquatic environments. These models typically neglect the consequences of toxicant-induced behavioral changes on population dynamics. Taking into account that individuals may flee from areas with high toxicant concentrations to areas with low toxicant concentrations in order to improve their chances of survival, growth, and reproduction, we develop a diffusive population-toxicant model with toxicant-taxis. We establish the global well-posedness of our model and prove the global stability of spatially homogeneous toxicant-only steady states and population-toxicant coexistence steady states under some conditions. We find conditions under which stable spatially inhomogeneous steady states become unstable to trigger spatial pattern formations as the toxicant-taxis is strong. We also identify a narrow parameter regime in which toxicant-only and population-toxicant coexistence steady states are bistable. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate that spatial aggregation and segregation patterns between the population and the toxicant will typically emerge. Our study highlights the important effects of toxicant-induced movement responses on the spatial distributions of populations in polluted aquatic environments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. One of the most important branches of nonlinear control theory of dynamical systems is the so-called sliding mode. Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law that brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given sliding surface. Here, dynamics become completely independent of the model parameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we study this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural constraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values only over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also not perfectly known a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between two values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of time-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary state-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is only apparently confined to the linear setting and also allows one study an important set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to epidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people and the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. We prove the global convergence of epidemic sliding-mode control schemes applied to two popular dynamical systems used in epidemiology, i.e., SEIR and SAIR, and based on the introduction of severe restrictions like lockdowns. Results obtained in the literature regarding control of many other epidemiological models are also generalized by casting them within a general sliding-mode theory.},

One of the most fundamental questions for self-organizing swarms is whether the swarms disperse or remain in a spatially cohesive configuration.

The self-propulsion term is assumed to be continuously differentiable and to grow faster than , that is, as . We establish that the velocity and acceleration of the particles are ultimately bounded. We show that when is trivial, the positions of the particles are also ultimately bounded. For systems with , we show that, while the system might infinitely drift away from its initial location, the particles remain within a bounded distance from the generalized center of mass of the system, which geometrically coincides with the weighted average of agent positions. The weights are determined by the coefficients of the projection matrix onto . We also discuss the ultimate boundedness for systems with bounded coupling, including the Morse potential systems, and systems governed by power-law potentials with strong repulsion properties. We show that the former systems are ultimately bounded in the velocity-acceleration domain, whereas the models based on the power-law potentials are not.},

In contrast, when the diffusion rates are sufficiently small, the metapopulation growth rate is maximized when all resources are concentrated in one of the most downstream locations.

However, drawing from social contagion theory, we assume that as the disease spreads and prevention measures are enacted, noncompliance with prevention measures also spreads throughout the population. We prove global existence of classical solutions of our model, and then perform -type analysis and determine asymptotic behavior of the model in different parameter regimes.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze the searching strategies of a forager diffusing in the whole space via an equation of fractional type. Specifically, the diffusion of the forager is regulated by a Lévy flight whose exponent can be chosen in order to optimize a suitable foraging efficiency functional. Here, the dimension of the space is arbitrary. On the one hand, we show that the exponent corresponding to the limit case of heavy-tailed Lévy flights is a pessimizer for the efficiency functional. On the other hand, we prove that, in situations of biological interest, one finds the most rewarding strategies arbitrarily close to . The combination of these results gives that the most rewarding searching option may turn out to be unfeasible, or at least unreliable, in practice, since small perturbations of the optimal searching exponent lead to pessimal patterns. The cases analyzed specifically are those of a target located in the proximity of the forager and that of sparse prey modeled by a target infinitely far from the initial position of the seeker. The efficiency functionals taken into account are either of pointwise type (in which the predator and the prey are modeled by moving points) or of set-dependent type (in which the predator and the prey correspond to regions of space with uniform density, thus modeling also the case of a sight range of the biological individuals involved). To implement our analysis, we also provide a number of structural results about finiteness, continuity, and asymptotic behaviors of the efficiency functionals. It is suggestive to relate the adoption of the most rewarding searching pattern close to pessimizers to a “high-risk/high-gain” strategy, in which the forager aims at high-energy content prey to mitigate the risk of failure. This setting is also connected to foraging modes of “ambush” type.},

The least number of observation directions is given in terms of the number of the point sources. Having identified the point sources, under certain conditions, we further show that the multifrequency far field patterns at a fixed observation direction uniquely determine the narrowest strip containing the source support. With the increase of the number of observation directions, a convex hull of the source support can be obtained. Based on the constructive uniqueness proof, we introduce a novel direct sampling method both for locating the point sources and for reconstructing the support of the extended source. A formula for computing the polarization strengths is also given. Numerical examples in two dimensions are presented to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods for multiscale elastic sources.},

First, it is shown that the ODE version of the model has a Bogdanov–Takens (BT) singularity or a weak focus with multiplicity at most 1 for different parameter values. As the parameters vary, the ODE model undergoes supercritical Hopf bifurcation and supercritical BT bifurcation. Our analysis indicates that there exists a threshold value of the activation rate of T cells, below which tumor immune escape occurs, above or at which T cells and tumor cells coexist in the form of a stable periodic oscillation or steady state. Second, we study how the immune response delay affects the dynamics of the model. Our results reveal that the delay can destabilize the stable positive equilibrium through Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation are derived. When there is a cusp, we show that it is a BT singularity for any delay and the delay model also undergoes BT bifurcation. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

Using the perfectly matched layer (PML) method, we truncate the unbounded background medium and propose an approximate problem on the truncated domain. The well-posedness of the PML problem and the exponential convergence of the approximate solution to the exact solution are established.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Random walks represent an important tool for probing the structural and dynamical properties of networks and modeling transport and diffusion processes on networks. However, when individuals’ movements become dictated by more complicated factors, e.g., scenarios that involve complex decision making, the linear paradigm of classical random walks lacks the ability to capture dynamically rich behaviors. One modification that addresses this issue is to allow transition probabilities to depend on the current system state, resulting in a nonlinear random walk. While the resulting nonlinearity has been shown to give rise to an array of more complex dynamics, the patterns that emerge, in particular on regular network topologies, remain unexplored and poorly understood. Here we study nonlinear random walks on regular networks. We present a number of stability results for the uniform state where random walkers are uniformly distributed throughout the network, characterizing the spectral properties of its Jacobian which we use to characterize its bifurcations. These spectral properties may also be used to understand the patterns that emerge beyond bifurcations, which consist of oscillating short wavelength patterns and localized structures for negative and positive bias, respectively. We also uncover a subcriticality in the bifurcation for positive bias, leading to a hysteresis loop and multistability.},

As measurements, we use the generated pressure, that we denote by , depending on only one fixed point , where we measure, the time variable , in a large enough interval, and the incidence frequency , in a large enough band. These measurements are repeated while the location of the nanoparticle is moved inside to scan it. We show that these measurements (which are in terms of dimensionality) are enough to reconstruct both the sound speed, the mass density, and the permittivity inside (i.e., coefficients of each in terms of dimensionality). Indeed, from the behavior of the measured pressure in terms of time, we can estimate the travel time of the pressure, for arriving points inside , then using the eikonal equation we reconstruct the acoustic speed of propagation, inside . In addition, we reconstruct the internal values of the acoustic Green’s function. From the singularity analysis of this Green’s function, we extract the integrals along the geodesics, for internal arriving points, of the logarithmic gradient of the mass density. Solving this (internal) integral geometric problem provides us with the values of the mass density function inside . Finally, from the behavior of with respect to the frequency , we detect the generated plasmonic resonances from which we reconstruct the permittivity inside .

On the other hand, if a polynomial dynamical system has a weakly reversible deficiency zero (WR0) realization, then its dynamics is known to be remarkably simple: oscillations and chaotic dynamics are ruled out, and, up to linear conservation laws, there exists a single positive steady state, which is asymptotically stable. Here we describe an algorithm for finding WR0 realizations of polynomial dynamical systems, whenever such realizations exist.},

In this article, we explore properties common to “almost every” system with a fixed structure and how the properties can be read from the corresponding connection graph. A solution of a system is called robust if it persists despite small changes in . We establish methods for determining robustness that depends on the structure, as expressed in the properties of the corresponding directed graph of the structured system. The keys to understanding linear and nonlinear structured systems are subsets of variables that we call forward and backward bottlenecks. In particular, when robustness fails in a structured system, it is due to the existence of a unique “backward bottleneck” that we call a “minimax bottleneck.” We present a numerical method for locating the minimax bottleneck. We show how to remove it by adding edges to the graph.},

To our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model of flow measurement using partial differential equations. This model is proved well-posed, and the corresponding algorithm is derived to compute the velocity field efficiently. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our model. The comparison results demonstrate that our model is ten times more accurate than ADCP.

  abstract     = {Abstract. A unified method for analyzing the dynamics and topological structure associated with a class of Floquet topological insulators is presented. The method is applied to a system that describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the bulk of a two-dimensional lattice that is helically driven in the direction of propagation. Tight-binding approximations are employed to derive reduced dynamical systems. Further asymptotic approximations, valid in the high-frequency driving regime, yield a time-averaged system which governs the leading order behavior of the wave. From this follows an analytic calculation of the Berry connection, curvature, and Chern number via analyzing the local behavior of the eigenfunctions near the critical points of the spectrum. Examples include honeycomb, Lieb, kagome, and 1/5-depleted lattices. In the nonlinear regime, novel equations governing slowly varying wave envelopes are derived. For the honeycomb lattice, numerical simulations show that for relatively small nonlinear effects a striking spiral pattern occurs; as nonlinearity increases, localized structures emerge, and for somewhat higher nonlinearity the waves appear to collapse.},

When ions are crowded, the effect of steric repulsion between ions (which can produce oscillations in charge density profiles) becomes significant and the conventional Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation should be modified.

This motivates us to derive a general model of PB equations called the PB-steric equations with a parameter , which not only include the conventional and modified PB equations but also have oscillatory total ionic charge density under different assumptions of steric effects and chemical potentials. As , the PB-steric equation becomes the conventional PB equation, but as , the concentrations of ions and solvent molecules are determined by the Lambert type functions. To approach the modified PB equations, we study the asymptotic limit of PB-steric equations with the Robin boundary condition as goes to infinity. Our theoretical results show that the PB-steric equations (for ) may include the conventional and modified PB equations.

However, recent experiments have shown that many genes in mammalian cells may produce nonexponential switching time distributions, implying the existence of multiple promoter states and molecular memory in the promoter switching dynamics. Here we analytically solve a gene expression model with random bursting and complex promoter switching, and derive the time-dependent distributions of the mRNA and protein copy numbers, generalizing the steady-state solution obtained in [T. Zhou and J. Zhang, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 72 (2012), pp. 789–818] and [U. Herbach, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 79 (2019), pp. 1007–1029]. Using multiscale simplification techniques, we find that molecular memory has no influence on the time-dependent distribution when promoter switching is very fast or very slow, while it significantly affects the distribution when promoter switching is neither too fast nor too slow. By analyzing the dynamical phase diagram of the system, we also find that molecular memory in the inactive gene state weakens transient and stationary bimodality of the copy number distribution, while molecular memory in the active gene state enhances such bimodality.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Diffusion in heterogeneous media partitioned by semipermeable interfaces has a wide range of applications in the physical and life sciences, ranging from thermal conduction in composite media, gas permeation in soils, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, and intercellular gap junctions. Many of these systems involve three-dimensional diffusion in an array of parallel planes with homogeneity in the lateral directions, so that they can be reduced to effective one-dimensional (1D) models. In this paper we develop a probabilistic model of single-particle diffusion in 1D multilayered media by constructing a multilayered version of so-called snapping out Brownian motion (BM). The latter sews together successive rounds of reflected BM, each of which is restricted to a single layer. Each round of reflected BM is killed when the local time at one end of the layer exceeds an independent, exponentially distributed random variable. (The local time specifies the amount of time a reflected Brownian particle spends in a neighborhood of a boundary.) The particle then immediately resumes reflected BM in the same layer or the layer on the other side of the boundary with equal probability, and the process is iterated We proceed by constructing a last renewal equation for multilayered snapping out BM that relates the full probability density to the probability densities of partially reflected BM in each layer. We then show how transfer matrices can be used to solve the Laplace transformed renewal equation, and prove that the renewal equation and corresponding multilayer diffusion equation are equivalent. We illustrate the theory by analyzing the first passage time (FPT) problem for escape at the exterior boundaries of the domain. Finally, we use the renewal approach to incorporate a generalization of snapping out BM based on the encounter-based method for surface absorption; each round of reflected BM is now killed according to a nonexponential distribution for each local time threshold. This is achieved by considering a corresponding first renewal equation that relates the full probability density to the FPT densities for killing each round of reflected BM. We show that for certain configurations, nonexponential killing leads to an effective time-dependent permeability that is normalizable but heavy-tailed.},

Inverse problems of recovering space-dependent parameters, e.g., initial condition, space-dependent source, or potential coefficient in a subdiffusion model from the terminal observation have been extensively studied in recent years.

In this work, we present uniqueness and stability results for three canonical inverse problems, e.g., backward problem, inverse source, and inverse potential problems from the terminal observation at an unknown time. The subdiffusive nature of the problem indicates that one can simultaneously determine the terminal time and space-dependent parameter. The analysis is based on explicit solution representations, asymptotic behavior of the Mittag–Leffler function, and mild regularity conditions on the problem data. Further, we present several one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments to illustrate the feasibility of the approach.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Understanding and predicting the dynamical properties of systems involving dry friction is a major concern in physics and engineering. It abounds in many mechanical processes, from the sound produced by a violin to the screeching of chalk on a blackboard to human infant crawling dynamics and friction-based locomotion of a multitude of living organisms (snakes, bacteria, scallops) to the displacement of mechanical structures (building, bridges, nuclear plants, massive industrial infrastructures) under earthquakes and beyond. Surprisingly, even for low-dimensional systems, the modeling of dry friction in the presence of random forcing has not been elucidated. In this paper, we propose a piecewise deterministic Markov process approach modeling a system with dry friction including different coefficients for the static and dynamic forces. In this mathematical framework, we derive the corresponding Kolmogorov equations to compute statistical quantities of interest related to the distributions of the static (sticked) and dynamic phases. We show ergodicity and provide a representation formula of the stationary measure using independent identically distributed portions of the trajectory (excursions). We also obtain deterministic characterizations of the Laplace transforms of the probability density functions of the durations of the static and dynamic phases. In particular, the analysis of the power spectral density of the velocity reveals a critical value of the noise correlation time below which the correlations of the dynamic behaviors coincide with those of the white noise limit. The existence of such a critical value was already mentioned in the physical literature [Geffert and Just, Phys. Rev. E, 95 (2017), 062111].},

Our resulting algorithm is able to sample from a specified measure on partitions or spanning forests. Being able to sample from a specified measure is a requirement of what we consider as the gold standard in quantifying the extent to which a particular map is a gerrymander. Our proposal chain modifies the recently developed method called recombination (ReCom), which draws spanning trees on joined partitions and then randomly cuts them to repartition. We improve the computational efficiency by augmenting the statespace from partitions to spanning forests. The extra information accelerates the computation of the forward and backward proposal probabilities which are required for the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. We demonstrate this method by sampling redistricting plans on several measures of interest and find promising convergence results on several key observables of interest. We also explore some limitations in the measures that are efficient to sample from and investigate the feasibility of using parallel tempering to extend this space of measures.},

We are also interested in the problem of minimal measurement number. We show that at least but no more than measurements are needed for the reconstruction of all , whereas the minimal measurement number is exactly if we pursue the recovery of almost all signals.

We optimize the total emission reduction cost by a two- step process. Fixing the auction amount, we optimize the emission reduction control strategy, and then relate the value function to a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The existence and uniqueness of the classical solution of the equation are proved so as to describe the optimal control strategy. After that, we find the optimal auction amount by determining the zero point of the derivative. We then show that the auction amount minimizing the total cost is unique in a special case. Finally, the relationships between the optimal auction amount and the total cost and various parameters are discussed through numerical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the dynamics of unsaturated flows within a fluid-infused wet patch in a thin porous layer, coupled with the transport of passive particles, partly inspired by some art practice and environmental and industrial activities. The role of wetting and capillary forces and the influence of evaporation are both emphasized. Two coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are first derived to describe the time evolution of the fluid saturation and concentration of passive particles. Three dimensionless parameters are identified after appropriate nondimensionalization of the coupled PDEs, the influence of which is demonstrated through asymptotic and numerical solutions at both the early and late times. With evaporation, in particular, the fluid front first arrives at a maximum location after an initial period of spreading. Thereafter, the front starts to recede until the fluid drains out at a finite time. Correspondingly, the concentration of particles blows up at a finite time, when the size of the wet region shrinks to zero. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution of particles evolves towards a universal curve near the front at late times, as the particles gradually accumulate at the front of the wet patch. It is recognized that, while the spreading of fluid within a porous layer behaves similar to that of a viscous gravity current subject to volume loss, the frontal structure for the concentration of particles, to some extent, is similar to that of an intruding inviscid gravity current.},

The evolution of the gel is described by a model that incorporates non-linear elasticity, Stefan–Maxwell diffusion and interfacial gradient free energy to account for phase separation of the gel. A bifurcation analysis of the homogeneous equilibrium states reveals three solution branches at low ion concentrations in the bath, giving way to only one above a critical ion concentration. We present numerical solutions that capture both the spatial heterogeneity and the multiple timescales involved in the process of collapse. These solutions are complemented by two analytical studies. Firstly, a phase-plane analysis that reveals the existence of a depletion front for the transition from the highly swollen to the new collapsed equilibrium state. This depletion front is initiated after the fast ionic diffusion has set the initial condition for this time regime. Secondly, we perform a linear stability analysis about the homogeneous states that show that for a range of ion concentrations in the bath, spinodal decomposition of the swollen state gives rise to localized solvent-rich(poor) and, due to the electroneutrality condition, ion-poor(rich) phases that coarsen on the route to collapse.

The light-grating interaction excites gap solitons, a type of localized nonlinear coherent state which propagates with a central frequency in the forbidden band gap, resulting in a dramatically slower group velocity. Due to the nature of the band gap, a substantial amount of light is back-reflected by the grating’s strong reflective properties. We optimize, via a projected gradient descent method, the transmission efficiency of previously designed nonuniform grating structures in order to couple more slow light into the grating. We further explore the space of possible grating designs, using genetic algorithms, along with a previously unexplored design parameter: the grating chirp. Through these methods, we find structures that couple a greater fraction of light into the grating with the added bonus of creating slower pulses.},

It disproportionately affects young children, with two-thirds of fatalities occurring in under-fives. Individuals acquire protection from disease through repeated exposure, and this immunity plays a crucial role in the dynamics of malaria spread. We develop a novel age-structured PDE malaria model, which couples vector-host epidemiological dynamics with immunity dynamics. Our model tracks the acquisition and loss of antidisease immunity during transmission and its corresponding nonlinear feedback onto the transmission parameters. We derive the basic reproduction number as the threshold condition for the stability of disease-free equilibrium; we also interpret probabilistically as a weighted sum of cases generated by infected individuals at different infectious stages and different ages. We parametrize our model using demographic and immunological data from sub-Saharan regions. Numerical bifurcation analysis demonstrates the existence of an endemic equilibrium, and we observe a forward bifurcation in . Our numerical simulations reproduce the heterogeneity in the age distributions of immunity profiles and infection status created by frequent exposure. Motivated by the recently approved RTS,S vaccine, we also study the impact of vaccination; our results show a reduction in severe disease among young children but a small increase in severe malaria among older children due to lower acquired immunity from delayed exposure.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce the first two-way coupled model for the thermo-viscous damping of a mechanical structure (such as quartz tuning fork) that is forced by the weak acoustic and thermal waves generated when a laser source periodically interacts with a trace gas. The model is based on a Helmholtz system of thermo-visco-acoustic equations in the fluid, together with a system of equations for the temperature and the displacement of the structure. These two subsystems are coupled across the fluid-structure interface via several conditions. With this model, the user specifies the geometry of the structure and the viscous and thermal parameters of the fluid, and the model outputs an effective damping parameter and a signal strength that is proportional to the concentration of the trace gas. This new model is a significant improvement over existing one-way coupled models in which damping effects are incorporated via a priori laboratory measurements. Analytical solutions derived for an annular structure show reasonable agreement between the one-way and two-way coupled models at higher ambient pressures. However, at low ambient pressure the one-way coupled model does not adequately capture thermo-viscous effects.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Long-term behaviors of biochemical systems are described by steady states in deterministic models and stationary distributions in stochastic models. Obtaining their analytic solutions can be done for limited cases, such as linear or finite-state systems, as it generally requires solving many coupled equations. Interestingly, analytic solutions can be easily obtained when underlying networks have special topologies, called weak reversibility (WR) and zero deficiency (ZD), and the kinetic law follows a generalized form of mass-action kinetics. However, such desired topological conditions do not hold for the majority of cases. Thus, translating networks to have WR and ZD while preserving the original dynamics was proposed. Yet, this approach is limited because manually obtaining the desired network translation among the large number of candidates is challenging. Here, we prove necessary conditions for having WR and ZD after translation, and based on these conditions, we develop a user-friendly computational package, TOWARDZ, that automatically and efficiently identifies translated networks with WR and ZD. This allows us to quantitatively examine how likely it is to obtain WR and ZD after translation depending on the number of species and reactions. Importantly, we also describe how our package can be used to analytically derive steady states of deterministic models and stationary distributions of stochastic models. TOWARDZ provides an effective tool to analyze biochemical systems.},

When total particle numbers are fixed and finite, simulations of corresponding microscopic dynamics exhibit stochastic effects which can induce a variety of interesting behaviors not present in the large system limit. In this article we undertake a systematic examination of finite-size fluctuations in a general class of particle models whose statistics correspond to those of stochastic kinematic flows. Doing so, we are able to characterize phenomena including quasi-jams in models of traffic flow; stochastic pattern formation among spatially coupled oscillators; anomalous bulk subdiffusion in porous media; and travelling wave fluctuations in a model of bacterial swarming.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A generalization of the Schwarz integral formula in the class of multiply connected circular domains is constructed. A classical Schwarz integral formula retrieves, up to an imaginary constant, an analytic function in a domain given its real part on the boundary of a domain; Poisson integral formulas are well-known examples for simply connected domains. The generalized integral formulas derived here retrieve an analytic function given more general linear combinations of its real and imaginary parts on each boundary component of a multiply connected domain. Those linear combinations can be different on each boundary component. The chief mathematical tool is the prime function of a multiply connected circular domain. A Schwarz integral formula for such domains, retrieving an analytic function given its real part on all boundary components, was derived in terms of the prime function by Crowdy [Complex Var. Elliptic Equ., 53 (2008), pp. 221–236]. The present paper combines those formulas with use of radial-slit conformal mappings, also expressible in terms of the prime function, to produce integral expressions for analytic functions where more general linear combinations of their real and imaginary parts are specified on the boundary components of a multiply connected domain. We refer to the resulting expressions as generalized Schwarz integral formulas. Their usefulness and versatility are showcased by application to three topical problems: finding the potential around periodic interdigitated electrodes, solving the free boundary problem for hollow vortex wakes behind a bluff body, and determining the two-phase flow over a so-called liquid-infused surface.},

Here we explore both weakly and strongly nonlinear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored nonlinear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg–de Vries, Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev–Petviashvilli equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we study the problem of stabilizing the traffic flow on a ring road to a uniform steady-state using autonomous vehicles (AV). Traffic is represented at a microscopic level via a Bando-Follow-the-Leader model capable of reproducing phantom jams. For the single-lane case, a single AV can stabilize an arbitrary large ring road with an arbitrary large number of cars. Moreover, this stabilization is exponentially quick with a decay rate independent of the number of cars and a control gain also independent of the number of cars. On the other side, the stabilization domain and stabilization time depend on the number of cars. Two types of controller algorithms are proposed: a proportional control and a proportional-integral control. In both cases, the measurements used by the controller only depend on the local data around the AV, enabling an easy implementation. After numerical tests of the single-lane case, a multilane model is described using a safety-incentive mechanism for lane change. Numerical simulations for the multilane ring road suggest that the control strategy is also very efficient in such a setting, even with a single AV.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Asymptotic methods are employed to analyze earlier two-phase steady-state Euler–Euler models that were originally intended as simplified representations for gas-solid flow in an ironmaking blast furnace; more generally, however, they can be thought of as models for two-phase flow in countercurrent moving bed reactors. A scaling analysis, based around the fact that the solid velocity is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the gas velocity, indicates that the effects of viscosity and inertia are basically negligible compared with those of gravity and interphase momentum transfer. The resulting reduced model yields quasi-analytical expressions for the solid fraction and the gas velocity, with the former being directly related to the shapes of the reactor and any stagnant zone that may form as a consequence of solids or granular materials being able to withstand substantial amounts of shear; in ironmaking blast furnaces, this occurs near the bottom of the reactor, and the zone is commonly known as the deadman. On the other hand, the solid velocity can be found via a numerical solution of Laplace’s equation; nevertheless, the solution is different to that obtained from earlier potential flow models in blast furnace modeling. Most significantly, the current model would form the basis of a computationally efficient approach for modeling transient heat and mass transfer with chemical reactions in a countercurrent moving bed reactor.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Boundary value problems for diffusion in singularly perturbed domains is a topic of considerable current interest. Applications include intracellular diffusive transport and the spread of pollutants or heat from localized sources. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method for characterizing the approach to steady state in the case of two-dimensional (2D) diffusion. This was based on a local measure of the relaxation rate known as the accumulation time . The latter was calculated by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space using a combination of matched asymptotics and Green’s function methods. We thus obtained an asymptotic expansion of in powers of , where specifies the relative size of the holes. In this paper, we develop the corresponding theory for three-dimensional (3D) diffusion. The analysis is a nontrivial extension of the 2D case due to differences in the singular nature of the Laplace transformed Green’s function. In particular, the asymptotic expansion of the solution of the 3D diffusion equation in Laplace space involves terms of order , where is the Laplace variable. These -singularities have to be removed by partial series resummations in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of in powers of .},

It is often interpreted as an approximation to spatially continuous reaction-diffusion models, which, in the limit of an infinitely large population, may be described by means of reaction-diffusion partial differential equations. Analyzing and understanding the relation between different mathematical models for reaction-diffusion dynamics is a research topic of steady interest. In this work, we explore a route to the hydrodynamic limit of the RDME which uses gradient structures. Specifically, we elaborate on a method introduced in [J. Maas and A. Mielke, J. Stat. Phys., 181 (2020), pp. 2257–2303] in the context of well-mixed reaction networks by showing that, once it is complemented with an appropriate limit procedure, it can be applied to spatially extended systems with diffusion. Under the assumption of detailed balance, we write down a gradient structure for the RDME and use the method in order to produce a gradient structure for its hydrodynamic limit, namely, for the corresponding RDPDE.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Heterogeneity plays an important role in cancer genesis and progression. In this paper, we theoretically and computationally show that the increase of heterogeneity signals predeterioration during tumor progression by unified random ordinary differential equations (RODEs). Tumor formation results from a systematic change in organisms, and its causality is complex. Heterogeneity may be one of the key factors under some conditions. Specifically, the interactions between cell populations are modeled by random community matrices in normal tissues, benign tumors, and malignant tumors, and then we prove that the RODEs system describing the cell density of normal tissues or benign tumors becomes unstable as heterogeneity of cell populations or species increases. The increase of heterogeneity is an important signal. Heterogeneity can be viewed as a feature to distinguish benign tumors from malignant tumors under certain circumstances. Furthermore, we show that with the increase of heterogeneity, the divergence speed of the RODEs system becomes faster, which implies that malignant tumors with higher heterogeneity may develop faster and have poorer prognoses. Our theoretical findings can explain some noteworthy phenomena in various datasets in tumor patients and our biological experiments in mice from a mathematical viewpoint. Particularly, clinical data and mutation information from the cancer genome atlas and our experiments in mice revealed that tumors with higher heterogeneity usually show shorter survival time, whereas tumors with lower heterogeneity tend to have better prognosis, which also indicates that heterogeneity can be used as a potential biomarker in future clinical diagnosis. Targeting the heterogeneity may be a potential strategy for the cancer treatment.},

By means of a numerical experiment, which was made employing a previously developed macroscopic model for charge and energy transport in graphene, we analyze how fast a suspended graphene sheet heats up when it is subject to a constant homogeneous electric field and how it reaches the equilibrium state once the electric field is turned off. We consider electrons and all phonon branches and show that the influence of the out-of-plane acoustical phonons on the final equilibrium temperature is notable due to their great surface heat capacity. The influence of the electrons on the equilibrium temperature depends on their density; in fact the higher it is, the more energy they gain from the electric field. The behavior of the system can be theoretically justified on the basis of two important physical properties: the conservation of the total energy and the increase of the total entropy of the electron-phonon system; of the latter we give an almost explicit expression. After that, we study the electronic thermal and electric conductivity and the thermopower by finding formulas which express them as functions of the electron and phonon temperatures and the electron density by using a suitable recasting of the macroscopic model in the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics.},

The claim has been proved previously for equilibria alone; however, the generalisation to include oscillation involves extensive development of rather different techniques. Several inheritance results for multistationarity and oscillation in mass action CRNs, including the main result of this paper, are gathered into a single theorem. Examples are presented showing how these results can be used together to make claims about reaction networks based on knowledge of their subnetworks.

We illustrate the DTB by two sets of numerical experiments. In the first set, the perturbation is a smooth, rapidly oscillating sinusoid, and in the second, a fractal curve. The experiments reveal that the match between the DTB and reconstruction is worse as gets rougher. This is in agreement with the proof of the DTB, which suggests that the rate of convergence to the limit is . We then propose a new DTB, which exhibits an excellent agreement with reconstructions. Investigation of this phenomenon requires computing the rate of convergence for the new DTB. This, in turn, requires completely new approaches.

An iterative algorithm and a continuous interior penalty finite element method (CIP-FEM) are also proposed for solving the system of equations associated to the coupled PML.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a mathematical theory of acoustic wave scattering in one-dimensional finite high-contrast media. The system considered is constituted of a finite alternance of high-contrast segments of arbitrary lengths and interdistances, called the “resonators,” and a background medium. We prove the existence of subwavelength resonances, which are the counterparts of the well-known Minnaert resonances in three-dimensional systems. One of the main contribution of the paper is to show that the resonant frequencies as well as the transmission and reflection properties of the system can be accurately predicted by a “capacitance” eigenvalue problem, analogously to the three-dimensional setting. Moreover, we discover new properties which are peculiar to the one-dimensional setting, notably the tridiagonal structure of the capacitance matrix as well as the fact that the first resonant frequency is always exactly zero, implying a low-pass filtering property of a one-dimensional chain of resonators. Numerical results considering different situations with to resonators are provided to support our mathematical analysis and to illustrate the various possibilities offered by high-contrast resonators to manipulate waves at subwavelength scales.},

An axisymmetric normal traction is applied to a material surface. The surface is modeled using the Steigmann–Ogden form of surface energy. The problem is solved by using the Boussinesq potentials represented by the Hankel transforms of certain unknown functions. With the help of these functions, the problem can be reduced to a system of two singular integral equations. Two types of material surface tip boundary conditions are considered: free tip conditions and conditions with a compensated surface prestress term. The numerical solution of this system is obtained by expanding each unknown function into a series based on Chebyshev polynomials. Then the approximations of the unknown functions can be obtained from a system of linear algebraic equations. Accuracy of the numerical procedure is studied. Various numerical examples for different values of the surface energy parameters are considered. It is shown that both the surface parameters and the type of tip conditions have significant influence on the behavior of the material system.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose an extension of the well-known Klausmeier model of vegetation to two plant species that consume water at different rates. Rather than competing directly, the plants compete through their intake of water, which is a shared resource between them. In semiarid regions, the Klausmeier model produces vegetation spot patterns. We are interested in how the competition for water affects the coexistence and stability of patches of different plant species. We consider two plant types—a “thirsty” species and a “frugal” species—that only differ by the amount of water they consume per unit growth, while being identical in other aspects. We find that there is a finite range of precipitation rate for which two species can coexist. Outside of that range (when the rate is either sufficiently low or high), the frugal species out-competes the thirsty species. As the precipitation rate is decreased, there is a sequence of stability thresholds such that thirsty plant patches are the first to die off, while the frugal spots remain resilient for longer. The pattern consisting of only frugal spots is the most resilient. The next most resilient pattern consists of all-thirsty patches, with the mixed pattern being less resilient than either of the homogeneous patterns. We also examine numerically what happens for very large precipitation rates. We find that for a sufficiently high rate, the frugal plant takes over the entire range, out-competing the thirsty plant.},

The possible scenarios of the asymmetric competition are explicitly formulated. The numerical bifurcation diagrams show that the environmental parameters affect the asymmetric competition and cause the regime switch between pelagic and benthic producers.

The impact of the presence of only one friction-type infinite memory term on the stability of the piezoelectric coupled plate is investigated. By introducing the so called “minimal state variable” and using semigroup theories, the system is proved to be well-posed. It is found that this kind of memory term still acts as a damping to some extent under certain conditions, but its damping effect is too weak to indirectly stabilize the system exponentially. Based on frequency domain analysis, it is further proved that this system can be indirectly stabilized polynomially by only one friction-type infinite memory term located on one of these strongly coupled PDEs. Especially, the optimality of this decay rate is also further verified by detailed spectral analysis for the system operator.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modeling diffusive processes via a constant effective diffusivity value taken to represent realistic uncertainty or heterogeneity is entrenched in scientific and engineering applications. This brings forth the question, to what extent does the flow pattern changes when symmetry is broken by anisotropy. This study supplies the answer by deriving a class of tridimensional solutions to the steady nonlinear diffusion equation in a spherical domain divided into an arbitrary number of meridian sectors with distinct diffusivities and generation rates. The new family of solutions permits flexible modeling, where traditionally only isotropic radial transport was considered. The flow patterns support an extensive variety of topological terrain via tesseral and sectoral harmonics. The anisotropy gives rise to an unconventional type of a fixed point combining both node and saddle attributes. The contours are nonsmooth on the contiguity planes between sectors and might or might not be localized in the polar angle and/or azimuthal angle , implying a particle might remain confined to a relatively small neighborhood or meander over the sphere. The impact on motion trajectories and thus transport efficiency implies that the energy required to sustain a steady flow is starkly underestimated when symmetry is assumed for simplicity despite the presence of anisotropy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Mean-field equations have been developed recently to approximate the dynamics of the Deffuant model of opinion formation. These equations can describe both fully mixed populations and the case where individuals interact only along edges of a network. In each case, interactions only occur between individuals whose opinions differ by less than a given parameter, called the confidence bound. The size of the confidence bound parameter is known to strongly affect both the dynamics and the number and location of opinion clusters. In this work, we carry out a mathematical analysis of the mean-field equations to investigate the role of the confidence bound and boundaries on these important observables of the model. We consider the limit in which the confidence bound interval is small, and we identify the key mechanisms driving opinion evolution. We show that linear stability analysis can predict the number and location of opinion clusters. Comparison with numerical simulations of the model illustrates that the early-time dynamics and the final cluster locations can be accurately approximated for networks composed of two degree classes, as well as for the case of a fully mixed population.},

This far-field operator is defined in a way to incorporate the possibly nonlinear dispersion relation, a unique feature in waveguides. The factorization method is deployed to establish a rigorous characterization of the range support, which is the support of source in the direction of wave propagation. A related factorization-based sampling method is also discussed. These sampling methods are shown to be capable of imaging the range support of the source.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Understanding the properties of charge dynamics is crucial to many practical applications, such as electrochemical energy devices and transmembrane ion channels. This work proposes a Maxwell–Ampère Nernst–Planck (MANP) framework for the description of charge dynamics. The MANP model with a curl-free condition on the electric displacement is shown to be energy dissipative with respect to a convex free-energy functional, and demonstrated to be equivalent to the Poisson–Nernst–Planck model. By the energy dissipation law, the steady state of the MANP model reproduces the charge conserving Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) theory, providing an alternative energy stable approach to study the PB theory. In order to achieve the curl-free condition, a companion local curl-free relaxation algorithm, which is shown to naturally preserve the discrete Gauss’s law and converge robustly with linear computational complexity, is developed for the MANP model. One of the main advantages of our development is that it can efficiently deal with space-dependent permittivity instead of solving the variable-coefficient Poisson’s equation. Many-body effects such as ionic steric effects and Coulomb correlations can be incorporated within the MANP framework to derive modified MANP models for problems in which the mean-field approximation fails. Numerical results on the charge dynamics with such beyond mean-field effects in inhomogeneous dielectric environments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the MANP models in the description of charge dynamics, illustrating that the proposed MANP model provides a general framework for modeling charge dynamics.},

This article considers the minimization of the total number of infected individuals over the course of an epidemic in which the rate of infectious contacts can be reduced by time-dependent nonpharmaceutical interventions. The societal and economic costs of interventions are taken into account using a linear budget constraint which imposes a trade-off between short-term heavy interventions and long-term light interventions. We search for an optimal intervention strategy in an infinite-dimensional space of controls containing multiple consecutive lockdowns, gradually imposed and lifted restrictions, and various heuristic controls based, for example, on tracking the effective reproduction number. Mathematical analysis shows that among all such strategies, the global optimum is achieved by a single constant-level lockdown of maximum possible magnitude. Numerical simulations highlight the need for careful timing of such interventions and illustrate their benefits and disadvantages compared to strategies designed for minimizing peak prevalence. Rather counterintuitively, adding restrictions prior to the start of a well-planned intervention strategy may even increase the total incidence.},

Our analysis is based on the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation, by representing the deviation from the Newtonian viscosity as a singular perturbation in a parameter, leading to a solvability condition at the finger tip, which selects a unique finger width from the family of solutions. We find that the relation between the dimensionless finger width, and the dimensionless group of parameters containing the viscosity and surface tension, has the form for the shear thinning case and for the shear thickening case, in the limit of small . This theoretical estimate is compared with the existing experimental, finger width data as well as the one computed with the linearized model, and a good agreement is found near the power-law exponent, .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with uniqueness of solution of the inverse diffraction by problems by a periodic curve with Dirichlet boundary condition in two dimensions. It is proved that the periodic curve can be uniquely determined by the near-field measurement data corresponding to infinitely many incident plane waves with distinct directions at a fixed frequency. Our proof is based on Schiffer’s idea which consists of two ingredients: (i) the total fields for incident plane waves with distinct directions are linearly independent, and (ii) for a fixed wave number there exist only finitely many linearly independent Dirichlet eigenfunctions in a bounded domain or in a closed waveguide under additional assumptions on the waveguide boundary. Based on the Rayleigh expansion, we prove that the phased near-field data can be uniquely determined by the phaseless near-field data in a bounded domain, with the exception of a finite set of incident angles. Such a phase retrieval result leads to a new uniqueness result for the inverse grating diffraction problem with phaseless near-field data at a fixed frequency. Since the incident direction determines the quasi-periodicity of the boundary value problem, our inverse issues are different from the existing results of [F. Hettlich and A. Kirsch, Inverse Problems, 13 (1997), pp. 351–361], where fixed-direction plane waves at multiple frequencies were considered.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a huge threat to global public health. Motivated by China’s experience of using Fangcang shelter hospitals (FSHs) to successfully combat the epidemic in its initial stages, we present a two-stage delay model considering the average waiting time of patients’ admission to study the impact of hospital beds and centralized quarantine on mitigating and controlling of the outbreak. We compute the basic reproduction number in terms of the hospital resources and perform a sensitivity analysis of the average waiting times of patients before admission to the hospitals. We conclude that, while designated hospitals save lives in severely infected individuals, the FSHs played a key role in mitigating and eventually curbing the epidemic. We also quantified some key epidemiological indicators, such as the final size of infections and deaths, the peak height and its timing, and the maximum occupation of beds in FSHs. Our study suggests that, for a jurisdiction (region or country) still struggling with COVID-19, when possible, it is essential to increase testing capacity and use a centralized quarantine to massively reduce the severity and magnitude of the epidemic that follows.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and myosin-dependent contraction can generate elastic stress and strain in living tissues, which may be dissipated by internal rearrangement through cell topological transition and cytoskeletal reorganization. Moreover, cells and tissues can change their sizes in response to mechanical cues. The present work demonstrates the role of tissue compressibility and internal rearranging activities on its size and mechanics regulation in the context of differential growth induced by a field of growth-promoting chemical factors. We develop a mathematical model based on finite elasticity and growth theory and the reference map techniques to describe the coupled tissue growth and mechanics in the Eulerian frame. We incorporate the tissue rearrangement by introducing a rearranging rate to the reference map evolution, leading to elastic-energy dissipation when tissue growth and deformation are in radial symmetry. By linearizing the model, we show that the stress follows the Maxwell-type viscoelastic relaxation. The rearrangement rate, which we call tissue fluidity, sets the stress relaxation time, and the ratio between the shear modulus and the fluidity sets the tissue viscosity. By nonlinear simulation of growing tissue spheroids and discs with graded growth rates along the radius, we find that the tissue compressibility and fluidity influence their equilibrium size. By comparing the nonlinear simulations with the linear analytical solutions, we show the size change as a nonlinear effect due to the advection of the tissue density flow, which only occurs when both tissue compressibility and fluidity are small. We apply the model to study tumor spheroid growth and epithelial disc growth when a reaction-diffusion process determines the growth-promoting factor field.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many physical, epidemiological, or physiological dynamical processes on networks support front-like propagation, where an initial localized perturbation grows and systematically invades all nodes in the network. A key problem is then to extract estimates for the dynamics. In particular, if a single node is seeded at a small concentration, when will other nodes reach the same initial concentration? Here, motivated by the study of toxic protein propagation in neurodegenerative diseases, we present and compare three different estimates for the arrival time in order of increasing analytical complexity: the linear arrival time, obtained by linearizing the underlying dynamical system; the Lambert time, obtained by considering the interaction of pairs of nodes; and the nonlinear arrival time, obtained by asymptotic techniques. We use the classic Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation as a paradigm for the dynamics and show that each method provides different insights but consistent time estimates. Further, we show that the nonlinear asymptotic method also gives an approximate solution, valid in the entire domain, and the correct ordering of arrival regions over large regions of parameters and initial conditions.},

Motivated by recent laboratory experiments, we study microbial populations with light-inducible genetic differentiation that generates a two-species microbial consortium relevant for bioproduction. First, we derive a hierarchy of models describing the evolution of the microbial populations, each with decreasing complexity. This sequential order reduction reveals the connections between several popular classes of models used in this context. Second, we demonstrate the analytical insight the order reduction provides by studying the optimal control of such a reduced-order system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Appealing to Pontryagin’s maximum principle, we find different optimal control structures within different regions of the parameter space. Explicit solutions are obtained in a subset of parameter space, while, for the remainder of parameter space, closed-form solutions are obtained that depend on a scalar value that solves a particular transcendental equation. We show that a unique solution of the scalar equation exists and lies in a known compact interval, making its numerical approximation particularly easy. The analytical results are verified against direct numerical calculations.},

The diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal arising from biological tissues can be numerically simulated by solving the Bloch–Torrey partial differential equation. Numerical simulations can facilitate the investigation of the relationship between the diffusion MRI signals and cellular structures. With the rapid advance of available computing power, the diffusion MRI community has begun to employ numerical simulations for model formulation and validation, as well as for imaging sequence optimization. Existing simulation frameworks use the finite difference method, the finite element method, or the Matrix Formalism method to solve the Bloch–Torrey partial differential equation. We propose a new method based on the efficient evaluation of layer potentials. In this paper, the mathematical framework and the numerical implementation of the new method are described. We demonstrate the convergence of our method via numerical experiments and analyze the errors linked to various model and simulation parameters. Since our method provides a Fourier-type representation of the diffusion MRI signal, it can potentially facilitate new physical and biological signal interpretations in the future.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the paraxial wave equation with a randomly perturbed index of refraction, which can model the propagation of a wave beam in a turbulent medium. The random perturbation is a stationary and isotropic process with a general form of the covariance that may or may not be integrable. We focus attention mostly on the nonintegrable case, which corresponds to a random perturbation with long-range correlations, that is, relevant for propagation through a cloudy turbulent atmosphere. The analysis is carried out in a high-frequency regime where the forward scattering approximation holds. It reveals that the randomization of the wave field is multiscale: The travel time of the wave front is randomized at short distances of propagation, and it can be described by a fractional Brownian motion. The wave field observed in the random travel time frame is affected by the random perturbations at long distances, and it is described by a Schrödinger-type equation driven by a standard Brownian field. We use these results to quantify how scattering leads to decorrelation of the spatial and spectral components of the wave field and to a deformation of the pulse emitted by the source. These are important questions for applications, such as imaging and free space communications with pulsed laser beams through a turbulent atmosphere. We also compare the results with those used in the optics literature, which are based on the Kolmogorov model of turbulence. We show explicitly that the commonly used approximations for the decorrelation of spatial and spectral components are appropriate for the Kolmogorov model but fail for models with long-range correlations.},

Traveling waves propagating on a taut cable resting on an elastic substrate are investigated by an equivalent mechanical model based on the classical Klein–Gordon equation. The formulation is devised for an elastic response of generally arbitrary shape, and permits one to compute the propagation wave velocity without solving the equation of motion, thus providing a unified theoretical framework for a large class of response functions, linear or nonlinear, smooth or nonsmooth. The general solution is then applied to the cases of a general polynomial substrate, a bilinear substrate, a bilinear substrate with a cubic correction, and a negative linear stiffness substrate, all of them falling within the realm of nonsmooth systems when a piecewise continuous stiffness is chosen; in the second one, we recover results present in the literature and obtained by employing a method based on matching conditions, which are spared in the approach used in this paper.
