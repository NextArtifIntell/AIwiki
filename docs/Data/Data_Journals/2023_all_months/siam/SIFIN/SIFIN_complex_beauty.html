We provide a sufficient condition for the inf-compactness and thus existence with costs that are lower semicontinuous and bounded from below and transition kernels that are continuous in controls under given states.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The optimal stopping problem is one of the core problems in financial markets, with broad applications such as pricing American and Bermudan options. The deep BSDE method [J. Han, A. Jentzen, and W. E, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 115 (2018), pp. 8505–8510] has shown great power in solving high-dimensional forward-backward stochastic differential equations and has inspired many applications. However, the method solves backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a forward manner, which cannot be used for optimal stopping problems that in general require running BSDE backwardly. To overcome this difficulty, a recent paper [H. Wang et al., Deep Learning-Based BSDE Solver for LIBOR Market Model with Application to Bermudan Swaption Pricing and Hedging, arXiv:1807.06622, 2018] proposed the backward deep BSDE method to solve the optimal stopping problem. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theory for the backward deep BSDE method. Specifically, (1) we derive the a posteriori error estimation, i.e., the error of the numerical solution can be bounded by the training loss function; and (2) we give an upper bound of the loss function, which can be sufficiently small subject to universal approximations. We give two numerical examples, which present consistent performance with the proved theory.},

Based on the notion of conditional elicitability, our methodology constructs (strictly consistent) scoring functions that are used as penalizers in the estimation procedure. Our contribution is threefold: we (i) devise an efficient approach to estimate a class of dynamic spectral risk measures with deep neural networks, (ii) prove that these dynamic spectral risk measures may be approximated to any arbitrary accuracy using deep neural networks, and (iii) develop a risk-sensitive actor-critic algorithm that uses full episodes and does not require any additional nested transitions. We compare our conceptually improved reinforcement learning algorithm with the nested simulation approach and illustrate its performance in two settings: statistical arbitrage and portfolio allocation on both simulated and real data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the problem of active portfolio management where an investor aims to outperform a benchmark strategy’s risk profile while not deviating too far from it. Specifically, an investor considers alternative strategies whose terminal wealth lies within a Wasserstein ball surrounding a benchmark’s terminal wealth—being distributionally close—and that have a specified dependence/copula tying state-by-state outcomes to it. The investor then chooses the alternative strategy that minimizes a distortion risk measure of terminal wealth. In a general complete market model, we prove that an optimal dynamic strategy exists and provide its characterization through the notion of isotonic projections. We further propose a simulation approach to calculate the optimal strategy’s terminal wealth, making our approach applicable to a wide range of market models. Finally, we illustrate how investors with different copula and risk preferences invest and improve upon the benchmark using the Tail Value-at-Risk, inverse S-shaped, and lower- and upper-tail distortion risk measures as examples. We find that investors’ optimal terminal wealth distribution has larger probability masses in regions that reduce their risk measure relative to the benchmark while preserving the benchmark’s structure.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies a continuous-time optimal portfolio selection problem in a complete market for a behavioral investor whose preference is of the prospect type with probability distortion. The investor is concerned with the terminal relative growth rate (log-return) instead of absolute capital value. This model can be regarded as an extension of the classical growth optimal problem to the behavioral framework. It leads to a new type of -shaped utility maximization problem under nonlinear Choquet expectation. Due to the presence of probability distortion, the classical stochastic control methods are not applicable. Instead, we use the martingale method, concavification, and quantile optimization techniques to derive the closed-form optimal growth rate. We find that the benchmark growth rate has a significant impact on investment behaviors. Compared to S. Zhang, H. Q. Jin, and X. Zhou [Acta Math. Sin. (Engl. Ser.), 27 (2011), pp. 255–274] where the same preference measure is applied to the terminal relative wealth, we find a new phenomenon when the investor’s risk tolerance level is high and the market state is bad. In addition, our optimal wealth in every scenario is less sensitive to the pricing kernel and thus more stable than theirs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The value of an American option is the maximized value of the discounted cash flows from the option. At each time step, one needs to compare the immediate exercise value with the continuation value and decide to exercise as soon as the exercise value is strictly greater than the continuation value. We can formulate this problem as a dynamic programming equation, where the main difficulty comes from the computation of the conditional expectations representing the continuation values at each time step. In Longstaff and Schwartz [Rev. Financ. Studies, 14 (2001), pp. 113–147], these conditional expectations were estimated using regressions on a finite-dimensional vector space (typically a polynomial basis). In this paper, we follow the same algorithm; only the conditional expectations are estimated using regression trees or random forests. We discuss the convergence of the Longstaff and Schwartz algorithm when the standard least squares regression is replaced by regression trees. Finally, we expose some numerical results with regression trees and random forests. The random forest algorithm gives excellent results in high dimensions.},

This paper includes a marked Hawkes process in the original Heath–Jarrow–Morton (HJM) setup and investigates the impact of this assumption on the pricing of the popular vanilla fixed-income derivatives. Our model exhibits a smile that can fit the implied volatility of swaptions for a given key rate (tenor). We harness the log-normality of the model, conditionally with respect to jumps, and derive formulae to evaluate both caplets/floorlets and swaptions. Our model exhibits negative jumps on the zero-coupon (hence positive on the rates). Therefore, its behavior is compatible with the situation where globally low interest rates can suddenly show a cluster of positive jumps in case of tensions on the market. One of the main difficulties when dealing with the HJM model is to keep a framework that is Markovian. In this paper we show how to preserve the relevant features of the Hull and White version, especially the reconstruction formula that provides the zero-coupon bonds in terms of the underlying model factors.},

We propose a hybrid method for generating arbitrage-free implied volatility (IV) surfaces consistent with historical data by combining model-free variational autoencoders (VAEs) with continuous time stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven models. We focus on two classes of SDE models: regime switching models and Lévy additive processes. By projecting historical surfaces onto the space of SDE model parameters, we obtain a distribution on the parameter subspace faithful to the data on which we then train a VAE. Arbitrage-free IV surfaces are then generated by sampling from the posterior distribution on the latent space, decoding to obtain SDE model parameters, and finally mapping those parameters to IV surfaces. We further refine the VAE model by including conditional features and demonstrate its superior generative out-of-sample performance. Finally, we showcase how our method can be used as a data augmentation tool to help practitioners manage the tail risk of option portfolios.},

We shall provide the error estimate rigorously. Our numerical examples show that the cubature method is much more efficient than the Euler scheme, provided certain conditions are satisfied.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider asset price models whose dynamics are described by linear functions of the (time extended) signature of a primary underlying process, which can range from a (market-inferred) Brownian motion to a general multidimensional continuous semimartingale. The framework is universal in the sense that classical models can be approximated arbitrarily well and that the model’s parameters can be learned from all sources of available data by simple methods. We provide conditions guaranteeing absence of arbitrage as well as tractable option pricing formulas for so-called sig-payoffs, exploiting the polynomial nature of generic primary processes. One of our main focuses lies on calibration, where we consider both time-series and implied volatility surface data, generated from classical stochastic volatility models and also from S&amp;P 500 index market data. For both tasks the linearity of the model turns out to be the crucial tractability feature which allows one to get fast and accurate calibrations results, since the signature samples can be easily precomputed.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We develop a general mathematical framework, based on rough path theory that can incorporate the empirically observed nonlinear mean-variance relation of the logarithmic return in a systematic manner. This model offers the possibility of an additional noise hidden in the rough path lift, hence supporting the idea of mixture of a Gaussian noise that is close to a standard Brownian motion and another source of long memory noise (a fractional Brownian motion for instance), that can account for the multiscaling phenomenon in financial data. The no-arbitrage principle is then satisfied under the assumption of transaction costs as long as the driving noise is a sticky process. We also discuss the potential risk of model uncertainty where the ambiguity comes from the rough path lifts, as well as the problem of cooperation. Our models are supported by empirical evidence from financial data and, in particular, can explain some stylized fact (a parabolic lower bound of a mean-variance relation) that has not been explained before.},

Suppose an investor aims at Delta hedging a European contingent claim in a jump-diffusion model, but incorrectly specifies the stock price’s volatility and jump sensitivity, so that any hedging strategy is calculated under a misspecified model. When does the erroneously computed strategy approximate the true claim in an appropriate sense? If the misspecified volatility and jump sensitivity dominate the true ones, we show that following the misspecified Delta strategy does superreplicate in expectation among a wide collection of models. We also show that if a robust pricing operator with a whole class of models is used, the corresponding hedge is dominating the contingent claim under each model in expectation. Such a hedging error is also called a good-deal or a -arbitrage. Moreover, in general the misspecified price of the option dominates the true one if the volatility and the jump sensitivity are overestimated. Our results rely on proving stochastic flow properties of the jump-diffusion and the convexity of the contingent claim’s value function.},

Other convenient properties of quantiles—monotonicity, semicontinuity, comonotonic additivity, elicitability, and locality in particular—follow from this axiom. Furthermore, on the set of convexly supported distributions, the median is the only mapping that commutates with all monotone and continuous transforms. On a general set of distributions, the median interval is pinned down as the unique minimal interval-valued mapping that commutes with all monotone and continuous transforms. Finally, our main result, put in a decision-theoretic setting, leads to a minimalist axiomatization of quantile preferences. In banking and insurance, quantiles are known as the standard regulatory risk measure Value-at-Risk (VaR), and thus an axiomatization of VaR is obtained with only one axiom among law-based risk measures.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a model of a simple financial system consisting of a leveraged investor that invests in a risky asset and manages risk by using value-at-risk (VaR). The VaR is estimated by using past data via an adaptive expectation scheme. We show that the leverage dynamics can be described by a dynamical system of slow-fast type associated with a unimodal map on with an additive heteroscedastic noise whose variance is related to the portfolio rebalancing frequency to target leverage. In absence of noise the model is purely deterministic and the parameter space splits into two regions: (i) a region with a globally attracting fixed point or a 2-cycle; (ii) a dynamical core region, where the map could exhibit chaotic behavior. Whenever the model is randomly perturbed, we prove the existence of a unique stationary density with bounded variation, the stochastic stability of the process, and the almost certain existence and continuity of the Lyapunov exponent for the stationary measure. We then use deep neural networks to estimate map parameters from a short time series. Using this method, we estimate the model in a large dataset of US commercial banks over the period 2001–2014. We find that the parameters of a substantial fraction of banks lie in the dynamical core, and their leverage time series are consistent with a chaotic behavior. We also present evidence that the time series of the leverage of large banks tend to exhibit chaoticity more frequently than those of small banks.},

We formulate and solve a deterministic optimal consumption problem to maximize the discounted constant relative risk aversion utility of an individual’s consumption-to-habit process assuming they only invest in a riskless market and that they are unwilling to consume at a rate below a certain proportion of their consumption habit. Increasing increases the degree of addictiveness of habit formation, with (respectively, ) corresponding to nonaddictive (respectively, completely addictive) model. We derive the optimal consumption policies explicitly in terms of the solution of a nonlinear free-boundary problem, which we analyze in detail. Impatient individuals (or, equivalently, those with more addictive habits) always consume above the minimum rate; thus, they eventually attain the minimum wealth-to-habit ratio. Patient individuals (or, equivalently, those with less addictive habits) consume at the minimum rate if their wealth-to-habit ratio is below a threshold and above it otherwise. By consuming patiently, these individuals maintain a wealth-to-habit ratio that is greater than the minimum acceptable level. Additionally, we prove that the optimal consumption path is hump-shaped if the initial wealth-to-habit ratio is either (1) larger than a high threshold or (2) below a low threshold and the agent is more risk seeking (that is, less risk averse). Thus, we provide a simple explanation for the consumption hump observed by various empirical studies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Diversification return has been well studied in finance literature, mainly focusing on the various sources from which it may be generated. The maximization of diversification return, in its natural form, is often handed over to convex quadratic optimization for its solution. In this paper, we study the maximization problem from the perspective of Rao’s quadratic entropy (RQE), which is closely related to the Euclidean distance matrix and hence has deep geometric implications. This new approach reveals a fundamental feature that the maximum diversification return portfolio (MDRP) admits a spherical embedding with the hypersphere having the least volume. This important characterization extends to the maximum volatility portfolio, the long-only MDRP, and the ridge-regularized MDRP. RQE serves as a unified formulation for diversification return related portfolios and generates new portfolios that are worth further investigation. As an application of this geometric characterization, we develop a computational formula for measuring the distance between a new asset and an existing portfolio that has the hyperspherical embedding. Numerical experiments demonstrate the developed theory.},

We show that the value function is the unique solution of a nonlinear Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman variational inequality. In addition, this value function embodies a unique optimal threshold strategy for the insurer’s surplus, thereby making it the smooth pasting of a nonlinear and a linear part at the location of the threshold. Furthermore, we obtain continuity and monotonicity of the value function in addition to continuity of the threshold strategy with respect to the parameter that measures ambiguity of our model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We derive generalizations of the Dupire formula to the case of general stochastic drift and/or the case of general stochastic local volatility. First, we handle the case in which the drift is given as a difference of two stochastic short rates. Such a setting is natural in a foreign exchange context where the short rates correspond to the short rates of the two currencies, in an equity single-currency context with stochastic dividend yield, or in a commodity context with stochastic convenience yield. We present the formula in both a call surface formulation and a total implied variance formulation where the latter avoids calendar spread arbitrage by construction. We provide derivations for the case where both short rates are given as single factor processes, and we present limits for a single stochastic rate or all deterministic short rates. The limits agree with published results. Then we derive a formulation that allows a more general stochastic drift and diffusion, including one or more stochastic local volatility terms. In the general setting, our derivation allows for the computation and cali ration of the leverage function for stochastic local volatility models. Despite being implicit, the generalized Dupire formula can be used numerically in a fixed-point iterative scheme.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze dynamic investment strategies for benchmark outperformance using two widely used objectives of practical interest to investors: (i) maximizing the information ratio (IR), and (ii) obtaining a favorable tracking difference (cumulative outperformance) relative to the benchmark. In the case of the tracking difference, we propose a simple and intuitive objective function based on the quadratic deviation (QD) from an elevated benchmark. In order to gain some intuition about these strategies, we provide closed-form solutions for the controls under idealized assumptions. For more realistic cases, we represent the control using a neural network (NN) and directly solve a sampled optimization problem, which approximates the original optimal stochastic control formulation. Unlike the typical approach based on dynamic programming (DP), e.g., reinforcement learning, solving the sampled optimization with an NN as a control avoids computing conditional expectations and leads to an optimization problem with a small number of variables. In addition, our NN parameter size is independent of the number of portfolio rebalancing times. Under some assumptions, we prove that a traditional DP approach results in a high-dimensional problem, whereas directly solving for the control without using DP yields a low-dimensional problem. Our analytical and numerical results illustrate that, compared with IR-optimal strategies with the same expected value of terminal wealth, the QD-optimal investment strategies result in comparatively more diversified asset allocations during certain periods of the investment time horizon.},

Assuming asset prices are continuous and strictly positive, we derive model-free expressions for the funding rate and discount rate of these perpetual contracts as well as replication strategies for the short side. When asset prices can jump, we derive expressions for the funding and discount rates, which are semirobust in the sense that they do not depend on the dynamics of the volatility process of the underlying risky assets, but do depend on the intensity of jumps under the market’s pricing measure. When asset prices can jump and the volatility process is independent of the underlying risky assets, we derive an explicit replication strategy for the short side of a perpetual contract. Throughout the paper, we illustrate through examples how specific perpetual contracts relate to traditional financial instruments such as variance swaps and leveraged exchange traded funds.},

The pricing functional is compatible with prices for attainable claims. Except translation invariance, the pricing principle possesses lots of elegant properties, such as monotonicity and concavity.

This problem arises in market economies, including electricity generation from renewable sources in smart grids. Our model includes noise on the supply side, which is counterbalanced on the consumption side by storing energy or reducing the demand according to a dynamic price process. By solving a constrained minimization problem, we prove that the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the market-clearing condition defines the solution of the price formation problem. For the linear-quadratic structure, we characterize the price process of a continuum population using optimal control techniques. We include numerical schemes for the price computation in the finite and infinite games, and we illustrate the model using real data.},

The question is framed in a financial network model of debt and equity interlinkages with the addition of a variant of the CoCo that converts continuously when a bank’s equity–debt ratio drops to a trigger level. The main theoretical result is a complete characterization of the clearing problem for the interbank debt and equity at the maturity of the obligations. We then introduce stylized networks to study when introducing CoCo bonds improves financial stability, as well as specific networks for which CoCo bonds do not provide uniformly improved system performance. To return to the main question, we examine the European Union financial network at the time of the 2011 European Banking Authority stress test to do comparative statics to study the implications of CoCo debt on financial stability. It is found that by replacing all unsecured interbank debt by standardized CoCo interbank debt securities, systemic risk in the European Union will decrease and bank shareholder value will increase.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper incorporates Bayesian estimation and optimization into a portfolio selection framework, particularly for high-dimensional portfolios in which the number of assets is larger than the number of observations. We leverage a constrained minimization approach, called the linear programming optimal (LPO) portfolio, to directly estimate effective parameters appearing in the optimal portfolio. We propose two refinements for the LPO strategy. First, we explore improved Bayesian estimates, instead of sample estimates, of the covariance matrix of asset returns. Second, we introduce Bayesian optimization (BO) to replace traditional grid-search cross-validation (CV) in tuning hyperparameters of the LPO strategy. We further propose modifications in the BO algorithm by (1) taking into account the time-dependent nature of financial problems and (2) extending the commonly used expected improvement acquisition function to include a tunable trade-off with the improvement’s variance. Allowing a general case of noisy observations, we theoretically derive the sublinear convergence rate of BO under the newly proposed EIVar and thus our algorithm has no regret. Our empirical studies confirm that the adjusted BO results in portfolios with higher out-of-sample Sharpe ratio, certainty equivalent, and lower turnover compared to those tuned with CV. This superior performance is achieved with a significant reduction in time elapsed, thus also addressing time-consuming issues of CV. Furthermore, LPO with Bayesian estimates outperforms the original proposal of LPO, as well as the benchmark equally weighted and plugin strategies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study we consider the pricing of energy derivatives when the evolution of spot prices is modeled with a normal tempered stable driven Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Such processes are the generalization of normal inverse Gaussian processes that are widely used in energy finance applications. We first specify their statistical properties calculating their characteristic function in closed form. This result is instrumental for the derivation of nonarbitrage conditions such that the spot dynamics is consistent with the forward curve without relying on numerical approximations or on numerical integration. Moreover, we conceive an efficient algorithm for the exact generation of the trajectories which gives the possibility to implement Monte Carlo simulations without approximations or bias. We illustrate the applicability of the theoretical findings and the simulation algorithms in the context of the pricing of different contracts, namely, strips of daily call options, Asian options with European style, and swing options. Finally, we present an extension to future markets.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with portfolio selection for an investor with power utility in multiasset financial markets in a rough stochastic environment. We investigate Merton’s portfolio problem for different multivariate Volterra models, covering the rough Heston model. First we consider a class of multivariate affine Volterra models introduced in [E. Abi Jaber, E. Miller, and H. Pham, SIAM J. Financial Math.., 12 (2021), pp. 369–409]. Based on the classical Wishart model described in [N. Bäuerle and Z. Li, J. Appl. Probab., 50 (2013), pp. 1025–1043], we then introduce a new matrix-valued stochastic volatility model, where the volatility is driven by a Volterra–Wishart process. Due to the non-Markovianity of the underlying processes, the classical stochastic control approach cannot be applied in these settings. To overcome this issue, we provide a verification argument using calculus of convolutions and resolvents. The resulting optimal strategy can then be expressed explicitly in terms of the solution of a multivariate Riccati–Volterra equation. We thus extend the results obtained by Han and Wong to the multivariate case, avoiding restrictions on the correlation structure linked to the martingale distortion transformation used in [B. Han and H. Y. Wong, Finance Res. Lett., 39 (2021)]. We also provide existence and uniqueness theorems for the occurring Volterra processes and illustrate our results with a numerical study.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study a microscopic limit order book model, in which the order dynamics depend on the current best bid and ask price and the current volume density functions, simultaneously, and derive its macroscopic high-frequency dynamics. As opposed to the existing literature on scaling limits for limit order book models, we include price changes which do not scale with the tick size in our model to account for large price movement, for example, being triggered by highly unforeseen events. Our main result states that, when the size of an individual limit order and the tick size tend to zero, while the order arrival rate tends to infinity, the microscopic limit order book model dynamics converge to two one dimensional jump diffusion processes describing the prices coupled with two infinite dimensional fluid processes describing the standing volumes at the buy and sell side.},
