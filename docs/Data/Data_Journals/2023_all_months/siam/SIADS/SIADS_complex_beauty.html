  abstract     = {Abstract. For many engineered systems it is important to assess vulnerability to potential disturbances in order to ensure reliable operation. Whether the system will recover from a particular finite-time disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on uncertain and time-varying system parameter values. Therefore, it is valuable to determine, for specific fixed disturbances, the margins for safe operation: the smallest change in parameter values that would cause the system to become vulnerable to the disturbance. The natural setting for this problem is a parameter-dependent vector field with a family of stable equilibria and a parameter-dependent initial condition representing the disturbance. The system recovers for a particular parameter value if its initial condition lies within the region of attraction of the desired stable equilibrium point. Prior work has developed algorithms for numerically computing the margins for safe operation. However, the theoretical guarantees provided for these methods require a very restrictive assumption: that the nonwandering set in the region of attraction boundary is stable under perturbations to the vector field. This assumption is generally intractable to verify, so feasibility of the above algorithms cannot be determined in advance, and even when these algorithms do converge their convergence to the correct values cannot be guaranteed. Thus, this assumption limits the effective application of these algorithms in practice. This work relaxes this restrictive assumption while still obtaining similar results under weaker assumptions, thereby guaranteeing effectiveness of these algorithms. For the setting under consideration, it is shown for vector fields on compact Riemannian manifolds that the restrictive assumption follows immediately and does not need to be independently verified. A motivating example shows that this is not the case for vector fields on Euclidean space, but in this setting it is shown that the restrictive assumption can still be relaxed provided there exist a neighborhood of infinity with suitable properties and some additional generic assumptions. These results are then used to provide theoretical guarantees for the numerical algorithms discussed above under far weaker assumptions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The rocking can problem [M. Srinivasan and A. Ruina, Phys. Rev. E, 78 (2008), 066609] consists of an empty drinks can standing upright on a horizontal plane which, when tipped back to a single contact point and released, rocks down towards the flat and level state. At the bottom of the motion, the contact point moves quickly around the rim of the can. The can then rises up again, having rotated through some finite angle of turn . We recast the problem as a second order ODE and find a Frobenius solution. We then use this Frobenius solution to derive a reduced equation of motion. The rocking can exhibits two distinct phenomena: behavior very similar to an inverted pendulum, and dynamics with the angle of turn. This distinction allows us to use matched asymptotic expansions to derive a uniformly valid solution that is in excellent agreement with numerical calculations of the reduced equation of motion. The solution of the inner problem was used to investigate of the angle of turn phenomenon. We also examine the motion of the contact locus and see a range of different trajectories, from circular to petaloid motion and even cusp-like behavior. Finally, we obtain an approximate lower bound for the required coefficient of friction to avoid slip.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The intention of this article is to illustrate the use of methods from symplectic geometry for practical purposes. Our intended audience is scientists interested in orbits of Hamiltonian systems (e.g., the three-body problem). The main directions pursued in this article are as follows: (1) given two periodic orbits, decide when they can be connected by a regular family of periodic orbits; (2) use numerical invariants from Floer theory which help predict the existence of orbits in the presence of a bifurcation; (3) attach a sign to each elliptic or hyperbolic Floquet multiplier of a closed symmetric orbit, which generalizes the classical Krein–Moser sign to also include the hyperbolic case; and (4) do all of the above in a visual, easily implementable, and resource-efficient way. The mathematical framework is provided by the first and third authors in [U. Frauenfelder and A. Moreno, J. Symplectic Geom., to appear], where, as it turns out, the “Broucke stability diagram” [R. Broucke, AIAA J., 7 (1969), pp. 1003–1009] was rediscovered, but further refined with the above signs and algebraically reformulated in terms of quotients of the symplectic group. The advantage of the framework is that it applies to the study of closed orbits of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system. We will carry out numerical work based on the cell-mapping method as described in [D. Koh, R. L. Anderson, and I. Bermejo-Moreno, J. Astronautical Sci., 68 (2021), pp. 172–196] for the Jupiter-Europa and Saturn-Enceladus systems. These are currently systems of interest, falling in the agenda of space agencies like NASA, as these icy moons are considered candidates for harboring conditions suitable for extraterrestrial life.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Mathematical models come in many forms across biological applications. In the case of complex, spatial dynamics and pattern formation, stochastic models also face two main challenges: pattern data are largely qualitative, and model realizations may vary significantly. Together these issues make it difficult to relate models and empirical data—or even models and models—limiting how different approaches can be combined to offer new insights into biology. These challenges also raise mathematical questions about how models are related, since alternative approaches to the same problem—e.g., Cellular Potts models; off-lattice, agent-based models; on-lattice, cellular automaton models; and continuum approaches—treat uncertainty and implement cell behavior in different ways. To help open the door to future work on questions like these, here we adapt methods from topological data analysis and computational geometry to quantitatively relate two different models of the same biological process in a fair, comparable way. To center our work and illustrate concrete challenges, we focus on the example of zebrafish-skin pattern formation, and we relate patterns that arise from agent-based and cellular automaton models.},

We extend this geometric framework, obtaining explicit expressions for the volume form, including the case when the network has infinite depth. We investigate the link between the Riemannian geometry and the training asymptotics for matrix completion with rigorous analysis and numerics.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In an epidemic network, lags due to travel time between populations, latent period, and recovery period can significantly change the epidemic behavior and result in successive echoing waves of the spread between various population clusters. Moreover, external shocks to a given population can propagate to other populations within the network, potentially snowballing into waves of resurgent epidemics. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of time delay and small shocks/uncertainties on the linear susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) dynamics of epidemic networks. In this regard, the asymptotic stability of this class of networks is first studied, and then its performance loss due to small shocks/uncertainties is evaluated based on the notion of the norm. It is shown that network performance loss is correlated with the structure of the underlying graph, intrinsic time delays, epidemic characteristics, and external shocks. This performance measure is then used to develop an optimal traffic restriction algorithm for network performance enhancement, resulting in reduced infection in the metapopulation. A novel epidemic-based centrality index is also defined to evaluate the impact of every subpopulation on network performance, and its asymptotic behavior is investigated. It is shown that for specific choices of parameters, the output of the epidemic-based centrality index converges to the results obtained by local or eigenvector centralities. Moreover, given that epidemic-based centrality depends on the epidemic properties of the disease, it may yield distinct node rankings as the disease characteristics slowly change over time or as different types of infections spread. This node interlacing phenomenon is not observed in other centralities that rely solely on network structure. This unique characteristic of epidemic-based centrality enables it to adjust to various epidemic features. The derived centrality index is then adopted to improve the network robustness against external shocks on the epidemic network. The numerical results, along with the theoretical expectations, highlight the role of time delay as well as small shocks in investigating the most effective methods of epidemic containment.},

The low-order parametric descriptor systems are identified from transfer matrix samples by means of two-variable Lagrange rational matrix interpolation. This is done within the Loewner framework by deploying the new matrix-valued barycentric formula given in both right and left polynomial matrix fraction forms, which enables the construction of minimal parametric descriptor systems with rectangular transfer matrices. The developed method allows the reduction of order and parameter dependence complexity of the constructed system. Stability of the system is preserved by the postprocessing technique based on flipping signs of unstable poles. The developed methodology is illustrated with a few academic examples and applied to low-order parametric state-space identification of an aerodynamic system.},

The strategy is geometric in nature and consists of viewing the connection as the zero of a nonlinear map, such that the invertibility of its Fréchet derivative implies the transversality of the intersection. The map is defined by a projected boundary value problem (BVP), with boundary conditions in the (finite dimensional) unstable and (infinite dimensional) stable manifolds of the periodic orbit. The parameterization method is used to compute the unstable manifold, and the BVP is solved using a discrete time dynamical system approach (defined via the method of steps) and Chebyshev series expansions. We illustrate this technique by computing transverse homoclinic orbits in the cubic Ikeda and Mackey–Glass systems.},

In this work, we consider induced linear operators acting on the space of sections of the state space’s tangent, cotangent, and tensor bundles. We first demonstrate how these operators are natural generalizations of Koopman operators acting on functions. We then draw connections between the various operators’ spectra and characterize the algebraic and differential topological properties of their spectra. We describe the discrete spectrum of these operators for linear dynamical systems and derive spectral expansions for linear vector fields. We define the notion of an “eigendistribution,” provide conditions for an eigendistribution to be integrable, and demonstrate how to recover the foliations arising from their integral manifolds. Last, we demonstrate that the characteristic Lyapunov exponents of a uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system are in the spectrum of the induced operators on sections of the tangent or cotangent bundle. We conclude with an application to differential geometry where the well-known fact that the flows of commuting vector fields commute is generalized, and we recover the original statement as a particular case of our result. We also apply our results to recover the Lyapunov exponents and the stable/unstable foliations of Arnold’s cat map via the spectrum of the induced operator on sections of the tangent bundle.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Developing a model to capture all aspects of a complex dynamical system is an immense task, and each model will have deficiencies in some areas, such as global climate models having difficulty in capturing tropical intraseasonal variability such as the Madden–Julian oscillation. Besides complex models, it is possible to create simplified, low-dimensional models to capture specific phenomena while ignoring many aspects of the full system. Here, we propose a strategy to allow complex models to communicate with simplified models throughout a simulation. The communication allows one to leverage the strengths of each model, without needing to change their dynamics, to mitigate model error. Furthermore, to ensure ease of implementation in complex systems, the strategy is based on common data assimilation techniques that are normally used to combine models and real-world data. This strategy is investigated here in a test case that is nonlinear, non-Gaussian, and high-dimensional (approximately degrees of freedom), and the multiple models have different state spaces. In particular, it is an idealized tropical climate model in three spatial dimensions. The multimodel communication strategy is seen to mitigate model error and reproduce statistical features akin to those of the truth model when the communication is sufficiently frequent. In these tests, the low-dimensional model contributes only two degrees of freedom, which suggests that, in some systems, large amounts of model error can possibly be reduced by focusing on a small set of model components.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a framework to study tipping points in reaction-diffusion equations (RDEs) in one spatial dimension, where the reaction term decays in space (asymptotically homogeneous) and varies linearly with time (nonautonomous) due to an external input. A compactification of the moving-frame coordinate together with Lin’s method to construct heteroclinic orbits along intersections of stable and unstable invariant manifolds allows us to (i) obtain multiple coexisting pulse and front solutions for the RDE by computing heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibria at negative and positive infinity in the compactified moving-frame ordinary differential equation, (ii) detect tipping points as dangerous bifurcations of such heteroclinic orbits, and (iii) obtain tipping diagrams by numerical continuation of such bifurcations. We apply our framework to an illustrative model of a habitat patch that features an Allee effect in population growth and is geographically shrinking or shifting due to human activity or climate change. Thus, we identify two classes of tipping points to extinction: bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping) when the shrinking habitat falls below some critical length and rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) when the shifting habitat exceeds some critical speed. We explore two-parameter R-tipping diagrams to understand how the critical speed depends on the size of the habitat patch and the dispersal rate of the population, uncover parameter regions where the shifting population survives, and relate these regions to the invasion speed in an infinite homogeneous habitat. Furthermore, we contrast the tipping instabilities with gradual transitions to extinction found for logistic population growth without the Allee effect.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent advances in high-resolution experimental methods have highlighted the significance of cell signal pathway crosstalk and localized signaling activity in the development and disease of numerous biological systems. The investigation of multiple signal pathways often introduces different methods of cell-cell communication, i.e., contact-based or diffusive signaling, which generates both a spatial and a temporal dependence on cell behaviors. Motivated by cellular mechanisms that control cell-fate decisions in developing bilayer tissues, we use dynamical systems coupled with multilayer graphs to analyze the role of signaling polarity and pathway crosstalk in fine-grain pattern formation of protein activity. Specifically, we study how multilayer graph edge structures and weights influence the layerwise (laminar) patterning of cells in bilayer structures, which are commonly found in glandular tissues. We present sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and instability of homogeneous cell states in the large-scale spatially discrete dynamical system. Using methods of pattern templating by graph partitioning to generate quotient systems, in combination with concepts from monotone dynamical systems, we exploit the extensive dimensionality reduction to provide existence conditions for the polarity required to induce fine-grain laminar patterns with multiple spatially dependent intracellular components. We then explore the spectral links between the quotient and large-scale dynamical systems to extend the laminar patterning criteria from existence to convergence for sufficiently large amounts of cellular polarity in the large-scale dynamical system, independent of spatial dimension and number of cells in the tissue.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. To address noise inherent in electronic data acquisition systems and real-world sources, Araki et al. [Phys. D, 417 (2021), 132819] demonstrated a grid-based nonlinear technique to remove noise from a chaotic signal, leveraging a clean high-fidelity signal from the same dynamical system and ensemble averaging in multidimensional phase space. This method achieved denoising of a time series data with 100\% added noise but suffered in regions of low data density. To improve this grid-based method, here an unstructured mesh based on triangulations and Voronoi diagrams is used to accomplish the same task. The unstructured mesh more uniformly distributes data samples over mesh cells to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed signal. By empirically balancing bias and variance errors in selecting the number of unstructured cells as a function of the number of available samples, the method achieves asymptotic statistical convergence with known test data and reduces synthetic noise on experimental signals from Hall effect thrusters with greater success than the original grid-based strategy.},

We show that the choice of linear regression results in a recently proposed data-driven learning algorithm based on Mori’s projection operator, which is a higher-order approximate Koopman learning method. We show that more expressive nonlinear regression models naturally fill in the gap between the highly idealized and computationally efficient Mori’s projection operator and the most optimal yet computationally infeasible Zwanzig’s projection operator. We performed numerical experiments and extracted the operators for an array of regression-based projections, including linear, polynomial, spline, and neural network–based regressions, showing a progressive improvement as the complexity of the regression model increased. Our proposition provides a general framework to extract memory-dependent corrections and can be readily applied to an array of data-driven learning methods for stationary dynamical systems in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper considers a deterministic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) networked bivirus epidemic model (termed the bivirus model for short), in which two competing viruses spread through a set of populations (nodes) connected by two graphs, which may be different if the two viruses have different transmission pathways. The networked dynamics can give rise to complex equilibria patterns, and most current results identify conditions on the model parameters for convergence to the healthy equilibrium (where both viruses are extinct) or a boundary equilibrium (where one virus is endemic and the other is extinct). However, there are only limited results on coexistence equilibria (where both viruses are endemic). This paper establishes a set of “counting” results which provide lower bounds on the number of coexistence equilibria and, perhaps more importantly, establish properties on the local stability/instability properties of these equilibria. In order to do this, we employ the Poincaré–Hopf theorem but with significant modifications to overcome several challenges arising from the bivirus system model, such as the fact that the system dynamics do not evolve on a manifold in the typical sense required to apply Poincaré–Hopf theory. Subsequently, Morse inequalities are used to tighten the counting results, under the reasonable assumption that the bivirus system is a Morse–Smale dynamical system. Numerical examples are provided which demonstrate the presence of multiple attractor equilibria and multiple coexistence equilibria.},

Motivated by the control of complex microbiota for reducing infection by a pathogenic agent, we introduce the theoretical framework from optimal control to analyze this problem. Two complementary approaches can be applied in the analysis: one is the so-called permanent case, where no digital constraints are concerned with the control (taken as a measurable mapping); the other is the sampled-data control case taking into account the logistic constraints, e.g., frequency of the medical interventions. The model is the n-dimensional Lotka–Volterra equation controlled using either probiotics or antibiotic agents or a combination of transplantation and bactericides. In this article, we concentrate on the permanent case associated to the probiotic or antibiotic agent. The maximum principle is used to parameterize the geodesics, and the optimal synthesis boils down to analyzing mainly the singular trajectories and their concatenation with bang arcs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A wide variety of stationary or moving spatially localized structures is present in evolution problems on unbounded domains, governed by higher-than-second-order reversible spatial interactions. This work provides a generic unfolding in one spatial dimension of a certain codimension-three singularity that explains the organization of bifurcation diagrams of such localized states in a variety of contexts, ranging from nonlinear optics to fluid mechanics, mathematical biology, and beyond. The singularity occurs when a cusp bifurcation associated with the onset of bistability between homogeneous steady states encounters a pattern-forming, or Turing, bifurcation. The latter corresponds to a Hamiltonian-Hopf point of the corresponding spatial dynamics problem. Such codimension-three points are sometimes called Lifshitz points in the physics literature. In the simplest case where the spatial system conserves a first integral, the system is described by a canonical fourth-order scalar system. The problem contains three small parameters: two that unfold the cusp bifurcation and one that unfolds the Turing bifurcation. Several cases are revealed, depending on open conditions on the signs of the lowest-order nonlinear terms. Taking the case in which the Turing bifurcation is subcritical, various parameter regimes are considered and the bifurcation diagrams of localized structures are elucidated. A rich bifurcation structure is revealed which involves transitions between regions of localized periodic patterns generated by standard homoclinic snaking, and regions of stationary domains of one homogeneous solution embedded in the other organized in a collapsed snaking structure. The theory is shown to unify previous numerical results obtained in models arising in nonlinear optics, fluid mechanics, and excitable media more generally.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A function with finite asymptotic limits gives rise to a transition equation between a “past system” and a “future system.” This question is analyzed in the case of nonautonomous coercive nonlinear scalar ordinary differential equations with concave derivative with respect to the state variable. The fundamental hypothesis is the existence of three hyperbolic solutions for the limit systems, in which case the upper and lower ones are attractive. All the global dynamical possibilities are described in terms of the internal dynamics of the pullback attractor: cases of tracking of the two hyperbolic attractive solutions or lack of it (tipping) may arise. This analysis, made in the language of processes and also in terms of the skewproduct formulation of the problem, includes cases of rate-induced critical transitions, as well as cases of phase-induced and size-induced tipping. The conclusions are applied in models of mathematical biology and population dynamics. Rate-induced tracking phenomena causing extinction of a native species or invasion of a nonnative one are described, as well as population models affected by a Holling type III functional response to predation where tipping due to the changes in the size of the transition may occur. In all these cases, the appearance of a critical transition can be understood as a consequence of the strength of the Allee effect.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Traditional models of opinion dynamics, in which the nodes of a network change their opinions based on their interactions with neighboring nodes, consider how opinions evolve either on time-independent networks or on temporal networks with edges that follow Poisson statistics. Most such models are Markovian. However, in many real-life networks, interactions between individuals (and hence the edges of a network) follow non-Poisson processes and thus yield dynamics with memory-dependent effects. In this paper, we model opinion dynamics in which the entities of a temporal network interact and change their opinions via random social interactions. When the edges have non-Poisson interevent statistics, the corresponding opinion models have non-Markovian dynamics. We derive a family of opinion models that are induced by arbitrary waiting-time distributions (WTDs), and we illustrate a variety of induced opinion models from common WTDs (including Dirac delta distributions, exponential distributions, and heavy-tailed distributions). We analyze the convergence to consensus of these models and prove that homogeneous memory-dependent models of opinion dynamics in our framework always converge to the same steady state regardless of the WTD. We also conduct a numerical investigation of the effects of waiting-time distributions on both transient dynamics and steady states. We observe that models that are induced by heavy-tailed WTDs converge more slowly to a steady state than models that are induced by WTDs with light tails (or with compact support) and that entities with longer waiting times exert more influence on the mean opinion at steady state.},

For systems that display relaxation oscillations, our method automatically detects boundary (time) layer structures in the dynamics, fitting inner and outer solutions and matching them in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate the method on well-studied systems: the Rayleigh oscillator and the van der Pol oscillator. We then apply the mathematical framework to networks of semisynchronized Kuramoto, Rayleigh, Rössler, and FitzHugh–Nagumo oscillators, as well as heterogeneous combinations thereof, showing that the discovery of coarse-grained variables and dynamics can be accomplished with the proposed architecture.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper investigates the stability and instability of a generalized reaction-diffusion-advection system, which describes a cross-talk between antigens and immune cells via chemokines in the immune system. Based on the spectral analysis, energy estimates, and bootstrap techniques, we first consider a linearized problem around the positive constant equilibrium and show how the reaction term and chemotactic strength affect the stability and instability of the linearized problem. Then we go a further step to study the stability and instability for the nonlinear system based on the linearized results. Moreover, the numerical simulations are carried out to support our analytically theoretical results. Our results not only extend the previous ones of [S. Lee et al., J. Math.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The rotating shallow water equations with f-plane approximation and nonlinear bottom drag are a prototypical model for midlatitude geophysical flow that experience energy loss through simple topography. Motivated by numerical schemes for large-scale geophysical flow, we consider this model on the whole space with horizontal kinetic energy backscatter source terms built from negative viscosity and stabilizing hyperviscosity with constant parameters. We study its interplay with linear and nonsmooth quadratic bottom drag through the existence of coherent flows. Our results highlight that backscatter can have undesired amplification and selection effects, generating obstacles to energy distribution. We find that decreasing linear bottom drag destabilizes the trivial flow and generates nonlinear flows that can be associated with geostrophic equilibria (GE) and inertia-gravity waves (IGWs). The IGWs are periodic travelling waves, while the GE are stationary and can be studied by a plane wave reduction. We show that for isotropic backscatter both bifurcate simultaneously and supercritically, while for anisotropic backscatter the primary bifurcations are GE. In all cases, the presence of nonsmooth quadratic bottom drag implies unusual scaling laws. For the rigorous bifurcation analysis, by Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction, care has to be taken due to this lack of smoothness and since the hyperviscous terms yield a lack of spectral gap at large wave numbers. For purely smooth bottom drag, we identify a class of explicit such flows that behave linearly within the nonlinear equations: amplitudes can be steady and arbitrary, or grow exponentially and unboundedly. We illustrate the results by numerical computations and present extended branches in parameter space.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has recently become a popular tool for the nonintrusive analysis of dynamical systems. Exploiting proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) as a dimensionality reduction technique, DMD is able to approximate a dynamical system as a sum of spatial bases evolving linearly in time, thus enabling a better understanding of the physical phenomena and forecasting of future time instants. In this work we propose an extension of DMD to parameterized dynamical systems, focusing on the future forecasting of the output of interest in a parametric context. Initially all the snapshots—for different parameters and different time instants—are projected to a reduced space; then DMD, or one of its variants, is employed to approximate reduced snapshots for future time instants. Exploiting the low dimension of the reduced space, we then combine the predicted reduced snapshots using regression techniques, thus enabling the possibility of approximating any untested parametric configuration in the future. This paper depicts in detail the algorithmic core of this method; we also present and discuss three test cases for our algorithm: a simple dynamical system with a linear parameter dependency, a heat problem with nonlinear parameter dependency, and a fluid dynamics problem with nonlinear parameter dependency.},

In this paper, a minimal, mass-conserving model of cell-polarization on a curved membrane is analyzed in the limit of slow surface diffusion. Using the tools of formal asymptotics and calculus of variations, we study the characteristic wave-pinning behavior of this system on three dynamical timescales. On the short timescale, generation of an interface separating high- and low-concentration domains is established under suitable conditions. Intermediate timescale dynamics are shown to lead to a uniform growth or shrinking of these domains to sizes that are fixed by global parameters. Finally, the long timescale dynamics reduce to area-preserving geodesic curvature flow that may lead to multi-interface steady state solutions. These results provide a foundation for studying cell polarization and related phenomena in biologically relevant geometries.},

We investigate a differential equations model for population interactions with the goal of determining when several species (i.e., coordinates of a bounded solution) must die out or “go extinct” and must do so exponentially fast. Typically each coordinate represents the population density of a different species. For our main tool, we create what we call “die-out” Lyapunov functions. A given system may have several or many such functions, each of which is a function of a different set of coordinates. That die-out function implies that one of the species in its subset must die out exponentially fast—for almost every choice of coefficients of the system. We create a “team” of die-out functions that work together to show that species must die, where is determined separately. Second, we present a “trophic” condition for generalized Lotka–Volterra systems that guarantees that there is a trapping region that is globally attracting. That implies that all solutions are bounded.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This manuscript is aimed at addressing several long-standing limitations of dynamic mode decomposition in the application of Koopman analysis. Principal among these limitations are the convergence of associated dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithms and the existence of Koopman modes. To address these limitations, two major modifications are made, where Koopman operators are removed from the analysis in light of Liouville operators (known as Koopman generators in special cases), and these operators are shown to be compact for certain pairs of Hilbert spaces selected separately as the domain and range of the operator. While eigenfunctions are discarded in the general analysis, a viable reconstruction algorithm is still demonstrated, and the sacrifice of eigenfunctions realizes the theoretical goals of DMD analysis that have yet to be achieved in other contexts. However, in the case where the domain is embedded in the range, an eigenfunction approach is still achievable, where a more typical DMD routine is established, but that leverages a finite rank representation that converges in norm. The manuscript concludes with the description of two DMD algorithms that converge when a dense collection of occupation kernels, arising from the data, are leveraged in the analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work studies front formation in the Allen–Cahn equation with a parameter heterogeneity which slowly varies in space. In particular, we consider a heterogeneity which mediates the local stability of the zero state and subsequent pitchfork bifurcation to a nontrivial state. For slowly varying ramps which are either rigidly propagating in time or stationary, we rigorously establish existence and stability of positive, monotone fronts and give leading order expansions for their interface location. For nonzero ramp speeds, and sufficiently small ramp slopes, the front location is determined by the local transition between convective and absolute instability of the base state and leads to an delay beyond the instantaneous pitchfork location before the system jumps to a nontrivial state. The slow ramp induces a further delay of the interface controlled by a slow passage through a fold of strong- and weak-stable eigenspaces of the associated linearization. We introduce projective coordinates to desingularize the dynamics near the trivial state and track relevant invariant manifolds all the way to the fold point. We then use geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up techniques to locate the desired intersection of invariant manifolds. For stationary ramps, the front is governed by the slow passage through the instantaneous pitchfork bifurcation with inner expansion given by the unique Hastings–McLeod connecting solution of Painlevé’s second equation. We once again use geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up techniques to track invariant manifolds into a neighborhood of the nonhyperbolic point where the ramp passes through zero and to locate intersections.},

It is shown that the discrete semigroup has a numerical attractor, which converges upper semicontinuously to the global attractor as the step size tends to zero. A new subject on enlarged attractors for lattice systems is investigated, which includes unique existence and convergence of attractors as well as solutions on the larger initial space. The second-order Taylor expansion and discretization error on the enlarged regular space are established to prove the upper semicontinuity of the enlarged numerical attractors with respect to the step size, while an upper bound of the enlarged attractors is provided to establish the lower semicontinuity in special cases.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We formulate an effective numerical scheme that can readily, and accurately, calculate the dynamics of weakly interacting multi-pulse solutions of the quintic complex Ginzburg–Landau equation (QCGLE) in one space dimension. The scheme is based on a global center-manifold reduction where one considers the solution of the QCGLE as the composition of individual pulses plus a remainder function, which is orthogonal to the adjoint eigenfunctions of the linearized operator about a single pulse. This center-manifold projection overcomes the difficulties of other, more orthodox, numerical schemes, by yielding a fast-slow system describing “slow” ordinary differential equations for the locations and phases of the individual pulses, and a “fast” partial differential equation for the remainder function. With small parameter where is a constant and is the minimal pulse separation distance, we write the fast-slow system in terms of first-order and second-order correction terms only, a formulation which is solved more efficiently than the full system. This fast-slow system is integrated numerically using adaptive time-stepping. Results are presented here for two- and three-pulse interactions. For the two-pulse problem, cells of periodic behavior, separated by an infinite set of heteroclinic orbits, are shown to “split” under perturbation creating complex spiral behavior. For the case of three-pulse interaction a range of dynamics, including chaotic pulse interaction, is found. While results are presented for pulse interaction in the QCGLE, the numerical scheme can also be applied to a wider class of parabolic PDEs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work we propose a model that represents the relation between fish ponds, the mosquito population and the transmission of malaria. It has been observed that in the Amazonic region of Acre, in the North of Brazil, fish farming is correlated to the transmission of malaria when carried out in artificial ponds that become breeding sites. Evidence has been found indicating that cleaning the vegetation from the edges of the crop tanks helps to control the size of the mosquito population. We use our model to determine the effective contribution of fish farming practices on malaria transmission dynamics. The model consists of a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations with jumps at the cleaning time, which act as impulsive controls. We study the asymptotic behavior of the system in function of the intensity and periodicity of the cleaning, and the value of the parameters. In particular, we state sufficient conditions under which the mosquito population is eliminated or persists, and under which the malaria is eliminated or becomes endemic. We prove our conditions by applying results for cooperative systems with concave nonlinearities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The task of modeling and forecasting a dynamical system is one of the oldest problems, and it remains challenging. Broadly, this task has two subtasks: extracting the full dynamical information from a partial observation, and then explicitly learning the dynamics from this information. We present a mathematical framework in which the dynamical information is represented in the form of an embedding. The framework combines the two subtasks using the language of spaces, maps, and commutations. The framework also unifies two of the most common learning paradigms: delay-coordinates and reservoir computing. We use this framework as a platform for two other investigations of the reconstructed system, its dynamical stability and the growth of error under iterations. We show that these questions are deeply tied to more fundamental properties of the underlying system, i.e., the behavior of matrix cocycles over the base dynamics, its nonuniform hyperbolic behavior, and its decay of correlations. Thus, our framework bridges the gap between universally observed behavior of dynamics modeling and the spectral, differential, and ergodic properties intrinsic to the dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The stability analysis of synchronization in time-varying higher-order networked structures (simplicial complexes) is a challenging problem due to the presence of time-varying group interactions. In this context, most of the previous studies have been done either on temporal pairwise networks or on static simplicial complexes. Here, for the first time, we propose a general framework to study the synchronization phenomenon in temporal simplicial complexes. We show that the synchronous state exists as an invariant solution and obtain the necessary condition for it to emerge as a stable state in the fast-switching regime. We prove that the time-averaged simplicial complex plays the role of synchronization indicator whenever the switching among simplicial topologies is adequately fast. We attempt to transform the stability problem into a master stability function form. Unfortunately, for the general circumstances, the dimension reduction of the master stability equation is cumbersome due to the presence of group interactions. However, we overcome this difficulty in two interesting situations based on either the functional forms of the coupling schemes or the connectivity structure of the simplicial complex, and we demonstrate that the necessary condition mimics the form of a master stability function in these cases. We verify our analytical findings by applying them on synthetic and real-world networked systems. We find that the presence of temporality along with the multiway interactions improves the synchronization phenomena as compared to the static higher-ordered or temporal pairwise system. In addition, our results also reveal that with sufficient higher-order coupling and adequately fast rewiring, the temporal simplicial complex achieves synchrony even in a very low connectivity regime.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multisite phosphorylation is a signaling mechanism well known to give rise to multiple steady states, a property termed multistationarity. When phosphorylation occurs in a sequential and distributive manner, we obtain a family of networks indexed by the number of phosphorylation sites . This work addresses the problem of understanding the parameter region where this family of networks displays multistationarity, by focusing on the projection of this region onto the set of kinetic parameters. The problem is phrased in the context of real algebraic geometry and reduced to studying whether a polynomial, defined as the determinant of a parametric matrix of size three, attains negative values over the positive orthant. The coefficients of the polynomial are functions of the kinetic parameters. For any , we provide sufficient conditions for the polynomial to be positive and, hence, preclude multistationarity, and also sufficient conditions for it to attain negative values and, hence, enable multistationarity. These conditions are derived by exploiting the structure of the polynomial and its Newton polytope and employing circuit polynomials. A relevant consequence of our results is that the sets of kinetic parameters that enable or preclude multistationarity are both connected for all .},

For a mechanical system consisting of a rotator and a pendulum coupled via a small, time-periodic Hamiltonian perturbation, the Arnold diffusion problem asserts the existence of “diffusing orbits” along which the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter, for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter. There is a vast literature on establishing Arnold diffusion for such systems. In this work, we consider the case when an additional, dissipative perturbation is added to the rotator-pendulum system with coupling. Therefore, the system obtained is not symplectic but conformally symplectic. We provide explicit conditions on the dissipation parameter, so that the resulting system still exhibits energy growth. The fact that Arnold diffusion may play a role in systems with small dissipation was conjectured by Chirikov. In this work, the coupling is carefully chosen, but the mechanism we present can be adapted to general couplings, and we will deal with the general case in future work.},

However, once the diffusion is sufficiently strong, the wave propagates in a single direction up the tree irrespective of the detuning parameter.

Econ., 101 (2014), pp. 90–102] to address this concern with a special emphasis on the role of the stratification of the society. In this paper we analyze the dynamics of this model, and we explore the influence of two parameters: the nature depletion rate and the inequality factor. We characterize the asymptotic states of the system through a bifurcation analysis, and we derive several quantitative predictions. We show that some collapses are irreversible and, depending on the wealth production factor, bistability regimes can be obtained. In particular, a sustainable equilibrium can coexist with cycles of prosperity and collapse. We discuss the possible policies to prevent undesirable fates.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. How does a group of agents break indecision when deciding about options with qualities that are hard to distinguish? Biological and artificial multiagent systems, from honeybees and bird flocks to bacteria, robots, and humans, often need to overcome indecision when choosing among options in situations in which the performance or even the survival of the group is at stake. Breaking indecision is also important because in a fully indecisive state, where agents are not biased toward any specific option, the agent group is maximally sensitive and prone to adapt to inputs and changes in its environment. Here, we develop a mathematical theory to study how decisions arise from the breaking of indecision. Our approach is grounded in both equivariant and network bifurcation theory. We model decision from indecision as synchrony-breaking in influence networks in which each node is the value assigned by an agent to an option. First, we show that three universal decision behaviors, namely, deadlock, consensus, and dissensus, are the generic outcomes of synchrony-breaking bifurcations from a fully synchronous state of indecision in influence networks. Second, we show that all deadlock and consensus value patterns and some dissensus value patterns are predicted by the symmetry of the influence networks. Third, we show that there are also many “exotic” dissensus value patterns. These patterns are predicted by network architecture but not by network symmetries through a new synchrony-breaking branching lemma. This is the first example of exotic solutions in an application. Numerical simulations of a novel influence network model illustrate our theoretical results.},

We assume that the unperturbed ODE has an isolated periodic orbit, and derive a set of polynomial inequalities which, if satisfied, imply the existence and uniqueness of a periodic solution in the perturbed system. A general procedure is given, which facilitates the computation of the polynomial coefficients and the optimization of the inputs necessary to satisfy the inequalities on an explicit range of the perturbing parameter. Our approach uses tools from validated numerics and interval arithmetic together with Chebyshev series expansions to obtain the periodic orbit of the ODE as well as the solution of the variational equations. The general procedure is illustrated by proving the existence of some periodic orbits in state-dependent delayed perturbations of the van der Pol equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Fluids subject to both thermal and compositional variations can undergo doubly diffusive convection when these properties both affect the fluid density and diffuse at different rates. A variety of patterns can arise from these buoyancy-driven flows, including spatially localized states known as convectons, which consist of convective fluid motion localized within a background of quiescent fluid. We consider these states in a vertical slot with the horizontal temperature and solutal gradients providing competing effects to the fluid density while allowing the existence of a conduction state. In this configuration, convectons have been studied with specific parameter values where the onset of convection is subcritical, and the states have been found to lie on a pair of secondary branches that undergo homoclinic snaking in a parameter regime below the onset of linear instability. In this paper, we show that convectons persist into parameter regimes in which the primary bifurcation is supercritical and there is no bistability, despite coexistence between the stable conduction state and large-amplitude convection. We detail this transition by considering spatial dynamics and observe how the structure of the secondary branches becomes increasingly complex owing to the increased role of inertia at low Prandtl numbers.},

Precise conditions are provided for the existence and criticality of Turing bifurcations in a general class of activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion equations on a one-dimensional infinite domain. The class includes generalized Schnakenberg and Brusselator models, as well as other models with cubic autocatalytic nonlinear terms. Previous numerical work suggests the existence of a bifurcation structure containing localized patterns due to the so-called homoclinic snaking mechanism. This paper provides explicit calculations to justify those results. Two distinct scalings of parameters that lead to tractable normal-form coefficients are considered in the limit that the diffusion ratio . First, under a small-parameter scaling, the Turing bifurcation is shown to be always subcritical. Second, a large-parameter scaling reveals the Turing bifurcation to be supercritical, leading, by continuity, to the existence of a codimension-two degenerate bifurcation. The sign of a fifth-order normal form coefficient is also computed, which is shown to have the correct sign for the local birth of homoclinic snaking. For the case of the Brusselator, two such codimension-two points can be found explicitly, as can the leading-order expression for the Maxwell point, in a parameter wedge about which localized patterns emerge. Numerical results are found to be consistent with the theory.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Kuramoto model provides a prototypical framework for synchronization phenomena in interacting particle systems. Apart from full phase synchrony where all oscillators behave identically, identical Kuramoto oscillators with ring-like nonlocal coupling can exhibit more elaborate patterns such as uniformly twisted states. It was discovered by Wiley, Strogatz, and Girvan in 2006 that the stability of these twisted states depends on the coupling range of each oscillator. In this paper, we analyze twisted states and their bifurcations in the infinite particle limit of ring-like nonlocal coupling. We not only consider traditional pairwise interactions as in the Kuramoto model but also demonstrate the effects of higher-order nonpairwise interactions, which arise naturally in phase reductions. We elucidate how pairwise and nonpairwise interactions affect the stability of the twisted states, compute bifurcating branches, and show that higher-order interactions can stabilize twisted states that are unstable if the coupling is only pairwise.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Dynamical systems have a wide range of applications in mechanics, electrical engineering, chemistry, and so on. In this work, we propose the adaptive spectral Koopman (ASK) method to solve nonlinear autonomous dynamical systems. This novel numerical method leverages the spectral-collocation (i.e., pseudospectral) method and properties of the Koopman operator to obtain the solution of a dynamical system. Specifically, this solution is represented as a linear combination of the multiplication of the Koopman operator’s eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, and these eigenpairs are approximated by the spectral method. Unlike conventional time evolution algorithms such as Euler’s scheme and the Runge–Kutta scheme, ASK is mesh free and hence is more flexible when evaluating the solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy of ASK for solving one-, two-, and three-dimensional dynamical systems.},

In the absence of inertia, it has been known that the finiteness of collisions between oscillators is equivalent to the emergence of phase-locking. Thus, a natural question is whether this finiteness result is still valid for the Kuramoto model with inertia or not. In a small inertia regime, we show that the finiteness of collisions is also equivalent to phase-locking like the Kuramoto model. In contrast, in a large inertia regime, we show that a homogeneous Kuramoto ensemble with the same natural frequency can exhibit phase-locking, while there are a countable number of collisions between Kuramoto oscillators. This is the contrasted effect of a large inertia in the phase-locking process.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Koopman analysis provides a general theoretical underpinning for widely used dynamic mode decomposition algorithms which approximate the behavior of a nonlinear dynamical system using a linear operator. While such methods have proven to be remarkably useful in the analysis of time-series data, the resulting linear models must generally be of high order to accurately approximate fundamentally nonlinear behaviors. This issue poses an inherent risk of overfitting to training data, thereby limiting predictive capabilities. By contrast, this work explores strategies for nonlinear data-driven system identification using strategies inspired by Koopman analysis. General strategies that yield nonlinear models are presented for systems both with and without control. Subsequent projection of the resulting nonlinear equations onto a low-rank basis yields a low-order representation for the underlying dynamical system. In both computational and experimental examples considered in this work, linear estimators of the Koopman operator are generally only able to provide short-term predictions for the observable dynamics, while comparable nonlinear estimators for the system dynamics provide accurate predictions on substantially longer timescales and replicate infinite-time behaviors that linear predictors cannot.},

We show that the parameters that give rise to such systems are preserved under invertible affine transformations of the network.

In this paper, we use geometric singular perturbation theory and blowup as our main technical tool to study the mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) that occur in two coupled FitzHugh–Nagumo units with symmetric and repulsive coupling. In particular, we demonstrate that the MMOs in this model are not due to generic folded singularities, but rather due to singularities at a cusp – not a fold – of the critical manifold. Using blowup, we determine the number of small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs) analytically, showing–-as for the folded nodes–-that they are determined by the Weber equation and the ratio of eigenvalues. We also show that the model undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation in the desingularized reduced problem, which–-although resembling a folded saddle-node (type II) at this level–-also occurs on a cusp, and not a fold. We demonstrate that this bifurcation is associated with the emergence of an invariant cylinder, the onset of SAOs, as well as SAOs of increasing amplitude. We relate our findings with numerical computations and find excellent agreement.},

We give examples on how this approach may be used to obtain various characteristics of single-molecule dynamics (for instance, the distribution of the number of infections in a single individual in the course of an epidemic or the activity time of a single enzyme molecule). Moreover, we show how to approximate the overall dynamics of species of interest in the full system with a collection of independent single-molecule trajectories, and give explicit bounds for the approximation error in terms of the reaction rates. This approximation, which is well defined for all times, leads to an efficient and fully parallelizable simulation technique for which we provide some numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze a class of stochastic processes, referred to as asynchronous and semianonymous dynamics (ASD), over directed labeled random networks. These processes are a natural tool to describe general best-response and noisy best-response dynamics in network games where each agent, at random times governed by independent Poisson clocks, can choose among a finite set of actions. The payoff is determined by the relative frequency of the different actions among neighbors while being independent of the specific identities of neighbors. Using a local mean-field approach, we prove rigorously that, under certain conditions on the network and initial node configuration, the evolution of ASD can be approximated, in the large-scale limit, by the solution of a system of nonlinear ODEs. Our framework is very general and applies to a large class of graph ensembles for which the typical random graph is locally tree-like. In particular, we focus on labeled configuration-model random graphs, a generalization of the traditional configuration model which allows different classes of nodes to be mixed together in the network, permitting us, for example, to incorporate a community structure in the system. Our analysis also applies to configuration-model graphs having a power-law degree distribution, an essential feature of many real systems. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of our framework, we consider several examples of dynamics belonging to our class of stochastic processes. Moreover, we illustrate by simulation the applicability of our analysis to realistic scenarios by running our example dynamics over a real social network graph.},

By approximating the system as a compositional map between the gain and loss dynamics, the underlying nonlinear dynamics can be shown to be driven by energy balances in the systems. The gain-loss iterative mapping is similar to a normal form encoding for the pattern forming instabilities generated in such spatially extended systems. Similar to mode-locked lasers and rotating detonation engines, the underlying bifurcations persist for general forms of the loss and gain, both of which admit explicit representations in our approximation. Moreover, the resulting geometrical description of the particle-wave interaction completely characterizes the instabilities observed in experiments.},

When the rigid body dynamics is driven by colored noise, and damped by double-bracket dissipation, our theoretical and numerical results show that the additional deterministic torque due to the the Lévy area correction shifts the center of the probability distribution function by shifting the Hamiltonian function in the exponent of the Gibbsian invariant measure.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We address the problem of approximating the moments of the solution, of an Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) with drift and diffusion terms over a time grid . In particular, we assume an explicit numerical scheme for the generation of sample paths and then obtain recursive equations that yield any desired noncentral moment of as a function of the initial condition . The core of the methodology is the decomposition of the numerical solution into a “central part” and an “effective noise” term. The central term is computed deterministically from the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that results from eliminating the diffusion term in the SDE, while the effective noise accounts for the stochastic deviation from the numerical solution of the ODE. For simplicity, we describe the proposed methodology based on an Euler–Maruyama integrator, but other explicit numerical schemes can be exploited in the same way. We also apply the moment approximations to construct estimates of the 1-dimensional marginal probability density functions of based on a Gram–Charlier expansion. Both for the approximation of moments and 1-dimensional densities, we describe how to handle the cases in which the initial condition is fixed (i.e., for some deterministic and known ) or random. In the latter case, we resort to polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) schemes in order to approximate the target moments. The methodology has been inspired by the PCE and differential algebra methods used for uncertainty propagation in astrodynamics problems. Hence, we illustrate its application for the quantification of uncertainty in a 2-dimensional Keplerian orbit perturbed by a Wiener noise process.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work makes explicit the degrees of freedom involved in modeling the dynamics of a network, or some other first-order property of a network, such as a measurement function. In previous work, an admissible function in a network was constructed through the evaluation of what we called oracle components. These oracle components are defined through some minimal properties that they are expected to obey. This is a high-level description in the sense that it is not clear how one could design such an object. The goal is to obtain a low-level representation of these objects by unwrapping them into their degrees of freedom. To achieve this, we introduce two decompositions. The first one is the more intuitive one and allows us to define the important concept of coupling order. The second decomposition is built on top of the first one and is valid for the class of coupling components that have finite coupling order. Despite this requirement, we show that this is still a very useful tool for designing coupling components with infinite coupling orders, through a limit approach.},

For the case of nearest neighbor attraction and next-to-nearest neighbor repulsion we prove that such a lattice admits, in contrast to the classical FPU model, moving modulating front solutions of permanent form, which have small converging tails at infinity and can be approximated by solitary wave solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. When the associated potentials are even, then the proof yields moving modulating pulse solutions of permanent form, whose profiles are spatially localized. Our analysis employs the spatial dynamics approach as developed by Iooss and Kirchgässner. The relevant solutions are constructed on a five-dimensional center manifold, and their persistence is guaranteed by reversibility arguments.},

In case the network is affected by disturbances, a stochastic linearized system of the coupled phase oscillators may be used to determine the fluctuations of phase differences in the lines between the nodes and to identify the vulnerable lines that may lead to desynchronization. The main result is the derivation of the asymptotic variance matrices of the phase differences which characterizes the severity of the fluctuations. It is found that the cycle space of the graph of the system plays a role in this characterization. With theory of the cycle space, the effect of forming small cycles on the fluctuations is evaluated. It is proven that adding a new line or increasing the coupling strength of a line affects the fluctuations in the lines in any cycle including this line, while it does not affect the fluctuations in the other lines. In particular, if the phase differences at the synchronous state are not changed by these actions, then the affected fluctuations reduce.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), also known as the circadian master clock, consists of a large population of oscillator neurons. Together, these neurons produce a coherent signal that drives the body’s circadian rhythms. What properties of the cell-to-cell communication allow the synchronization of these neurons, despite a wide range of environmental challenges such as fluctuations in photoperiods? To answer that question, we present a mean-field description of globally coupled neurons modeled as Goodwin oscillators with standard Gaussian noise. Provided that the initial conditions of all neurons are independent and identically distributed, any finite number of neurons becomes independent and has the same probability distribution in the mean-field limit, a phenomenon called propagation of chaos. This probability distribution is a solution to a Vlasov–Fokker–Planck type equation, which can be obtained from the stochastic particle model. We study, using the macroscopic description, how the interaction between external noise and intercellular coupling affects the dynamics of the collective rhythm, and we provide a numerical description of the bifurcations resulting from the noise-induced transitions. Our numerical simulations show a noise-induced rhythm generation at low noise intensities, while the SCN clock is arrhythmic in the high noise setting. Notably, coupling induces resonance-like behavior at low noise intensities, and varying coupling strength can cause period locking and variance dissipation even in the presence of noise.},

The patho-physiological mechanisms underpinning FOG are currently poorly understood. In this paper we combine time series analysis and mathematical modeling to study the FOG phenomenon’s dynamics. We focus on the transition from stepping in place into freezing and treat this phenomenon in the context of an escape from an oscillatory attractor into an equilibrium attractor state. We extract a discrete-time discrete-space Markov chain from experimental data and divide its state space into communicating classes to identify the transition into freezing. This allows us to develop a methodology for computationally estimating the time to freezing as well as the phase along the oscillatory (stepping) cycle of a patient experiencing Freezing Episodes (FE). The developed methodology is general and could be applied to any time series featuring transitions between different dynamic regimes including time series data from forward walking in people with FOG.},

In this article, we describe an algebraic method to find equilibria in this kind of system without approximation. To do this, we use a recently introduced algebraic approach to the Kuramoto dynamics, which results in an explicitly solvable complex-valued equation that captures the dynamics of the original Kuramoto model. Using this new approach, we obtain equilibria for both the nonlinear original Kuramoto and complex-valued systems considering the case of homogeneous natural frequency. We then completely classify all equilibria in the case of complete graphs originally studied by Kuramoto. Finally, we study equilibria in networks of coupled oscillators with phase-lag in generalized circulant networks, multilayer networks, and also random networks.},

In this work, we use ideas from validated numerics in order to obtain rigorous a posteriori error estimates together with existence results about gPC expansions of random invariant sets. This approach also provides a new framework for conducting validated continuation, i.e., for rigorously computing isolated branches of solutions in parameter-dependent systems, which generalizes in a straightforward way to multiparameter continuation. We illustrate the proposed methodology by rigorously computing random invariant periodic orbits in the Lorenz system, as well as branches and 2 dimensional manifolds of steady states of the Swift–Hohenberg equation.},

For every solution in these families the oriented distance to the plane , which we call , is an odd function that is also even with respect to for some . For this reason we call solutions in these families double symmetric solutions. By exploring more carefully our initial set of periodic solutions, we numerically show that some of the branches established in our existence theorem have bifurcations that produce branches of solutions with the property that the oriented distance function is not even with respect to any ; we call these solutions single symmetric solutions. We prove that no single symmetric solution is a choreography. We also display explicit double symmetric solutions that are choreographies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we take the Rosenzweig–MacArthur (RM) model with generalist predator as an example in a constant or changing environment. When the environment is fixed, we provide a more easily verifiable classification, in terms of the coefficients of the system with nilpotent linear part and general higher terms, to determine the types and codimension of nilpotent singularities in a general planar system. Second, by using the existing classification and some algebraic methods, we show that the highest codimension of a nilpotent focus is 4 and the sample RM model with generalist predator can exhibit nilpotent focus bifurcation of codimension 4. Our results indicate that generalist predation can cause not only richer bifurcations and dynamics (such as multitype tristability and quadristability, a figure-eight loop) but also the possible extirpation of prey. When the environment is changing, we study the impact of the rate and intensity of a nonlinear environmental change on dynamics. The key observations on the asymptotic and transient dynamics include (i) transient tracking on unstable steady states or oscillations, and transient-related regime shifts; (ii) slow and fast regime shifts; (iii) regulation of transient dynamics by the environmental change parameters and ; (iv) slow negative or fast positive environmental change can delay or even avoid population extirpation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We develop a model for investigating the impact of rainstorm variability on the formation of banded vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems. Water input, during rare rainstorms, is modeled as an instantaneous kick to the soil water. The redistribution, from surface water to soil moisture, accounts for the impact of vegetation on infiltration rate and downslope overland flow speed. These two positive feedbacks between water and biomass distributions act on the fast timescales of rain storms. During dry periods, a classic reaction-diffusion framework is used for the slow processes associated with soil water and biomass. This pulsed-precipitation model predicts that the preferred spacing of the vegetation bands is determined by the characteristic distance that a storm pulse of water travels overland before infiltrating into the soil. In this way, the vegetation pattern is determined by the fast ecohydrological processes and may be attuned with its dryland precipitation pattern. We demonstrate how this modeling framework, suited for stochastic rain inputs, can be used to investigate possible collapse of a dryland pattern-forming ecosystem under different precipitation patterns with identical low annual mean. Model simulations suggest, for instance, that shorter rainy seasons and greater variability in storm depth may both hasten ecosystem collapse.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A reduced order modeling strategy is proposed that can accurately capture the behavior of strongly perturbed nonlinear dynamical systems, i.e., those that are subject to general, large magnitude inputs. In contrast to standard variational approaches which consider dynamics in the neighborhood of a single reference trajectory, the proposed methodology augments the dynamics with an additional variable that continuously selects from a family of reference trajectories in order to limit truncation errors that result from neglected nonlinear terms. Provided the reference trajectories contract sufficiently rapidly in some directions, a reduced order set of equations can be obtained by choosing an appropriate coordinate system. Direct numerical approaches for computation of the necessary terms of the associated reduced order equations are provided. Crucially, because the proposed reduction strategy does not require the existence of a persistent, stable fixed point or periodic orbit, it can be implemented in situations where external inputs cause the dynamics to transition through a bifurcation. Two examples with relevance to neural control are provided. In the first, the proposed reduction strategy allows for the formulation of a numerically tractable control problem to identify energy-optimal inputs that eliminate tonic firing in a neural model. In the second example, the proposed reduction framework accurately captures successive transitions between quiescence and tonic firing across the boundary of a saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation.},

Because of the high dimensionality of reaction-diffusion systems on networks, exploration for the bifurcation properties of such systems has been far less thorough than their corresponding parabolic PDE systems. With the overcoming of this long-standing difficulty, we consider the steady state bifurcation for the general network-organized reaction-diffusion system and derive the algorithm of calculating the perturbation incorporated restricted system associated with the simple zero singularity, through seeking out the parameter dependent center manifolds belonging to the unique zero eigenvalue. Rigorous theoretical analysis for the third-order truncated restricted system shows that the complex underlying networks can trigger some bifurcation types differing from the usual supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations and so enrich the dynamical behaviors of reaction-diffusion process in networks. To illustrate the application for our obtained theoretical results, we conduct a strict steady state bifurcation analysis for a metapopulation epidemic system defined on four typical connected undirected underlying networks, and find that there exist some new multistability phenomena and hysteresis effects in the irregular small-word and scale-free lattice network.},

This approach has a rigorous foundation in Koopman operator theory and it produces good forecasts in practice, but it suffers from the heavy computational costs common to kernel methods. This paper proposes a streaming algorithm for KAF that only requires a single pass over the training data. This algorithm dramatically reduces the costs of training and prediction without sacrificing forecasting skill. Computational experiments demonstrate that the streaming KAF method can successfully forecast several classes of dynamical systems (periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic) in both data-scarce and data-rich regimes. The overall methodology may have wider interest as a new template for streaming kernel regression.},

The implication for the underlying biological system is robustness in the concentration of one of the species independent of the initial conditions as well as independent of the concentration of all other species. Identifying network conditions for dynamic ACR is a challenging problem. We lay the groundwork in this paper by studying small reaction networks, those with two reactions and two species. We give a complete classification by ACR properties of these minimal reaction networks. The dynamics are rich even within this simple setting. Insights obtained from this work will help illuminate the properties of more complex networks with dynamic ACR.},

Combining these divergence rate fields with information inequalities derived in [M. Branicki and K. Uda, SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantif., 9 (2021), pp. 1242–1313] allows for a principled quantification of Lagrangian uncertainty in a given dynamics, as well as a mitigation of the uncertainty in path-based observables estimated from simplified models of the truth/reference dynamics in a way that is amenable to algorithmic implementations. This approach can be utilized in information-geometric analysis of statistical estimation and inference, as well as in a data-driven machine learning of reduced-order models.

The goal of this paper is to study the invariant sets generated by resonances under foliation preserving torus maps. They are a special kind of torus maps which preserve a foliation of irrational lines . Foliation preserving maps appear naturally as a reparameterization of linear flows in the torus and also play an important role in several applications involving coupled oscillators, delay equations, resonators with moving walls, etc. The invariant objects we find here lead to predictions on the behavior of these models. Since the results of this paper are meant to be applied to other problems, we have developed very quantitative results giving explicit descriptions of the phenomena and the invariant objects that control them. The structure of the phase locking regions for foliation preserving maps is different than for generic maps of the torus. Indeed, for the sake of completeness, we have developed a similar analysis for the case of generic maps of the torus and shown that the objects that appear in foliation preserving maps are quantitatively and qualitatively different from those of generic torus maps. This has consequences in applications.},

We suppose the input to the pathway to switch between zero and a positive value according to the concentration of the metabolite effector. Considering the switching system as a differential inclusion, we prove that it converges to a globally uniformly asymptotically stable equilibrium point, reaches the sliding mode, or oscillates around the sliding mode depending on the positive value of the input. Finally, we show that in any case the solution of the switching system is the limit of solutions of equation sequences with smooth or piecewise linear inputs.},

We study stochastic perturbations of ODEs with stable limit cycles — referred to as stochastic oscillators — and investigate the response of the asymptotic (in time) frequency of oscillations to changing noise amplitude. Unlike previous studies, we do not restrict our attention to the small-noise limit, and we account for the fact that large deviation events may push the system out of its oscillatory regime. To do so, we consider stochastic oscillators conditioned on their remaining in an oscillatory regime for all time. This leads us to use the theory of quasi-ergodic measures, and to define quasi-asymptotic frequencies as conditional, long-time average frequencies. We show that quasi-asymptotic frequencies exist under minimal assumptions, though they may or may not be observable in practice. Our discussion recovers and expands upon previous results on stochastic oscillators in the literature. In particular, existing results imply that the asymptotic frequency of a stochastic oscillator depends quadratically on the noise amplitude. We describe scenarios where this prediction holds, though we also show that it is not true in general — potentially, even for small noise.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is an efficient tool for decomposing spatio-temporal data into a set of low-dimensional modes, yielding the oscillation frequencies and the growth rates of physically significant modes. In this paper, we propose a novel DMD model that can be used for dynamical systems affected by multiplicative noise. We first derive a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the data-based model decomposition of a linear dynamical system corrupted by certain multiplicative noise. Applying penalty relaxation to the MAP estimator, we obtain the proposed DMD model whose epigraphical limits are the MAP estimator and the conventional optimized DMD model. We also propose an efficient alternating gradient descent method for solving the proposed DMD model and analyze its convergence behavior. The proposed model is demonstrated on both the synthetic data and the numerically generated one-dimensional combustor data and is shown to have superior reconstruction properties compared to state-of-the-art DMD models. Considering that multiplicative noise is ubiquitous in numerous dynamical systems, the proposed DMD model opens up new possibilities for accurate data-based modal decomposition.},

We intend to reveal how the fractional dissipation and the time-dependent force affect long-time dynamics of weak solutions. More precisely, we prove that with certain conditions on , there exists a finite-dimensional Lipschitz manifold in the -space of divergent-free vector fields with zero mean. The manifold is locally forward invariant and pullback exponentially attracting. Moreover, the compact uniform attractor is contained in the union of all fibers of the manifold. In our result, no large viscosity is assumed. It is also significant that in the three-dimensional case the spectrum of the fractional Laplacian does not have arbitrarily large gaps.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work focuses on angular values of nonautonomous dynamical systems which have been introduced for general random and (non)autonomous dynamical systems in a previous publication [W.-J. Beyn, G. Froyland, and T. Hls, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 21 (2022), pp. 1245–1286]. The angular value of dimension measures the maximal average rotation which an -dimensional subspace of the phase space experiences through the dynamics of a discrete-time linear system. Our main results relate the notion of angular value to the well-known dichotomy (or Sacker–Sell) spectrum and its associated spectral bundles. In particular, we prove a reduction theorem which shows that instead of maximizing over all subspaces, it suffices to maximize over so-called trace spaces which have their basis in the spectral fibers. The reduction leads to an algorithm for computing angular values of dimensions one and two. We apply the algorithm to several systems of dimension up to 4 and demonstrate its efficiency to detect the fastest rotating subspace even if it is not dominant under the forward dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a deterministic model of a rock-paper-scissors cyclic ecological system. The model accounts for species mobility via Fickian diffusion, as well as interspecies interactions describing the cyclic competition scheme. The system admits both single-species equilibria (saddles) and a three-species coexistence equilibrium state. We focus on the regime where coexistence is unstable. When there is no spatial dependence, the solution of the corresponding ordinary differential equation system admits an attracting heteroclinic cycle consisting of orbits connecting the three single-species saddles in the sequence, to which most solutions with physical initial conditions asymptote. When there is spatial dependence (partial differential equation system), we consider mixed initial conditions (all species cohabit the same spatial region), as well as patch initial conditions, where each species is isolated from the other two, and show that, when interspecies competition is not strong, spatiotemporal chaotic behavior generally occurs. We propose a mechanism for the development of chaos—patch splitting—whereby sufficiently large patches are repeatedly split by the diffusion of competitors into the patch. However, when there is strong interspecies competition, ordered spatiotemporal patterns can occur. We consider both 1D patterns, corresponding to a community confined to a thin, circular annulus, and 2D geometries, simulating a petri dish. We show that, in 1 dimension, traveling arrays of single-species patches, as well as modulated traveling waves, consisting of patches which periodically expand and contract (breather modes), exist. In 2 dimensions, spirals, as well as localized patches chasing each other in the sequence, can occur. We consider length and temporal scales appropriate for a bacterial community in a laboratory setting, qualitatively modeling observed Escherichia coli cyclic bacterial systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a mean-field formalism for modeling firing-rate statistics of brain regions whose neurons exhibit atypical firing patterns and heterogeneous electrophysiological properties. We apply the formalism to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)—the human circadian pacemaker—whose neurons can intrinsically exhibit depolarized low-amplitude membrane oscillations (DLAMOs), depolarization block (DB), and standard action potential firing at different times of day. Further, gamma-aminobutyric acid reversal potentials and molecular circadian phases of SCN neurons, among other properties, vary across the network and/or slowly over time. Our formalism consists of a system of integro-differential equations describing the time evolution of the mean and standard deviation of synaptic conductances across the network. Electrophysiological properties of SCN neurons are incorporated by computing responses to synaptic conductance inputs of a Hodgkin–Huxley-type SCN neuron model that exhibits DLAMOs and DB. Such responses are then averaged over distributions of relevant quantities and included in the differential equations. Results suggest mechanisms by which physiologically relevant changes to firing activities may arise, highlighting means by which the amplitude of firing rates may shrink, the standard deviation of firing rates may grow, and by which a mid-day dip in firing rates may appear. For instance, results show that a large spread in circadian phases across SCN neurons reduces the size of oscillations in SCN network firing activity across the 24-hour day, identifying a mechanism by which heterogeneities in neuron electrophysiology could influence circadian rhythms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. One of the most important problems arising in time series analysis is that of classifying the states of a dynamical system. That is, given a collection of time series, is it possible to perform two-state classification (chaotic versus periodic) of the underlying system? For this task, we turn to the field of topological data analysis, which encodes information about the shape and structure of data. In this paper, we investigate a more recent method for encoding the structure of the attractor as a weighted graph, known as the ordinal partition network, representing information about when the dynamical system has passed between certain regions of state space. We provide methods to incorporate the weighting information and show that this framework provides more resilience to noise or perturbations in the system as well as improving the accuracy of dynamic state identification.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The goal of this work is to introduce a new online data driven modeling solution for tracking the dynamics of systems, the behavior of which is governed by (nonlinear) partial differential equations (PDEs). In order to reach this goal, this paper introduces a recursive algorithm for black box time varying model identification along with an online algorithm for reducing the order of the identified model. The resulting system model is a linear time varying low order state space representation usable, e.g., for controller design or prediction. The model reduction step relies on the recursive determination of the orthonormal basis of a specific data based proper orthogonal decomposition. The system identification procedure is initialized with the dynamic mode decomposition with control and updated recursively via the introduction of a specific recursive least squares algorithm. In both steps, a forgetting factor is used to focus on the most recent variations of the system. As case studies, a linear heat diffusion equation with a time varying diffusion parameter is first considered. The Burgers equation, a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE, is then utilized to assess the introduced methods applicability with nonlinear systems. Identification results based on simulation show the high accuracy of this new approach.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents a framework to perform bifurcation analysis in laboratory experiments or simulations. We employ control-based continuation to study the dynamics of a macroscopic variable of a microscopically defined model, exploring the potential viability of the underlying feedback control techniques in an experiment. In contrast to previous experimental studies that used iterative root-finding methods on the feedback control targets, we propose a feedback control law that is inherently noninvasive. That is, the control discovers the location of equilibria and stabilizes them simultaneously. We call the proposed control zero-in-equilibrium feedback control and we prove that it is able to stabilize branches of equilibria, except at singularities of codimension , where is the number of state space dimensions the feedback can depend on. We apply the method to a simulated evacuation scenario where pedestrians have to reach an exit after maneuvering left or right around an obstacle. The scenario shows a hysteresis phenomenon with bistability and tipping between two possible steady pedestrian flows in microscopic simulations. We demonstrate for the evacuation scenario that the proposed control law is able to uniformly discover and stabilize steady flows along the entire branch, including points where other noninvasive approaches to feedback control become singular.},
