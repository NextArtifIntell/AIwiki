  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper focuses on the structural stability of interior subsonic steady-states to the multi-dimensional Euler–Poisson system of hydrodynamic model for semiconductors with sonic boundary. As we know, the doping profile plays a crucial role for the existence/nonexistence of all types of subsonic/supersonic/transonic solutions for the multidimensional steady hydrodynamic model of semiconductors with sonic boundary. So it is quite significant and important to further investigate the structural stability of these physical solutions, when the doping profile is with small perturbation. The main issue of this paper is to study the structural stability of the radial interior subsonic steady-states, once the perturbations of doping profiles are small enough. Owing to the boundary degeneracy, and the strong singularity of the subsonic steady-states at the sonic boundary, it is full of challenges to derive the globally structural stability of interior subsonic solutions in multidimensional case. The adopted approach is the local singularity analysis at the sonic boundaries, with the help of the monotonicity argument.},

Under two different kinds of assumptions on , we prove several new existence results, which, in the context of normalized solutions, can be considered as both counterparts of planar unconstrained critical problems and extensions of unconstrained Schrödinger problems with Rabinowitz-type trapping potential. Especially, in this scenario, we develop some sharp estimates of energy levels and ingenious analysis techniques to restore the compactness which are novel even for constant. We believe that these techniques will allow not only treating other -constrained problems in the Trudinger–Moser critical setting but also generalizing previous results to the case of variable potentials.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We prove that linear and weakly nonlinear run and tumble equations converge to a unique steady state solution with an exponential rate in a weighted total variation distance. In the linear setting, our result extends the previous results to an arbitary dimension while relaxing the assumptions. The main challenge is that even though the equation is a mass-preserving, Boltzmann-type kinetic-transport equation, the classical hypocoercivity methods, e.g., by J. Dolbeault, C. Mouhot, and C. Schmeiser [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 367 (2015), pp. 3807–3828], are not applicable for dimension . We overcome this difficulty by using a probabilistic technique, known as Harris’s theorem. We also introduce a weakly nonlinear model via a nonlocal coupling on the chemoattractant concentration. This toy model serves as an intermediate step between the linear model and the physically more relevant nonlinear models. We build a stationary solution for this equation and provide a hypocoercivity result.},

We study the generalized capacitance matrix as a model for three-dimensional coupled resonators with long-range interactions and consider defect modes that are induced by compact perturbations. If such a mode exists, then there are elements of the discrete spectrum of the corresponding truncated finite system that converge to each element of the pure point spectrum. The rate of convergence depends on the dimension of the lattice. When the dimension of the lattice is equal to that of the physical space, the convergence is exponential. Conversely, when the dimension of the lattice is less than that of the physical space, the convergence is only algebraic, because of long-range interactions arising due to coupling with the far field.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Laplace–Beltrami problem on closed surfaces embedded in three dimensions arises in many areas of physics, including molecular dynamics (surface diffusion), electromagnetics (harmonic vector fields), and fluid dynamics (vesicle deformation). In particular, the Hodge decomposition of vector fields tangent to a surface can be computed by solving a sequence of Laplace–Beltrami problems. Such decompositions are very important in magnetostatic calculations and in various plasma and fluid flow problems. In this work we develop -invertibility theory for the Laplace–Beltrami operator on piecewise smooth surfaces, extending earlier weak formulations and integral equation approaches on smooth surfaces. Furthermore, we reformulate the weak form of the problem as an interface problem with continuity conditions across edges of adjacent piecewise smooth panels of the surface. We then provide high-order numerical examples along surfaces of revolution to support our analysis and discuss numerical extensions to general surfaces embedded in three dimensions.},

This is achieved by first conditioning the underlying stochastic process to nonfixation in order to get rid of singularities on the boundaries, and then studying the conditioned -process from a more traditional and variational point of view. In doing so we complete the work initiated in [Chalub et al., Acta Appl. Math., 171 (2021), pp. 1–50], where the gradient flow was identified only formally. The approach is based on the energy dissipation inequality and evolution variational inequality notions of metric gradient flows. Building up on some convexity of the driving entropy functional, we obtain new contraction estimates and quantitative long-time convergence towards the stationary distribution.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The large-time behavior of a nonlinearly coupled pair of measure-valued transport equations with discontinuous boundary conditions, parameterized by a positive real-valued parameter , is considered. These equations describe the hydrodynamic or fluid limit of many-server queues with reneging (with traffic intensity ), which model phenomena in diverse disciplines, including biology and operations research. For a broad class of reneging distributions with finite mean, and service distributions with finite mean and hazard rate function that is either nonincreasing or bounded away from zero and infinity, it is shown that if the fluid equations have a unique invariant state, then the Dirac measure at this invariant state is the unique invariant distribution of the fluid equations. In particular, this implies that the stationary distributions of scaled -server systems converge to the unique invariant state of the corresponding fluid equations. Moreover, when the mean arrival rate is not equal to the mean service rate, that is, when , it is shown that the solution to the fluid equation starting from any initial condition converges to this unique invariant state in the large-time limit. The proof techniques are different under the two sets of assumptions on the service distribution, as well as under the two regimes and . When the hazard rate function is nonincreasing, a reformulation of the dynamics in terms of a certain renewal equation is used, in conjunction with recursive asymptotic estimates. When the hazard rate function is bounded away from zero and infinity, the proof uses an extended relative entropy functional as a Lyapunov function. Analogous large-time convergence results are also established for a system of coupled measure-valued equations modeling a multiclass queue.},

We study the stability for a coupled system of second-order evolution equations with indirect memory-damping, which arises from the theory of viscoelasticity and takes the Timoshenko systems as concrete examples. What concerns us is how to efficiently control the memory kernels to achieve the desired stabilities of the whole system. With the help of the memory and coupling effects in the system, we establish some optimal stability results for the energy of the system under weak conditions. Especially, we do not need the usual nonnegative/nonincreasing restrictions on the memory kernels in our results. For the Timoshenko systems, we obtain the optimal decay rate under minimal assumptions on memory kernels and the best (so far) exponential stability result in the case of equal wave speeds. As can be seen, to overcome the difficulties in obtaining these results, novel ideas and techniques are presented and utilized in our proofs.},

These systems play an important role in the mechanical modeling of living tissues and tumor growth. Due to their mixed parabolic-hyperbolic structure, even proving the existence of solutions to these equations is challenging. In this paper, we exploit the parabolic structure of the system to prove the strong compactness of the pressure gradient in . The key ingredient is the energy dissipation relation, which, along with some compensated compactness arguments, allows us to upgrade weak convergence to strong convergence. As a consequence of the pressure compactness, we are able to prove the existence of solutions in a general setting and pass to the Hele-Shaw/incompressible limit in any dimension.},

For such a controlled system with an SDE constraint, we introduce a rigorous limit process toward an infinite-dimensional optimal control problem constrained by the coupling of a system of ODE for the leaders with a McKean–Vlasov type of SDE, governing the dynamics of the prototypical follower. The latter is, under some assumptions on the distribution of the initial data, equivalent with a (nonlinear parabolic) PDE-ODE system. The derivation of the limit mean-field optimal control problem is achieved by linking the mean-field limit of the governing equations together with the -limit of the cost functionals for the finite-dimensional problems.},

It is proved to be approximated in the sense of -convergence by a sequence of discrete integral functionals defined on continuous piecewise affine functions.

This result can also be formulated in the language of stable norms corresponding to periodic metrics in . Similar results were known long ago when for front speeds in . The two-dimensional case is much more subtle due to topological restrictions. In fact, for given front speeds, the effective front is and hence cannot be a polygon. Our regularity requirements on front speeds are hence optimal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that polygonal effective fronts have been constructed in two dimensions.},

In this article, we apply equivariant Pyragas control to discrete waves, which are periodic solutions that have a finite number of spatio-temporal symmetries. We prove sufficient conditions under which a discrete wave can be stabilized via equivariant Pyragas control. The result is applicable to a broad class of discrete waves, including discrete waves that are far away from a bifurcation point. Key ingredients of the proof are an adaptation of Floquet theory to systems with symmetries, and the use of characteristic matrix functions to reduce the infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem to a one dimensional zero finding problem.},

Here we first prove some regularization properties of weak solutions in finite time. Then we show the validity of the strict separation property for both problems. This means that the solutions stay uniformly away from the pure phases from any positive time onward. This property plays an essential role to achieving higher-order regularity for the solutions. Also, it is a rigorous validation of the standard double-well approximation. The present results are a twofold extension of the well-known ones for the classical equation in planar domains.},

Previous work by Iyer, Xu, and Zlatoš produces a family of cellular flows that can enhance dissipation by an arbitrarily large amount. We improve this result by providing quantitative bounds on the dissipation enhancement in terms of the flow amplitude, cell size, and diffusivity. Explicitly we show that the mixing time is bounded by the exit time from one cell when the flow amplitude is large enough, and by the reciprocal of the effective diffusivity when the flow amplitude is small. This agrees with the optimal heuristics. We also prove a general result relating the dissipation time of incompressible flows to the mixing time. The main idea behind the proof is to study the dynamics probabilistically and construct a successful coupling.},

This paper reinterprets the Freidlin–Wentzell variational construction of the rate function in the large deviation principle for invariant measures from the weak KAM perspective. Through a one-dimensional irreversible diffusion process on a torus, we explicitly characterize essential concepts in the weak KAM theory, such as the Peierls barrier and the projected Mather/Aubry/Mañé sets. The weak KAM representation of the Freidlin–Wentzell variational construction of the rate function is discussed based on the global adjustment for the boundary data and the local trimming from the lifted Peierls barriers. This rate function gives the maximal Lipschitz continuous viscosity solution to the corresponding stationary Hamilton–Jacobi equation (HJE), satisfying the Freidlin–Wentzell variational formula for the boundary data on the Aubry set. Choosing meaningful self-consistent boundary data at each local attractor is essential to select a unique weak KAM solution to stationary HJE. This selected viscosity solution also serves as the global energy landscape of the original stochastic process. This selection for stationary HJEs can be described by first taking the long time limit and then taking the zero noise limit, which also provides a special construction of vanishing viscosity approximation.},

The proof is based on the weighted estimates of both hyperbolic and parabolic types with weights capturing the singular behavior of higher-order normal derivatives near vacuum states, exploring the balance between the physical singularity which pushes the vacuum boundary outward and the effect of gravity which pulls it inward, and the dissipation of the frictional damping. The results obtained in this paper are the first ones on the global existence of solutions to the vacuum free boundary problems of inviscid compressible fluids with the nonexpanding background solutions.

Under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, the dynamics of such systems have been studied extensively. However, the corresponding Dirichlet problem remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the existence and nonexistence of positive steady-state solutions and make a detailed description for the global bifurcation structure of the set of positive steady-state solutions. Compared with the original systems without indirect prey-taxis, our mathematical analysis shows that the introduction of indirect prey-taxis not only makes mathematical analysis more difficult, but also affects the bifurcation structure of the set of positive steady-state solutions. We hope this work will inspire further research on prey-predator systems with indirect prey-taxis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we study the global wellposedness of a radiation hydrodynamics model with viscosity and thermal conductivity. It is now well-understood that, unlike the compressible Euler equations whose smooth solutions must blow up in finite time no matter how small and how smooth the initial data is, the dissipative structure of such a radiation hydrodynamics model can indeed guarantee that its one-dimensional Cauchy problem admits a unique global smooth solution provided that the initial data is sufficiently small, while for large initial data, even if the heat conductivity is taken into account but the viscosity effect is ignored, shock type singularities must appear in finite time for smooth solutions of the Cauchy problem of a one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics model with thermal conductivity and zero viscosity. Thus a natural question is, If effects of both the viscosity and the thermal conductivity are considered, does the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics model with viscosity and thermal conductivity exist as a unique global large solution? We give an affirmative answer to this problem and show in this paper that the initial-boundary value problem to the radiation hydrodynamics model in a one-dimensional periodic box with viscosity and thermal conductivity does exist as a unique global smooth solution for any large initial data. The main ingredient in our analysis is to introduce some delicate estimates, especially an improved estimate on the absolute temperature for some and a pointwise estimate between the absolute temperature, the specific volume, and the first-order spatial derivative of the macro radiation flux, to deduce the desired positive lower and upper bounds on the density and the absolute temperature.},

We quantify this effect near homogeneous isotropic equilibria . Notably, in the absence of particle (translational and orientational) diffusion, swimming is the only stabilizing mechanism. On the torus, in the nondiffusive regime, we demonstrate linear Landau damping up to the stability threshold predicted in the applied literature. With small diffusion, we demonstrate nonlinear stability of arbitrary equilibrium values for pullers (front-actuated swimmers) and enhanced dissipation for both pullers and pushers (rear-actuated swimmers) at small concentrations. On the whole space, we prove nonlinear stability of the vacuum equilibrium due to generalized Taylor dispersion.},

We are able to conclude that in fact for any bounded entropy solution , the density is almost everywhere upper semicontinuous away from vacuum. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a nonlinear hyperbolic system, which fails to be Temple class, but has the property that generic initial data give rise to bounded entropy solutions with a form of near classical regularity. This provides one example that hyperbolic systems can possess some of the more striking regularizing effects known to hold generically in the genuinely nonlinear, multidimensional scalar setting. While we are not able to use our regularity results to show unconditional uniqueness, the results substantially lower the likelihood that current methods of convex integration can be used in this setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article has two purposes. The first is to prove that solutions of the second boundary value problem for generated Jacobian equations (GJEs) are strictly -convex. The second is to prove the global regularity of Aleksandrov solutions to the same problem. In particular, Aleksandrov solutions are classical solutions. These are related because the strict -convexity is essential for the proof of the global regularity. The assumptions for the strict -convexity are the natural extension of those used by Chen and Wang in the optimal transport case. They are the Loeper maximum principle condition, a positively pinched right-hand side, a -convex target, and a source domain strictly contained in a -convex domain. This improves the existing domain conditions, though at the expense of requiring a generating function. This is appropriate for global regularity where existence is proved assuming a generating function. We prove the global regularity under the hypothesis that Jiang and Trudinger recently used to obtain the existence of a globally smooth solution and an additional condition on the height of solutions. Our proof of global regularity is by modifying Jiang and Trudinger’s existence result to construct a globally solution intersecting the Aleksandrov solution. Then the strict convexity yields the interior regularity to apply the author’s uniqueness results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the inverse boundary value problem of determining a coefficient function in an elliptic partial differential equation from knowledge of the associated Neumann–Dirichlet-operator. The unknown coefficient function is assumed to be piecewise constant with respect to a given pixel partition, and upper and lower bounds are assumed to be known a priori. We will show that this Calderón problem with finitely many unknowns can be equivalently formulated as a minimization problem for a linear cost functional with a convex nonlinear semidefinite constraint. We also prove error estimates for noisy data, and extend the result to the practically relevant case of finitely many measurements, where the coefficient is to be reconstructed from a finite-dimensional Galerkin projection of the Neumann–Dirichlet-operator. Our result is based on previous works on Loewner monotonicity and convexity of the Neumann–Dirichlet-operator, and the technique of localized potentials. It connects the emerging fields of inverse coefficient problems and semidefinite optimization.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nonlinear extensions of the quasi-static Biot model of consolidation are studied with emphasis on boundary conditions, attainment of initial values, and parabolic regularizing effects. The local fluid content is monotone and possibly nonlinear or degenerate with respect to pressure, and the stress of the solid in the fully saturated porous medium is strictly monotone in strain. In addition to boundary conditions of classical Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin type, the medium may have a singular or degenerate semipermeable interface with the exterior fluid at a known pressure, and the monotone dependence of traction on boundary displacement includes unilateral constraints of Signorini type given by a variational inequality. The initial-boundary-value problem for this general system is formulated as a Cauchy problem in Hilbert space for a semilinear implicit evolution equation that is nonlinear in the time derivative, and it is shown to be well-posed with regularity of the solution dependent on the data. When the stress is the derivative of a convex strain energy function, the evolution equation is a gradient flow with corresponding parabolic regularizing effects on the solution.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the time-domain acoustic wave propagation in the presence of a microbubble. This microbubble is characterized by a mass density and bulk modulus which are both very small compared to the ones of the background vacuum. The goal is to estimate the amount of pressure that is created very near (at a distance proportional to the radius of the bubble) to the bubble. We show that, at that small distance, the dominating field is reminiscent of the wave created by a point-like obstacle modeled formally by a Dirac-like heterogeneity with support at the location of the bubble and the contrast between the bubble and background material as the scattering coefficient. As a conclusion, we can tune the bubble’s material properties so that the pressure near it reaches a desired amount. Such a design might be useful for the purpose of acoustic cavitation, where one needs enough, but not too much, pressure to eliminate unwanted anomalies. The mathematical analysis is done using time-domain integral equations and asymptotic analysis techniques. A well known feature here is that the contrasting scales between the bubble and the background generate resonances (mainly the Minnaert one) in the time-harmonic regime. Such critical scales, and the generated resonances, are also reflected in the time-domain estimation of the acoustic wave. In particular, reaching the desired amount of pressure near the location of the bubble is possible only with such resonating bubbles.},

We describe the large time asymptotic expansions of the conservative solutions and rigorously verify the validity of the leading order term in and spaces, respectively. The leading order term is given by a kink-wave that is determined by the total energy of the system only. As a corollary, we also show that the singular part of the energy measure converges to zero, as the time goes to either positive or negative infinity. Under some natural decay rate assumptions on the tails of the initial energy measure, we rigorously provide the optimal error estimates in and . As the time goes to infinity, the pointwise convergence and pointwise growth rate for the solution are also obtained under the same assumptions on the initial data. The proofs of our results rely heavily on the elaborate analysis of the generalized characteristics designed for the measure-valued initial data and explicit formulae for conservative solutions.},

Furthermore, we strengthen previous results by obtaining an explicit convergence rate arbitrarily close to the (formal) optimal rate, provided that the initial data lie in some space with large enough. Our result holds on bounded time intervals whose size grows to infinity in the asymptotic limit with explicit lower bound. The analysis relies on identifying the right set of phase-space coordinates to study the regime of interest. In this set of coordinates, the limiting model arises explicitly.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In recent decades qualitative inverse scattering methods with eigenvalues as target signatures have received much attention. To understand those methods, knowledge of the properties of the related eigenvalue problems is essential. However, even the existence of eigenvalues for such (nonselfadjoint) problems is a challenging question and existing results for absorbing media are usually established under unrealistic assumptions or a smoothing of the eigenvalue problem. We present a technique to prove the existence of infinitely many eigenvalues for such problems under realistic assumptions. In particular we consider the class of scalar and modified Maxwell nonselfadjoint Steklov eigenvalue problems. In addition, we present stability results for the eigenvalues with respect to changes in the material parameters. In distinction to existing results, the analysis of the present article requires only minimal regularity assumptions. By that we mean that the regularity of the domain is not required to be better than Lipschitz, and the material coefficients are only assumed to be piecewise . Also the stability estimates for eigenvalues are obtained solely in -norms of the material perturbations.},

We then apply this general framework to two types of nonautonomous evolution equations: Reaction-diffusion equations and FitzHugh-Nagumo systems, driven by time-dependent additive/multiplicative forces, on a 2-D rectangular domain or a 3-D cubic domain. It is significant that on the 3D domain the spectrum of the linear unbounded operator in the principal part does not have arbitrarily large gaps.

In constrast to the soft potential case, local existence for the hard potentials case has been missing from the literature. This is because the moment loss issue is the most severe for these potentials. To get over this issue, our proof relies on a weighted hierarchy of norms that depends on the number of spatial and velocity derivatives in an asymmetric way. This hierarchy lets us take care of the terms that are affected by the moment loss issue the most. These terms do not give in to methods applied to study the existence of solutions to the Landau equation with soft potentials and are a major reason why the local existence problem was not known for the case of hard potentials.},

After characterizing the limit problem, we embark on a comprehensive study of the problem in one space dimension to illustrate the delicate nature of the problem, including the generic nature of nonuniqueness and instability. For compactly supported initial data, we show that the density can either perish or thrive, even if it starts from the same initial data, depending on its initial pressure configuration. When the initial pressure is a characteristic function, we establish the existence of the sharp threshold separating the two behaviors. Last, we present a detailed analysis of the behavior of traveling waves in this incompressible limit. We study the existence of traveling waves for the limiting model and prove convergence results in the incompressible limit (depending on the reaction term).},

This paper studies supersonic reacting jet flows from a three-dimensional (3D) divergent conical nozzle. We assume that the flow is governed by 3D steady Zeldovich–von Neumann–Döring combustion equations with cylindrical symmetry and that the state of the flow is given at the inlet of the nozzle. When the nozzle is surrounded by a vacuum, we obtain a global continuous and piecewise smooth supersonic reacting jet flow expanding into the vacuum from the nozzle. When the nozzle is surrounded by a static atmosphere with a lower pressure than the pressure of the flow at the exit of the nozzle, we obtain a local continuous and piecewise smooth supersonic reacting jet flow expanding into the atmosphere from the nozzle. Moreover, we also give an explanation for the formation of intercepting shocks in supersonic jets expanding into a lower pressure environment, which is stated in section 148 in the famous book Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves and is verified by physical experiments. The flow patterns constructed in the paper may be used as background solutions for more general supersonic jet flow problems. The result in the paper is also suitable for nonreacting supersonic jet flows.},

Local energy decay constitutes a powerful tool in the study of dispersive partial differential equations on such geometric backgrounds. By utilizing the geometric control condition to handle trapped trajectories, we are able to recover high frequency estimates without any loss. We may then apply known estimates from the work of Metcalfe, Sterbenz, and Tataru in the medium and low frequency regimes in order to establish local energy decay. This generalizes the integrated version of results established by Bouclet and Royer from the setting of asymptotically Euclidean manifolds to the full Lorentzian case.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We use the Maslov index to study the spectrum of a class of linear Hamiltonian differential operators. We provide a lower bound on the number of positive real eigenvalues, which includes a contribution to the Maslov index from a nonregular crossing. A close study of the eigenvalue curves, which represent the evolution of the eigenvalues as the domain is shrunk or expanded, yields formulas for their concavity at the nonregular crossing in terms of the corresponding Jordan chains. This enables the computation of the Maslov index at such a crossing via a homotopy argument. We apply our theory to study the spectral (in)stability of standing waves in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation on a compact interval. We derive stability results in the spirit of the Jones–Grillakis instability theorem and the Vakhitov–Kolokolov criterion, both originally formulated on the real line. A fundamental difference on passing from the real line to the compact interval is the loss of translational invariance, in which case the zero eigenvalue of the linearized operator is (typically) geometrically simple. Consequently, the stability results differ depending on the boundary conditions satisfied by the wave. We compare our lower bound to existing results involving constrained eigenvalue counts, finding a direct relationship between the correction factors found therein and the objects of our analysis, including the second-order Maslov crossing form.},

Among all possible cracked and uncracked admissible configurations, the one obtained under Dirichlet-type boundary conditions realizes the minimum of a regularized Griffith’s energy that includes curvature terms. For it, we prove the existence of minimizers for different constitutive functional choices and geometric structures with or without active through-the-thickness microstructure.

Current-carrying coils are represented as singularities within the magnetic field and therefore this problem can be modeled mathematically as finding how far we can harmonically extend a vector field from the boundary of a domain. For this paper we consider two-dimensional domains with real analytic boundary and prove that a harmonic extension exists if and only if the boundary data satisfies a combined compatibility and regularity condition. Our method of proof uses a generalization of a result of Hadamard on the Cauchy problem for the Laplacian. We then provide a carefully constructed lower bound on how far we can harmonically extend the vector field from the boundary via the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The existence of nontrivial static spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein–Vlasov system is well-known. However, it is an open problem whether or not static solutions arise as minimizers of a variational problem. Apart from being of interest in its own right, it is the connection to nonlinear stability that gives this topic its importance. This problem was considered in [G. Wolansky, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 156 (2001), pp. 205–230], but as has been pointed out in [H. Andréasson and M. Kunze, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 235 (2020), pp. 783–791], that paper contained serious flaws. In this work we construct static solutions by solving the Euler–Lagrange equation for the energy density as a fixed point problem. The Euler–Lagrange equation originates from the particle number–Casimir functional introduced in Wolansky (2001). We then define a density function on phase space which induces the energy density and we show that it constitutes a static solution of the Einstein–Vlasov system. Hence we settle rigorously parts of what Wolansky (2001) attempted to prove.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The reconstruction of a function from its spectrogram (i.e., the absolute value of its short-time Fourier transform (STFT)) arises as a key problem in several important applications, including coherent diffraction imaging and audio processing. It is a classical result that for suitable windows any function can, in principle, be uniquely recovered up to a global phase factor from its spectrogram. However, for most practical applications only discrete samples—typically from a lattice—of the spectrogram are available. This raises the question of whether lattice samples of the spectrogram contain sufficient information for determining a function up to a global phase factor. In the present paper, we answer this question in the negative by providing general nonidentifiability results which lead to a non-uniqueness theory for the sampled STFT phase retrieval problem. Precisely, given any dimension , any window function and any (symplectic or separable) lattice , we construct pairs of functions that do not agree up to a global phase factor, but whose spectrograms agree on . Our techniques are sufficiently flexible to produce counterexamples to unique recoverability under even more stringent assumptions; for example, if the window function is real-valued, the functions can even be chosen to satisfy . Our results thus reveal the non-existence of a critical sampling density in the absence of phase information, a property which is in stark contrast to uniqueness results in time-frequency analysis.},

Rectangular cavities may produce corner shear layers and jump discontinuities between lid and cavity interior. We construct a vector field lifting the jump values into the region and sort out the corner singularity functions by the Lamé system with zero boundary condition. We show that the velocity vector has the decomposition into the lifting vector plus the corner singularity plus the remainder of the twice differentiability. The fluid density and velocity gradient have jump discontinuities across the curve as predicted by Rankine–Hugoniot conditions. The interface curve remains , despite the singular decomposition of the velocity vector.},

The dissipation in just one direction, say, is simply insufficient in controlling the nonlinearity in the whole space . The beautiful work of Paicu and Zhang [Sci. China Math., 62 (2019), pp. 1175–1204] solved the case when the spatial domain is bounded in the -direction by observing a crucial Poincaré-type inequality. Motivated by this Navier–Stokes open problem and by experimental observations on the stabilizing effects of background magnetic fields, this paper intends to understand the global well-posedness and stability of a special 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system near a background magnetic field. The spatial domain is , and the velocity in this MHD system obeys the 3D Navier–Stokes with only one-directional dissipation. With no Poincaré-type inequality, this problem appears to be impossible. By discovering the mathematical mechanism of the experimentally observed stabilizing effect and introducing several innovative techniques to deal with the derivative loss difficulties, we are able to bound the Navier–Stokes nonlinearity and solve the desired global well-posedness and stability problem.},

This paper develops the sharp rates of decay and the global-in-time stability of global solutions with general initial data to the three-dimensional incompressible Phan-Thien–Tanner (PTT) system. The PTT system has shown great advantages in the dynamic properties of polymer fluids. This paper is devoted to showing the sharp upper and lower bounds of decay rates of large solutions themselves and their spatial derivatives (including highest-order spatial derivatives of velocity) for the PTT system. The other result is that large solutions to the PTT system are stable. We show that any perturbed solution will remain close to the reference solution if initially they are close to each other. The proof is based on time-weighted energy estimates, Fourier time-splitting, and semigroup methods. As a byproduct, our results can be applied to the simpler case of the Oldroyd-B system.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is an interesting and important topic to study the motion of small particles in a viscous liquid in current applied research. In this paper we assume the particles are convex with arbitrary shapes and mainly investigate the interaction between the rigid particles and the domain boundary when the distance tends to zero. In fact, even though the domain and the prescribed boundary data are both smooth, it is possible to cause a definite increase of the blowup rate of the stress. This problem has the free boundary value feature due to the rigidity assumption on the particle. We find that the prescribed local boundary data has a direct affect on the free boundary value of the particle. Two kinds of boundary data are considered: locally constant boundary data and locally polynomial boundary data. For the former we prove the free boundary value is close to the prescribed constant, while for the latter we show the influence on the blowup rate from the order of growth of the prescribed polynomial. Based on pointwise upper bounds in the neck region and lower bounds at the midpoint of the shortest line between the particle and the domain boundary, we show that these blowup rates obtained in this paper are optimal. These precise estimates will help us understand the underlying mechanism of the hydrodynamic interactions in the fluid particle model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An Euler type hyperbolic-parabolic system of chemotactic aggregation describing vascular network formation is investigated in the critical regularity setting. For initial data near a constant equilibrium state, the global well-posedness of the classical solution to the Cauchy problem with general pressure laws is proved in critical hybrid Besov spaces, and qualitative regularity estimates uniform with respect to the relaxation parameter are established. Then, the optimal time-decay rates of the global solution are analyzed under an additional regularity assumption on the initial data. Furthermore, the relaxation limit of the hyperbolic-parabolic system toward a parabolic-elliptic Keller–Segel model is justified rigorously. It is shown that as the relaxation parameter tends to zero, the solutions of the hyperbolic-parabolic chemotaxis system converge to the solutions of the Keller–Segel model at an explicit rate of convergence. Our approach relies on the introduction of new effective unknowns in low frequencies and the construction of a Lyapunov functional in the spirit of that of Beauchard and Zuazua [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 199 (2011), pp. 177–227] to treat the high frequencies.},

We show that, when the measure of is sufficiently small, has a unique local maximum point lying on the boundary of and is connected. Furthermore, the boundary of intersects the boundary of the box , and more precisely, for some universal constant . Though widely expected, these properties are still unknown if the measure of is arbitrary.},

Consider the bidomain equations from electrophysiology with FitzHugh–Nagumo transport subject to Current noise, i.e., subject to stochastic forcing modeled by a cylindrical Wiener process. It is shown that this set of equations admits in two- and three-dimensional situations a unique, global, strong pathwise solution within the setting of critical spaces. The proof is based on combining methods from stochastic and deterministic maximal regularity. In addition, the method of extrapolation spaces from deterministic evolution equations is transferred to the stochastic setting.},

These three-wave equations are formulated from underlying compatible linear systems and are connected to a third order linear scattering problem. The inverse scattering transform (IST) is carried out in detail for all these three-wave interaction equations. This entails obtaining and analyzing the direct scattering problem, discrete eigenvalues, symmetries, the inverse scattering problem via Riemann–Hilbert methods, minimal scattering data, and time dependence. In addition, soliton solutions illustrating energy sharing mechanisms are also discussed. A crucial step in the analysis is the use of adjoint eigenfunctions which connects the third order scattering problem to key eigenfunctions that are analytic in the upper/lower half planes. The general compatible nonlinear wave system and its classical and nonlocal three-wave reductions are asymptotic limits of physically significant nonlinear equations, including water/gravity waves with surface tension.},

We discuss the sharp interface limit of a coupled Navier–Stokes/Allen–Cahn system in a two dimensional, bounded and smooth domain, when a parameter that is proportional to the thickness of the diffuse interface tends to zero, rigorously. We prove convergence of the solutions of the Navier–Stokes/Allen–Cahn system to solutions of a sharp interface model, where the interface evolution is given by the mean curvature flow with an additional convection term coupled to a two-phase Navier–Stokes system with surface tension. This is done by constructing an approximate solution from the limiting system via matched asymptotic expansions together with a novel ansatz for the highest order term, and then estimating its difference with the real solution with the aid of a refined spectral estimate of the linearized Allen–Cahn operator near the approximate solution.},

These results have been proved for the constant-coefficient Helmholtz equation in either the exterior of a Dirichlet obstacle or an interior domain with an impedance boundary condition. Using the Helffer–Sjöstrand functional calculus [B. Helffer and J. Sjöstrand, Schrödinger Operators, Springer, Berlin, 1989, pp. 118–197] this paper proves analogous decompositions for scattering problems fitting into the black-box scattering framework of Sjöstrand and Zworski [J.

These results allow us to prove new frequency-explicit convergence results for (i) the -finite-element method ( -FEM) applied to the variable-coefficient Helmholtz equation in the exterior of an analytic Dirichlet obstacle, where the coefficients are analytic in a neighborhood of the obstacle, and (ii) the -FEM applied to the Helmholtz penetrable-obstacle transmission problem. In particular, the result in (i) shows that the -FEM applied to this problem does not suffer from the pollution effect.},

We construct two vector-valued functions which completely capture the singular behavior of the stress and derive an asymptotic representation formula for the stress in terms of these functions as the distance between the two cylinders tends to zero. We then show, using the representation formula, that the stress always blows up by proving that either the pressure or the shear stress component of the stress tensor blows up.

In this work we discuss an example of such a domain perturbation. Let be a (not necessarily bounded) domain in . We perturb it to where are closed surfaces with small suitably scaled holes (“windows”) through which the bounded domains enclosed by these surfaces (“resonators”) are connected to the outer domain. When goes to zero, the resonators shrink to points. We prove that in the limit the spectrum of the Laplacian on with the Neumann boundary conditions on and the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the outer boundary converges to the union of the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian on and the numbers , being equal to times the limit of the ratio between the capacity of the th window and the volume of the th resonator. We obtain an estimate on the rate of this convergence with respect to the Hausdorff-type metrics. Also, an application of this result is presented: we construct an unbounded waveguide-like domain with inserted resonators such that the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on this domain lying below the essential spectrum threshold do coincide with the prescribed numbers.},

Understanding the robustness of these patterns with respect to noise is one of the key open questions in computational neuroscience. In the present work, we analyze a family of stochastic differential systems modeling grid cell networks. Furthermore, the well-posedness of the associated McKean–Vlasov and Fokker–Planck equations, describing the average behavior of the networks, is established. Finally, we rigorously prove the mean field limit of these systems and provide a sharp rate of convergence for their empirical measures.},

Moreover, for a fixed scaling angle and large enough PML width, the PML solution is exponentially close to the true scattering solution in both frequency and the PML width. In fact, the exponential bound holds with rate of decay , where is the PML width and is the scaling angle. More generally, the results of the paper hold in the framework of black-box scattering under the assumption of an exponential bound on the norm of the cutoff resolvent, thus including problems with strong trapping.

The model features a mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian formulation, as magnetizations are defined on the deformed set in the actual space. We consider low-energy configurations by rescaling the elastic energy according to the linearized von Kármán regime. First, we identify a reduced model by computing the -limit of the magnetoelastic energy, as the thickness of the plate goes to zero. This extends a previous result obtained by the first author in the incompressible case to the compressible one. Then, we introduce applied loads given by mechanical forces and external magnetic fields, and we prove that sequences of almost minimizers of the total energy converge to minimizers of the corresponding energy in the reduced model. Subsequently, we study quasistatic evolutions driven by time-dependent applied loads and a rate-independent dissipation. We prove that energetic solutions for the bulk model converge to energetic solutions for the reduced model, and we establish a similar result for solutions of the approximate incremental minimization problem. Both these results provide a further justification of the reduced model in the spirit of the evolutionary -convergence.},

Consider now the family of solutions to the associated Navier–Stokes equation with the no-slip condition on the flat boundaries, for small viscosities , and initial values in . We are interested in the weak inviscid limits up to subsequences when both the viscosity converges to 0, and the initial value converges to in . Under a conditional assumption on the energy dissipation close to the boundary, Kato showed in 1984 that converges to strongly in uniformly in time under this double limit. It is still unknown whether this inviscid limit is unconditionally true. The convex integration method produces solutions to the Euler equation with the same initial values which verify at time : . This predicts the possibility of a layer separation with an energy of order . We show in this paper that the energy of layer separation associated with any asymptotic obtained via double limits cannot be more than . This result holds unconditionally for any weak limit of Leray–Hopf solutions of the Navier–Stokes equation. Especially, it shows that, even if the limit is not unique, the shear flow pattern is observable up to time . This provides a notion of stability despite the possible nonuniqueness of the limit predicted by the convex integration theory. The result relies on a new boundary vorticity estimate for the Navier–Stokes equation. This new estimate, inspired by previous work on higher regularity estimates for Navier–Stokes, provides a nonlinear control scalable through the inviscid limit.},

In this paper, we study the global-in-time compressible Euler–Poisson limit of the Vlasov–Poisson–Boltzmann (VPB) system with soft potential for the whole range , as the Knudsen number tends to zero. By using the truncated Hilbert expansion, we first transform the original system to a remainder system. After choosing a new time-velocity weight and establishing some new inequalities of the nonlinear term, we obtain the low-velocity and high-velocity a priori estimates of solutions to the remainder system. Due to the effects of a self-consistent electric field which requires higher regularities than the Boltzmann equation, we then derive the extra weighted estimates to close the total energy. Finally, according to the classical – interplay mechanism of the system, we rigorously prove the validity of the global-in-time hydrodynamic limits of the VPB system in a soft potential case. Our results generalize those obtained by Guo and Jang [Comm. Math. Phys., 299 (2010), pp. 469–501], where the same system with a hard-sphere collision kernel was considered. Our results also reveal the effect of the soft potentials on the compressible Euler–Poisson limit of the VPB system: for the hard-sphere collision kernel case, the validity time interval is , while for the soft potential case, it becomes .},

By the sophisticated coupling energy estimates based on the Neumann semigroup smoothing properties, we establish the existence of globally bounded solutions in two dimensions with Neumann boundary conditions and furthermore prove the global stability of coexistence homogeneous steady states under certain conditions on the system parameters.},

We establish a so-called convexity structure of the sequence of subsonic-sonic solutions near the boundary domains in this limit process, which efficiently overcomes the degenerate effect. We first show the strong convergence in the norm with the order for the Debye length when the doping profile is continuous. Then we derive the uniform error estimates in the norm with the order when the doping profile has higher regularity. The proof of boundedness is based on a new bounded estimate method, which is used to replace the maximum principle utilized in the nondegenerate case.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the problem of optimal distribution of a limited amount of conductive material in systems governed by local and nonlocal scalar diffusion laws. Of particular interest for these problems is the study of the limiting case, which appears when the amount of available material is driven to zero. Such a limiting process is of both theoretical and practical interest and continues to be a subject of active study. In the local case, the limiting optimization problem is convex and has a well-understood basis pursuit structure. Even still, this local problem is quite challenging both analytically and numerically because it is posed in the space of vector-valued Radon measures. With this in mind, we focus on identifying the vanishing material limit for the corresponding nonlocal optimal design problem. Similarly to the local case, the resulting nonlocal problem is convex and has the basis pursuit structure in terms of nonlocal antisymmetric two-point fluxes. In stark contrast with the local case, the nonlocal problem admits solutions in Lebesgue spaces with mixed exponents. When the nonlocal interaction horizon is driven to zero, the “vanishing material limit” nonlocal problems provide a one-sided estimate for the corresponding local measure-valued optimal design problem. The surprising fact is that in order to transform the one-sided estimate into a true limiting process it is sufficient to disregard the antisymmetry requirement on the two-point fluxes. This result relies on duality and requires generalizing some of the well-known nonlocal characterizations of Sobolev spaces to the case of mixed Lebesgue exponents.},

We prove the existence of a family of such stars with small angular velocity and small entropy variation and with an equation of state . Our analysis reduces to a hyperbolic equation for the modified entropy coupled to an elliptic equation for the modified density, together with a mass constraint. Due to the variable entropy and the consequent loss of both regularity and variational structure, all the methods in the previous literature fail.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The asymptotically autonomous robustness of random attractors of stochastic fluid equations defined on bounded domains has been considered in the literature. In this article, we initially consider this topic (almost surely and in probability) for a nonautonomous stochastic 2D Navier–Stokes equation driven by additive and multiplicative noises defined on some unbounded Poincaré domains. There are two significant keys to studying this topic: (1) determining the asymptotically autonomous limiting set of the time-section of random attractors as time goes to negative infinity, and (2) showing the precompactness of a time-union of random attractors over an infinite time-interval . We guess and prove that such a limiting set is just determined by the random attractor of a stochastic Navier–Stokes equation (SNSE) driven by an autonomous forcing satisfying a convergent condition. The uniform “tail-smallness” and “flattening effect” of the solutions are derived in order to justify that the usual asymptotic compactness of the solution operators is uniform over . This in fact leads to the precompactness of the time-union of random attractors over . The idea of uniform tail-estimates due to Wang [Phys. D, 128 (1999), pp. 41–52] is employed to overcome the noncompactness of Sobolev embeddings on unbounded domains. Several rigorous calculations are given to deal with the pressure terms when we derive these uniform tail-estimates.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by the astrophysical problems of star formations from molecular clouds, we make the first step on the possible long time behaviors of certain irregularly shaped molecular clouds. We emphasis the main difficulty of the blowups of the irregularly shaped fluids with vacuum (molecular clouds) comes from the initial irregular configurations of its density (multiple centers of gravity). This inevitably causes more complicated movements during the evolution than the one with spherical symmetry. The spherically symmetric case has been well studied. However, for the nonspherically symmetric case with the gravity, it is very rare in the references due to a very complicate nonlinear interaction between the gravity and the fluids. This article concludes, under the admissible data (i.e., large scale, irregularly shaped, expanding and rotational molecular clouds), the developments of the solution (molecular clouds) are either global (the first class) with near-boundary mass accretions (lead to star formations), or blowup at finite time. In addition, certain singularities can be removed from the boundary if the data are strongly admissible. This paper partially answers Makino’s conjecture [T. Makino, Transp. Theory Stat. Phys., 21 (1992), pp. 615–624] in 1992 on the finite time blowup of any tame solution without symmetries for some data. The model of the molecular clouds and the local well posedness have been established in the companion article [C. Liu, Local Well-Posedness of Euler-Poisson Dominated Molecular Clouds in Astrophysics, preprint, arXiv:2111.11708, 2021].},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The strong Allee effect plays an important role on the evolution of population in ecological systems. One important concept is the Allee threshold that determines the persistence or extinction of the population in a long time. In general, a small initial population size is harmful to the survival of a species since when the initial data is below the Allee threshold the population tends to extinction rather than persistence. Another interesting feature of population evolution is that a species whose movement strategy follows a conditional dispersal strategy is more likely to persist. In other words, the biased movement can be a benefit for the persistence of the population. The coexistence of the above two conflicting mechanisms makes the dynamics rather intricate. However, some numerical results obtained by Cosner and Rodriguez [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 81 (2021), pp. 407–433] show that the directed movement can invalidate the strong Allee effect and help the population survive. To study this intriguing phenomenon, we consider the pattern formation and local dynamics for a class of single species population models that is subject to the strong Allee effect. We first rigorously show the existence of multiple localized solutions when the directed movement is strong enough. Next, the spectrum analysis of the associated linear eigenvalue problem is established and used to investigate the stability properties of these interior spikes. This analysis proves that there exists not only unstable but also linear stable steady states. Then, we extend results of the single equation to coupled systems and also construct several nonconstant steady states and analyze their stability. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical results.},

It contrasts sharply with the steady Navier–Stokes equations and reflects the stabilization effect of magnetic fields.

Our approach uses the theory of graphons to approximate the graph Laplacian in the limit as the number of nodes tends to infinity by a nonlocal operator—the graphon Laplacian. For the ring networks considered here, we employ center manifold theory to characterize Turing bifurcations in the continuum limit in a manner similar to the classical partial differential equation case and classify these bifurcations as sub-/super-/transcritical. We derive estimates that relate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the finite graph Laplacian to those of the graphon Laplacian. We are then able to show that, for a sufficiently large realization of the network, with high probability the bifurcations that occur in the finite graph are well approximated by those in the graphon limit. The number of nodes required depends on the spectral gap between the critical eigenvalue and the remaining ones; the smaller this gap is, the more nodes are required to guarantee that the graphon and graph bifurcations are similar. We demonstrate that if this condition is not satisfied, then the bifurcations that occur in the finite network can differ significantly from those in the graphon limit.},

Mathematically, the problem can be formulated as an initial-boundary value problem for hyperbolic balance laws with a large shock front as free boundary. In the present paper, we establish the global well-posedness of entropy solutions via wave front tracking scheme within the framework of space. The main difficulties here stem from the discontinuous source term without uniform dissipation structure and from the characteristic boundary associated with degenerate characteristic field. In dealing with the obstacles caused by ignition temperature, we develop a modified Glimm-type functional to control the oscillation growth of combustion waves, even if the exothermic source fails to uniformly decay. As to the characteristic boundary, the degeneracy of contact discontinuity is fully employed to get elegant stability estimates near the piston boundary. Meanwhile, we devise a weighted Lyapunov functional to balance the nonlinear effects arising from large shock, characteristic boundary, and exothermic reaction and then obtain the -stability of combustion wave solutions. Our results reveal that one-dimensional Zeldovich–von Neumann–Döring detonation waves supported by a forward piston are indeed nonlinearly stable under small perturbation in sense. This is the first work on well-posedness of inviscid reacting Euler fluids dominated by ignition temperature.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We develop deterministic particle schemes to solve nonlocal scalar conservation laws with congestion. We show that the discrete approximations converge to the unique entropy solution under more general assumptions than the existing literature: the velocity fields are allowed to be time-dependent (with no regularity in time), they are allowed to be less regular in space (in particular the interaction force can have a discontinuity at the origin), no prescribed attractive/repulsive regimes or symmetry are required, and the mobility can have unbounded support. We treat in a unified manner two different schemes, with sampled and integrated interaction, showing that they both converge to the entropy solution, albeit with different trade-offs between accuracy and computational effort. We complement our results with some numerical simulations, among which we show the applicability to the multispecies setting, for which the integrated scheme appears to be the better choice.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations in anisotropic media. The problem to be solved is an approximation of the diffraction problem, or scattering from bounded objects, that is usually set in some exterior domain in . We consider perfectly conducting objects, so the equations are supplemented with a Dirichlet boundary condition on those objects, and we truncate the exterior domain by imposing an impedance condition on an artificial boundary, to model an approximate radiation condition. The resulting problem is then posed in a bounded domain, with Dirichlet and impedance boundary conditions. In this work, we focus on the mathematical meaning of the impedance condition, precisely in which function space it holds. This relies on a careful analysis of the regularity of the traces of electromagnetic fields, which can be derived thanks to the study of the regularity of the solution to second-order surface PDEs. Then, we prove well-posedness of the model, and we determine the a priori regularity of the fields in the domain and on the boundaries, depending on the geometry, the coefficients, and the data. Finally, the discretization of the formulations is presented, with an approximation based on edge finite elements. Error estimates are derived, and a benchmark is provided to discuss those estimates.},

This problem consists in identifying the set of initial data evolving to a given target at a final time. Due to the time-irreversibility of the Burgers equation, some target functions are unattainable from solutions of this equation, making the identification problem under consideration ill-posed. To get around this issue, we introduce a nonsmooth optimization problem, which consists in minimizing the difference between the predictions of the Burgers equation and the observations of the system at a final time in norm. Here, we characterize the set of minimizers of the aforementioned nonsmooth optimization problem. One of the minimizers is the backward entropy solution, constructed using a backward-forward method.

Next, by developing a solution which is orthogonal with the gradient of coefficient of the noise, we extend the global well-posedness to a more general case in which the diffusion coefficient is spatial dependent, i.e., it is a function of the spatial variable.

We first establish the local existence and uniqueness of the strong solution for general initial data in a critical homogeneous Besov space, and then prove the global existence of the solution if the initial data are a small perturbation of the equilibrium state. Moreover, under the additional condition that the low-frequency part of the initial perturbation also belongs to another Besov space with lower regularity, we obtain the optimal time-decay rates of the global solution toward the equilibrium state. These results imply that the relaxation drag force and the viscosity dissipation affect the regularity properties and long time behaviors of solutions for the compressible Navier–Stokes–Euler system.},

The main challenges include that the presence of the strong boundary layer effect will prevent the convergence over the whole spatial domain, and that the quantities of a nonisentropic flow interact strongly with each other not only through the pressure term but also through the strongly nonlinear term in the temperature equation which would possibly slow down the convergence rate. Our main strategy is to find some new functions via asymptotic matching methods such that both the strong boundary layer effect and those quantities decaying at a lower speed can be canceled.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper considers the immediate blowup of entropy-bounded classical solutions to the vacuum free boundary problem of nonisentropic compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The viscosities and the heat conductivity could be constants or, more physically, the degenerate, temperature-dependent functions which vanish on the vacuum boundary (i.e., for constants , and adiabatic exponent ). With prescribed decaying rate of the initial density across the vacuum boundary, we prove that (1) for three-dimensional spherically symmetric flows with nonvanishing bulk viscosity and zero heat conductivity, entropy-bounded classical solutions do not exist for any small time, provided the initial velocity is expanding near the boundary; (2) for three-dimensional spherically symmetric flows with nonvanishing heat conductivity, the normal derivative of the temperature of the classical solution across the free boundary does not degenerate, and therefore the entropy immediately blows up if the decaying rate of the initial density is not of power of the distance function to the boundary; (3) for one-dimensional flow with zero heat conductivity, the nonexistence result is similar but needs more restrictions on the decaying rate. Together with our previous results on local or global entropy-bounded classical solutions [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 51 (2019), pp. 748–789; Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 29 (2019), pp. 2271–2320], this paper shows the necessity of proper degenerate conditions on the density and temperature across the boundary for the well-posedness of the entropy-bounded classical solutions to the vacuum boundary problem of the viscous gas.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies a Cauchy problem for a scalar multidimensional (multi-d) viscous convex conservation law, in which the initial data is a planar viscous shock with a multi-d periodic perturbation. We show that if the wave-strength and perturbation are both small, then the viscous shock is stable in the space with an exponential decay rate. One contribution of the paper is to establish a new framework to study the stability of viscous shocks in multiple dimensions, where the elementary energy method with the antiderivative technique can be used. The idea is to decompose the multi-d perturbation into a one-dimensional function and a multi-d remainder, where the former can well define its antiderivative and the latter satisfies the Poincaré inequality over a periodic domain.},

When the initial data are sufficiently close to constant equilibrium states, we prove the global existence of smooth solutions with uniform bounds with respect to the Debye length in Sobolev spaces. This allows us to pass to the limit in the system for all times to obtain a compressible Euler system. We also prove global error estimates between the solution of the two-fluid Euler–Poisson system and that of the compressible Euler system. These results are obtained by establishing uniform energy estimates and various dissipation estimates. A key step in the proof is the control of the quasi-neutrality of the velocities. For this purpose, an orthogonal projection operator is used.},

We first prove a well-posedness result and a frequency-explicit bound on the solution operator that are valid for sufficiently large frequency and for a class of coefficients that satisfy certain monotonicity conditions in one spatial direction and that are only assumed to be bounded (i.e., ) in the other spatial directions. This class of coefficients therefore includes coefficients modeling transmission by penetrable obstacles with a (potentially large) number of layers (in 2-d) or fibers (in 3-d). Importantly, the frequency-explicit bound holds uniformly for all coefficients in this class; this uniformity allows us to consider highly oscillatory coefficients and study the limiting behavior when the period of oscillations goes to zero. In particular, we bound the error committed by the first-order bulk correction to the homogenized transmission problem, with this bound explicit in both the period of oscillations of the coefficients and the frequency of the Helmholtz equation; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first homogenization result for the Helmholtz equation that is explicit in these two quantities and valid without the assumption that the frequency is small.},

The nonequilibrium process in dislocation dynamics and its relaxation to the metastable transition profile are crucial for understanding the plastic deformation caused by line defects in materials. In this paper, we consider the full dynamics of a scalar dislocation model in two dimensions described by the bulk diffusion equation coupled with a dynamic boundary condition on the interface, where a nonconvex misfit potential, due to the presence of dislocation, yields an interfacial reaction term on the interface. We prove that the dynamic solution to this bulk-interface coupled system will uniformly converge to the metastable transition profile, which has a bistates with fat-tail decay rate at the far fields. This global stability for the metastable pattern is the first result for a bulk-interface coupled dynamics driven only by an interfacial reaction on the slip plane.},

This generalization is the neural activation scattering transform (NAST).

Here, the nonlinear function models how a neuron gets excited by the input signal. In addition to showing properties like nonexpansion, horizontal translational invariability, and insensitivity to local deformation, we explore the statistical properties of the second-order NAST of a Gaussian process with various dependence structures and its interaction with the chosen wavelets and activation functions. We also provide central limit theorem (CLT) and non-CLT results. Numerical simulations demonstrate the developed theorems. Our results explain how NAST processes complicated time series, paving a way toward statistical inference based on NAST for real-world applications.},

We clarify in which sense such a measure-valued solution is generated as a low Mach limit and state sufficient conditions for this convergence. For the special case of pressure-free solutions we are able to give such sufficient conditions only on the incompressible solution itself. As a necessary condition for low Mach limits we obtain a Jensen-type inequality. The same necessary condition actually holds true for limits of weak solutions or vanishing viscosity limits. We illustrate that this Jensen inequality is not trivially fulfilled. Since measure-valued solutions in the classical sense are always generated by weak solutions, this shows that our solution concept contains more information and that low Mach limits lead to a partial selection criterion for incompressible solutions.},

In this paper, we establish the second Bogolyubov theorem and global averaging principle for stochastic partial differential equations (in short, SPDEs) with monotone coefficients. First, we prove that there exists a unique -bounded solution to SPDEs with monotone coefficients and this bounded solution is globally asymptotically stable in square-mean sense. Then we show that the -bounded solution possesses the same recurrent properties (e.g., periodic, quasi-periodic, almost periodic, almost automorphic, Birkhoff recurrent, Levitan almost periodic, etc.) in distribution sense as the coefficients. Third, we prove that the recurrent solution of the original equation converges to the stationary solution of averaged equation under the compact-open topology as the time scale goes to zero—in other words, there exists a unique recurrent solution to the original equation in a neighborhood of the stationary solution of averaged equation when the time scale is small. Finally, we establish the global averaging principle in weak sense, i.e., we show that the attractor of original system tends to that of the averaged equation in probability measure space as the time scale goes to zero. For illustration of our results, we give two applications, including stochastic reaction diffusion equations and stochastic generalized porous media equations.},

Klingenberg, M. Pirner, and G. Puppo, Kinet. Relat. Models, 10 (2017), pp. 445–465] when the initial data is a small perturbation of global equilibrium. For this, we carefully analyze the dissipative nature of the linearized two-component relaxation operator and observe that the partial dissipation from the intraspecies and the interspecies linearized relaxation operators are combined in a complementary manner to give rise to the desired dissipation estimate of the model. We also observe that the convergence rate of the distribution function increases as the momentum-energy interchange rate between the different components of the gas increases.},

Liu and S.-H. Yu, Comm. Pure Appl.

In this paper, we obtain the time asymptotic pointwise structure of the weak solutions. It thus completes the initial motivation for the earlier paper on viewing the solution behavior as part of the well-posedness theory.},

The model as well as the mathematical analysis involve the fields of fluid-structure interaction and of magnetohydrodynamics. Our main result shows the existence of a weak solution to the corresponding system of partial differential equations. The proof relies on a use of a time discretization via the Rothe method to decouple the system. This allows us to deal with test functions, depending on the position of the moving body and therefore on the solution of the system, in the weak formulation of the induction equation. The proof moreover makes use of the Brinkman penalization in order to cope with the mechanical part of the problem.},

The models are hybrid in the sense that cells are discrete entities given by ODEs, while the chemoattractant is considered as a continuous signal which solves a diffusive equation. For this model we prove the mean-field limit in the Wasserstein distance to a system given by the coupling of a Vlasov-type equation with the chemoattractant equation. Our approach and results are not based on empirical measures but rather on marginals of a large number of individuals densities, and we show the limit with explicit bounds by proving also existence and uniqueness for the limit system.

We investigate global stability and nonvanishing vacuum states of large solutions to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations on the torus , and the main purpose of this work is threefold. First, under the assumption that the density verifies , it is shown that the solutions converge to an equilibrium state exponentially in the -norm. In contrast to previous related works where the density has uniform positive lower and upper bounds, this gives the first stability result for large strong solutions of the three-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations in the presence of vacuum. Second, by employing some new thoughts, we also show that the density converges to its equilibrium state exponentially in the -norm if additionally the initial density satisfies . Finally, we prove that the vacuum state will persist for any time provided that the initial density contains vacuum, which is different from the previous work of [H. L. Li, J. Li, and Z. P. Xin, Comm. Math. Phys., 281 (2008), pp. 401–444], where the authors showed that any vacuum state must vanish within finite time for the free boundary problem of the one-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity with . This phenomenon implies the different behaviors for Navier–Stokes equations with different types of viscous effects, namely, degenerate or not.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the celebrated work [Y. Guo., J. Amer. Math. Soc., 25 (2012), pp. 759–812], Guo proved global well-posedness of the Vlasov–Poisson–Landau (VPL) system with Coulomb potential in algebraically weighted Sobolev spaces. Thanks to this breakthrough, there are rich developments on the VPL system and also on the Vlasov–Poisson–Boltzmann (VPB) system with cutoff or noncutoff Boltzmann kernels. In this work, we are interested in the connection between the two important physical systems where particles interact through the Coulomb force and are influenced by their self-consistent electrostatic field. The Coulomb potential yields the famous Rutherford scattering cross section which is too singular in the angular variable for the Boltzmann equation to be meaningful. With an angular cutoff and a proper scaling as in [R. Alexandre and C. Villani, Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré Anal. Non Linéaire, 21 (2004), pp. 61–95], we prove global well-posedness of VPB in algebraically weighted Sobolev spaces. To this end, we develop a new two-stage energy method and merely rely on the -norm (from the dissipation of the linearized Boltzmann operator) to control the nonlinear terms containing the electrostatic field. Consequently, the same well-posedness result also holds for the VPB system with all the other soft potentials, which removes the technical constraint in [R. Duan and S. Liu, Comm. Math. Phys., 324 (2013), pp. 1–45]. Moreover, when the cutoff parameter tends to zero, convergence of VPB to VPL is established with an explicit rate.},

We consider a shear-rate dependent fluid the rheology of which is described by a constitutive power law or Ellis law for the fluid viscosity. In all three cases, positive constants (i.e., positive flat films) are the only positive steady-state solutions. Moreover, we can give a detailed picture of the long-time behavior of solutions with respect to the -norm. In the case of shear-thickening power-law fluids, one observes that solutions which are initially close to a steady state converge to equilibrium in finite time. In the shear-thinning power-law case, we find that steady states are polynomially stable in the sense that, as time tends to infinity, solutions which are initially close to a steady state converge to equilibrium at rate for some . Finally, in the case of an Ellis fluid, steady states are exponentially stable in .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Of concern is the a priori symmetry of traveling wave solutions of a general class of nonlocal dispersive equations , where is a Fourier multiplier operator with symbol . Our analysis includes both homogeneous and inhomogeneous symbols. We characterize a large class of symbols guaranteeing that periodic traveling wave solutions are symmetric under a mild assumption on the wave profile. In contrast with the classically imposed setting in the water wave problem which assumes traveling waves to have a unique crest and trough per period or a monotone structure near troughs, we formulate a reflection criterion which does not presuppose a monotone structure on the wave profile. Thereby, the reflection criterion enables us to treat a priori solutions with multiple crests of different size per period. Moreover, our result applies not only to smooth traveling wave solutions, but also to those with singular crests around which some cancellation structure appears, including in particular waves with peaks or cusps. The proof relies on a so-called touching lemma, which is related to a strong maximum principle for elliptic operators, and a weak form of the celebrated method of moving planes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A phase field model which describes the formation of protein-RNA complexes subject to phase segregation is analyzed. A single protein, two RNA species, and two complexes are considered. Protein and RNA species are governed by coupled reaction-diffusion equations which also depend on the two complexes. The latter ones are driven by two Cahn–Hilliard equations with Flory–Huggins potential and reaction terms depending on the solution variables. The resulting nonlinear coupled system is equipped with no-flux boundary conditions and suitable initial conditions. The former ones entail some mass conservation constraints which are also due to the nature of the reaction terms. The existence of global weak solutions in a bounded (two- or) three-dimensional domain is established. In dimension two, some weighted-in-time regularity properties are shown. Moreover, making a suitable approximation of the potential, the complexes instantaneously get uniformly separated from the pure phases. Taking advantage of this result, a unique continuation property is proven. Among the many technical difficulties, the most significant one arises from the fact that the two complexes are initially nonexistent, so their initial conditions are zero, i.e., they start from a pure phase. Thus we must solve, in particular, a system of two coupled Cahn–Hilliard equations with singular potential and nonlinear sources without the usual assumption on the initial datum, i.e., the initial phase cannot be pure. This novelty requires a new approach to estimate the chemical potential in a suitable -space with . This technique can be extended to other models like, for instance, the well-known Cahn–Hilliard–Oono equation.},

In the deterministic setting, if we assume the interactions are of Lotka–Volterra type (competition or predation), the long-term behavior of this system is well known. However, nature is usually not deterministic. All ecosystems experience some type of random environmental fluctuations. We incorporate these into a natural framework as follows. Suppose the environment has two possible states. In each of the two environmental states the dynamics is governed by a system of Lotka–Volterra ODEs. The randomness comes from spending an exponential amount of time in each environmental state and then switching to the other one. We show how this random switching can create very interesting phenomena. In some cases the randomness can facilitate the coexistence of the three species even though coexistence is impossible in each of the two environmental states. In other cases, even though there is coexistence in each of the two environmental states, switching can lead to the loss of one or more species. We look into how predators and environmental fluctuations can mediate coexistence among competing species.},

The micro-macro interaction is manifested by the presence of a corotational drag term in the Fokker–Planck equation and the divergence of a polymeric extra-stress tensor on the right-hand side of the Navier–Stokes momentum equation. We also analyze certain properties of weak solutions to this system of PDEs: we use the relative energy method to deduce a weak-strong uniqueness type result, and derive the macroscopic closure of the kinetic model; a corotational Oldroyd-B model with stress-diffusion.

In order to prevent the propagation of human diseases transmitted by mosquitoes (such as dengue or Zika), one possible solution is to act directly on the mosquito population. In this work, we consider an invasive species (the mosquitoes), and we study two strategies to eradicate the population in the whole space by a local intervention. The dynamics of the population is modeled through a bistable reaction-diffusion equation in a one-dimensional setting, and both strategies are based on the same idea: we act on a moving interval. The action of the first strategy is to kill as many individuals as we can in this moving interval. The action of the second strategy is to release sterile males in this moving interval. For both strategies, we manage to generate traveling waves that propagate in the opposite direction relative to the one of the natural invasive traveling wave. These cases correspond to succeeding in eradicating the invasive species. Furthermore, for the first strategy, we fully characterize the minimal size of the interval. All the results are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

(2) Moreover, the convergence rate of the solution toward the stationary solution is obtained, provided that the initial perturbation belongs to the weighted Sobolev space. Precisely, we obtain an algebraic decay rate provided that an initial perturbation decays in a tangential direction with the algebraic rate for a supersonic flow. The corresponding algebraic convergence rate is also obtained for a transonic flow, which is worse than that for the supersonic flow due to a degenerate property of the transonic flow.

The fluid drags the particles and thus alters the magnetic field. Vice versa, the magnetic field acts on the particles, which in turn affect the fluid via the no-slip boundary condition. As the size of the particles approaches zero, it is shown that the suspension’s behavior is governed by a generalized magnetohydrodynamic system, where the fluid is modeled by a stationary Navier–Stokes system, while the magnetic field is modeled by Maxwell equations. A corrector result from the theory of two-scale convergence allows us to obtain the limit of the product of several weakly convergent sequences, where the div-curl lemma, which is a typical tool in these types of problems, is not applicable.},

Furthermore, the uniformly subsonic compressible flows tend to the incompressible flows with quadratic order of Mach numbers as the compressibility parameter goes to zero. We finally give the convergence rates of both incompressible and compressible flows at far fields as the boundary of the nozzle goes to flat even when the forces do not admit convergence rates at far fields.

Local well-posedness is shown in the nonperiodic case for with and in the periodic case for data with mean zero, where . Both results rely on the structure of the nonlinearity, which becomes visible with a symmetrization argument. Additionally, for the periodic problem a bilinear Strichartz-type estimate is derived.},

An operator-based approach is used here to prove the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution to the time-varying nonlinear Fokker–Planck equation , in the Sobolev space , under appropriate conditions on and It is proved also that if is a density of a probability measure, so is for all . Moreover, we construct a weak solution to the McKean–Vlasov SDE associated with the Fokker–Planck equation such that is the density of its time marginal law.},
