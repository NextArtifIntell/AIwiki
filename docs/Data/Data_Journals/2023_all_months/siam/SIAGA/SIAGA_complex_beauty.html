  abstract     = {Abstract. Paths of persistence diagrams provide a summary of the dynamic topological structure of a one-parameter family of metric spaces. These summaries can be used to study and characterize the dynamic shape of data such as swarming behavior in multiagent systems, time-varying functional MRI scans from neuroscience, and time-dependent scalar fields in hydrodynamics. While persistence diagrams can provide a powerful topological summary of data, the standard space of persistence diagrams lacks the sufficient algebraic and analytic structure required for many theoretical and computational analyses. We enrich the space of persistence diagrams by isometrically embedding it into a Lipschitz-free space, a Banach space built from a universal construction. We utilize the Banach space structure to define bounded variation paths of persistence diagrams, which can be studied using the path signature, a reparametrization-invariant characterization of paths valued in a Banach space. The signature is universal and characteristic, which allow us to theoretically characterize measures on the space of paths and motivate its use in the context of kernel methods. However, kernel methods often require a feature map into a Hilbert space, so we introduce the moment map, a stable and injective feature map for static persistence diagrams, and compose it with the discrete path signature, producing a computable feature map into a Hilbert space. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by applying this to a parameter estimation problem for a 3-dimensional model of swarming behavior.},

This paper concerns the computation and identification of the (homological) Conley index over the integers, in the context of discrete dynamical systems generated by continuous maps. We discuss the significance with respect to nonlinear dynamics of using integer as opposed to field coefficients. We translate the problem into the language of commutative ring theory. More precisely, we relate shift equivalence in the category of finitely generated abelian groups to the classification of -modules whose underlying abelian group is given. We provide tools to handle the classification problem but also highlight the associated computational challenges.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The subrank of tensors is a measure of how much a tensor can be “diagonalized.&quot; This parameter was introduced by Strassen to study fast matrix multiplication algorithms in algebraic complexity theory and is closely related to many central tensor parameters (e.g., slice rank, partition rank, analytic rank, geometric rank, G-stable rank) and problems in combinatorics, computer science, and quantum information theory. Strassen [J. Reine Angew. Math., 375–376 (1988), pp. 406–443] proved that there is a gap in the subrank when taking large powers under the tensor product: either the subrank of all powers is at most one, or it grows as a power of a constant strictly larger than one. In this paper, we precisely determine this constant for tensors of any order. Additionally, for tensors of order three, we prove that there is a second gap in the possible rates of growth. Our results strengthen the recent work of Costa and Dalai [J. Combin. Theory, Ser. A, 177 (2021), 105335] who proved a similar gap for the slice rank. Our theorem on the subrank has wider applications by implying such gaps not only for the slice rank, but for any “normalized monotone.&quot; In order to prove the main result, we characterize when a tensor has a very structured tensor (the W-tensor) in its orbit closure. Our methods include degenerations in Grassmanians, which may be of independent interest.},

We also characterize graphs for which the associated polynomials belong to certain structured subsets of sum of squares polynomials. Finally, we reformulate some well-known results from the theory of perfect graphs as statements about sum of squares proofs of nonnegativity of certain polynomials.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by the analysis of the performance of the simplex method, we study the behavior of families of pivot rules of linear programs. We introduce normalized-weight pivot rules which are fundamental for the following reasons: First, they are memory-less, in the sense that the pivots are governed by local information encoded by an arborescence. Second, many of the most used pivot rules belong to that class, and we show this subclass is critical for understanding the complexity of all pivot rules. Finally, normalized-weight pivot rules can be parametrized in a natural continuous manner. The latter leads to the existence of two polytopes, the pivot rule polytopes and the neighbotopes, that capture the behavior of normalized-weight pivot rules on polytopes and linear programs. We explain their face structure in terms of multi-arborescences and compute upper bounds on the number of coherent arborescences, that is, vertices of our polytopes. We introduce a normalized-weight pivot rule, called the max-slope pivot rule, which generalizes the shadow-vertex pivot rule. The corresponding pivot rule polytopes and neighbotopes refine the monotone path polytopes of Billera and Sturmfels. Our constructions are important beyond optimization and provide new perspectives on classical geometric combinatorics. Special cases of our polytopes yield permutahedra, associahedra, and multiplihedra. For the greatest-improvement pivot rules we draw connections to sweep polytopes and polymatroids.},

In this paper, we develop a theory to exactly study any quantum walk generated by an integral Hamiltonian, and we put emphasis on those with irrational eigenvalues—what we call irrational quantum walks. As a result, we provide exact methods to compute the average of the mixing matrices, and to decide whether pretty good (or almost perfect) state transfer occurs in a given graph. We also use our methods to study geometric properties of beautiful curves arising from entries of the quantum walk matrix and discuss possible applications of these results. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the interplay between different fields of mathematics applied to the study of quantum walks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Real algebra is usually thought of as the study of certain kinds of preorders on fields and rings. Among its core themes are the separation theorems known as Positivstellensätze. However, there is a nascent subfield of real algebra which studies preordered semirings and semifields, which is motivated by applications to probability, graph theory, and theoretical computer science, among others. Here, we contribute to this subfield by developing a number of foundational results for it, with two abstract Vergleichsstellensätze being our main theorems. Our first Vergleichsstellensatz states that every semifield preorder is the intersection of its total extensions. We apply this to derive our second main result, a Vergleichsstellensatz for certain non-Archimedean preordered semirings in which the homomorphisms to the tropical reals play an important role. We show how this result recovers the existing Vergleichsstellensatz of Strassen and (through the latter) the classical Positivstellensatz of Krivine, Kadison, and Dubois.},

We investigate basic properties of this variety, such as dimension, smoothness, and multidegree. Finally, we give experimental results for the Euclidean distance degree and robustness under noise for the triangulation of lines.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A geometric model for the computation of the firefront of a forest wildfire which takes into account several effects (possibly time-dependent wind, anisotropies, and slope of the ground) is introduced. It relies on a general theoretical framework, which reduces the hyperbolic PDE system of any wave to an ODE in a Lorentz–Finsler framework. The wind induces a sort of double semielliptical fire growth, while the influence of the slope is modeled by means of a term which comes from the Matsumoto metric (i.e., the standard nonreversible Finsler metric that measures the time when going up and down a hill). These contributions make a significant difference from previous models because, now, the infinitesimal wavefronts are not restricted to be elliptical. Even though this is a technical complication, the wavefronts remain computable in real time. Some simulations of evolution are shown, paying special attention to possible crossovers of the fire.},

We furthermore show the characteristic polynomial of a -matroid is equal to that of the projectivization matroid. We use this relation to establish a recursive formula for the characteristic polynomial of a -matroid in terms of the characteristic polynomial of its minors.

To highlight its effectiveness, we implemented the algorithm in Mathematica: it took less than 15 seconds on an example where a Gröbner basis calculation took 5 days and 6 hours.

In this work, we present a study of the automorphisms of ROG hyperbolicity cones and their derivative relaxations. One of our main results states that the automorphisms of the derivative relaxations are exactly the automorphisms of the original cone fixing a certain direction. As an application, we completely determine the automorphisms of the derivative relaxations of the nonnegative orthant and of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. More generally, we also prove relations between the automorphisms of a spectral cone and the underlying permutation-invariant set, which might be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Elimination of unknowns in a system of differential equations is often required when analyzing (possibly nonlinear) dynamical systems models, where only a subset of variables are observable. One such analysis, identifiability, often relies on computing input-output relations via differential algebraic elimination. Determining identifiability, a natural prerequisite for meaningful parameter estimation, is often prohibitively expensive for medium to large systems due to the computationally expensive task of elimination. We propose an algorithm that computes a description of the set of differential-algebraic relations between the input and output variables of a dynamical system model. The resulting algorithm outperforms general-purpose software for differential elimination on a set of benchmark models from the literature. We use the designed elimination algorithm to build a new randomized algorithm for assessing structural identifiability of a parameter in a parametric model. A parameter is said to be identifiable if its value can be uniquely determined from input-output data assuming the absence of noise and sufficiently exciting inputs. Our new algorithm allows the identification of models that could not be tackled before. Our implementation is publicly available online as a Julia package.},

By modeling a partitioned dataset as an unordered -tuple of points in a Wasserstein space, we are able to draw from techniques in optimal transport. More generally, our method is developed using the formalism of local Fréchet means in symmetric products of metric spaces. We establish basic theory in this general setting, including Alexandrov curvature bounds and a verifiable characterization of local means. Our method is demonstrated on ensembles of political redistricting plans to extract and visualize properties of the space of plans for a particular state, using North Carolina as our main example.},

Relatedly, a tree-shaped electrical network has effective resistance between its leaf nodes found as the minimum path resistance. This latter fact raises the question of comparing the effective resistance on electrical networks to the minimum path length on split systems. Surprisingly, it turns out that circular planar electrical networks correspond to unique weighted circular split systems. This crucial result is found precisely by showing that the resistance metric of the Kron reduction of a circular planar electrical network obeys the Kalmanson condition. We demonstrate how this fact allows interchange of methods: primarily circuit reconstruction using phylogenetic techniques.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We describe a framework for estimating Hilbert–Samuel multiplicities for pairs of projective varieties from finite point samples rather than defining equations. The first step involves proving that this multiplicity remains invariant under certain hyperplane sections which reduce to a point and to a curve . Next, we establish that equals the Euler characteristic (and hence the cardinality) of the complex link of in . Finally, we provide explicit bounds on the number of uniform point samples needed (in an annular neighborhood of in ) to determine this Euler characteristic with high confidence.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Low-rank approximation of kernels is a fundamental mathematical problem with widespread algorithmic applications. Often the kernel is restricted to an algebraic variety, e.g., in problems involving sparse or low-rank data. We show that significantly better approximations are obtainable in this setting: the rank required to achieve a given error depends on the variety’s dimension rather than the ambient dimension, which is typically much larger. This is true in both high-precision and high-dimensional regimes. Our results are presented for smooth isotropic kernels, the predominant class of kernels used in applications. Our main technical insight is to approximate smooth kernels by polynomial kernels and to leverage two key properties of polynomial kernels that hold when they are restricted to a variety. First, their ranks decrease exponentially in the variety’s co-dimension. Second, their maximum values are governed by their values over a small set of points. Together, our results provide a general approach for exploiting (approximate) “algebraic structure” in datasets in order to efficiently solve large-scale data science problems.},
