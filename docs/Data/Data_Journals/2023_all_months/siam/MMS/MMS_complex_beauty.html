  abstract     = {Abstract. This work presents a systematic methodology for describing the transient dynamics of coarse-grained molecular systems inferred from all-atom simulated data. We suggest Langevin-type dynamics where the coarse-grained interaction potential depends explicitly on time to efficiently approximate the transient coarse-grained dynamics. We apply the path-space force matching approach at the transient dynamics regime to learn the proposed model parameters. In particular, we parameterize the coarse-grained potential both with respect to the pair distance of the coarse-grained particles and the time, and we obtain an evolution model that is explicitly time dependent. Moreover, we follow a data-driven approach to estimate the friction kernel, given by appropriate correlation functions directly from the underlying all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. To explore and validate the proposed methodology we study a benchmark system of a moving particle in a box. We examine the suggested model’s effectiveness in terms of the system’s correlation time and find that the model can well approximate the transient time regime of the system, depending on the correlation time of the system. As a result, in the less correlated case, it can represent the dynamics for a longer time interval. We present an extensive study of our approach to a realistic high-dimensional water molecular system. Posing the water system initially out of thermal equilibrium we collect trajectories of all-atom data for the, empirically estimated, transient time regime. Then, we infer the suggested model and strengthen the model’s validity by comparing it with simplified Markovian models.},

To accommodate for the effects of complex fractional order and coefficients, an auxiliary equation method is proposed, along with the Fredholm alternative for compact operators, to analyze the well-posedness of the state equation. Additionally, a bootstrapping argument is utilized to progressively improve the solution regularity through a carefully designed pathway, leading to the maximal regularity estimates. Subsequently, we analyze the adjoint equation derived from the first-order optimality condition, which requires more subtle treatments due to the presence of hidden-memory variable-order fractional operators. Based on these findings, we ultimately analyze the well-posedness, first-order optimality conditions and maximal regularity estimates for the optimal control problem, and we conduct numerical experiments to investigate its behavior in potential applications.},

The lower-order bounds, e.g., Wiener and Hashin–Shtrikman bounds, are universal for composites but do not take into account interactions among inclusions corresponding to their location. To study the variety of dispersed random composites, we use computationally effective structural sums directly relating the location of inclusions to the effective constants. The present paper is the first report where the structural sums are applied to higher-order contrast bounds instead of the virtually impossible in computation multipoint correlation functions. We concentrate our attention on two-phase conducting fibrous composites. Rylko’s matrix decomposition is used for the higher-order contrast bounds to extend the obtained analytical bounds to piezoelectric fibrous composites.

At the macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing of magnitude , with , acting on the system to an average response expressed through some steady-state flux. In practice, steady-state averages involved in the linear response are computed as time averages over a realization of some stochastic differential equation. Variance reduction techniques are of paramount interest in this context, as the linear response is scaled by a factor of , leading to large statistical error. One way to limit the increase in the variance is to allow for larger values of by increasing the range of values of the forcing for which the nonlinear part of the response is sufficiently small. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to the physical perturbation of the system, called synthetic forcing, as long as this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system. The aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing one to reduce the nonlinear part of the response as much as possible. We present a mathematical framework for quantifying the quality of synthetic forcings, in the context of linear response theory, and discuss various possible choices for them. Our findings are illustrated with numerical results in low-dimensional systems.},

For problems that are not highly oscillatory, our algorithm computes an -like hierarchical factorization of the dense system matrix, permitting application of the inverse in time, where is the number of unknowns on the surface. The factorization itself also scales linearly with the system size, albeit with a somewhat larger constant. The scheme is built on a level-restricted adaptive octree data structure, and therefore, it is compatible with highly nonuniform discretizations. Furthermore, the scheme is coupled with high-order accurate locally-corrected Nyström quadrature methods to integrate the singular and weakly-singular Green’s functions used in the integral representations. Our method has immediate applications to a variety of problems in computational physics. We concentrate here on studying its performance in acoustic scattering (governed by the Helmholtz equation) at low to moderate frequencies, and provide rigorous justification for compression of submatrices via proxy surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Chemical reactions can be modeled by a random time-changed Poisson process on countable states. The macroscopic behaviors, such as large fluctuations, can be studied via the WKB reformulation. The WKB reformulation for the backward equation is Varadhan’s discrete nonlinear semigroup and is also a monotone scheme that approximates the limiting first-order Hamilton–Jacobi equations (HJE). The discrete Hamiltonian is an m-accretive operator, which generates a nonlinear semigroup on countable grids and justifies the well-posedness of the chemical master equation and the backward equation with “no reaction” boundary conditions. The convergence from the monotone schemes to the viscosity solution of HJE is proved by constructing barriers to overcome the polynomial growth coefficients in the Hamiltonian. This implies the convergence of Varadhan’s discrete nonlinear semigroup to the continuous Lax–Oleinik semigroup and leads to the large deviation principle for the chemical reaction process at any single time. Consequently, the macroscopic mean-field limit reaction rate equation is recovered with a concentration rate estimate. Furthermore, we establish the convergence from a reversible invariant measure to an upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of the stationary HJE.},

We study a Stokes system posed in a thin perforated layer with a Navier-slip condition on the internal oscillating boundary from two viewpoints: (1) dimensional reduction of the layer and (2) homogenization of the perforated structure. Assuming the perforations are periodic, both aspects can be described through a small parameter , which is related to the thickness of the layer as well as the size of the periodic structure. By letting tend to zero, we prove that the sequence of solutions converges to a limit which satisfies a well-defined macroscopic problem. More precisely, the limit velocity and limit pressure satisfy a two pressure Stokes model, from which a Darcy law for thin layers can be derived. Due to nonstandard boundary conditions, some additional terms appear in Darcy’s law.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Coarse-scale surrogate models in the context of numerical homogenization of linear elliptic problems with arbitrary rough diffusion coefficients rely on the efficient solution of fine-scale subproblems on local subdomains whose solutions are then employed to deduce appropriate coarse contributions to the surrogate model. However, in the absence of periodicity and scale separation, the reliability of such models requires the local subdomains to cover the whole domain which may result in high offline costs, in particular for parameter-dependent and stochastic problems. This paper justifies the use of neural networks for the approximation of coarse-scale surrogate models by analyzing their approximation properties. For a prototypical and representative numerical homogenization technique, the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method, we show that one single neural network is sufficient to approximate the coarse contributions of all occurring coefficient-dependent local subproblems for a nontrivial class of diffusion coefficients up to arbitrary accuracy. We present rigorous upper bounds on the depth and number of nonzero parameters for such a network to achieve a given accuracy. Further, we analyze the overall error of the resulting neural network enhanced numerical homogenization surrogate model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work concerns the asymptotic analysis of high-frequency wave propagation in randomly layered media with fast variations and long-range correlations. The analysis takes place in the three-dimensional physical space and weak-coupling regime. The role played by the slow decay of the correlations on a propagating pulse is twofold. First we observe a random travel time characterized by a fractional Brownian motion that appears to have a standard deviation larger than the pulse width, which is in contrast with the standard O’Doherty–Anstey theory for random propagation media with mixing properties. Second, a deterministic pulse deformation is described as the solution of a paraxial wave equation involving a pseudodifferential operator. This operator is characterized by the autocorrelation function of the medium fluctuations. In case of fluctuations with long-range correlations this operator is close to a fractional Weyl derivative whose order, between 2 and 3, depends on the power decay of the autocorrelation function. In the frequency domain, the pseudodifferential operator exhibits a frequency-dependent power-law attenuation with exponent corresponding to the order of the fractional derivative, and a frequency-dependent phase modulation, both ensuring the causality of the limiting paraxial wave equation as well as the Kramers–Kronig relations. The mathematical analysis is based on an approximation-diffusion theorem for random ordinary differential equations with long-range correlations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Momentum space transformations for incommensurate two-dimensional electronic structure calculations are fundamental for reducing computational cost and for representing the data in a more physically motivating format, as exemplified in the Bistritzer–MacDonald model [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 108 (2011), pp. 12233–12237]. However, these transformations can be difficult to implement in more complex systems such as when mechanical relaxation patterns are present. In this work, we aim for two objectives. First, we strive to simplify the understanding and implementation of this transformation by rigorously writing the transformations between the four relevant spaces, which we denote real space, configuration space, momentum space, and reciprocal space. This provides a straightforward algorithm for writing the complex momentum space model from the original real space model. Second, we implement this for twisted bilayer graphene with mechanical relaxation effects included. We also analyze the convergence rates of the approximations and show the tight-binding coupling range increases for smaller relative twists between layers, demonstrating that the 3-nearest neighbor coupling of the Bistritzer–MacDonald model is insufficient when mechanical relaxation is included for very small angles. We quantify this and verify with numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a class of novel materials that exhibit superb engineering properties. It has been demonstrated by extensive experiments and first principles/atomistic simulations that short-range order in the atomic level randomness strongly influences the properties of HEAs. In this paper, we derive stochastic continuum models for HEAs with short-range order from atomistic models. A proper continuum limit is obtained such that the mean and variance of the atomic level randomness together with the short-range order described by a characteristic length are kept in the process from the atomistic interaction model to the continuum equation. The obtained continuum model with short-range order is in the form of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process. This validates the continuum model based on the OU process adopted phenomenologically by Zhang et al. [Acta Mater., 166 (2019), pp. 424–434] for HEAs with short-range order. We derive such stochastic continuum models with short-range order for both (i) the elastic deformation in HEAs without defects and (ii) HEAs with dislocations (line defects). The obtained stochastic continuum models are based on the energy formulations, whose variations lead to stochastic partial differential equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns the derivation of radiative transfer equations for acoustic waves propagating in a randomly fluctuating half-space in the weak-scattering regime, and the study of boundary effects through an asymptotic analysis of the Wigner transform of the wave solution. These radiative transfer equations allow one to model the transport of wave energy density, taking into account the scattering by random heterogeneities. The approach builds on the method of images, where the half-space problem is extended to a full-space, with two symmetric sources and an even map of mechanical properties. Two contributions to the total energy density are then identified: one similar to the energy density propagation in a full-space, for which the resulting lack of statistical stationarity of the medium properties has no leading-order effect; and one supported within one wavelength of the boundary, which describes interference effects between the waves produced by the two symmetric sources. In the case of a homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, this boundary effect yields a doubling of the intensity, and in the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, a canceling of that intensity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we analyze the narrow capture problem for a single Brownian particle diffusing in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain containing a set of small, spherical traps. The boundary surface of each trap is taken to be a semipermeable membrane. That is, the continuous flux across the interface is proportional to an associated jump discontinuity in the probability density. The constant of proportionality is identified with the permeability . In addition, we allow for discontinuities in the diffusivity and chemical potential across each interface; the latter introduces a directional bias. We also assume that the particle can be absorbed (captured) within the interior of each trap at some Poisson rate . In the small-trap limit, we use matched asymptotics and Green’s function methods to calculate the splitting probabilities and unconditional mean first passage time (MFPT) to be absorbed by one of the traps. However, the details of the analysis depend on how various parameters scale with the characteristic trap radius . Under the scalings and , we show that the semipermeable membrane reduces the effective capacitance of each spherical trap compared to the standard example of totally absorbing traps. The latter case is recovered in the dual limits and , with equal to the intrinsic capacitance of a sphere, namely, the radius. We also illustrate how the asymptotic expansions are modified when (slow absorption) or (low permeability). Finally, we consider the unidirectional limit in which each interface only allows particles to flow into a trap. The traps then act as partially absorbing surfaces with a constant reaction rate . Combining asymptotic analysis with the encounter-based formulation of partially reactive surfaces, we show how a generalized surface absorption mechanism (non-Markovian) can be analyzed in terms of the capacitances . We thus establish that a wide range of narrow capture problems can be characterized in terms of the effective capacitances of the traps.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, a multiscale constitutive framework for one-dimensional blood flow modeling is presented and discussed. By analyzing the asymptotic limits of the proposed model, it is shown that different types of blood propagation phenomena in arteries and veins can be described through an appropriate choice of scaling parameters, which are related to distinct characterizations of the fluid-structure interaction mechanism (whether elastic or viscoelastic) that exist between vessel walls and blood flow. In these asymptotic limits, well-known blood flow models from the literature are recovered. Additionally, by analyzing the perturbation of the local elastic equilibrium of the system, a new viscoelastic blood flow model is derived. The proposed approach is highly flexible and suitable for studying the human cardiovascular system, which is composed of vessels with high morphological and mechanical variability. The resulting multiscale hyperbolic model of blood flow is solved using an asymptotic-preserving implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta finite volume method, which ensures the consistency of the numerical scheme with the different asymptotic limits of the mathematical model without affecting the choice of the time step by restrictions related to the smallness of the scaling parameters. Several numerical tests confirm the validity of the proposed methodology, including a case study investigating the hemodynamics of a thoracic aorta in the presence of a stent.},

This work investigates double Dirac cones that occur in the vicinity of a fourfold degenerate point in the band structures of certain operators. It is known that such degeneracy originates in the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We use two-dimensional periodic Schrödinger operators with novel designed symmetries as our prototype. First, we characterize admissible potentials, termed super honeycomb lattice potentials. They are honeycomb lattices potentials with a key additional translation symmetry. It is rigorously justified that Schrödinger operators with such potentials almost guarantee the existence of double Dirac cones on the bands at the point, the origin of the Brillouin zone. We further show that the additional translation symmetry is an indispensable ingredient by a perturbation analysis. Indeed, the double cones disappear if the additional translation symmetry is broken. Many numerical simulations are provided which agree well with our analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sampling the phase space of molecular systems—and, more generally, of complex systems effectively modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs)—is a crucial modeling step in many fields, from protein folding to materials discovery. These problems are often multiscale in nature: they can be described in terms of low-dimensional effective free energy surfaces parametrized by a small number of “slow” reaction coordinates; the remaining “fast” degrees of freedom populate an equilibrium measure conditioned on the reaction coordinate values. Sampling procedures for such problems are used to estimate effective free energy differences as well as ensemble averages with respect to the conditional equilibrium distributions; these latter averages lead to closures for effective reduced dynamic models. Over the years, enhanced sampling techniques coupled with molecular simulation have been developed; they often use knowledge of the system order parameters in order to sample the corresponding conditional equilibrium distributions, and estimate ensemble averages of observables. An intriguing analogy arises with the field of machine learning (ML), where generative adversarial networks (GANs) can produce high-dimensional samples from low-dimensional probability distributions. This sample generation is what in equation-free multiscale modeling is called a “lifting process”: it returns plausible (or realistic) high-dimensional space realizations of a model state, from information about its low-dimensional representation. In this work, we elaborate on this analogy, and we present an approach that couples physics-based simulations and biasing methods for sampling conditional distributions with ML-based conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) for the same task. The “coarse descriptors” on which we condition the fine scale realizations can either be known a priori or learned through nonlinear dimensionality reduction (here, using diffusion maps). We suggest that this may bring out the best features of both approaches: we demonstrate that a framework that couples cGANs with physics-based enhanced sampling techniques can improve multiscale SDE dynamical systems sampling, and even shows promise for systems of increasing complexity (here, simple molecules).},

If gating is included, each triangular region has gapped electronic Dirac points that behave as bulk topological insulators with topological indices depending on valley index and the type of stacking. Since each triangle has two oppositely charged valleys, they remain topologically trivial. In this work, we address several questions related to the edge currents of this system by analysis and computation of continuum PDE models. First, we derive the bulk invariants corresponding to a single valley, and then apply a bulk-interface correspondence to quantify asymmetric transport along the interface. Second, we introduce a valley-coupled continuum model to show how valleys are approximately decoupled in the presence of small perturbations using a multiscale expansion, and how valleys couple for larger defects. Third, we present a method to prove for a large class of continuum (pseudo)differential models that a quantized asymmetric current is preserved through a junction such as a triangular network vertex. We support all of these arguments with numerical simulations using spectral methods to compute relevant currents and wave packet propagation.},

MLIPs are nevertheless capable of making accurate predictions of forces and energies in simulations involving (seemingly) much more complex structures. In this article we propose a framework within which this kind of generalization can be rigorously understood. As a prototypical example, we apply the framework to the case of simulating point defects in a crystalline solid. Here, we demonstrate how the accuracy of the simulation depends explicitly on the size of the training structures, on the kind of observations (e.g., energies, forces, force constants, virials) to which the model has been fitted, and on the fit accuracy. The new theoretical insights we gain partially justify current best practices in the MLIP literature and in addition suggest a new approach to the collection of training data and the design of loss functions.},

The model is representative among many 3D subwavelength hole structures, which are able to induce resonant scattering of electromagnetic wave and the so-called extraordinary optical transmission. We develop a multiscale framework for the underlying scattering problem based upon a combination of the integral equation in the exterior domain and the waveguide mode expansion inside the tiny hole. The matching of the electromagnetic field over the hole aperture leads to a sequence of decoupled infinite systems, which are used to set up the resonance conditions for the scattering problem. By performing rigorous analysis for the infinite systems and the resonance conditions, we characterize all the resonances in a bounded domain over the complex plane. It is shown that the resonances are associated with the transverse electric (TE) and transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waveguide modes in the annular hole, and they are close to the real axis with the imaginary parts of order . We also investigate resonant scattering when an incident wave is present. It is proved that the electromagnetic field is amplified with order at the resonant frequencies that are associated with the TE modes in the annular hole. On the other hand, one particular resonance associated with the TEM mode cannot be excited by a plane wave but can be excited with a near-field electric dipole source, leading to field enhancement of order .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we revisit a two-level discretization based on localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD). It was originally proposed in [P. Henning, A. Målqvist, and D. Peterseim, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 52 (2014), pp. 1525–1550] to compute ground states of Bose–Einstein condensates by finding discrete minimizers of the Gross–Pitaevskii energy functional. The established convergence rates for the method appeared, however, suboptimal compared to numerical observations and a proof of optimal rates in this setting remained open. In this paper we shall close this gap by proving optimal order error estimates for the - and -errors between the exact ground state and discrete minimizers, as well as error estimates for the ground state energy and the ground state eigenvalue. In particular, the achieved convergence rates for the energy and the eigenvalue are of 6th order with respect to the mesh size on which the discrete LOD space is based, without making any additional regularity assumptions. These high rates justify the use of very coarse meshes, which significantly reduces the computational effort for finding accurate approximations of ground states. In addition, we include numerical experiments that confirm the optimality of the new theoretical convergence rates, for both smooth and discontinuous potentials.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the effect of time-periodic forcing on a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation with a topologically protected defect (edge) mode. The unforced system models a domain wall or dislocation defect in a periodic structure, and it supports a defect mode which bifurcates from the Dirac point (linear band crossing) of the underlying bulk medium. We study the robustness of this state against time-periodic forcing of the type that arises in the study of Floquet topological insulators in condensed matter, photonics, and cold-atoms systems. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that under time-periodic forcing of sufficiently high frequency, the defect state undergoes radiative leakage of its energy away from the interface into the bulk; the time-decay is exponential on a time scale proportional to the inverse square of the forcing amplitude. The envelope dynamics of our Floquet system are approximately governed, on long time scales, by an effective (homogenized) periodically forced Dirac equation. Multiple scale analysis of the effective envelope dynamics yields an expansion of the radiating solution, which shows excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we present a multiscale framework for solving the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media without scale separation and in the high frequency regime where the wavenumber can be large. The main innovation is that our methods achieve a nearly exponential rate of convergence with respect to the computational degrees of freedom, using a coarse grid of mesh size without suffering from the well-known pollution effect. The key idea is a nonoverlapped domain decomposition and its associated coarse-fine scale decomposition of the solution space that adapts to the media property and wavenumber; this decomposition is inspired by the multiscale finite element method. We show that the coarse part is of low complexity in the sense that it can be approximated with a nearly exponential rate of convergence via local basis functions, due to the compactness of a restriction operator that maps Helmholtz-harmonic functions to their interpolation residues on edges, while the fine part is local such that it can be computed efficiently using the local information of the right-hand side. The combination of the two parts yields the overall nearly exponential rate of convergence of our multiscale method. Our method draws many connections to multiscale methods in the literature, which we will comment in detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods theoretically and numerically; an exponential rate of convergence is consistently observed and confirmed. In addition, we observe the robustness of our methods regarding the high contrast in the media numerically. We specifically focus on 2D problems in our exposition since the geometry of nonoverlapped domain decomposition is simplest to explain in such cases.},

The Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model (the canonical example of a one-dimensional system with topologically protected localized defect states) is used to demonstrate the method. Our approach can be used to describe two broad classes of perturbations to periodic differential problems: those caused by inserting a finite-sized piece of arbitrary material and those caused by creating an interface between two different periodic media. The results presented here characterize the existence of localized eigenmodes in each case and, when they exist, determine their eigenfrequencies and provide concise analytic results that quantify the decay rate of these modes. These results are obtained using both high-frequency homogenization and transfer matrix analysis, with good agreement between the two methods.},

Motivated by the constructive uniqueness, two indicator functions are then designed for locating the magnetic dipoles and the electric dipoles. After locating all the dipoles, the formulas for computing the corresponding polarization strengths are proposed. The stability of the formulas with respect to the frequency band is also derived. Finally, an indicator for the support of the extended sources is introduced once the dipoles are identified.

Then a constraint energy minimization performed in the oversampling domains is exploited to construct the multiscale space. The resulting multiscale basis functions have a good decay property even for high contrast diffusion and convection coefficients. Furthermore, if the number of oversampling layers is chosen properly, we can prove that the convergence rate is proportional to the coarse meshsize. Our analysis also indicates that the size of the oversampling domain weakly depends on the contrast of the heterogeneous coefficients.

Compared with other network-based approaches for multiscale problems, the proposed method is free from the design of hand-crafted neural network architecture and the cell problem to calculate the homogenization coefficient. The exploration neighborhood of the Brownian walkers affects the overall learning trajectory. We determine the bounds of micro- and macro-time steps that capture the local heterogeneous and global homogeneous solution behaviors, respectively, through a neural network. The bounds imply that the computational cost of the proposed method is independent of the microscale periodic structure for the standard periodic problems. We validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method through a suite of linear and nonlinear multiscale problems with periodic and random field coefficients.},

Theoretical results are lacking, and numerical calculation of the mobility in the underdamped regime is challenging because the computational cost of standard Monte Carlo methods is inversely proportional to the friction coefficient, while deterministic methods are ill-conditioned. In this work, we propose a new variance-reduction method based on control variates for efficiently estimating the mobility of Langevin-type dynamics. We provide bounds on the bias and variance of the proposed estimator and illustrate its efficacy through numerical experiments, first in simple one-dimensional settings and then for two-dimensional Langevin dynamics. Our results corroborate prior numerical evidence that the mobility scales as , with , in the low friction regime for a simple nonseparable potential.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Fully resolving dynamics of materials with rapidly varying features involves expensive fine-scale computations which need to be conducted on macroscopic scales. The theory of homogenization provides an approach for deriving effective macroscopic equations which eliminates the small scales by exploiting scale separation. An accurate homogenized model avoids the computationally expensive task of numerically solving the underlying balance laws at a fine scale, thereby rendering a numerical solution of the balance laws more computationally tractable. In complex settings, homogenization only defines the constitutive model implicitly, and machine learning can be used to learn the constitutive model explicitly from localized fine-scale simulations. In the case of one-dimensional viscoelasticity, the linearity of the model allows for a complete analysis. We establish that the homogenized constitutive model may be approximated by a recurrent neural network that captures the memory. The memory is encapsulated in the evolution of an appropriate finite set of hidden variables, which are discovered through the learning process and dependent on the history of the strain. Simulations are presented which validate the theory. Guidance for the learning of more complex models, such as arise in plasticity, using similar techniques, is given.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Optimal balance is a nonasymptotic numerical method for computing a point on an elliptic slow manifold for two-scale dynamical systems with strong gyroscopic forces. It works by solving a modified differential equation as a boundary value problem in time, where the nonlinear terms are adiabatically ramped up from zero to the fully nonlinear dynamics. A dedicated boundary value solver, however, is often not directly available. The most natural alternative is a nudging solver, where the problem is repeatedly solved forward and backward in time and the respective boundary conditions are restored whenever one of the temporal end points is visited. In this paper, we show quasi-convergence of this scheme in the sense that the termination residual of the nudging iteration is as small as the asymptotic error of the method itself, i.e., under appropriate assumptions exponentially small. This confirms that optimal balance in its nudging formulation is an effective algorithm. Further, it shows that the boundary value problem formulation of optimal balance is well posed up to at most a residual error as small as the asymptotic error of the method itself. The key step in our proof is a careful two-component Gronwall inequality.},

The nanoparticles are described via the Lorentz model. If the used incident frequency is chosen related to the plasmonic frequency (via the magnetization operator), then the nanoparticle behaves as a plasmonic one; if it is chosen related to the undamped resonance frequency (via the Newtonian operator), then it behaves as a dielectric one. The two regimes exhibit different optical behaviors. In both cases, we estimate the generated heat and discuss advantages of each incident frequency regime.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Numerical multiscale methods usually rely on some coupling between a macroscopic and a microscopic model. The macroscopic model is incomplete as effective quantities, such as the homogenized material coefficients or fluxes, are missing in the model. These effective data need to be computed by running local microscale simulations followed by a local averaging of the microscopic information. Motivated by the classical homogenization theory, it is a common practice to use local elliptic cell problems for computing the missing homogenized coefficients in the macro model. Such a consideration results in a first order error , where represents the wavelength of the microscale variations and is the size of the microscopic simulation boxes. This error, called “resonance error,” originates from the boundary conditions used in the microproblem and typically dominates all other errors in a multiscale numerical method. Optimal decay of the resonance error remains an open problem, although several interesting approaches reducing the effect of the boundary have been proposed over the last two decades. In this paper, as an attempt to resolve this problem, we propose a computationally efficient, fully elliptic approach with exponential decay of the resonance error.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This is the second paper in a series in which we develop machine learning (ML) moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation (RTE). In our previous work [J. Huang, Y. Cheng, A. J. Christlieb, and L. F. Roberts, J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941], we proposed an approach to directly learn the spatial gradient of the unclosed high-order moment, which performs much better than learning the moment itself and the conventional closure. However, the ML moment closure model in [J. Huang, Y. Cheng, A. J. Christlieb, and L. F. Roberts, J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941] is not able to guarantee hyperbolicity and long time stability. We propose in this paper a method to enforce the global hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. The main idea is to seek a symmetrizer (a symmetric positive definite matrix) for the closure system and derive constraints such that the system is globally symmetrizable hyperbolic. It is shown that the new ML closure system inherits the dissipativeness of the RTE and preserves the correct diffusion limit as the Knudsen number goes to zero. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, long time stability, and generalizability of our globally hyperbolic ML closure model.},

We present a novel and general variational characterization of optimal RCs and provide conditions for their existence. Optimal RCs are minimizers of a certain loss function, and reduced models based on them guarantee a good approximation of the statistical long-term properties of the original high-dimensional process. We show that for slow-fast systems, metastable systems, and other systems with known good RCs, the novel theory reproduces previous insight. Remarkably, for reversible systems, the numerical effort required to evaluate the loss function scales only with the variability of the underlying, low-dimensional mechanism, and not with that of the full system. The theory provided lays the foundation for an efficient and data-sparse computation of RCs via modern machine learning techniques.},

Interpreted as a distribution, the potential is assumed to be a microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field whose covariance operator is a classical pseudodifferential operator. Given the potential, the direct scattering problem is shown to be well-posed in the sense of distributions by studying the equivalent Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation. For the inverse scattering problem, we demonstrate that the microlocal strength of the random potential can be uniquely determined with probability one by a single realization of the high frequency limit of the averaged compressional or shear backscattered far-field pattern of the scattered wave. The analysis employs the integral operator theory, the Born approximation in the high frequency regime, the microlocal analysis for the Fourier integral operators, and the ergodicity of the wave field.},

In this paper, we present theoretical studies on the time averaging of a reduced model for wetting on rough surfaces and also the analysis on the effect of stochastic thermal forces. We derive equations for the averaged dynamics and show that the apparent contact angle depends on the harmonic averaging of the geometric and chemical properties of the substrates as well as the contact line velocity. The contact angle hysteresis can be determined quantitatively by the equations. The averaging results are proved rigorously by multi-scale analysis and verified by some numerical examples.},

We start from a drift-diffusion equation in which the drift term describes the effect of bubble traps and is modeled by a short-range potential with an attractive term and a repulsive core. The interaction of the particles attracted by the bubble surface is simulated by the Lennard–Jones potential that simplifies the capture due to the hydrophobic properties of the ions. In our model, the effect of the potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass conservation and asymptotic analysis. The potential is assumed to have a range of small size . An asymptotic expansion in the is considered, and the boundary conditions are obtained by retaining the lowest-order terms in the expansion. Another aspect we investigate is the saturation effect coming from high concentrations in the proximity of the bubble surface. The validity of the model is carefully checked with several tests in one and two dimensions and different geometries.},

This stability analysis considers small perturbations of the density and chemical concentration around two nontrivial steady states, and the linearized equations are transformed into a generalized eigenvalue problem. By formal analysis, when the internal variable responds to the outside signal fast enough, the PBDM converges to an anisotropic diffusion model, for which the probability density distribution in the internal variable becomes a delta function. We introduce an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme for the PBDM that converges to a stable limit scheme consistent with the anisotropic diffusion model. Further numerical simulations demonstrate the theoretical results of linear stability analysis, i.e., the pattern formation, and the convergence of the AP scheme.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We derive the PDE governing the hydrodynamic limit of a Metropolis rate crystal surface height process in the “rough scaling” regime introduced by Marzuola and Weare. The PDE takes the form of a continuity equation, and the expression for the current involves a numerically computed multiplicative correction term similar to a mobility. The correction accounts for the fact that, unusually, the local equilibrium distribution of the process is not a local Gibbs measure even though the global equilibrium distribution is Gibbs. We give definitive numerical evidence of this fact, originally suggested by Y. Gao, A. E. Katsevich, J.-G. Liu, J. Lu, and J. L. Marzuola [Pure Appl. Anal., 3 (2021), pp. 595–612]. In that paper, an approximate PDE—our PDE, but without the correction term—was derived for the limit of the Metropolis rate process under the assumption of a local Gibbs distribution. Our main contribution is to present a numerical method to compute the corrected macroscopic current, which is given by a function of the third spatial derivative of the height profile. Our method exploits properties of the local equilibrium (LE) state of the third order finite difference process. We find that the LE state of this process is not only useful for deriving the PDE, it also enjoys nonstandard properties which are interesting in their own right. Namely, we demonstrate that the LE state is a “rough LE,” a novel kind of LE state discovered in our recent work on an Arrhenius rate crystal surface process.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a butterfly-compressed representation of the Hadamard–Babich (HB) ansatz for the Green’s function of the high-frequency Helmholtz equation in smooth inhomogeneous media. For a computational domain discretized with discretization cells, the proposed algorithm first solves and tabulates the phase and HB coefficients via eikonal and transport equations with observation points and point sources located at the Chebyshev nodes using a set of much coarser computation grids, and then butterfly compresses the resulting HB interactions from all cell centers to each other. The overall CPU time and memory requirement scale as for any bounded two-dimensional (2D) domains with arbitrary excitation sources. A direct extension of this scheme to bounded 3D domains yields an CPU complexity, which can be further reduced to quasi-linear complexities with proposed remedies. The scheme can also efficiently handle scattering problems involving inclusions in inhomogeneous media. Although the current construction of our HB integrator does not accommodate caustics, the resulting HB integrator itself can be applied to certain sources, such as concave-shaped sources, to produce caustic effects. Compared to finite-difference frequency domain methods, the proposed HB integrator is free of numerical dispersion and requires fewer discretization points per wavelength. As a result, it can solve wave propagation problems well beyond the capability of existing solvers. Remarkably, the proposed scheme can accurately model wave propagation in 2D domains with 640 wavelengths per direction and in 3D domains with 54 wavelengths per direction on a state-of-the-art supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.},

In this paper, we present strong numerical evidence that the incompressible axisymmetric Euler equations with degenerate viscosity coefficients and smooth initial data of finite energy develop a potential finite-time locally self-similar singularity at the origin. An important feature of this potential singularity is that the solution develops a two-scale traveling wave that travels toward the origin. The two-scale feature is characterized by the scaling property that the center of the traveling wave is located at a ring of radius surrounding the symmetry axis while the thickness of the ring collapses at a rate . The driving mechanism for this potential singularity is due to an antisymmetric vortex dipole that generates a strong shearing layer in both the radial and axial velocity fields. Without the viscous regularization, the three-dimensional Euler equations develop a sharp front and some shearing instability in the far field. On the other hand, the Navier–Stokes equations with a constant viscosity coefficient regularize the two-scale solution structure and do not develop a finite-time singularity for the same initial data.},

A complete analysis of the method is presented, which shows the proposed online enrichment leads to a fast convergence from multiscale approximation to the fine-scale solution. The error reduction can be made sufficiently large by suitably selecting oversampling regions and the number of oversampling layers. Further, the convergence rate of the enrichment algorithm depends on a factor of exponential decay regarding the number of oversampling layers and a user-defined parameter.

To this end, a free material optimization is performed on the macro-scale using elasticity tensors in a set of microscopically realizable tensors. A database of these realizable tensors and their cost values is obtained with a shape and topology optimization on microscopic cells, working within a fixed set of elasticity tensors samples. This microscopic optimization takes into account manufacturability constraints via predefined material bridges to neighboring cells at the faces of the microscopic fundamental cell. For the actual additive manufacturing on a chosen fine-scale, a piecewise constant elasticity tensor ansatz on grid cells of a macroscopic mesh is applied. The macroscopic optimization is performed in an efficient online phase, whereas the associated cellwise optimal material patterns are retrieved from the database that was computed offline. For that, the set of admissible realizable elasticity tensors is parametrized using tensor product cubic B-splines over the unit square matching the precomputed samples. This representation is then efficiently used in an interior point method for the free material optimization on the macro-scale.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When waves propagate through a complex medium like the turbulent atmosphere the wave field becomes incoherent and the wave intensity forms a complex speckle pattern. In this paper we study a speckle memory effect in the frequency domain and some of its consequences. This effect means that certain properties of the speckle pattern produced by wave transmission through a randomly scattering medium is preserved when shifting the frequency of the illumination. The speckle memory effect is characterized via a detailed novel analysis of the fourth-order moment of the random paraxial Green’s function at four different frequencies. We arrive at a precise characterization of the frequency memory effect and what governs the strength of the memory. As an application we quantify the statistical stability of time-reversal wave refocusing through a randomly scattering medium in the paraxial or beam regime. Time reversal refers to the situation when a transmitted wave field is recorded on a time-reversal mirror then time reversed and sent back into the complex medium. The re-emitted wave field then refocuses at the original source point. We compute the mean of the refocused wave and identify a novel quantitative description of its variance in terms of the radius of the time-reversal mirror, the size of its elements, the source bandwidth, and the statistics of the random medium fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the homogenized energy densities of periodic ferromagnetic Ising systems. We prove that, for finite range interactions, the homogenized energy density, identifying the effective limit, is crystalline, i.e., its Wulff crystal is a polytope, for which we can (exponentially) bound the number of vertices. This is achieved by deriving a dual representation of the energy density through a finite cell formula. This formula also permits easy numerical computations: we show a few experiments where we compute periodic patterns which minimize the anisotropy of the surface tension.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a data-driven point of view for rare events, which represent conformational transitions in biochemical reactions modeled by overdamped Langevin dynamics on manifolds in high dimensions. We first reinterpret the transition state theory and the transition path theory from the optimal control viewpoint. Given a point cloud probing the manifold, we construct a discrete Markov chain with a -matrix computed from an approximated Voronoi tesselation via the point cloud. We use this -matrix to compute a discrete committor function whose level set automatically orders the point cloud. Then based on the committor function, an optimally controlled random walk on point clouds is constructed and utilized to efficiently sample transition paths, which become an almost sure event in time instead of a rare event in the original reaction dynamics. To compute the mean transition path efficiently, a local averaging algorithm based on the optimally controlled random walk is developed, which adapts the finite temperature string method to the controlled Monte Carlo samples. Numerical examples on sphere/torus including a conformational transition for the alanine dipeptide in vacuum are conducted to illustrate the data-driven solver for the transition path theory on point clouds. The mean transition path obtained via the controlled Monte Carlo simulations highly coincides with the computed dominant transition path in the transition path theory.},
