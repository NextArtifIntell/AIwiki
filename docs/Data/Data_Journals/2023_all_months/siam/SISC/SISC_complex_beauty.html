  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a parallel algorithm for the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in higher dimensions. This algorithm generalizes the cyclic-to-cyclic one-dimensional parallel algorithm to a cyclic-to-cyclic multidimensional parallel algorithm while retaining the property of needing only a single all-to-all communication step. This is under the constraint that we use at most processors for an FFT on an array with a total of elements, irrespective of the dimension or the shape of the array. The only assumption we make is that is sufficiently composite. Our algorithm starts and ends in the same data distribution. We present our multidimensional implementation FFTU which utilizes the sequential FFTW program for its local FFTs, and which can handle any dimension . We obtain experimental results for using MPI on up to 4096 cores of the supercomputer Snellius, comparing FFTU with the parallel FFTW program and with PFFT and heFFTe. These results show that FFTU is competitive with the state of the art and that it allows one to use a larger number of processors, while keeping communication limited to a single all-to-all operation. For arrays of size and , FFTU achieves a speedup of a factor 149 and 176, respectively, on 4096 processors.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Matrix-free techniques play an increasingly important role in large-scale simulations. Schur complement techniques and massively parallel multigrid solvers for second-order elliptic partial differential equations significantly benefit from reduced memory traffic and consumption. The matrix-free approach often restricts solver components to purely local operations, for instance, to the most basic schemes like Jacobi- or Gauss–Seidel-Smoothers in multigrid methods. An incomplete LU(0)-decomposition (ILU) cannot be calculated from local information and is therefore not applicable to an on-the-fly computation typically needed for matrix-free calculations. It requires storing and factorizing a sparse matrix, contradicting the low memory requirements in large-scale scenarios. Here, we propose a matrix-free ILU realization. More precisely, we introduce a memory-efficient matrix-free ILU-Smoother component for low-order conforming finite elements on tetrahedral hybrid grids. Hybrid grids consist of an unstructured macro-mesh which is subdivided into structured micro-meshes. The ILU operates on the degrees of freedom assigned to the interior of macro-tetrahedra. This ILU-Smoother can be applied to the efficient matrix-free evaluation of the Steklov–Poincaré operator from domain-decomposition methods, as well as for the finite element tearing and interconnecting dual-primal and balancing domain decomposition by constraints methods. After introducing and formally defining our smoother, we investigate its performance on refined macro-tetrahedra. On the macro-tetrahedra the ILU-Smoother is implemented via surrogate matrix polynomials, which we combine with a fast on-the-fly evaluation scheme, resulting in an efficient matrix-free algorithm. We obtain the polynomial coefficients by solving a least-squares problem on a small part of the factorized ILU matrices to remain memory efficient. The convergence rates of this smoother in relation to the polynomial order are thoroughly studied.},

Although subcubic algorithms exist, most high performance implementations are based on the classical matrix multiplication. Designing an algorithm that obtains even modest improvements in performance over existing implementations, requires carefully addressing challenges such as reducing computation costs, communication costs, and memory footprint. We provide the first high performance general matrix-matrix multiplication that utilizes the alternative basis method on Strassen’s algorithm. We reduce the basis transformation overheads and decrease the memory footprint of the bilinear phase by using the pebbling game optimization scheme, consequentially improving both arithmetic and communication costs. Our algorithm outperforms DGEMM on feasible matrix dimensions starting at . It obtains an increasing speedup of up to nearly speedup for larger matrix dimensions when running sequentially, and even larger speedups for certain matrix dimensions when running in parallel.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Numerical resolution for 6-D Wigner dynamics under the Coulomb potential is faced with the combined challenges of high dimensionality, nonlocality, oscillation, and singularity. In particular, the extremely huge memory storage of 6-D grids hinders the usage of all existing deterministic numerical schemes, which is well known as the curse of dimensionality. To surmount these difficulties, we propose a massively parallel solver, termed the characteristic-spectral-mixed (CHASM) scheme, by fully exploiting two distinct features of the Wigner equation: locality of spatial advection and nonlocality of quantum interaction. Our scheme utilizes the local cubic B-spline basis to interpolate the local spatial advection. The key is to use a perfectly matched boundary condition to give a closure of spline coefficients, so that distributed pieces can recover the global one as accurately as possible owing to the rapid decay of wavelet basis in the dual space, and communication costs are significantly reduced. To resolve the nonlocal pseudodifferential operator with a singular symbol, CHASM further adopts the truncated kernel method to attain a highly efficient approximation. Several typical experiments including the quantum harmonic oscillator and the 1s state of hydrogen demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of CHASM. Nonequilibrium electron-proton couplings are also clearly displayed and illuminate the uncertainty principle and quantum tunneling in phase space. Finally, the scalability of CHASM up to 16000 cores is presented.},

A strongly coupled nonlinear system of a multiple time-scale time-fractional transport equation and a backward multiple time-scale time-fractional Hamilton–Jacobi equation is derived using the first-order optimality condition. A sequentially decoupled time-stepping finite element method is derived for the numerical simulation of the MFC.

In this work, we develop preconditioners for the linear systems arising in the application of this method to Stokes flow, making it practical for use in three dimensions. In particular, we develop a nested block preconditioning approach which reduces the linear systems to solving two symmetric positive-definite matrices and an augmented momentum block. An augmented Lagrangian term is used to control the innermost Schur complement, and we apply a geometric multigrid method with a kernel-capturing relaxation method for the augmented momentum block. We present multiple solutions in three-dimensional examples computed using the proposed iterative solver.},

The relevance of the model and the robustness of the numerical strategy are illustrated by several numerical simulations in a one-dimensional framework.

Its stability analysis, crucial for the well-posedness of the discrete problem, is performed, and cost-efficient parameter-robust preconditioners are derived.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Two-phase flow with moving contact lines (MCLs) is an unsolved problem in fluid dynamics. It is challenging to solve the problem numerically due to its intrinsic multiscale property that the microscopic slip must be taken into account in a macroscopic model. It is even more difficult when the solid substrate has microscopic inhomogeneity or roughness. In this paper, we propose a novel unified numerical framework for two-phase flows with MCLs. The framework cover some typical sharp-interface models for MCLs and can deal with the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) naturally. We prove that all the models, including the nonlinear Cox model and a CAH model, are thermodynamically consistent in the sense that an energy dissipation relation is satisfied. We further derive a new variational formula which leads to a stable and consistent numerical method independent of the choice of the slip length and the contact line frictions. This enables us to efficiently solve the macroscopic models for MCLs without resolving very small scale flow field in the vicinity of the contact line. We prove the well-posedness of the fully decoupled scheme which is based on a stabilized extended finite element discretization and a level-set representation for the free interface. Numerical examples are given to show the efficiency of the numerical framework.},

Due to the existence of local minimum traps, the success of the inversion process usually requires a good initial model. Our study primarily focuses on understanding the impact of source wavelets on the landscape of the corresponding optimization problem. We thus introduce a decomposition scheme that divides the inverse problem into two parts. The first step transforms the measured data into data associated with the desired source wavelet. Here, we consider inversions with known and unknown sources to mimic real scenarios. The second subproblem is the conventional FWI, which is much less dependent on an accurate initial model since the previous step improves the misfit landscape. A regularized deconvolution method and a convolutional neural network are employed to solve the source transformation problem. Numerical experiments on the benchmark models demonstrate that our approach improves the gradient’s quality in the subsequent FWI and provides a better inversion performance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Efficient and accurate computation of interface problems is of great importance in many electromagnetic applications. Unfitted mesh methods are especially attractive in three-dimensional (3D) computation as they can circumvent generating complex 3D interface-fitted meshes. However, many unfitted mesh methods rely on nonconforming approximation spaces, which may cause a loss of accuracy for solving Maxwell-type equations, and the widely used penalty techniques in the literature may not help in recovering the optimal convergence. In this article, we provide a remedy by developing Nédélec-type immersed finite element (IFE) spaces with a Petrov–Galerkin scheme that is able to produce optimal-convergent solutions. To establish a systematic framework, we analyze all the , and IFE spaces and form a discrete de Rham complex. Based on these fundamental results, we further develop a fast solver using a modified Hiptmair–Xu preconditioner which works for both the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) and conjugate gradient (CG) methods for solving the nonsymmetric linear algebraic system. The approximation capabilities of the proposed IFE spaces will be also established. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Neural networks have gained much interest because of their effectiveness in many applications. However, their mathematical properties are generally not well understood. If there is some underlying geometric structure inherent to the data or to the function to approximate, it is often desirable to take this into account in the design of the neural network. In this work, we start with a nonautonomous ODE and build neural networks using a suitable, structure-preserving, numerical time discretization. The structure of the neural network is then inferred from the properties of the ODE vector field. Besides injecting more structure into the network architectures, this modeling procedure allows a better theoretical understanding of their behavior. We present two universal approximation results and demonstrate how to impose some particular properties on the neural networks. A particular focus is on 1-Lipschitz architectures including layers that are not 1-Lipschitz. These networks are expressive and robust against adversarial attacks, as shown for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work we consider the unbiased estimation of expectations w.r.t. probability measures that have nonnegative Lebesgue density and which are known pointwise up to a normalizing constant. We focus upon developing an unbiased method via the underdamped Langevin dynamics, which has proven to be popular of late due to applications in statistics and machine learning. Specifically in continuous time, the dynamics can be constructed to admit the probability of interest as a stationary measure. We develop a novel scheme based upon doubly randomized estimation as in [J. Heng, J. Houssineau, and A. Jasra, On Unbiased Score Estimation for Partially Observed Diffusions, preprint, 2021] and [J. Heng, A. Jasra, K. J. H. Law, and A. Tarakanov, SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantif., 11 (2023), pp. 616–645], which requires access only to time-discretized versions of the dynamics, i.e., the ones used in practical algorithms. We prove, under standard assumptions, that our estimator is of finite variance and either has finite expected cost or has finite cost with a high probability. To illustrate our theoretical findings we provide numerical experiments that verify our theory, which include challenging examples from Bayesian statistics and statistical physics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For numerous parameter and state estimation problems, assimilating new data as they become available can help produce accurate and fast inference of unknown quantities. While most existing algorithms for solving those kinds of ill-posed inverse problems can only be used with a single instance of the observed data, in this work we propose a new framework that enables existing algorithms to invert multiple instances of data in a sequential fashion. Specifically we will work with the well-known iteratively regularized Gauss–Newton method (IRGNM), a variational methodology for solving nonlinear inverse problems. We develop a theory of convergence analysis for a proposed dynamic IRGNM algorithm in the presence of Gaussian white noise. We combine this algorithm with the classical IRGNM to deliver a practical (blended) algorithm that can invert data sequentially while producing fast estimates. Our work includes the proof of well-definedness of the proposed iterative scheme, as well as various error bounds that rely on standard assumptions for nonlinear inverse problems. We use several numerical experiments to verify our theoretical findings and to highlight the benefits of incorporating sequential data. The context of the numerical experiments comprises various parameter identification problems, including a toy elliptic PDE example and one of electrical impedance tomography.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We describe a new, adaptive solver for the two-dimensional Poisson equation in complicated geometries. Using classical potential theory, we represent the solution as the sum of a volume potential and a double layer potential. Rather than evaluating the volume potential over the given domain, we first extend the source data to a geometrically simpler region with high order accuracy. This allows us to accelerate the evaluation of the volume potential using an efficient, geometry-unaware fast multipole-based algorithm. To impose the desired boundary condition, it remains only to solve the Laplace equation with suitably modified boundary data. This is accomplished with existing fast and accurate boundary integral methods. The novelty of our solver is the scheme used for creating the source extension, assuming it is provided on an adaptive quad-tree. For leaf boxes intersected by the boundary, we construct a universal “stencil” and require that the data be provided at the subset of those points that lie within the domain interior. This universality permits us to precompute and store an interpolation matrix which is used to extrapolate the source data to an extended set of leaf nodes with full tensor-product grids on each. We demonstrate the method’s speed, robustness, and high order convergence with several examples, including domains with piecewise smooth boundaries.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Convection-diffusion equations arise in a variety of applications such as particle transport, electromagnetics, and magnetohydrodynamics. Simulation of the convection-dominated regime for these problems, even with high-fidelity techniques, is particularly challenging due to the presence of sharp boundary layers and shocks causing jumps and discontinuities in the solution, and numerical issues such as loss of the maximum principle in the discretization. These complications cause instabilities, admitting large oscillations in the numerical solution when using traditional methods. Drawing connections to the simplex-averaged finite-element method [S. Wu and J. Xu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 58 (2020), pp. 884–906], this paper develops a mimetic finite-difference (MFD) discretization using exponentially averaged coefficients to overcome instability of the numerical solution as the diffusion coefficient approaches zero. The finite-element framework allows for transparent analysis of the MFD, such as proving well-posedness and deriving error estimates. Numerical tests are presented confirming the stability of the method and verifying the error estimates.},

In this first work, we focus on a new class of implicit-explicit polynomial block methods that are based on fully implicit Runge–Kutta methods with Radau nodes and that possess high stage order. We show that the new fully implicit-explicit (FIMEX) integrators have improved stability compared to existing IMEX Runge–Kutta methods, while also being more computationally efficient due to recent developments in preconditioning techniques for solving the associated systems of nonlinear equations. For PDEs on periodic domains where the implicit component is trivial to invert, we will show how parallelization of the right-hand side evaluations can be exploited to obtain significant speedup compared to existing serial IMEX Runge–Kutta methods. For parallel (in space) finite element discretizations, the new methods can achieve orders of magnitude better accuracy than existing IMEX Runge–Kutta methods and/or achieve a given accuracy several times times faster in terms of computational runtime.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, based on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework, a meshfree method using the deep neural network approach is developed for solving two kinds of two-phase interface problems governed by different dynamic partial differential equations on either side of the stationary interface with the jump and high-contrast coefficients. The first type of two-phase interface problem is the fluid-fluid (two-phase flow) interface problem modeled by Navier–Stokes equations with high-contrast physical parameters across the interface. The second one is the fluid-structure interaction problem modeled by Navier–Stokes equations on one side of the interface and the structural equation on the other side, where the fluid and the structure interact with each other via the kinematic and dynamic interface conditions across the interface. Following the PINNs framework, the DNN/meshfree method is respectively developed for two kinds of two-phase interface problems by approximating the solutions using different DNN’s structures in different subdomains and reformulating the interface problems as least-squares minimization problems based on a space-time sampling-point set (as the training dataset). Mathematically, the approximation error analyses are carried out for both interface problems, revealing an intrinsic strategy for efficiently sampling points to improve the accuracy. In addition, compared with traditional discretization approaches (e.g., finite element/volume/difference methods), the proposed DNN/meshfree method and its error analysis technique can be smoothly extended to many other dynamic interface problems with stationary interfaces. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method for the presented two-phase interface problems and validate theoretical results to some extent through two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Gradient-enhanced Kriging (GE-Kriging) is a well-established surrogate modeling technique for approximating expensive computational models. However, it tends to get impractical for high-dimensional problems due to the size of the inherent correlation matrix and the associated high-dimensional hyperparameter tuning problem. To address these issues, a new method, called sliced GE-Kriging (SGE-Kriging), is developed in this paper for reducing both the size of the correlation matrix and the number of hyperparameters. We first split the training sample set into multiple slices, and invoke Bayes’ theorem to approximate the full likelihood function via a sliced likelihood function, in which multiple small correlation matrices are utilized to describe the correlation of the sample set rather than one large one. Then, we replace the original high-dimensional hyperparameter tuning problem with a low-dimensional counterpart by learning the relationship between the hyperparameters and the derivative-based global sensitivity indices. The performance of SGE-kriging is finally validated by means of numerical experiments with several benchmarks and a high-dimensional aerodynamic modeling problem. The results show that the SGE-Kriging model features an accuracy and robustness that is comparable to the standard one but comes at much less training costs. The benefits are most evident for high-dimensional problems with tens of variables.},

The latter are different from the classical bidomain and monodomain cardiac models based on homogenized descriptions of the cardiac tissue at the macroscopic level, and therefore they allow the representation of individual cardiac cells, cell aggregates, damaged tissues, and nonuniform distributions of ion channels on the cell membrane. The resulting discrete cell-by-cell models have discontinuous global solutions across the cell boundaries, and hence the proposed BDDC preconditioner is based on appropriate dual and primal spaces with additional constraints which transfer information between cells (subdomains) without influencing the overall discontinuity of the global solution. A scalable convergence rate bound is proved for the resulting BDDC cell-by-cell preconditioned operator, while numerical tests validate this bound and investigate its dependence on the discretization parameters.},

This embedding equation is developed based on a push-forward operator that can extend any tangential flux vectors from the surface to a neighboring level surface. This operator is easy to compute and involves only the level set function and the corresponding Hessian. The resulting solution is constant in the normal direction of the interface.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is prevalent in chemometrics, signal processing, data mining, and many more fields. While many algorithms have been proposed to compute the CPD, alternating least squares (ALS) remains one of the most widely used algorithms for computing the decomposition. Recent works have introduced the notion of eigenvalues and singular values of a tensor and explored applications of eigenvectors and singular vectors in signal processing, data analytics, and various other fields. We introduce a new formulation for deriving singular values and vectors of a tensor by considering the critical points of a function differently from previous works. Computing these critical points in an alternating manner motivates an alternating optimization algorithm which corresponds to the ALS algorithm in the matrix case. However, for tensors with order greater than or equal to 3, it minimizes an objective function which is different from the commonly used least squares loss. Alternating optimization of this new objective leads to simple updates to the factor matrices with the same asymptotic computational cost as ALS. We show that a subsweep of this algorithm can achieve a superlinear convergence rate for exact CPD when the known rank is not larger than the mode lengths of the input tensor. We verify our theoretical arguments experimentally. We then view the algorithm as optimizing a Mahalanobis distance with respect to each factor with the ground metric dependent on the other factors. This perspective allows us to generalize our approach to interpolate between updates corresponding to the ALS and the new algorithm to manage the tradeoff between stability and fitness of the decomposition. Our experimental results show that for approximating synthetic and real-world tensors, this algorithm and its variants converge to a better conditioned decomposition with comparable and sometimes better fitness as compared to the ALS algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic rounding (SR) offers an alternative to the deterministic IEEE-754 floating-point rounding modes. In some applications such as PDEs, ODEs, and neural networks, SR empirically improves the numerical behavior and convergence to accurate solutions while the theoretical background remains partial. Recent works by Ipsen, Zhou, Higham, and Mary have computed SR probabilistic error bounds for basic linear algebra kernels. For example, the inner product SR probabilistic bound of the forward error is proportional to instead of for the default rounding mode. To compute the bounds, these works show that the errors accumulated in computation form a martingale. This paper proposes an alternative framework to characterize SR errors based on the computation of the variance. We pinpoint common error patterns in numerical algorithms and propose a lemma that bounds their variance. For each probability and through the Bienaymé–Chebyshev inequality, this bound leads to a better probabilistic error bound in several situations. Our method has the advantage of providing a tight probabilistic bound for all algorithms fitting our model. We show how the method can be applied to give SR error bounds for the inner product and Horner polynomial evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Pattern formation plays an important role in the development of living organisms. Since the classical work of Alan Turing, a pre-eminent way of modeling has been through reaction-diffusion mechanisms. Alternative models have been proposed that link dynamics of diffusing molecular signals with tissue mechanics. Model validation is complicated as in many experimental situations only the limiting, stationary regime of the pattern formation process is observable, without any knowledge of the transient behavior or the initial state. To overcome this problem, the initial state of the model can be randomized. But then fixed values of the model parameters correspond to a family of patterns rather than a fixed stationary solution, and standard estimation approaches, such the least squares, are not suitable. Instead, statistical characteristics of the patterns should be compared, which is difficult given the typically limited amount of available data in practical applications. To deal with this problem, we extend the recently developed statistical approach (the correlation integral likelihood method) for parameter identification by pattern data. We introduce modifications that allow increasing the accuracy of the identification process without resizing the data set. The proposed approach is tested using different classes of pattern formation models and severely limited data sets. For all considered equations, parallel, GPU-based implementations of the numerical solvers with efficient time stepping schemes are provided.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with a blood flow problem coupled with a slow plaque growth at the artery wall. In the model, the micro (fast) system is the Navier–Stokes equation with a periodically applied force, and the macro (slow) system is a fractional reaction equation, which is used to describe the plaque growth with memory effect. We construct an auxiliary temporal periodic problem and an effective time-average equation to approximate the original problem and analyze the approximation error of the corresponding linearized PDE (Stokes) system, where the simple front-tracking technique is used to update the slow moving boundary. An effective multiscale method is then designed based on the approximate problem and the front-tracking framework. We also present a temporal finite difference scheme with a spatial continuous finite element method and analyze its temporal discrete error. Furthermore, a fast iterative procedure is designed to find the initial value of the temporal periodic problem, and its convergence is analyzed as well. Our designed front-tracking framework and the iterative procedure for solving the temporal periodic problem make it easy to implement the multiscale method on existing PDE solving software. The numerical method is implemented by a combination of the finite element platform COMSOL Multiphysics and the mainstream software MATLAB, which significantly reduce the programming effort and easily handle the fluid-structure interaction, especially moving boundaries with more complex geometries. We present two numerical examples of ODEs and a two-dimensional Navier–Stokes system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the multiscale method. Finally, we have a numerical experiment on the plaque growth problem and discuss the physical implication of the fractional order parameter.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we apply the binary level set method and techniques from image segmentation to the variational implicit solvent model (VISM), a theoretical and computational setting for studying biomolecular systems with complex topology. Central in VISM is an effective free energy on interfaces that separate solutes, such as proteins, from solvent, such as water. In previous work, the level set method is used to represent the separating interfaces, and an evolution partial differential equation derived from gradient descent on the energy is solved to capture a locally minimizing solute-solvent interface. In this work, we replace the continuous level set function with a binary level set function, which only takes on one of two values, one negative and one positive, and work in this setting. We introduce, under this discrete framework, an approximation of the original free energy, using results in threshold dynamics, and apply to it a fast flipping algorithm based on fast algorithms in image segmentation for local minimization. Numerical experiments in model problems and on real-world proteins show the algorithm’s extremely fast speed, even exceeding that of threshold dynamics using fast Fourier transforms in certain cases, while retaining first order accuracy, the maximum allowed by the binary setting.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We develop an accurate, highly efficient, and scalable random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method for molecular dynamics simulations of systems with Coulomb interactions. The idea of the RBSOG method is based on a sum-of-Gaussians decomposition of the Coulomb kernel, and then a random batch importance sampling on the Fourier space is employed for approximating the Fourier expansion of the Gaussians with large bandwidths (the far components). The importance sampling significantly reduces the computational cost, resulting in a scalable algorithm by avoiding the use of communication-intensive fast Fourier transform. Theoretical analysis is presented to demonstrate the unbiasedness of the approximate force, the controllability of variance, and the convergence of the algorithm. The resultant method has complexity with low communication latency. Accurate simulation results on both dynamical and equilibrium properties of benchmark problems are reported to illustrate the attractive performance of the method. Simulations on parallel computing are, also performed to show the high parallel efficiency. The RBSOG method can be straightforwardly extended to more general interactions with long-ranged kernels and thus is promising for constructing fast algorithms for molecular dynamics simulations of various systems.},

Similarly to Parareal, it combines fine- and coarse-grained solutions to an ODE using a predictor-corrector (PC) scheme. The key difference is that carefully chosen random perturbations are added to the PC to try to accelerate the location of a stochastic solution to the ODE. In this paper, we derive superlinear and linear mean-square error bounds for SParareal applied to nonlinear systems of ODEs using different types of perturbations. We illustrate these bounds numerically on a linear system of ODEs and a scalar nonlinear ODE, showing a good match between theory and numerics.},

To obtain the correct numerical diffusion in all Mach number regimes, a convex combination of upwind and centered fluxes is applied. The numerical scheme is validated by applying it on a model for nonlinear elasticity.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Tensor trains are a versatile tool to compress and work with high-dimensional data and functions. In this work we introduce the streaming tensor train approximation (STTA), a new class of algorithms for approximating a given tensor in the tensor train format. STTA accesses exclusively via two-sided random sketches of the original data, making it streamable and easy to implement in parallel—unlike existing deterministic and randomized tensor train approximations. This property also allows STTA to conveniently leverage structures in , such as sparsity and various low-rank tensor formats, as well as linear combinations thereof. When Gaussian random matrices are used for sketching, STTA is admissible for an analysis that builds and extends upon existing results on the generalized Nyström approximation for matrices. Our results show that STTA can be expected to attain a nearly optimal approximation error if the sizes of the sketches are suitably chosen. A range of numerical experiments illustrates the performance of STTA compared to existing deterministic and randomized approaches.},

This paper proposes an approximate Newton method for the policy gradient algorithm with entropy regularization. In the case of Shannon entropy, the resulting algorithm reproduces the natural policy gradient algorithm. For other entropy functions, this method results in brand-new policy gradient algorithms. We prove that all these algorithms enjoy Newton-type quadratic convergence and that the corresponding gradient flow converges globally to the optimal solution. We use synthetic and industrial-scale examples to demonstrate that the proposed approximate Newton method typically converges in single-digit iterations, often orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is one of the most widely used solution techniques for linear systems of equations arising from discretized partial differential equations. The popularity of AMG stems from its potential to solve linear systems in almost linear time, that is with an complexity, where is the problem size. This capability is crucial at the present, where the increasing availability of massive HPC platforms pushes for the solution of very large problems. The key for a rapidly converging AMG method is a good interplay between the smoother and the coarse-grid correction, which in turn requires the use of an effective prolongation. From a theoretical viewpoint, the prolongation must accurately represent near kernel components and, at the same time, be bounded in the energy norm. For challenging problems, however, ensuring both these requirements is not easy and is exactly the goal of this work. We propose a constrained minimization procedure aimed at reducing prolongation energy while preserving the near kernel components in the span of interpolation. The proposed algorithm is based on previous energy minimization approaches utilizing a preconditioned restricted conjugate gradients method, but has new features and a specific focus on parallel performance and implementation. It is shown that the resulting solver, when used for large real-world problems from various application fields, exhibits excellent convergence rates and scalability and outperforms at least some more traditional AMG approaches.},

The associated variational energy dissipation law in continuous form is developed for the space-time fractional model in continuous form, which is compatible with that of the classical Cahn–Hilliard model. Detailed energy stability and convergence analysis of the proposed fully discrete scheme are rigorously established. We further show that the discrete energy dissipation law of the space-time fractional Cahn–Hilliard model is asymptotically compatible with that of the backward Euler scheme for the classical Cahn–Hilliard model when the order of the time fractional derivative and that of the space fractional Laplacian both approach . The proposed scheme is shown to achieve the optimal temporal convergence rate with the variable time steps numerically. More importantly, numerical results reveal that the energy dissipation rate depends on both the order of the time fractional derivative and that of the space fractional one. Specifically, the exponent of the power law for the energy dissipation scales linearly with the order of the space fractional Laplacian.},

We consider high-order discretizations of a Cauchy problem where the evolution operator comprises a hyperbolic part and a parabolic part with diffusion and stiff relaxation terms. We propose a technique that makes every implicit-explicit (IMEX) time stepping scheme invariant-domain preserving and mass conservative. Following the ideas introduced in Part I on explicit Runge–Kutta schemes, the IMEX scheme is written in incremental form. At each stage, we first combine a low-order and a high-order hyperbolic update using a limiting operator, then we combine a low-order and a high-order parabolic update using another limiting operator. The proposed technique, which is agnostic to the space discretization, allows one to optimize the time step restrictions induced by the hyperbolic substep. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we derive four novel IMEX methods with optimal efficiency. All the implicit schemes are singly diagonal. One of them is A-stable and the other three are L-stable. The novel IMEX schemes are evaluated numerically on systems of stiff ordinary differential equations and nonlinear conservation equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We address the problem of approximating an unknown function from its discrete samples given at arbitrarily scattered sites. This problem is essential in numerical sciences, where modern applications also highlight the need for a solution to the case of functions with manifold values. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a combination of kernel-based quasi-interpolation and multiscale approximations for both scalar- and manifold-valued functions. While quasi-interpolation provides a powerful tool for approximation problems if the data is defined on infinite grids, the situation is more complicated when it comes to scattered data. Here, higher-order quasi-interpolation schemes either require derivative information or become numerically unstable. Hence, this paper principally studies the improvement achieved by combining quasi-interpolation with a multiscale technique. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we introduce the multiscale quasi-interpolation technique for scalar-valued functions. Second, we show how this technique can be carried over using moving least-squares operators to the manifold-valued setting. Third, we give a mathematical proof that converging quasi-interpolation will also lead to converging multiscale quasi-interpolation. Fourth, we provide ample numerical evidence that multiscale quasi-interpolation has superior convergence to quasi-interpolation. In addition, we will provide examples showing that the multiscale quasi-interpolation approach offers a powerful tool for many data analysis tasks, such as denoising and anomaly detection. It is especially attractive for cases of massive data points and high dimensionality.},

Solutions are advanced in time using a fourth-order additive implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta method, with the viscous and source terms treated implicitly and explicitly, respectively. Formal accuracy of the method is demonstrated with several grid convergence studies, and results are shown for an application with a complex bio-inspired material. The developed method achieves fourth-order accuracy and is stable despite the pervasive small cells arising from complex geometries.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article introduces HODLR2D, a new hierarchical low-rank representation for a class of dense matrices arising out of -body problems in two dimensions. Using this new hierarchical framework, we propose a new fast matrix-vector product that scales almost linearly. We apply this fast matrix-vector product to accelerate the iterative solution of large dense linear systems arising out of radial basis function interpolation and discretized integral equation. The space and computational complexity of HODLR2D matrix-vector products scale as , where is the maximum rank of the compressed matrix subblocks. For the logarithmic kernel function, we prove that . We also numerically observe a similar scaling for other kernel functions in 2D. We thereby demonstrate that the storage and computational complexity of HODLR2D matrix-vector products remain tractable for large . Additionally, we also study the parallel scalability of HODLR2D as part of this article.},

Because of the curse of dimensionality, it is expensive to store both the solution and right-hand side vector in such extremely large linear systems. Our idea is to employ a neural network to characterize the solution with many fewer parameters than the size of the solution under a matrix-free setting. We present an error analysis of the proposed method, indicating that the solution error is bounded by the condition number of the matrix and the neural network approximation error. Several numerical examples from partial differential equations, queueing problems, and probabilistic Boolean networks are presented to demonstrate that the solutions of linear systems can be learned quite accurately.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Data-driven reduced-order models often fail to make accurate forecasts of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems that are sensitive along coordinates with low-variance because such coordinates are often truncated, e.g., by proper orthogonal decomposition, kernel principal component analysis, and autoencoders. Such systems are encountered frequently in shear-dominated fluid flows where nonnormality plays a significant role in the growth of disturbances. In order to address these issues, we employ ideas from active subspaces to find low-dimensional systems of coordinates for model reduction that balance adjoint-based information about the system’s sensitivity with the variance of states along trajectories. The resulting method, which we refer to as covariance balancing reduction using adjoint snapshots (CoBRAS), is analogous to balanced truncation with state and adjoint-based gradient covariance matrices replacing the system Gramians and obeying the same key transformation laws. Here, the extracted coordinates are associated with an oblique projection that can be used to construct Petrov–Galerkin reduced-order models. We provide an efficient snapshot-based computational method analogous to balanced proper orthogonal decomposition. This also leads to the observation that the reduced coordinates can be computed relying on inner products of state and gradient samples alone, allowing us to find rich nonlinear coordinates by replacing the inner product with a kernel function. In these coordinates, reduced-order models can be learned using regression. We demonstrate these techniques and compare to a variety of other methods on a simple, yet challenging three-dimensional system and a nonlinear axisymmetric jet flow simulation with state variables.},

We propose in this paper a new minimization algorithm based on a slightly modified version of the scalar auxialiary variable (SAV) approach coupled with a relaxation step and an adaptive strategy. It enjoys several distinct advantages over popular gradient based methods: (i) it is unconditionally energy diminishing with a modified energy which is intrinsically related to the original energy, and thus no parameter tuning is needed for stability; (ii) it allows the use of large step-sizes which can effectively accelerate the convergence rate. We also present a convergence analysis for some SAV based algorithms, which include our new algorithm without the relaxation step as a special case. We apply our new algorithm to several illustrative and benchmark problems and compare its performance with several popular gradient based methods. The numerical results indicate that the new algorithm is very robust, and its adaptive version usually converges significantly faster than those popular gradient decent based methods.},

Parallel-in-time integration has been the focus of intensive research efforts over the past two decades due to the advent of massively parallel computer architectures and the scaling limits of purely spatial parallelization. Various iterative parallel-in-time algorithms have been proposed, like Parareal, PFASST, MGRIT, and Space-Time Multi-Grid (STMG). These methods have been described using different notation, and the convergence estimates that are available are difficult to compare. We describe Parareal, PFASST, MGRIT, and STMG for the Dahlquist model problem using a common notation and give precise convergence estimates using generating functions. This allows us, for the first time, to directly compare their convergence. We prove that all four methods eventually converge superlinearly, and we also compare them numerically. The generating function framework provides further opportunities to explore and analyze existing and new methods. Reproducibility of computational results.

We provide closed-form expressions for the first moments (i.e., the volume and volume-weighted centroid) of a polyhedron clipped by a paraboloid, that is, of a polyhedron intersected with the subset of the three-dimensional real space located on one side of a paraboloid. These closed-form expressions are derived following successive applications of the divergence theorem and the judicious parametrization of the intersection of the polyhedron’s faces with the paraboloid. We provide means for identifying ambiguous discrete intersection topologies, and propose a corrective procedure for preventing their occurence. Finally, we put our proposed closed-form expressions and numerical approach to the test with millions of random and manually engineered polyhedron/paraboloid intersection configurations. The results of these tests show that we are able to provide robust machine-accurate estimates of the first moments at a computational cost that is within one order of magnitude of that of state-of-the-art half-space clipping algorithms.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The scientific code generation package lbmpy supports the automated design and the efficient implementation of lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) through metaprogramming. It is based on a new, concise calculus for describing multiple relaxation-time LBMs, including techniques that enable the numerically advantageous subtraction of the constant background component from the populations. These techniques are generalized to a wide range of collision spaces and equilibrium distributions. The article contains an overview of lbmpy’s frontend and its code generation pipeline, which implements the new LBM calculus by means of symbolic formula manipulation tools and object-oriented programming. The generated codes have only a minimal number of arithmetic operations. Their automatic derivation rests on two novel chimera transforms that have been specifically developed for efficiently computing raw and central moments. Information contained in the symbolic representation of the methods is further exploited in a customized sequence of algebraic simplifications, further reducing computational cost. When combined, these algebraic transformations lead to concise and compact numerical kernels. Specifically, with these optimizations, the advanced central moment- and cumulant-based methods can be realized with only little additional cost as when compared with the simple Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook method. The effectiveness and flexibility of the new lbmpy code generation system is demonstrated in simulating Taylor–Green vortex decay and the automatic derivation of an LBM algorithm to solve the shallow water equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study a new technique for reducing the number of iterations of the block Cimmino method by replicating rows in the partitioned system, so that we obtain a nondisjoint partitioning of the rows. Since rows in different partitions that are close to colinear produce a poorly conditioned iteration matrix for the block Cimmino method, row replication can get around this problem. With intelligent replication choices, we can reduce the number of iterations for convergence of the replicated block Cimmino method. The downside is a slight increase of the computational workload associated with each partition. In order to find a trade-off between a lower number of iterations and a higher cost per iteration, selecting the proper set of rows for replication is crucial. In this paper, we use graph-based techniques to find good candidates for replication. Since the block Cimmino method can be interpreted as a nonoverlapping additive Schwartz method applied to the normal equations, the replication techniques correspond to introducing an overlap between the subdomains defined by the partitions. We show analytically in the case of a two-block partitioning how the replication improves the condition number of the block Cimmino iteration matrix. We then use challenging two-dimensional PDE problems to show that our algebraic approach targets physically meaningful phenomena on the interface between partitions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in improving the performance of the block Cimmino solver, even with a small amount of replication, on problems from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection. Finally, we compare our approach to a BiCGStab preconditioned with an additive Schwartz method and show that our replication technique can be used to define the subdomains and overlaps in the context of domain decomposition methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The dynamic formulation of optimal transport has attracted growing interest in scientific computing and machine learning, and its computation requires solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem. The classical Eulerian discretization based approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which arises from the approximation of a high-dimensional velocity field. In this work, we propose a deep learning based method for solving the dynamic optimal transport in high-dimensional space. Our method contains three main ingredients: a carefully designed representation of the velocity field, the discretization of the PDE constraint along the characteristics, and the computation of a high-dimensional integral by the Monte Carlo method in each time step. Specifically, in the representation of the velocity field, we apply the classical nodal basis function in time and the deep neural networks in the space domain with the H1-norm regularization. This technique promotes the regularity of the velocity field in both time and space such that the discretization along the characteristic remains stable during the training process. Extensive numerical examples have been conducted to test the proposed method. Compared to other solvers of optimal transport, our method could give more accurate results in high-dimensional cases and has very good scalability with respect to dimension. Finally, we extend our method to more complicated cases such as the crowd motion problem.},

The original scattering problem is truncated onto a bounded domain by the PML.

The hyper-singular integral operator is transformed into a combination of weakly-singular integral operators and tangential derivatives. We develop a high-order Chebyshev-based rectangular-polar singular-integration solver to discretize all weakly singular integrals.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Molecular crystal structure prediction (CSP) seeks the most stable periodic structure given the chemical composition of molecule and pressure-temperature conditions. Modern CSP solvers use global optimization methods to search for structures with minimal free energy within a complex energy landscape induced by intermolecular potentials. A major caveat of these methods is that initial configurations are random, making the search susceptible to convergence at local minima. Providing initial configurations that are densely packed with respect to the geometric representation of a molecule can significantly accelerate CSP. Motivated by these observations, we define a class of periodic packings restricted to crystallographic symmetry groups (CSG) and design a search method for the densest CSG packings in an information-geometric framework. Since CSG induces a toroidal topology on the configuration space, a non-Euclidean trust region method is performed on a statistical manifold consisting of probability distributions defined on an -dimensional flat unit torus by extending the multivariate von Mises distribution. Introducing an adaptive quantile reformulation of the fitness function into the optimization schedule provides the algorithm with a geometric characterization through local dual geodesic flows. Moreover, we examine the geometry of the adaptive selection-quantile defined trust region and show that the algorithm performs a maximization of stochastic dependence among elements of the extended multivariate von Mises distributed random vector. We experimentally evaluate the behavior and performance of the algorithm on various densest packings of convex polygons in 2-dimensional CSGs for which optimal solutions are known, and we demonstrate its application in the pentacene thin-film CSP.},

By directly working with the intrinsic coordinate system with as the basis and the covariant formulation of Maxwell’s equations, the approach proposed here treats nonorthogonal and orthogonal Bravais lattices in an equal and unified manner and trivially incorporates the Bloch condition in the discretization. Yee’s scheme does not require the coordinate system or mesh to be orthogonal, and assisted by linear interpolation, this scheme can handle anisotropic media, by which the frequency domain Maxwell’s equations are discretized into a standard eigenvalue problem (SEP). With an alternative understanding of null-space deflation techniques, this SEP is transformed into several equivalent null-space free SEPs, whose smallest few positive eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors are calculated by an iterative eigensolver of the inner-outer type. Comparison with other methods for band structure calculations of 3D anisotropic and isotropic PhCs is made to demonstrate the effectiveness and strength of our present approach.},

In this research study, a bilinear Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method is considered to solve the two-dimensional nonlinear acoustic wave equation and extended to solve the three-dimensional nonlinear wave equations. First, the wave equation is spatially approximated by a bilinear Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method and a second-order Sylvester-type matrix differential equation (MDE) is obtained. Using an eigenvalue decomposition method, this equation is transformed to a set of separated second-order ODEs in the new coordinates. Finally, using an implicit Runge–Kutta–Nyström (IRKN) or stabilized Numerov method, the arising second-order ODEs will be solved. Transforming into a set of separated second-order ODEs causes one to reduce the computational complexity. Specifically, in the higher dimensional models, the cost of computation is considerably reduced. The convergence analysis is also investigated theoretically. Furthermore, the conservation of energy is numerically investigated. Finally, Some numerical examples are included to confirm the accuracy and efficiency and the fast computing behavior of the approach. These examples represent that our approach has superiority over the Kronecker approach.},

The stationary discontinuity induced by the singular source and its coupling with the convection of fluid present challenges in numerical computation. We introduce a definition of the well-balanced property of the numerical scheme for the singular source of interest, which is necessary for the numerical solution to be correct. We theoretically show that the splitting scheme is always not well-balanced and leads to incorrect results. For the unsplitting scheme, we present a consistency condition of the numerical fluxes for singular sources, which ensures that the numerical scheme is well-balanced. However, it can be shown that the well-balanced property of a scheme cannot guarantee the correct numerical solutions in extreme cases. To fix this difficulty, we propose a solution-structure based approximate Riemann solver, in which the structure of the Riemann solution is first predicted, and then its corresponding approximate solution is given. The proposed solver can be applied to the calculation of numerical fluxes in a general finite volume method, which can lead to a new well-balanced scheme. Numerical tests show that the discontinuous Galerkin method based on the present approximate Riemann solver has the ability to capture each wave accurately.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Surrogate models can reduce computational costs for multivariable functions with an unknown internal structure (black boxes). In a discrete formulation, surrogate modeling is equivalent to restoring a multidimensional array (tensor) from a small part of its elements. The alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm in the tensor train (TT) format is a widely used approach to effectively solve this problem in the case of nonadaptive tensor recovery from a given training set (i.e., tensor completion problem). TT-ALS allows obtaining a low-parametric representation of the tensor, which is free from the curse of dimensionality and can be used for fast computation of the values at arbitrary tensor indices or efficient implementation of algebra operations with the black box (integration, etc.). However, to obtain high accuracy in the presence of restrictions on the size of the train data, a good choice of initial approximation is essential. In this work, we construct the ANOVA representation in the TT-format and use it as an initial approximation for the TT-ALS algorithm. The performed numerical computations for a number of multidimensional model problems, including the parametric partial differential equation, demonstrate a significant advantage of our approach for the commonly used random initial approximation. For all considered model problems we obtained an increase in accuracy by at least an order of magnitude with the same number of requests to the black box. The proposed approach is very general and can be applied in a wide class of real-world surrogate modeling and machine learning problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. As CPU clock speeds have stagnated and high performance computers continue to have ever higher core counts, increased parallelism is needed to take advantage of these new architectures. Traditional serial time-marching schemes can be a significant bottleneck, as many types of simulations require large numbers of time-steps which must be computed sequentially. Parallel-in-time schemes, such as the Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) method, remedy this by parallelizing across time-steps and have shown promising results for parabolic problems. However, chaotic problems have proved more difficult, since chaotic initial value problems (IVPs) are inherently ill-conditioned. MGRIT relies on a hierarchy of successively coarser time-grids to iteratively correct the solution on the finest time-grid, but due to the nature of chaotic systems, small inaccuracies on the coarser levels can be greatly magnified and lead to poor coarse-grid corrections. Here we introduce a modified MGRIT algorithm based on an existing quadratically converging nonlinear extension to the multigrid Full Approximation Scheme (FAS), as well as a novel time-coarsening scheme. Together, these approaches better capture long-term chaotic behavior on coarse-grids and greatly improve convergence of MGRIT for chaotic IVPs. Further, we introduce a novel low-memory variant of the algorithm for solving chaotic PDEs with MGRIT which not only solves the IVP, but also provides estimates for the unstable Lyapunov vectors of the system. We provide supporting numerical results for the Lorenz system and demonstrate parallel speedup for the chaotic Kuramoto–Sivashinsky PDE over a significantly longer time-domain than in previous works.},

We present a computational scheme that derives a global polynomial level set parameterization for smooth closed surfaces from a regular surface-point set and prove its uniqueness. This enables us to approximate a broad class of smooth surfaces by affine algebraic varieties. From such a global polynomial level set parameterization, differential-geometric quantities like mean and Gauss curvature can be efficiently and accurately computed. Even fourth-order terms such as the Laplacian of mean curvature are approximated with high precision. The accuracy performance results in a gain of computational efficiency, significantly reducing the number of surface points required compared to classic alternatives that rely on surface meshes or embedding grids. We mathematically derive and empirically demonstrate the strengths and the limitations of the present approach, suggesting it to be applicable to a large number of computational tasks in numerical differential geometry.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as an effective technique for solving PDEs in a wide range of domains. It is noticed, however, that the performance of PINNs can vary dramatically with different sampling procedures. For instance, a fixed set of (prior chosen) training points may fail to capture the effective solution region (especially for problems with singularities). To overcome this issue, we present in this work an adaptive strategy, termed failure-informed PINNs (FI-PINNs), which is inspired by the viewpoint of reliability analysis. The key idea is to define an effective failure probability based on the residual, and then, with the aim of placing more samples in the failure region, the FI-PINNs employs a failure-informed enrichment technique to adaptively add new collocation points to the training set, such that the numerical accuracy is dramatically improved. In short, similar to adaptive finite element methods, the proposed FI-PINNs adopt the failure probability as the posterior error indicator to generate new training points. We prove rigorous error bounds of FI-PINNs and illustrate their performance through several problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) play a critical role in model development and calibration. In many applications, there are multiple uncertain parameters in a model that must be estimated. However, high dimensionality of the parameters and computational complexity of the PDE solves make such problems challenging. A common approach is to reduce the dimension by fixing some parameters (which we will call auxiliary parameters) to a best estimate and use techniques from PDE-constrained optimization to estimate the other parameters. In this article, hyper-differential sensitivity analysis (HDSA) is used to assess the sensitivity of the solution of the PDE-constrained optimization problem to changes in the auxiliary parameters. Foundational assumptions for HDSA require satisfaction of the optimality conditions which are not always practically feasible as a result of ill-posedness in the inverse problem. We introduce novel theoretical and computational approaches to justify and enable HDSA for ill-posed inverse problems by projecting the sensitivities on likelihood informed subspaces and defining a posteriori updates. Our proposed framework is demonstrated on a nonlinear multiphysics inverse problem motivated by estimation of spatially heterogeneous material properties in the presence of spatially distributed parametric modeling uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work formulates a new approach to reduced modeling of parameterized, time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). The method employs Operator Inference, a scientific machine learning framework combining data-driven learning and physics-based modeling. The parametric structure of the governing equations is embedded directly into the reduced-order model, and parameterized reduced-order operators are learned via a data-driven linear regression problem. The result is a reduced-order model that can be solved rapidly to map parameter values to approximate PDE solutions. Such parameterized reduced-order models may be used as physics-based surrogates for uncertainty quantification and inverse problems that require many forward solves of parametric PDEs. Numerical issues such as well-posedness and the need for appropriate regularization in the learning problem are considered, and an algorithm for hyperparameter selection is presented. The method is illustrated for a parametric heat equation and demonstrated for the FitzHugh–Nagumo neuron model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many iterative parallel-in-time algorithms have been shown to be highly efficient for diffusion-dominated partial differential equations (PDEs) but are inefficient or even divergent when applied to advection-dominated PDEs. We consider the application of the multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) algorithm to linear advection PDEs. The key to efficient time integration with this method is using a coarse-grid operator that provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to the so-called ideal coarse-grid operator. For certain classes of semi-Lagrangian discretizations, we present a novel semi-Lagrangian-based coarse-grid operator that leads to fast and scalable multilevel time integration of linear advection PDEs. The coarse-grid operator is composed of a semi-Lagrangian discretization followed by a correction term, with the correction designed so that the leading-order truncation error of the composite operator is approximately equal to that of the ideal coarse-grid operator. Parallel results show substantial speed-ups over sequential time integration for variable-wave-speed advection problems in one and two spatial dimensions, and using high-order discretizations up to order five. The proposed approach establishes the first practical method that provides small and scalable MGRIT iteration counts for advection problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Kinetic equations model the position-velocity distribution of particles subject to transport and collision effects. Under a diffusive scaling, these combined effects converge to a diffusion equation for the position density in the limit of an infinite collision rate. Despite this well-defined limit, numerical simulation is expensive when the collision rate is high but finite, as small time steps are then required. In this work, we present an asymptotic-preserving multilevel Monte Carlo particle scheme that makes use of this diffusive limit to accelerate computations. In this scheme, we first sample the diffusive limiting model to compute a biased initial estimate of a quantity of interest, using large time steps. We then perform a limited number of finer simulations with transport and collision dynamics to correct the bias. The efficiency of the multilevel method depends on being able to perform correlated simulations of particles on a hierarchy of discretization levels. We present a method for correlating particle trajectories and present both an analysis and numerical experiments. We demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the cost of particle simulations in high-collisional regimes, compared with prior work, indicating significant potential for adopting these schemes in various areas of active research.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents an extension of the Adaptive Antoulas–Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational modeling. Specifically, our new stable multi-input multi-output AAA (smiAAA) algorithm builds rational approximations of multi-input signals with a common set of stable poles. A new methodology is presented for iteratively enforcing the stability constraint on the poles. We demonstrate the strengths of this approach compared to the stability enforcement in the FastAAA algorithm. Results using the smiAAA algorithm are compared with the commonly used Vector Fitting algorithm and the more recently published Rational Krylov fitting (RKFIT) algorithm. The Vector Fitting and RKFIT algorithms both require the user to input the number of poles to use in the approximations. If the final approximation is not accurate enough, the user must restart the Vector Fitting or RKFIT algorithm with a larger number of poles and/or a new starting location for the poles. In contrast, the smiAAA algorithm is designed to allow the user to simply input the desired accuracy of the approximations, and the necessary number of poles is detected automatically. This permits users to produce approximations of a desired accuracy with no knowledge about the underlying order of the system being approximated, preventing the algorithm from ever needing to be rerun. An additional feature for preventing extraneous poles from being returned by the AAA algorithm is also discussed. The cause of these extraneous poles is efficiently detected and removed by our presented methodology. The examples presented demonstrate that the smiAAA algorithm can efficiently produce approximations of similar or better accuracy than the Vector Fitting and RKFIT algorithms while requiring less input from the user.},

The first approach can be considered as a reformulation of the Dyson series, and the second one, called “bold-thin-bold diagrammatic Monte Carlo,” is based on resummation of the diagrams in the Dyson series to accelerate its convergence. The underlying mechanism of the governing equations associated with the two methods lies in the recurrence relation of the path integrals, which is the most costly part in the numerical methods. The proposed algorithms give an extension to the work of Cai, Lu, and Yang [Comput. Phys. Commun. 278 (2022), 108417], where the algorithms are designed based on reusing the previous calculations of bath influence functionals. Compared with the algorithms therein, our methods further include the reuse of system-associated functionals and show better performance in terms of computational efficiency and memory cost. We demonstrate the two methods in the framework of spin-boson model, and numerical experiments are carried out to verify the validity of the methods.},

Neglecting the inter-layer coupling gives a preconditioner that degrades rapidly as the number of layers increases. By a careful analysis of the matrix that couples the layers, we derive a robust method that requires solving a reformulated system that only involves coupling between adjacent layers. Numerical results obtained using Firedrake [F. Rathgeber et al., ACM Trans. Math. Software, 43 (2016), 24] confirm the theory.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we discuss a projection model order reduction method for a class of parametric linear evolution PDEs, which is based on the application of the Laplace transform. The main advantage of this approach is that the Laplace transform allows us to compute the solution directly at a given instant. This can be done efficiently by approximating the contour integral associated to the inverse Laplace transform by a suitable quadrature formula. This feature turns out to be very important in terms of classical model order reduction methodologies. In fact, differently from time stepping integrators (like Runge–Kutta methods), the use of the Laplace transform determines a significant reduction of the size of the reduced space. In this article we propose two reduction methods; the first one constructs a unique reduced space, based on the vectors representing the Laplace transform at the chosen quadrature points for different values of the parameters, and the second one instead constructs several reduced spaces, one at each quadrature node. This last approach is particularly well suited to a parallel computation approach, allowing a faster computation. We show the effectiveness of the method by some illustrative parabolic PDEs arising from finance.},

We propose efficient numerical schemes for implementing the natural gradient descent (NGD) for a broad range of metric spaces with applications to PDE-based optimization problems. Our technique represents the natural gradient direction as a solution to a standard least-squares problem. Hence, instead of calculating, storing, or inverting the information matrix directly, we apply efficient methods from numerical linear algebra. We treat both scenarios where the Jacobian, i.e., the derivative of the state variable with respect to the parameter, is either explicitly known or implicitly given through constraints. We can thus reliably compute several natural NGDs for a large-scale parameter space. In particular, we are able to compute Wasserstein NGD in thousands of dimensions, which was believed to be out of reach. Finally, our numerical results shed light on the qualitative differences between the standard gradient descent and various NGD methods based on different metric spaces in nonconvex optimization problems.},

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose an estimator for the wave equation that is provably reliable and efficient in the same norm. We also explain, without analysis, how the estimator is adapted to cover time discretization by an explicit time integration scheme.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work introduces, analyzes, and demonstrates an efficient and theoretically sound filtering strategy to ensure the condition of the least-squares problem solved at each iteration of Anderson acceleration. The filtering strategy consists of two steps: the first controls the length disparity between columns of the least-squares matrix, and the second enforces a lower bound on the angles between subspaces spanned by the columns of that matrix. The combined strategy is shown to control the condition number of the least-squares matrix at each iteration. The method is shown to be effective on a range of problems based on discretizations of partial differential equations. It is shown to be particularly effective for problems where the initial iterate may lie far from the solution and which progress through distinct preasymptotic and asymptotic phases.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose an efficient exponential integrator finite element method for solving a class of semilinear parabolic equations in rectangular domains. The proposed method first performs the spatial discretization of the model equation using the finite element approximation with continuous multilinear rectangular basis functions, and then takes the explicit exponential Runge–Kutta approach for time integration of the resulting semidiscrete system to produce a fully discrete numerical solution. Under certain regularity assumptions, error estimates measured in -norm are successfully derived for the proposed schemes with one and two Runge–Kutta stages. More remarkably, the mass and coefficient matrices of the proposed method can be simultaneously diagonalized with an orthogonal matrix, which provides a fast solution process based on tensor product spectral decomposition and the fast Fourier transform. Various numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are also carried out to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We are concerned with employing model order reduction to efficiently solve parameterized multiscale problems using the localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) multiscale method. Like many multiscale methods, the LOD follows the idea of separating the problem into localized fine-scale subproblems and an effective coarse-scale system derived from the solutions of the local problems. While the reduced basis (RB) method has already been used to speed up the solution of the fine-scale problems, the resulting coarse system remained untouched, thus limiting the achievable speedup. In this work, we address this issue by applying the RB methodology to a new two-scale formulation of the LOD. By reducing the entire two-scale system, this two-scale RB LOD approach yields reduced order models that are completely independent from the size of the coarse mesh of the multiscale approach, allowing an efficient approximation of the solutions of parameterized multiscale problems even for very large domains. A rigorous and efficient a posteriori estimator bounds the model reduction error, taking into account the approximation error for both the local fine-scale problems and the global coarse-scale system.},

This work builds on operator inference from scientific machine learning to infer low-dimensional models from high-dimensional state trajectories polluted with noise. The presented analysis shows that, under certain conditions, the inferred operators are unbiased estimators of the well-studied projection-based reduced operators from traditional model reduction. Furthermore, the connection between operator inference and projection-based model reduction enables bounding the mean-squared errors of predictions made with the learned models with respect to traditional reduced models. The analysis also motivates an active operator inference approach that judiciously samples high-dimensional trajectories with the aim of achieving a low mean-squared error by reducing the effect of noise. Numerical experiments with high-dimensional linear and nonlinear state dynamics demonstrate that predictions obtained with active operator inference have orders of magnitude lower mean-squared errors than operator inference with traditional, equidistantly sampled trajectory data.},

By introducing a novel symmetric positive definite surface energy matrix depending on a stabilizing function and the Cahn–Hoffman -vector, we present a new symmetrized variational formulation for anisotropic surface diffusion in 3D with weakly or strongly anisotropic surface energy. The variational problem preserves two important structures, volume conservation and energy dissipation. Then we propose a structure-preserving parametric finite element method (SP-PFEM) to discretize the symmetrized variational problem in space via PFEM and in time via an implicit-explicit Euler method, which preserves the volume in the discretized level. Under a relatively mild and simple condition on , we show that the SP-PFEM is unconditionally energy stable for almost all anisotropic surface energies arising in practical applications. Thus the proposed SP-PFEM preserves the two important structures of the original anisotropic surface diffusion in the discretized level. Extensive numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy as well as the structure-preserving properties of the proposed SP-PFEM for solving anisotropic surface diffusion in 3D.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In recent years there has been a push to discover the governing equations of dynamical systems directly from measurements of the state, often motivated by systems that are too complex to directly model. Although there has been substantial work put into such a discovery, doing so in the case of large noise has proved challenging. Here we develop an algorithm for the simultaneous identification and denoising of a dynamical system (SIDDS). We infer the noise in the state measurements by requiring that the denoised state satisfies the dynamical system with an equality constraint. This contrasts to existing work where the mismatch in the dynamics is added as a penalty in the objective. Assuming the nonlinear differential equation is represented in a predefined basis, we develop a sequential quadratic programming approach to solve the SIDDS problem featuring a direct solution of the KKT system with a specialized preconditioner. We also show how to add a sparsity promotion regularization into SIDDS using an iteratively reweighted least squares approach. Our resulting algorithm obtains estimates of the dynamical system that achieve the Cramér–Rao lower bound up to discretization error. This enables SIDDS to provide substantial improvements compared to existing techniques: SIDDS substantially decreases the data burden for accurate identification, recovers optimal estimates with lower sample rates, and the sparsity promoting variant discovers the correct sparsity pattern with larger noise.},

The hypre software library provides high-performance multigrid preconditioners and solvers through conceptual interfaces, including a semistructured interface that describes matrices primarily in terms of stencils and logically structured grids. This paper presents a new semistructured algebraic multigrid (SSAMG) method built on this interface. The numerical convergence and performance of a CPU implementation of this method are evaluated for a set of semistructured problems. SSAMG achieves significantly better setup times than hypre’s unstructured AMG solvers and comparable convergence. In addition, the new method is capable of solving more complex problems than hypre’s structured solvers.},

To realize the possible computational savings, we develop some additive Schwarz methods based on solving local patch problems. Adapting arguments from Pavarino for the tensor-product case, we prove that patch smoothers give conditioning estimates independent of the polynomial degree for a model problem. We also combine this with a low-order global operator to give an optimal two-grid method, with conditioning estimates independent of the mesh size and polynomial degree. The theory holds for serendipity elements in two and three dimensions and can be extended to multigrid algorithms. Numerical experiments using Firedrake and PETSc confirm this theory and demonstrate efficiency relative to standard elements.},

Local Fourier analysis (LFA) is a technique for investigating and tuning multigrid methods. P-multigrid is popular for high-order or spectral finite element methods, especially on unstructured meshes. In this paper, we introduce LFAToolkit.jl, a new Julia package for LFA of high-order finite element methods. LFAToolkit.jl analyzes preconditioning techniques for arbitrary systems of second order PDEs and supports mixed finite element methods. Specifically, we develop LFA of p-multigrid with arbitrary second-order PDEs using high-order finite element discretizations and examine the performance of Jacobi and Chebyshev smoothing for two-grid schemes with aggressive p-coarsening. A natural extension of this LFA framework is the analysis of h-multigrid for finite element discretizations or finite difference discretizations that can be represented in the language of finite elements. With this extension, we can replicate previous work on the LFA of h-multigrid for arbitrary order discretizations using a convenient and extensible abstraction. Examples in one, two, and three dimensions are presented to validate our LFA of p-multigrid for the Laplacian and linear elasticity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We address the numerical solution of linear systems arising from the hybrid discretizations of second-order elliptic partial differential equations. Such discretizations hinge on a hybrid set of degrees of freedom (DoFs), respectively, defined in cells and faces, which naturally gives rise to a global hybrid system of linear equations. Assuming that the cell unknowns are only locally coupled, they can be efficiently eliminated from the system, leaving only face unknowns in the resulting Schur complement, which is also called the statically condensed matrix. We propose in this work an algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner specifically targeting condensed systems corresponding to lowest-order discretizations (piecewise constant). Like traditional AMG methods, we retrieve geometric information on the coupling of the DoFs from algebraic data. However, as the condensed matrix only gives information on the faces, we use the uncondensed version to reconstruct the connectivity graph between elements and faces. An aggregation-based coarsening strategy mimicking a geometric coarsening or semicoarsening can then be set up to build coarse levels. Numerical experiments are performed on diffusion problems discretized by the hybrid high-order method at the lowest order. Our approach uses a K-cycle to precondition an outer flexible Krylov method.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a multigrid-in-channels (MGIC) approach that tackles the quadratic growth of the number of parameters with respect to the number of channels in standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Thereby our approach addresses the redundancy in CNNs that is also exposed by the recent success of lightweight CNNs. Lightweight CNNs can achieve comparable accuracy to standard CNNs with fewer parameters; however, the number of weights still scales quadratically with the CNN’s width. Our MGIC architectures replace each CNN block with an MGIC counterpart that utilizes a hierarchy of nested grouped convolutions of small group size to address this. Hence, our proposed architectures scale linearly with respect to the network’s width while retaining full coupling of the channels as in standard CNNs. Our extensive experiments on image classification, segmentation, and point cloud classification show that applying this strategy to different architectures like ResNet and MobileNetV3 reduces the number of parameters while obtaining similar or better accuracy.},

The new algorithm is based on the multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT) approach, which, in certain settings, is equivalent to another common multilevel parallel-in-time method, Parareal. In contrast to Parareal and MGRIT that both consider a global temporal grid over the entire time interval on the coarsest level, the AT-MGRIT algorithm uses truncated local time grids on the coarsest level, each grid covering certain temporal subintervals. These local grids can be solved completely in an independent way from each other, which reduces the sequential part of the algorithm and, thus, increases parallelism in the method. Here, we study the effect of using truncated local coarse grids on the convergence of the algorithm, both theoretically and numerically, and show, using challenging nonlinear problems, that the new algorithm consistently outperforms classical Parareal/MGRIT in terms of time to solution.},

We propose a new approach that consists of first applying a simple algebraic transformation to the linear system, which is afterwards preconditioned with an aggregation-based algebraic two-grid method. An algebraic analysis is provided, which proves uniform convergence in norm with respect to problem parameters if a few constants can be uniformly bounded. A further analysis of these constants shows that they can be bounded in the case of a constant convection field, provided that the coarsening of the pressure unknowns is also driven by the convection field. This makes the method essentially different from a similar method developed for Stokes equations which initially inspired the present work. Technically, this means that one has to either use point-based coarsening, or that an auxiliary convection-diffusion matrix has to be built on the pressure space to guide the coarsening, which makes the method only semialgebraic. Using this ingredient, promising results are obtained, showing that the number of iterations is, in practice, uniformly bounded with respect to both the mesh size and the Reynolds number even for challenging recirculating convection fields or in presence of outflow boundary conditions.},

In this paper, we propose an efficient adaptive framework for learning optimized smoothers from operator stencils in the form of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

  abstract     = {The parallel performance of the three-level fast and robust overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) preconditioners is investigated for linear elasticity. The FROSch framework is part of the Trilinos software library and contains a parallel implementation of different preconditioners with energy minimizing coarse spaces of generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund type. The three-level extension is constructed by a recursive application of the FROSch preconditioner to the coarse problem. In this paper, the additional steps in the implementation in order to apply the FROSch preconditioner recursively are described in detail. Furthermore, it is shown that no explicit geometric information is needed in the recursive application of the preconditioner. In particular, the rigid body modes, including the rotations, can be interpolated on the coarse level without additional geometric information. Parallel results for a three-dimensional linear elasticity problem obtained on the Theta supercomputer (Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, Argonne, IL) using up to 220 000 cores are discussed and compared to results obtained on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer (Leibniz Supercomputing Centre, Garching, Germany). Notably, it can be observed that a hierarchical communication operation in FROSch related to the coarse operator starts to dominate the computing time on Theta, which has a dragonfly interconnect, for 100 000 message passing interface (MPI) ranks or more. The same operation, however, scales well and stays within the order of a second in all experiments performed on SuperMUC-NG, which uses a fat tree network. Using hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization, the onset of the MPI communication problem on Theta can be delayed. Further analysis of the performance of FROSch on large supercomputers with dragonfly interconnects will be necessary.},

For the preconditioner, we use a CNN of type U-Net that operates in conjunction with multigrid ingredients. Two types of preconditioners are proposed: (1) U-Net as a coarse grid solver and (2) U-Net as a deflation operator with shifted Laplacian V-cycles. Following our training scheme and data-augmentation, our CNN preconditioner can generalize over residuals and a relatively general set of wave slowness models. On top of that, we also offer an encoder-solver framework where an “encoder&quot; network generalizes over the medium and sends context vectors to another “solver&quot; network, which generalizes over the right-hand sides. We show that this option is more robust and efficient than the standalone variant. Last, we also offer a mini-retraining procedure, to improve the solver after the model is known. This option is beneficial when solving multiple right-hand sides, like in inverse problems. We demonstrate the efficiency and generalization abilities of our approach on a variety of two-dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {A new fixed (nonadaptive) recursive scheme for multigrid algorithms is introduced. Governed by a positive parameter $\kappa$ called the cycle counter, this scheme generates a family of multigrid cycles dubbed $\kappa$-cycles. The well-known $V$-cycle, $F$-cycle, and $W$-cycle are shown to be particular members of this rich $\kappa$-cycle family, which satisfies the property that the total number of recursive calls in a single cycle is a polynomial of degree $\kappa$ in the number of levels of the cycle. This broadening of the scope of fixed multigrid cycles is shown to be potentially significant for the solution of some large problems on platforms, such as graphics processing units, where the overhead induced by numerous sequential calls to the coarser levels may be relatively significant. In cases of problems for which the convergence of standard $V$-cycles or $F$-cycles (corresponding to $\kappa=1$ and $\kappa=2$, respectively) is particularly slow and yet the cost of $W$-cycles is very high due to the large number of coarse level calls (which is exponential in the number of levels), intermediate values of $\kappa$ may prove to yield significantly faster run-times. This is demonstrated in examples where $\kappa$-cycles are used for the solution of rotated anisotropic diffusion problems, both as a stand-alone solver and as a preconditioner. Moreover, a simple model is presented for predicting the approximate run-time of the $\kappa$-cycle, which is useful in preselecting an appropriate cycle counter for a given problem on a given platform. Implementing the $\kappa$-cycle requires making just a small change in the classical multigrid cycle.},

Given approximate initial values at each temporal subinterval, the algorithm locates a solution in a fixed number of iterations using a predictor-corrector, stopping once a tolerance is met. This iterative process combines solutions located by inexpensive (coarse resolution) and expensive (fine resolution) numerical integrators. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic parareal algorithm aimed at accelerating the convergence of the deterministic parareal algorithm. Instead of providing the predictor-corrector with a deterministically located set of initial values, the stochastic algorithm samples initial values from dynamically varying probability distributions in each temporal subinterval. All samples are then propagated in parallel using the expensive integrator. The set of sampled initial values yielding the most continuous (smoothest) trajectory across consecutive subintervals are fed into the predictor-corrector, converging in fewer iterations than the deterministic algorithm with a given probability. The performance of the stochastic algorithm, implemented using various probability distributions, is illustrated on low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We provide numerical evidence that when the number of sampled initial values is large enough, stochastic parareal converges almost certainly in fewer iterations than the deterministic algorithm, maintaining solution accuracy. Given its stochastic nature, we also highlight that multiple simulations of stochastic parareal return a distribution of solutions that can represent a measure of uncertainty over the ODE solution.},

The equations of poroelasticity offer significant challenges in both areas, due to the potentially strong coupling between unknowns in the system, saddle-point structure, and the need to account for wide ranges of parameter values, including limiting behavior such as incompressible elasticity. This paper was motivated by an attempt to develop monolithic multigrid preconditioners for the discretization developed in [C. Rodrigo et al., Comput. Methods App. Mech. Engrg, 341 (2018), pp. 467--484]; we show here why this is a difficult task and, as a result, we modify the discretization in [Rodrigo et al.] through the use of a reduced-quadrature approximation, yielding a more “solver-friendly” discretization. Local Fourier analysis is used to optimize parameters in the resulting monolithic multigrid method, allowing a fair comparison between the performance and costs of methods based on Vanka and Braess--Sarazin relaxation. Numerical results are presented to validate the local Fourier analysis predictions and demonstrate efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, a comparison to existing block-factorization preconditioners is also given.},

  abstract     = {Highly heterogeneous, anisotropic coefficients, e.g., in the simulation of carbon-Fiber composite components, can lead to extremely challenging finite element systems. Direct solvers for the resulting large and sparse linear systems suffer from severe memory requirements and limited parallel scalability, while iterative solvers in general lack robustness. Two-level spectral domain decomposition methods can provide such robustness for symmetric positive definite linear systems by using coarse spaces based on independent generalized eigenproblems in the subdomains. Rigorous condition number bounds are independent of mesh size, number of subdomains, and coefficient contrast. However, their parallel scalability is still limited by the fact that (in order to guarantee robustness) the coarse problem is solved via a direct method. In this paper, we introduce a multilevel variant in the context of subspace correction methods and provide a general convergence theory for its robust convergence for abstract, elliptic variational problems. Assumptions of the theory are verified for conforming as well as for discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to a scalar diffusion problem. Numerical results illustrate the performance of the method for two- and three-dimensional problems and for various discretization schemes, in the context of scalar diffusion and linear elasticity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The nonequidistant fast Fourier transform (NFFT) is an extension of the famous fast Fourier transform (FFT) that can be applied to nonequidistantly sampled data in time/space or frequency domain. It is an approximative algorithm that allows one to control the approximation error in such a way that machine precision is reached while keeping the algorithmic complexity in the same order as a regular FFT. The NFFT plays a major role in many signal processing applications and has been intensively studied from a theoretical and computational perspective. The fastest CPU implementations of the NFFT are implemented in the low-level programming languages C and C++ and require a compromise between code generalizability, code readability, and code efficiency. The programming language Julia promises new opportunities in optimizing these three conflicting goals. In this work we show that Julia indeed allows one to develop an NFFT implementation which is completely generic and dimension-agnostic and requires about two to three times less code than the other famous libraries NFFT3 and FINUFFT while still being one of the fastest NFFT implementations developed to date.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a new sparse matrix format which captures the matrix structure typical for discretized partial differential equations with piecewise-constant coefficients. The format uses a stencil representation for some blocks of matrix rows, typically corresponding to regions with constant coefficients, whereas other rows are encoded in the general compressed sparse row format. The stencil representation saves memory and is suitable for SIMD-like parallelism as available on GPUs. Further, this format is well suited for the implementation of algebraic multigrid methods, and we present a proof-of-concept GPU-accelerated aggregation-based algebraic multigrid solver based on this format. This solver is compared on a few model problems (2-dimension and 3-dimension Poisson-like) with the compressed sparse row–based solver AmgX from NVIDIA and with the CUDA version of the BoomerAMG solver. For the considered tested problems with one million unknowns or more, the presented solver outperforms AmgX and BoomerAMG in terms of both run time and memory usage, and the performance gap increases with the system size.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. With the commercial availability of mixed precision hardware, mixed precision GMRES-based iterative refinement schemes have emerged as popular approaches for solving sparse linear systems. Existing analyses of these approaches, however, are based on using full LU factorizations to construct preconditioners for use within GMRES in each refinement step. In practical applications, inexact preconditioning techniques, such as incomplete LU or sparse approximate inverses, are often used for performance reasons. In this work, we investigate the use of sparse approximate inverse preconditioners based on Frobenius norm minimization within GMRES-based iterative refinement. We analyze the computation of sparse approximate inverses in finite precision and derive constraints under which user-specified stopping criteria will be satisfied. We then analyze the behavior of and convergence constraints for a five-precision GMRES-based iterative refinement scheme that uses sparse approximate inverse preconditioning, which we call SPAI-GMRES-IR. Our numerical experiments confirm the theoretical analysis and illustrate the resulting tradeoffs between preconditioner sparsity and GMRES-IR convergence rate.},

The eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of (a batch of) Hermitian matrices of order two has a role in many numerical algorithms, of which the one-sided Jacobi method for the singular value decomposition (SVD) is the prime example. In this paper the batched EVD is vectorized with a vector-friendly data layout and the AVX-512 SIMD instructions of Intel CPUs, alongside other key components of a real and a complex OpenMP-parallel Jacobi-type SVD method, inspired by the sequential xGESVJ routines from LAPACK. These vectorized building blocks should be portable to other platforms that support similar vector operations. Unconditional numerical reproducibility is guaranteed for the batched EVD, sequential or threaded, and for the column transformations, which are, like the scaled dot-products, presently sequential but can be threaded if nested parallelism is desired. No avoidable overflow of the results can occur with the proposed EVD or the whole SVD. The measured accuracy of the proposed EVD often surpasses that of the xLAEV2 routines from LAPACK. While the batched EVD outperforms the matching sequence of xLAEV2 calls, speedup of the parallel SVD is modest but can be improved and is already beneficial with enough threads. Regardless of their number, the proposed SVD method gives identical results but of a somewhat lower accuracy than xGESVJ.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The application motivating this work is related to the identification of deposits inside nuclear power plant steam generators using eddy-current probes. We consider a realistic experimental process that relies on the scan of a domain by sweeping along a tube axis a probe made out of coils, playing the role of the sources/receivers. Solving the inverse shape problem associated with these measurements using a least squares method requires solutions to the eddy-current and the adjoint problems for a large number of right-hand sides at each gradient-descent iteration. Additional cost in the forward solver comes from the use of a potential formulation of the problem that has the advantage of being independent from the topology of the conductive media (that may vary during iterations). We use a level-set approach to avoid remeshing and handle unknown topologies. The crucial ingredient in our algorithm is an optimized way of handling high numbers of right-hand sides for iterative solvers of large-scale problems. We first benchmark various block Krylov methods, block GMRES, and block BGCRODR to test their effectiveness compared to their standard counterpart, i.e., GMRES and GCRODR. Then we propose for BGCRODR a new implementation for recycling information from previously generated Krylov bases that scales better than traditional approaches. This part is independent from the practical inverse problem at hand. The efficiency of the overall inversion procedure is finally demonstrated on realistic synthetic 3D examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In many large-scale inverse problems, such as computed tomography and image deblurring, characterization of sharp edges in the solution is desired. Within the Bayesian approach to inverse problems, edge-preservation is often achieved using Markov random field priors based on heavy-tailed distributions. Another strategy, popular in sparse statistical modeling, is the application of hierarchical shrinkage priors. An advantage of this formulation lies in expressing the prior as a conditionally Gaussian distribution depending on global and local hyperparameters which are endowed with heavy-tailed hyperpriors. In this work, we revisit the shrinkage horseshoe prior and introduce its formulation for edge-preserving settings. We discuss a Gibbs sampling framework to solve the resulting hierarchical formulation of the Bayesian inverse problem. In particular, one of the conditional distributions is high-dimensional Gaussian, and the rest are derived in closed form by using a scale mixture representation of the heavy-tailed hyperpriors. Applications from imaging science show that our computational procedure is able to compute sharp edge-preserving posterior point estimates with reduced uncertainty.},

This method inherits the spirit of stochastic gradient descent methods for solving high-dimensional optimization problems. The proposed idea is general in the sense that it does not rely on the use of frozen Gaussian approximation, and one can replace it with any other efficient wave propagation solver, e.g., Gaussian beam methods and spectral element methods. We prove the convergence of the random batch method in the mean-square sense and show the numerical performance of the proposed method by two- and three-dimensional examples of wave-equation-based travel-time inversion and full-waveform inversion, respectively.

The hierarchical structure of the ROM basis and the VMS framework enable a natural separation of the resolved and unresolved ROM spatial scales. Modern PGML algorithms are used to construct novel models for the interaction among the resolved and unresolved ROM scales. Specifically, the new framework builds ROM operators that are closest to the true interaction terms in the VMS framework. Finally, machine learning is used to reduce the projection error and further increase the ROM accuracy. Our numerical experiments for a two-dimensional vorticity transport problem show that the novel PGML-VMS-ROM paradigm maintains the low computational cost of current ROMs while significantly increasing the ROM accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The two-phase ferrohydrodynamics model consisting of Cahn–Hilliard equations, Navier–Stokes equations, magnetization equations, and magnetostatic equations is a highly nonlinear, coupled, and saddle point structural multiphysics PDE system. While various works exist to develop fully decoupled, linear, second-order in time, and unconditionally energy stable methods for simpler gradient flow models, existing ideas may not be applicable to this complex model or may be only applicable to part of this model. Therefore, significant challenges remain in developing corresponding efficient fully discrete numerical algorithms with the four above-mentioned desired properties, which will be addressed in this paper by dynamically incorporating several key ideas, including a reformulated weak formulation with special test functions for overcoming two major difficulties caused by the magnetostatic equation, the decoupling technique based on the “zero-energy-contribution” property to handle the coupled nonlinear terms, the second-order projection method for the Navier–Stokes equations, and the invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) method for the time marching. Among all these ideas, the reformulated weak formulation serves as a key bridge between the existing techniques and the challenges of the target model, with all of the four desired properties kept in mind. We demonstrate the well-posedness of the proposed scheme and rigorously show that the scheme is unconditionally energy stable. Extensive numerical simulations, including accuracy/stability tests, and several 2D/3D benchmark Rosensweig instability problems for “spiking” phenomena of ferrofluids are performed to verify the effectiveness of the scheme.},

Provided the scheme is discretely conservative and satisfies discrete geometric conservation laws, we derive a condition on the time step to guarantee that the cell-averaged approximate solution is a convex combination of states that are contained in all the invariant domains of the conservation laws. This condition is based on the existence of a pseudo-equilibrium solution that satisfies a balance of the numerical fluxes at the faces of each element. For application purposes, we use these positive states to define local bounds which are then imposed to the high-order approximate solution within the cells via existing linear scaling limiters. The scheme is invariant domain preserving after the limiting procedure. Numerical experiments are presented with modal and nodal discontinuous Galerkin schemes and confirm the robustness and stability enhancement of the present approach.},

In the setting of parametric dynamical systems appearing in many prominent applications, the underlying (transfer) function to be modeled is a multivariate function. With this in mind, we develop the AAA framework for approximating multivariate functions where the approximant is constructed in the multivariate barycentric form. The method is data driven, in the sense that it does not require access to the full state-space model and requires only function evaluations. We discuss an extension to the case of matrix-valued functions, i.e., multi-input/multi-output dynamical systems, and provide a connection to the tangential interpolation theory. Several numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a component-based (CB) parametric model order reduction (pMOR) formulation for parameterized nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. CB-pMOR is designed to deal with large-scale problems for which full-order solves are not affordable in a reasonable time frame or parameters’ variations induce topology changes that prevent the application of monolithic pMOR techniques. We rely on the partition-of-unity method to devise global approximation spaces from local reduced spaces, and on Galerkin projection to compute the global state estimate. We propose a randomized data compression algorithm based on oversampling for the construction of the components’ reduced spaces: the approach exploits random boundary conditions of controlled smoothness on the oversampling boundary. We further propose an adaptive residual-based enrichment algorithm that exploits global reduced-order solves on representative systems to update the local reduced spaces. We prove exponential convergence of the enrichment procedure for linear coercive problems; we further present numerical results for a two-dimensional nonlinear diffusion problem to illustrate the many features of our methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness.},

The name “Friedrichs learning” is to highlight the close relation between our learning strategy and Friedrichs theory on symmetric systems of PDEs. The weak solution and the test function in the weak formulation are parameterized as deep neural networks in a mesh-free manner, which are alternately updated to approach the optimal solution networks approximating the weak solution and the optimal test function, respectively. Extensive numerical results indicate that our mesh-free Friedrichs learning method can provide reasonably good solutions for a wide range of PDEs defined on regular and irregular domains, where conventional numerical methods such as finite difference methods and finite element methods may be tedious or difficult to be applied, especially for those with discontinuous solutions in high-dimensional problems.},

This type of optimal transport problem arises in quantum physics and plays an important role in understanding the strongly correlated quantum systems. With a Monge-like ansatz, we transfer the original high-dimensional problems into mathematical programmings with generalized complementarity constraints, and thus the curse of dimensionality is surmounted. However, the latter ones are themselves hard to deal with from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Moreover, in the presence of nonconvexity, brute-force searching for global solutions becomes prohibitive as the problem size grows large. To this end, we propose a global optimization approach for solving the nonconvex optimization problems, by exploiting an efficient proximal block coordinate descent local solver and an initialization subroutine based on hierarchical grid refinements. We conduct numerical simulations on some typical physical systems to show the efficiency of our approach. The results match well with both theoretical predictions and physical intuitions and provide indications for Monge solutions in two-dimensional contexts. In addition, we give the first visualization of approximate optimal transport maps for some two-dimensional systems.},

This paper presents a new spectral coarse space that can be constructed in a fully algebraic way unlike most existing spectral coarse spaces. We present theoretical convergence results for Hermitian positive definite diagonally dominant matrices. Numerical experiments and comparison against state-of-the-art preconditioners in the multigrid community show that the resulting two-level Schwarz preconditioner is efficient especially for non-self-adjoint operators.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Due to the curse of dimensionality and the limitation on training data, approximating high-dimensional functions is a very challenging task even for powerful deep neural networks. Inspired by the Nonlinear Level-set Learning (NLL) method, which uses the reversible residual network (RevNet), in this paper, we propose a new method of Dimension Reduction via Learning Level Sets (DRiLLS) for function approximation. Our method contains two major components: one is the pseudoreversible neural network (PRNN) module, which effectively transforms high-dimensional input variables to low-dimensional active variables, and the other is the synthesized regression module for approximating function values based on the transformed data in the low-dimensional space. The PRNN not only relaxes the invertibility constraint of the nonlinear transformation present in the NLL method due to the use of RevNet but also adaptively weights the influence of each sample and controls the sensitivity of the function to the learned active variables. The synthesized regression uses Euclidean distance in the input space to select neighboring samples whose projections on the space of active variables are used to perform local least-squares polynomial fitting. This helps to resolve numerical oscillation issues present in traditional local and global regressions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DRiLLS method outperforms both the NLL and active subspace methods, especially when the target function possesses critical points in the interior of its input domain.},

This relation requires only knowledge of certain recurrence matrices, and allows simple and stable evaluation of multivariate orthogonal polynomials. In the univariate case, various algorithms can stably and accurately evaluate the recurrence coefficients given the ability to compute polynomial moments, but it is difficult to identify analogous procedures in multiple dimensions. We present a new Multivariate Stieltjes (MS) algorithm that fills this gap in the multivariate case, allowing computation of recurrence matrices assuming moments are available. The algorithm is essentially explicit in two and three dimensions, but requires the numerical solution to a nonconvex problem in more than three dimensions. Compared to direct Gram–Schmidt-type orthogonalization, we demonstrate on several examples in up to three dimensions that the MS algorithm is far more stable, and allows accurate computation of orthogonal bases in the multivariate setting, in contrast to direct orthogonalization approaches.},

The resulting scheme is monotone and fits immediately into existing convergence proofs for the Monge–Ampère equation with either Dirichlet or optimal transport boundary conditions. The use of higher-order quadrature schemes allows for substantial reduction in the component of the error that depends on the angular resolution of the finite difference stencil. This, in turn, allows for significant improvements in both stencil width and formal truncation error. The resulting schemes can achieve a formal accuracy that is arbitrarily close to , which is the optimal consistency order for monotone approximations of second-order operators. We present three different implementations of this method. The first two exploit the spectral accuracy of the trapezoid rule on uniform angular discretizations to allow for computation on a nearest-neighbors finite difference stencil over a large range of grid refinements. The third uses higher-order quadrature to produce superlinear convergence while simultaneously utilizing narrower stencils than other monotone methods. Computational results are presented in two dimensions for problems of various regularity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We target time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) with heterogeneous coefficients in space and time. To tackle these problems, we construct reduced basis/multiscale ansatz functions defined in space that can be combined with time stepping schemes within model order reduction or multiscale methods. To that end, we propose to perform several simulations of the PDE for a few time steps in parallel starting at different, randomly drawn start points, prescribing random initial conditions; applying a singular value decomposition to a subset of the so obtained snapshots yields the reduced basis/multiscale ansatz functions. This facilitates constructing the reduced basis/multiscale ansatz functions in an embarrassingly parallel manner. In detail, we suggest using a data-dependent probability distribution based on the data functions of the PDE to select the start points. Each local in time simulation of the PDE with random initial conditions approximates a local approximation space in one time point that is optimal in the sense of Kolmogorov. The derivation of these optimal local approximation spaces which are spanned by the left singular vectors of a compact transfer operator that maps arbitrary initial conditions to the solution of the PDE in a later point of time is one other main contribution of this paper. By solving the PDE locally in time with random initial conditions, we construct local ansatz spaces in time that converge provably at a quasi-optimal rate and allow for local error control. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform existing methods like the proper orthogonal decomposition even in a sequential setting and is well capable of approximating advection-dominated problems.},

To allow for a certification of the model hierarchy, as well as to control the adaptation process, we employ rigorous a posteriori error estimates for the ROM and ML models. In particular, we provide an example of an ML-based model that allows for rigorous analytical quality statements. We demonstrate the efficiency of the modeling chain on a Monte Carlo and a parameter-optimization example.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The block Cimmino is a parallel hybrid row-block projection iterative method successfully used for solving general sparse linear systems. However, the convergence of the method degrades when angles between subspaces spanned by the row-blocks are far from being orthogonal. The density of columns as well as the numerical values of their nonzeros are more likely to contribute to the nonorthogonality between row-blocks. We propose a novel scheme to handle such “dense” columns. The proposed scheme forms a reduced system by separating these columns and the respective rows from the original coefficient matrix and handling them via the Schur complement. Then the angles between subspaces spanned by the row-blocks of the reduced system are expected to be closer to orthogonal, and the reduced system is solved efficiently by the block conjugate gradient (CG) accelerated block Cimmino in fewer iterations. We also propose a novel metric for selecting “dense” columns considering the numerical values. The proposed metric establishes an upper bound on the sum of inner products between row-blocks. Then we propose an efficient algorithm for computing the proposed metric for the columns. Extensive numerical experiments for a wide range of linear systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by achieving fewer iterations and faster parallel solution time compared to the classical CG accelerated block Cimmino algorithm.},

A special focus is placed on the scalability of the proposed methods for large scale parallel computers via the application of multigrid solvers. The preservation of mesh quality under large deformations, where shape singularities have to be smoothed or generated within the optimization process, is also discussed. It is shown that the interaction of hierarchically refined grids and shape optimization can be realized by the choice of appropriate descent directions.

The aim of this paper is to construct the finite difference/spectral method for the Klein–Gordon–Schrödinger (KGS) system on infinite domains ( , and 3) to conserve three kinds of the most important invariants, namely, the mass, the energy, and the momentum. Regarding the mass- and momentum-conservation laws as globally physical constraints, we elaborately combine the exponential scalar auxiliary variable (ESAV) approach and Lagrange multiplier approach to construct the ESAV/Lagrange multiplier reformulation of the KGS system to preserve its original energy-conservation law. When solving the ESAV/Lagrange multiplier reformulation, we employ the Hermite–Galerkin spectral method for the spatial approximation and apply the Crank–Nicolson scheme for the temporal discretization. At each time level, we only need to solve linearly algebraic systems with constant coefficients and a set of quadratic algebraic equations which can be efficiently solved by Newton iteration. We establish the conservation properties of the proposed method at the fullydiscrete level, which indicates that our scheme can preserve conserved quantities including mass, energy, and momentums of the KGS system. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and conservation properties of the proposed scheme. As the applications of our scheme, we simulate the nonlinear interactions of vector solitons for KGS system in 2 dimensional/3 dimensional cases.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, a strongly mass conservative and stabilizer-free scheme is designed and analyzed for the coupled Brinkman–Darcy flow and transport. The flow equations are discretized by using a strongly mass conservative scheme in mixed formulation with a suitable incorporation of the interface conditions. In particular, the interface conditions can be incorporated into the discrete formulation naturally without introducing additional variables. Moreover, the proposed scheme behaves uniformly robust for various values of viscosity. A novel upwinding staggered discontinuous Galerkin scheme in mixed form is exploited to solve the transport equation, where the boundary correction terms are added to improve the stability. A rigorous convergence analysis is carried out for the approximation of the flow equations. The velocity error is shown to be independent of the pressure and thus confirms the pressure-robustness. Stability and a priori error estimates are also obtained for the approximation of the transport equation; moreover, we are able to achieve sharp stability and convergence error estimates thanks to the strong mass conservation preserved by our scheme. In particular, the stability estimate depends only on the true velocity on the inflow boundary rather than on the approximated velocity. Several numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical findings and demonstrate the performances of the method.},

In this paper, we propose new geometrically unfitted space-time finite element methods for partial differential equations posed on moving domains of higher order accuracy in space and time. As a model problem, the convection-diffusion problem on a moving domain is studied. For geometrically higher order accuracy, we apply a parametric mapping on a background space-time tensor-product mesh. Concerning discretization in time, we consider discontinuous Galerkin, as well as related continuous (Petrov–)Galerkin and Galerkin collocation methods. For stabilization with respect to bad cut configurations and as an extension mechanism that is required for the latter two schemes, a ghost penalty stabilization is employed. The article puts an emphasis on the techniques that allow us to achieve a robust but higher order geometry handling for smooth domains. We investigate the computational properties of the respective methods in a series of numerical experiments. These include studies in different dimensions for different polynomial degrees in space and time, validating the higher order accuracy in both variables.},

We introduce a new micro-macro Markov chain Monte Carlo method to sample invariant distributions of molecular dynamics systems that exhibit a time-scale separation between the microscopic (fast) dynamics, and the macroscopic (slow) dynamics of some low-dimensional set of reaction coordinates. The algorithm enhances exploration of the state space in the presence of metastability by allowing larger proposed moves at the macroscopic level, on which a conditional accept-reject procedure is applied. Only when the macroscopic proposal is accepted, is the full microscopic state reconstructed from the newly sampled reaction coordinate value and is subjected to a second accept/reject procedure. The computational gain stems from the fact that most proposals are rejected at the macroscopic level, at low computational cost, while microscopic states, once reconstructed, are almost always accepted. We analytically show convergence and discuss the rate of convergence of the proposed algorithm, and numerically illustrate its efficiency on two standard molecular test cases.},

In general, our process generates orthogonal updates to the approximate solution . By choosing the sketch to be the set of all previous residuals, we obtain a simple recursive update and convergence in at most iterations (in exact arithmetic). By choosing a sequence of identity columns for the sketch, we develop a generalization of the Kaczmarz method.

We develop a data-driven approach for analyzing the underlying dynamics from snapshots, which is called the higher order extended dynamic mode decomposition (HOEDMD) in this paper. The HOEDMD method, generalizing the extended dynamic mode decomposition, can handle the case when the spectral complexity of the dynamical system exceeds its spatial complexity. Moreover, the proposed method is capable of analyzing the snapshots taken from multiple trajectories by a mode-frequency-individual decomposition. We also introduce the structured total least squares technique for denoising and debiasing purposes and discuss efficient implementation details. The ability of our proposed method to accurately retrieve the modes with frequencies in linear dynamical systems is proved, which further provides an empirical choice for an optimal order. Finally, we evaluate the proposed structured total least squares based HOEDMD algorithm and apply it to four kinds of dynamical systems: a synthetic linear system to show that the proposed algorithm is less sensitive to the noises; a nonlinear dynamical system of iterates from a multilinear PageRank model to illustrate the necessity of introducing higher order cases; real-world signals for time series classification to indicate individual coefficients could parameterize trajectories and kernel tricks can be employed to enhance its performance on nonlinear real-world systems; and a real-world dynamical system of fMRI data to show the proposed algorithm retrieves modes more stably over several other dynamic mode decomposition variants.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multirate methods have been used for decades to temporally evolve initial-value problems in which different components evolve on distinct time scales, and thus use of different step sizes for these components can result in increased computational efficiency. Generally, such methods select these different step sizes based on experimentation or stability considerations. For problems that evolve on a single time scale, adaptivity approaches that strive to control local temporal error are widely used to achieve numerical results of a desired accuracy with minimal computational effort, while alleviating the need for manual experimentation with different time step sizes. However, there is a notable gap in the publication record on the development of adaptive time step controllers for multirate methods. In this paper, we extend the single-rate controller work of Gustafsson [ACM Trans. Math. Software, 20 (1994), pp. 496–517] to the multirate method setting. Specifically, we develop controllers based on polynomial approximations to the principal error functions for both the “fast” and “slow” time scales within multirate infinitesimal (MRI) methods. We additionally investigate a variety of approaches for estimating the errors arising from each time scale within MRI methods. We then numerically evaluate the proposed multirate controllers and error estimation strategies on a range of multirate test problems, comparing their performance against an estimated optimal performance. Through this work, we combine the most performant of these approaches to arrive at a set of multirate adaptive time step controllers that robustly achieve desired solution accuracy with minimal computational effort.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Robust controllers that stabilize dynamical systems even under disturbances and noise are often formulated as solutions of nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization problems. While methods such as gradient sampling can handle the nonconvexity and nonsmoothness, the costs of evaluating the objective function may be substantial, making robust control challenging for dynamical systems with high-dimensional state spaces. In this work, we introduce multifidelity variants of gradient sampling that leverage low-cost, low-fidelity models with low-dimensional state spaces for speeding up the optimization process while nonetheless providing convergence guarantees for a high-fidelity model of the system of interest, which is primarily accessed in the last phase of the optimization process. Our first multifidelity method initiates gradient sampling on higher-fidelity models with starting points obtained from cheaper, lower-fidelity models. Our second multifidelity method relies on ensembles of gradients that are computed from low- and high-fidelity models. Numerical experiments with controlling the cooling of a steel rail profile and laminar flow in a cylinder wake demonstrate that our new multifidelity gradient sampling methods achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup compared to the single-fidelity gradient sampling method that relies on the high-fidelity model alone.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Whether due to the sheer size of a computational domain, the fine resolution required, or the multiples scales and stochasticity of the dynamics, the dimensionality of a system must often be reduced so that problems of interest become computationally tractable. In this paper, we develop retractions for time-integration schemes that efficiently and accurately evolve the dynamics of a system’s low-rank approximation. Through differential geometry, we analyze the error incurred at each time-step due to the high-order curvature of the manifold of fixed-rank matrices. We first obtain a novel, explicit, computationally inexpensive set of algorithms that we refer to as perturbative retractions and show that the set converges to an ideal retraction that projects optimally and exactly to the manifold of fixed-rank matrices by reducing what we define as the projection-retraction error. Furthermore, each perturbative retraction itself exhibits high-order convergence to the best low-rank approximation of the full-rank solution. Using perturbative retractions, we then develop a new class of integration techniques that we refer to as dynamically orthogonal Runge–Kutta (DORK) schemes. DORK schemes integrate along the nonlinear manifold, updating the subspace upon which we project the system’s dynamics as it is integrated. Through numerical test cases, we demonstrate our schemes for matrix addition, real-time data compression, and deterministic and stochastic partial differential equations. We find that DORK schemes are highly accurate by incorporating knowledge of the dynamic, nonlinear manifold’s high-order curvature, and they are computationally efficient by limiting the growing rank needed to represent the evolving dynamics.},

Nonlinearly preconditioned inexact Newton methods have been applied successfully for some difficult nonlinear systems of algebraic equations arising from the discretization of partial differential equations. The preconditioning step involves identifying and balancing the nonlinearities in the system. One of the challenging tasks when applying the methods is to accurately and efficiently identify the unbalanced nonlinearities. In this work, we propose an unsupervised learning strategy based on the classical principal component analysis that learns the bad behavior of a Newton solver in the nonlinear residual subspace of a training problem. A new initial guess is produced by the nonlinear preconditioner where a projected low dimensional Jacobian system corresponding to the slow subspace of the current residuals is solved for the Newton correction vector. Numerical experiments for high Reynolds number incompressible flow problems show that the proposed method is more robust and efficient compared with existing nonlinear solvers.},

Our asymptotic analysis leads to closed form optimized transmission conditions for many subdomains, and shows that the asymptotic best choice in the mesh size only differs from the two subdomain best choice in the constants, for which we derive the dependence on the number of subdomains explicitly, including the limiting case of an infinite number of subdomains, leading to new insight into scalability. Our results include both Robin and Ventcell transmission conditions, and we also optimize for the first time a two-sided Ventcell condition.

A suboptimal, but nonetheless reliable and convenient, implementation of the strategy involves approximation of the decoupled PDE problems with a common finite element approximation space. Computational results obtained using such a single-level strategy are presented in Part I of this work [A. Bespalov, D. Silvester, and F. Xu, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 44 (2022), pp. A3393–A3412].

  abstract     = {Abstract. The main two algorithms for computing the numerical radius are the level-set method of Mengi and Overton and the cutting-plane method of Uhlig. Via new analyses, we explain why the cutting-plane approach is sometimes much faster or much slower than the level-set one and then propose a new hybrid algorithm that remains efficient in all cases. For matrices whose fields of values are a circular disk centered at the origin, we show that the cost of Uhlig’s method blows up with respect to the desired relative accuracy. More generally, we also analyze the local behavior of Uhlig’s cutting procedure at outermost points in the field of values, showing that it often has a fast Q-linear rate of convergence and is Q-superlinear at corners. Finally, we identify and address inefficiencies in both the level-set and cutting-plane approaches and propose refined versions of these techniques.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider an incomplete Cholesky factorization preconditioner for the iterative solution of large sparse symmetric positive definite (SPD) systems of linear equations. The preconditioner exploits the numerical rank deficiency of some off-diagonal blocks of the Cholesky factor. As a distinctive feature, the approximations performed during the factorization procedure are orthogonal, and therefore the preconditioner falls within the framework introduced in [A. Napov, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 34 (2013), pp. 1148–1173]. This implies that the incomplete factorization procedure is breakdown-free, and that the resulting preconditioner is SPD. The aforementioned reference also gives some upper bounds on the spectral condition number of the preconditioned system based on the accuracy of individual approximations. The most accurate among these bounds is extended here to the considered preconditioner. On the practical side, we present and study an implementation of the preconditioner. It exploits the block sparsity structure as induced by nested dissection block partitioning, and identifies blocks with low numerical rank based on the sparsity pattern of the system matrix. The performance is assessed based on model PDE discretizations and, further, based on linear systems whose matrices correspond to large enough SPD matrices from the SuiteSparse matrix collection. The reported results are compared with those of some other solvers, including the SPD version of ILUPACK solver.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When an iterative method is applied to solve the linear equation system in interior point methods (IPMs), the attention is usually placed on accelerating their convergence by designing appropriate preconditioners, but the linear solver is applied as a black box with a standard termination criterion which asks for a sufficient reduction of the residual in the linear system. Such an approach often leads to an unnecessary “oversolving” of linear equations. In this paper, an IPM that relies on an inner termination criterion not based on the residual of the linear system is introduced and analyzed. Moreover, new indicators for the early termination of the inner iterations are derived from a deep understanding of IPM needs. The new technique has been adapted to the conjugate gradient (CG) and to the minimum residual method (MINRES) applied in the IPM context. The new criterion has been tested on a set of quadratic optimization problems including compressed sensing, image processing, and instances with partial differential equation constraints, and it has been compared to standard residual tests with variable tolerance. Evidence gathered from these computational experiments shows that the new technique delivers significant improvements in terms of inner (linear) iterations and those translate into significant savings of the IPM solution time.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we present a unified framework for constructing spectrally equivalent low-order-refined discretizations for the high-order finite element de Rham complex. This theory covers diffusion problems in , and and is based on combining a low-order discretization posed on a refined mesh with a high-order basis for Nédélec and Raviart–Thomas elements that makes use of the concept of polynomial histopolation (polynomial fitting using prescribed mean values over certain regions). This spectral equivalence, coupled with algebraic multigrid methods constructed using the low-order discretization, results in highly scalable matrix-free preconditioners for high-order finite element problems in the full de Rham complex. Additionally, a new lowest-order (piecewise constant) preconditioner is developed for high-order interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations, for which spectral equivalence results and convergence proofs for algebraic multigrid methods are provided. In all cases, the spectral equivalence results are independent of polynomial degree and mesh size; for DG methods, they are also independent of the penalty parameter. These new solvers are flexible and easy to use; any “black-box” preconditioner for low-order problems can be used to create an effective and efficient preconditioner for the corresponding high-order problem. A number of numerical experiments are presented, based on an implementation in the finite element library MFEM. A range of challenging three-dimensional problems are used to corroborate the theoretical properties and demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper new innovative fourth order compact schemes for Robin and Neumann boundary conditions have been developed for boundary value problems of elliptic PDEs in two and three dimensions. Different from the traditional finite difference operator approach, which may not work for the flux type of boundary conditions, carefully designed undetermined coefficient methods are utilized in developing high order compact (HOC) schemes. The new methods not only can be utilized to design HOC schemes for flux type boundary conditions but also can be applied to general elliptic PDEs including Poisson, Helmholtz, diffusion-advection, and anisotropic equations with linear boundary conditions. In the newly developed HOC methods, the coefficient matrices are generally M-matrices, which guarantee the discrete maximum principle for well-posed problems, so the convergence of the HOC methods. The developed HOC methods are versatile and can cover most HOC schemes in the literature. The HOC methods for Robin boundary conditions and for anisotropic diffusion and advection equations with Robin or even Dirichlet boundary conditions are likely the first ones that have ever been developed. With the help of pseudoinverse or singular value decomposition, we have also observed that the developed HOC methods usually have smaller error constants compared with traditional HOC methods when applicable. Nontrivial examples with large wave numbers and oscillatory solutions are presented to confirm the performance of the new HOC methods.},

These structured matrices are often constructed in an iterative way, and, for some applications, a basis matrix of the null space is required in every iteration. Consequently, recursively updating a numerical basis matrix of the null space, while exploiting the inherent structure of the matrices involved, induces large savings in the computation time. Moreover, we also develop a sparse adaptation of one of the recursive algorithms that avoids the explicit construction of the block Macaulay matrix and results in a considerable reduction of the required memory. We provide several numerical experiments to illustrate the proposed algorithms: for example, we solve four multiparameter eigenvalue problems via the null space of the block Macaulay matrix and notice that the recursive and sparse approach are, on average, 450 and 1300 times faster than the standard approach, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many problems in science and engineering require an efficient numerical approximation of integrals or solutions to differential equations. For systems with rapidly changing dynamics, an equidistant discretization is often inadvisable as it results in prohibitively large errors or computational effort. To this end, adaptive schemes, such as solvers based on Runge–Kutta pairs, have been developed which adapt the step size based on local error estimations at each step. While the classical schemes apply very generally and are highly efficient on regular systems, they can behave suboptimally when an inefficient step rejection mechanism is triggered by structurally complex systems such as chaotic systems. To overcome these issues, we propose a method to tailor numerical schemes to the problem class at hand. This is achieved by combining simple, classical quadrature rules or ODE solvers with data-driven time-stepping controllers. Compared with learning solution operators to ODEs directly, it generalizes better to unseen initial data as our approach employs classical numerical schemes as base methods. At the same time it can make use of identified structures of a problem class and, therefore, outperforms state-of-the-art adaptive schemes. Several examples demonstrate superior efficiency.

Furthermore, by introducing another space-independent Lagrange multiplier, we construct energy dissipative, in addition to length preserving, schemes for the Landau–Lifshitz equation, at the expense of solving one nonlinear algebraic equation.

The framework is based on parameter optimization, i.e., the elements of the system matrices of the ROM are iteratively varied to minimize an objective functional that measures the difference between the FOM and the ROM. The structural constraints can be encoded in the parametrization of the ROM. The method only depends on frequency response data and can thus be applied to a wide range of dynamical systems.

This work is concerned with a nonintrusive generalization of the adaptive Galerkin finite element method with residual-based error estimation. It combines the nonintrusive character of a randomized least squares method with the a posteriori error analysis of stochastic Galerkin methods. The proposed approach uses the variational Monte Carlo method to obtain a quasi-optimal low-rank approximation of the Galerkin projection in a highly efficient hierarchical tensor format. We derive an adaptive refinement algorithm which is steered by a reliable error estimator. Opposite to stochastic Galerkin methods, the approach is easily applicable to a wide range of problems, enabling a fully automated adjustment of all discretization parameters. Benchmark examples with affine and (unbounded) lognormal coefficient fields illustrate the performance of the nonintrusive adaptive algorithm, showing the expected convergence rates of single-level strategies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Cahn–Hilliard equation was originally proposed to describe the phase separation phenomenon for a binary alloy in the quenching process and now has been widely applied in many other scientific fields. To investigate its solution behavior, one mainly depends on the numerical simulations because of the nonlinearity. However, it would require very small time steps to describe the phase separation procedure since it evolves very quickly in time, which implies that an efficient solver for the spatial problem at each time level is very important. In this paper, we investigate a coupled second order elliptic system of constant coefficients, which occurs in many different unconditionally energy stable time discretization schemes for the Cahn–Hilliard equation. For a min-max problem of convergence factor that is obtained via Fourier analysis in the case of two-subdomain domain decomposition, by using an asymptotic analysis we obtain the optimized transmission parameters in explicit form applied in the Robin and the two-sided Robin transmission conditions for both the overlapping and the nonoverlapping Schwarz domain decomposition algorithms, and we obtain as well the corresponding asymptotic convergence rates. Particularly, we also explore and analyze the many-subdomain cases directly and find that the algorithms are scalable until a certain number of subdomains is reached for small time steps, even if there is no coarse grid correction. We finally use numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the computations of the action ground state for a rotating nonlinear Schrödinger equation. It reads as a minimization of the action functional under the Nehari constraint. In the focusing case, we identify an equivalent formulation of the problem which simplifies the constraint. Based on it, we propose a normalized gradient flow method with asymptotic Lagrange multiplier and establish the energy-decaying property. Popular optimization methods are also applied to gain more efficiency. In the defocusing case, we prove that the ground state can be obtained by the unconstrained minimization. Then the direct gradient flow method and unconstrained optimization methods are applied. Numerical experiments show the convergence and accuracy of the proposed methods in both cases, and comparisons on the efficiency are discussed. Finally, the relation between the action and the energy ground states is numerically investigated.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we present an algebraic dimension-oblivious two-level domain decomposition solver for discretizations of elliptic partial differential equations. The proposed parallel domain decomposition solver is based on a space-filling curve partitioning approach that is applicable to any discretization, i.e., it directly operates on the assembled matrix equations. Moreover, it allows for the effective use of arbitrary processor numbers independent of the dimension of the underlying partial differential equation while maintaining its optimal convergence behavior. This is the core property required to attain a combination technique solver with extreme scalability which can utilize exascale parallel systems efficiently. Moreover, this approach provides a basis for the development of a fault-tolerant solver for the numerical treatment of high-dimensional Problems. To achieve the required data redundancy we are therefore concerned with large overlaps of our domain decomposition, which we construct in any dimension via space-filling curves. In this paper, we propose a space-filling curve based domain decompositoin solver and present its convergence properties and scaling behavior. The results of our numerical experiments clearly show that our approach provides optimal convergence and scaling behavior in an arbitrary dimension utilizing arbitrary processor numbers.},

Initial numerical experiments, using for the density and a discretization by continuous piecewise linear finite elements, showed unsatisfactory convergence properties of state-of-the-art optimization solvers. This motivated the work in this paper, which proposes solutions to these difficulties. We present a theoretically founded new problem formulation based on a space for the density that allows for jumps along hypersurfaces, such as BV or fractional order Sobolev spaces. We extend the existing theory for the generalized Stokes equations and investigate the arising optimization problems concerning existence of solutions, differentiability, and convergence of relaxed solutions toward solutions of the original problem. We motivate a localized fractional order Sobolev norm as an approximation of the -norm for -valued functions and discuss its discretization by piecewise constant finite elements. Building on these theoretical findings, we present some numerical realizations and show computational results.},

The method uses a Poisson disk sampling-type technique for coarsening the point clouds and new meshfree restriction/interpolation operators based on polyharmonic splines for transferring information between the coarsened point clouds. These are then combined with standard smoothing and operator coarsening methods in a V-cycle iteration. MGM is applicable to discretizations of elliptic PDEs based on various localized meshfree methods, including RBF finite differences (RBF-FD) and generalized finite differences (GFD). We test MGM both as a standalone solver and preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods on several test problems using RBF-FD and GFD and numerically analyze convergence rates, efficiency, and scaling with increasing point cloud sizes. We also perform a side-by-side comparison to algebraic multigrid methods for solving the same systems. Finally, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of MGM by applying it to three challenging applications on complicated surfaces: pattern formation, surface harmonics, and geodesic distance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto linear subspaces of the high-dimensional state-space. For problems with slowly decaying Kolmogorov- -widths such as certain transport-dominated problems, however, classical linear-subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) of low dimension might yield inaccurate results. Thus, the concept of classical linear-subspace ROMs has to be extended to more general concepts, like model order teduction (MOR) on manifolds. Moreover, as we are dealing with Hamiltonian systems, it is crucial that the underlying symplectic structure is preserved in the reduced model, as otherwise it could become unphysical in the sense that the energy is not conserved or stability properties are lost. To the best of our knowledge, existing literature addresses either MOR on manifolds or symplectic model reduction for Hamiltonian systems, but not their combination. In this work, we bridge the two aforementioned approaches by providing a novel projection technique called symplectic manifold Galerkin (SMG), which projects the Hamiltonian system onto a nonlinear symplectic trial manifold such that the reduced model is again a Hamiltonian system. We derive analytical results such as stability, energy-preservation, and a rigorous a posteriori error bound. Moreover, we construct a weakly symplectic deep convolutional autoencoder as a computationally practical approach to approximate a nonlinear symplectic trial manifold. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the ability of the method to achieve higher accuracy than (non-)structure-preserving linear-subspace ROMs and non-structure-preserving MOR on manifold techniques.},

However, their cost strongly increases in the high-frequency regime. This paper introduces a new directional FMM for oscillatory kernels (defmm: directional equispaced interpolation-based fmm), whose precomputation and application are FFT-accelerated due to polynomial interpolations on equispaced grids. We demonstrate the consistency of our FFT approach and show how symmetries can be exploited in the Fourier domain. We also describe the algorithmic design of defmm, well-suited for the BIE nonuniform particle distributions, and present performance optimizations on one CPU core. Finally, we exhibit important performance gains on all test cases for defmm over a state-of-the-art FMM library for oscillatory kernels.},

Building on a general block FMA framework, we develop a comprehensive error analysis of multiword matrix multiplication. After confirming the theoretical error bounds experimentally by simulating low precision in software, we use the cuBLAS and CUTLASS libraries to implement a number of matrix multiplication algorithms using double-fp16 (double-binary16) arithmetic. When running the algorithms on NVIDIA V100 and A100 GPUs, we find that double-fp16 is not as accurate as fp32 (binary32) arithmetic despite satisfying the same worst-case error bound. Using probabilistic error analysis, we explain why this issue is likely to be caused by the rounding mode used by the NVIDIA tensor cores, and we propose a parameterized blocked summation algorithm that alleviates the problem and significantly improves the performance-accuracy tradeoff.},

In particular, we consider shapes that minimize the rate of energy dissipation while pumping a prescribed volume of fluid, number of particles, and/or distance traversed by the particles over a set time period. Our approach relies on a recently developed fast and accurate boundary integral solver for simulating multiphase flows through periodic geometries of arbitrary shapes. In order to fully capitalize on the dimensionality reduction feature of the boundary integral methods, shape sensitivities must ideally involve evaluating the physical variables on the particle or pump boundaries only. We show that this can indeed be accomplished owing to the linearity of Stokes flow. The forward problem solves for the particle motion in a slip-driven pipe flow while the adjoint problems in our construction solve quasi-static Dirichlet boundary value problems backwards in time, retracing the particle evolution. The shape sensitivities simply depend on the solution of one forward and one adjoint (for each shape functional) problems. We validate these analytic shape derivative formulas by comparing against finite-difference based gradients and present several examples showcasing optimal pump shapes under various constraints.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) plays an important role in minimizing model uncertainty with limited experimental data in a Bayesian framework. In many applications, rather than minimizing the uncertainty in the inference of model parameters, one seeks to minimize the uncertainty of a model-dependent quantity of interest (QoI). This is known as goal-oriented OED (GOOED). Here, we consider GOOED for linear Bayesian inverse problems governed by large-scale models represented by partial differential equations (PDE) that are computationally expensive to solve. In particular, we consider optimal sensor placement by maximizing an expected information gain (EIG) for the QoI. We develop an efficient method to solve such problems by deriving a new formulation of the goal-oriented EIG. Based on this formulation we propose an offline-online decomposition scheme that achieves significant computational reduction by computing all of the PDE-dependent quantities in an offline stage just once, and optimizing the sensor locations in an online stage without solving any PDEs. Moreover, in the offline stage we need only to compute low-rank approximations of two Hessian-related operators. The computational cost of these low-rank approximations, measured by the number of PDE solves, does not depend on the parameter or data dimensions for a large class of elliptic, parabolic, and sufficiently dissipative hyperbolic inverse problem that exhibit dimension-independent rapid spectra decay. We carry out detailed error analysis for the approximate goal-oriented EIG due to the low-rank approximations of the two operators. Furthermore, in the online stage we extend a swapping greedy method to optimize the sensor locations developed in our recent work that is demonstrated to be more efficient than a standard greedy method. We conduct a numerical experiment for a contaminant transport inverse problem with an infinite-dimensional parameter field to demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and both data- and parameter-dimension independence of the proposed algorithm.},

We show by a numerical example that a direct extension of the classical deep BSDE method to FBSDEs fails for a simple linear-quadratic control problem, and we motivate why the new method works. Under regularity and boundedness assumptions on the exact controls of time continuous and time discrete control problems, we provide an error analysis for our method. We show empirically that the method converges for three different problems, one being the one that failed for a direct extension of the deep BSDE method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many problems arising in computational science and engineering can be described in terms of approximating a smooth function of variables, defined over an unknown domain of interest , from sample data. Here both the underlying dimensionality of the problem (in the case ) as well as the lack of domain knowledge—with potentially irregular and/or disconnected—are confounding factors for sampling-based methods. Naïve approaches for such problems often lead to wasted samples and inefficient approximation schemes. For example, uniform sampling can result in upward of 20\% wasted samples in some problems considered herein. In applications such as surrogate model construction in computational uncertainty quantification, the high cost of computing samples necessitates a more efficient sampling procedure. Over the last several years methods for computing such approximations from sample data have been studied in the case of irregular domains, and the advantages of computing sampling measures depending on an approximation space of have been shown. More specifically, such approaches confer advantages such as stability and well-conditioning, with an asymptotically optimal sample complexity scaling . The recently proposed adaptive sampling for general domains (ASGD) strategy is one such technique to construct these sampling measures. The main contribution of this paper is a procedure to improve upon the ASGD approach by adaptively updating the sampling measure in the case of unknown domains. We achieve this by first introducing a general domain adaptivity strategy, which computes an approximation of the function and domain of interest from the sample points. Second, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy, termed adaptive sampling for unknown domains (ASUD), which generates sampling measures over a domain that may not be known in advance, based on the ideas introduced in the ASGD approach. We then derive (weighted) least squares and augmented least squares techniques for polynomial approximation on unknown domains. We present numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of the adaptive sampling techniques with least squares–based polynomial approximation schemes. Our results show that the ASUD approach consistently achieves errors the same as or smaller than uniform sampling, but using fewer, and often significantly fewer, function evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work presents a method for constructing online-efficient reduced models of large-scale systems governed by parametrized nonlinear scalar conservation laws. The solution manifolds induced by transport-dominated problems such as hyperbolic conservation laws typically exhibit nonlinear structures, which means that traditional model reduction methods based on linear approximations are inefficient when applied to these problems. In contrast, the approach introduced in this work derives reduced approximations that are nonlinear by explicitly composing global transport dynamics with locally linear approximations of the solution manifolds. A time-stepping scheme evolves the nonlinear reduced models by transporting local approximation spaces along the characteristic curves of the governing equations. The proposed computational procedure allows an offline/online decomposition and is online-efficient in the sense that the complexity of accurately time stepping the nonlinear reduced model is independent of that of the full model. Numerical experiments with transport through heterogeneous media and the Burgers equation show orders of magnitude speedups of the proposed nonlinear reduced models based on transported subspaces compared to traditional linear reduced models and full models.},

The method applies to all subdivisions of Jacobi polynomials (e.g., Chebyshev and Legendre), utilizes well-known recurrence relations of orthogonal polynomials, and leads to almost exactly the same discretized system of equations as the integration preconditioners [E. A. Coutsias, T. Hagstrom, and D. Torres, Math. Comp., 65 (1996), pp. 611–635] if this method was redesigned to make use of trial functions that satisfy a given problem’s boundary conditions. A link between the new Petrov–Galerkin method and IP is revealed through a new recursion relation for Jacobi polynomials. Because of the strictly banded nature of all coefficient matrices, the new method extends easily and efficiently to multiple dimensions though the use of tensor product methods.},

In particular we focus on the interaction between linear and nonlinear stabilizations. First we show that the combination of linear and nonlinear stabilization can be designed to be invariant preserving. Then we show that such a combined method allows for the classical error estimates for smooth solutions of space semidiscretized formulations of the linear transport equation. Based on these ideas we propose a Runge–Kutta finite element method for the compressible Euler equations using entropy viscosity to ensure stability at shocks and gradient jump penalty to prevent propagation of high frequency content into the smooth part of the solution. In a numerical example we show that the method predicts the shock structure accurately, without high frequency pollution of the smooth parts.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The tensor-train (TT) format is a highly compact low-rank representation for high-dimensional tensors. TT is particularly useful when representing approximations to the solutions of certain types of parametrized partial differential equations. For many of these problems, computing the solution explicitly would require an infeasible amount of memory and computational time. While the TT format makes these problems tractable, iterative techniques for solving the PDEs must be adapted to perform arithmetic while maintaining the implicit structure. The fundamental operation used to maintain feasible memory and computational time is called rounding, which truncates the internal ranks of a tensor already in TT format. We propose several randomized algorithms for this task that are generalizations of randomized low-rank matrix approximation algorithms and provide significant reduction in computation compared to deterministic TT-rounding algorithms. Randomization is particularly effective in the case of rounding a sum of TT-tensors (where we observe speedup), which is the bottleneck computation in the adaptation of GMRES to vectors in TT format. We present the randomized algorithms and compare their empirical accuracy and computational time with deterministic alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nonlinear advection-diffusion equations often arise in the modeling of transport processes. We propose for these equations a non-overlapping domain decomposition algorithm of Schwarz waveform-relaxation (SWR) type. It relies on nonlinear zeroth-order (or Robin) transmission conditions between the sub-domains that ensure the continuity of the converged solution and of its normal flux across the interface. We prove existence of unique iterative solutions and the convergence of the algorithm. We then present a numerical discretization for solving the SWR problems using a forward Euler discretization in time and a finite volume method in space, including a local Newton iteration for solving the nonlinear transmission conditions. Our discrete algorithm is asymptotic preserving, i.e., robust in the vanishing viscosity limit. Finally, we present numerical results that confirm the theoretical findings, in particular the convergence of the algorithm. Moreover, we show that the SWR algorithm can be successfully applied to two-phase flow problems in porous media as paradigms for evolution equations with strongly nonlinear advective and diffusive fluxes.},

The framework leads to four different approaches: two with alternating splittings and two with a multiplicative ansatz. The ansatz generalizes ADI and ILU methods to multiple factors and to a more general factor form. The factors may be computed directly from the matrix coefficients or adaptively by incomplete sparse inversions. The special case of tridiagonal splittings is examined in more detail. We decompose the adjacency graph of the sparse matrix into multiple (almost) disjoint linear forests, and each linear forest (a union of disjoint paths) leads to a tridiagonal splitting. We obtain specialized variants of the four general approaches. Parallel implementations for all steps are provided on a GPU. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these preconditioners combined with GMRES on various matrices.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) is used to treat high-dimensional problems that arise in such diverse fields as kinetic transport and uncertainty quantification. Even though it is well known that certain spatial and temporal discretizations when combined with the DLRA approach can result in numerical instability, this phenomenon is poorly understood. In this paper we perform an stability analysis for the corresponding nonlinear equations of motion. This reveals the source of the instability for the projector-splitting integrator [C. Lubich and I. V. Oseledets, BIT, 54 (2014), pp. 171–188] when first discretizing the equations and then applying the DLRA. Based on this we propose a projector-splitting integrator, based on applying DLRA to the continuous system before performing the discretization, that recovers the classic CFL condition. We also show that the unconventional integrator [G. Ceruti and C. Lubich, BIT, 62 (2021), pp. 23–44] has more favorable stability properties. Moreover, we explain why the projector-splitting integrator performs better when approximating higher moments, while the unconventional integrator is generally superior for first order moments. Furthermore, an efficient and stable dynamical low-rank update for the scattering term in kinetic transport is proposed. Numerical experiments for kinetic transport and uncertainty quantification, which confirm the results of the stability analysis, are presented.},
