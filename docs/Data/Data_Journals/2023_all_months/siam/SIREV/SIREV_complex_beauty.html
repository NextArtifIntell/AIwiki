  abstract     = {Our section starts with the featured review of Glenn Ledder&#39;s book Mathematical Modeling for Epidemiology and Ecology. This review is a joint work of 10 authors from Anita Layton&#39;s group. This shows that one can efficiently combine a reading course with an introduction to scientific work and the writing of a review. All reviewers are enthusiastic about the book and recommend it to all researchers interested in the topic. We come from biological aspects to Eric Lauga&#39;s book Fluid Mechanics: A Very Short Introduction. Reviewer Anita Layton recommends the book especially for the younger generation of researchers. This is followed by Guenther Leobacher&#39;s review of An Introduction to the Numerical Simulation of Stochastic Differential Equations, by Desmond Higham and Peter Kloeden. The reviewer praises in particular that the authors have made the “not so easy subject accessible.” After that Guenter Leugering reviews the book PDE Control of String-Actuated Motion, by Ji Wang and Miroslav Krstic. This book is recommended as having only a small gap between mathematical rigor and engineering objectives. In contrast to that, Sean M. Eli and Krešimir Josić note that in the book Visual Differential Geometry and Forms, by Tristan Needham, “the intuition gained” is “at the expense of the rigor.” The final review is written by Mehrshad Sadria. He praises Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction, written by Kevin Murphy, as a “valuable asset for both beginners and experienced readers.” On a final note, after six years of service, I am pleased to pass on the responsibility of the Book Reviews section to Anita Layton, who has been a valued member of our editorial board for some time now. I am delighted to announce that starting in 2024, Anita will be taking the helm of this highly successful segment of SIAM Review. I wish her as much joy and fulfillment in this role as I have experienced.},

  abstract     = {A common definition of hysteresis is that the graph of the state of the system displays looping behavior as the input of the system varies. Alternatively, a dynamical systems perspective can be used to define hysteresis as a phenomenon arising from multiple equilibrium points. Consequently, hysteresis is a topic that can be used to illustrate and extend concepts in a dynamical systems course. The concept is illustrated in this paper through examples of ordinary differential equations, most motivated by applications. Simulations are presented to complement the analysis. The examples can be used to construct student exercises, and specific additional questions are listed in an appendix. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible extensions, including hysteresis in partial differential equations.},

As a result, interdisciplinary mathematics courses are increasing in popularity. However, teaching such courses at an advanced level can be challenging. Students often arrive with different mathematical backgrounds, different interests, and divergent reasons for wanting to learn the material. Here we describe a course on stochastic processes in biology delivered between September and December 2020 to a mixed audience of mathematicians and biologists. In addition to traditional lectures and homework, we incorporated a series of weekly computational challenges into the course. These challenges served to familiarize students with the main modeling concepts and provide them with an introduction on how to implement the concepts in a research-like setting. In order to account for the different academic backgrounds of the students, they worked on the challenges in small groups and presented their results and code in a dedicated discussion class each week. We discuss our experience designing and implementing an element of problem-based learning in an applied mathematics course through computational challenges. We also discuss feedback from students and describe the content of the challenges presented in the course. We provide all materials, along with example code for a number of challenges.},

  abstract     = {In this issue the Education section presents three contributions. The first paper “The Reflection Method for the Numerical Solution of Linear Systems,” by Margherita Guida and Carlo Sbordone, discusses the celebrated Gianfranco Cimmino reflection algorithm for the numerical solution of linear systems $Ax=b$, where $A$ is a nonsingular $n \times n$ sparse matrix, $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $n$ may be large. This innovative iterative algorithm proposed in 1938 uses the geometric reading of each equation of the system as a hyperplane to compute an average of all the symmetric reflections of an initial point $x^0$ with respect to hyperplanes. This leads to a new point $x^1$ which is closer to the solution. The iterative method constructs a sequence $x^k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ converging to the unique intersection of hyperplanes. To overcome the algorithm&#39;s efficiency issues, in 1965 Cimmino upgraded his method by introducing probabilistic arguments also discussed in this article. The method is different from widely used direct methods. Since the early 1980s, there has been increasing interest in Cimmino&#39;s method that has shown to work well in parallel computing, in particular for applications in the area of image reconstruction via X-ray tomography. Cimmino&#39;s algorithm could be an interesting subject to be deepened by students in a course on scientific computing. The second paper, “Incorporating Computational Challenges into a Multidisciplinary Course on Stochastic Processes,” is presented by Mark Jayson Cortez, Alan Eric Akil, Krešimir Josić, and Alexander J. Stewart. The authors describe their graduate-level introductory stochastic modeling course in biology for a mixed audience of mathematicians and biologists whose goal was teaching students to formulate, implement, and assess nontrivial biomathematical models and to develop research skills. This problem-based learning was addressed by proposing several computational modeling challenges based on real life applied problems; by assigning tasks to groups formed by four students, where necessarily participants had different levels of knowledge in programming, mathematics, and biology; and by creating retrospective discussion sessions. In this way the stochastic modeling was introduced using a variety of examples involving, for instance, biochemical reaction networks, gene regulatory systems, neuronal networks, models of epidemics, stochastic games, and agent-based models. As supplementary material, a detailed syllabus, homework, and the text of all computational challenges, along with code for the discussed examples, are provided. The third paper, “Hysteresis and Stability,” by Amenda N. Chow, Kirsten A. Morris, and Gina F. Rabbah, describes the phenomenon of hysteresis in some ordinary differential equations motivated by applications in a way that can be integrated into an introductory course of dynamical systems for undergraduate students. The considered ODEs involve a time dependent parameter, and looping behavior is illustrated with figures. These low-dimensional examples can be used to construct student exercises. There are many citations of related literature inviting the readers to go beyond. A discussion of possible extensions, including hysteresis in PDEs, concludes the article.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive Galerkin numerical schemes integrate time-dependent partial differential equations with a finite number of basis functions, and a subset of them is selected at each time step. This subset changes over time discontinuously according to the evolution of the solution; therefore the corresponding projection operator is time-dependent and nondifferentiable, and we propose using an integral formulation in time. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of this weak form of adaptive Galerkin schemes and prove that nonsmooth projection operators can introduce energy dissipation, which is a crucial result for adaptive Galerkin schemes. To illustrate this, we study an adaptive Galerkin wavelet scheme which computes the time evolution of the inviscid Burgers equation in one dimension and of the incompressible Euler equations in two and three dimensions with a pseudospectral scheme, together with coherent vorticity simulation which uses wavelet denoising. With the help of the continuous wavelet representation we analyze the time evolution of the solution of the 1D inviscid Burgers equation: We first observe that numerical resonances appear when energy reaches the smallest resolved scale, then they spread in both space and scale until they reach energy equipartition between all basis functions, as thermal noise does. Finally we show how adaptive wavelet schemes denoise and regularize the solution of the Galerkin truncated inviscid equations, and for the inviscid Burgers case wavelet denoising even yields convergence towards the exact dissipative solution, also called entropy solution. These results motivate in particular adaptive wavelet Galerkin schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. This SIGEST article is a revised and extended version of the article [R. M. Pereira, N. Nguyen van yen, K. Schneider, and M. Farge, Multiscale Model. Simul., 20 (2022), pp. 1147--1166].},

  abstract     = {The SIGEST article in this issue is “Are Adaptive Galerkin Schemes Dissipative?” by Rodrigo M. Pereira, Natacha Nguyen van yen, Kai Schneider, and Marie Farge. “Although this may seem a paradox, all exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation.” With this quote from Bertrand Russell from 1931 commences this issue&#39;s SIGEST article. Indeed, approximation is at the core of mathematics associated to studying partial differential equations (PDEs) with the idea of approximating the solution to the continuous equation with a finite number of modes. The finite element method for PDEs is a prime exemplar of such an approximation, and much research has been dedicated to getting this approximation as accurate and computationally efficient as possible. In this context, adaptive finite element methods and especially Galerkin methods are often the method of choice. Here, typically, when used for solving evolutionary PDEs the number of modes in the Galerkin scheme is fixed over time. In this article, the authors consider adaptive Galerkin schemes in which the number of modes can change over time, and they introduce a mathematical framework for studying evolutionary PDEs discretized with these schemes. In particular, they show that the associated projection operators, i.e., the operators that project the continuous solution onto the finite-dimensional finite element spaces, are discontinuous and introduce energy dissipation. That this is a significant result is demonstrated by studying adaptive Galerkin schemes for the time evolution of the inviscid Burgers equation in 1D and the incompressible Euler equations in 2D and 3D. They show that adaptive wavelet schemes regularize the solution of the Galerkin truncated equations and yield convergence towards the exact dissipative solution for the inviscid Burgers equation. Also for the Euler equations this regularizing effect can be numerically observed though no exact reference solutions are available in this case. This motivates, in particular, adaptive wavelet Galerkin schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws and leave their systematic study for this class of PDEs for an interesting future work. For the SIGEST article the authors have expanded their original Multiscale Modeling &amp; Simulation article by providing a more comprehensive discussion on adaptive Galerkin methods fit for a general mathematical audience. They have also added a new section on continuous wavelet analysis of the inviscid Burgers equation, analyzing its time evolution, and added an illustration for the development of thermal resonances in wavelet space. Overall, adaptive Galerkin methods and their mathematical properties will be of interest to a wide range of applied mathematicians who study PDE models, and also to applied analysts and numerical analysts who wish to simulate PDEs numerically.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian methods have been widely used in the last two decades to infer statistical properties of spatially variable coefficients in partial differential equations from measurements of the solutions of these equations. Yet, in many cases the number of variables used to parameterize these coefficients is large, and oobtaining meaningful statistics of their probability distributions is difficult using simple sampling methods such as the basic Metropolis--Hastings algorithm---in particular, if the inverse problem is ill-conditioned or ill-posed. As a consequence, many advanced sampling methods have been described in the literature that converge faster than Metropolis--Hastings, for example, by exploiting hierarchies of statistical models or hierarchies of discretizations of the underlying differential equation. At the same time, it remains difficult for the reader of the literature to quantify the advantages of these algorithms because there is no commonly used benchmark. This paper presents a benchmark Bayesian inverse problem---namely, the determination of a spatially variable coefficient, discretized by 64 values, in a Poisson equation, based on point measurements of the solution---that fills the gap between widely used simple test cases (such as superpositions of Gaussians) and real applications that are difficult to replicate for developers of sampling algorithms. We provide a complete description of the test case and provide an open-source implementation that can serve as the basis for further experiments. We have also computed $2\times 10^{11}$ samples, at a cost of some 30 CPU years, of the posterior probability distribution from which we have generated detailed and accurate statistics against which other sampling algorithms can be tested.},

  abstract     = {Solutions to many partial differential equations satisfy certain bounds or constraints. For example, the density and pressure are positive for equations of fluid dynamics, and in the relativistic case the fluid velocity is upper bounded by the speed of light, etc. As widely realized, it is crucial to develop bound-preserving numerical methods that preserve such intrinsic constraints. Exploring provably bound-preserving schemes has attracted much attention and has been actively studied in recent years. This is, however, still a challenging task for many systems, especially those involving nonlinear constraints. Based on some key insights from geometry, we systematically propose an innovative and general framework, referred to as geometric quasilinearization (GQL), which paves a new effective way for studying bound-preserving problems with nonlinear constraints. The essential idea of GQL is to equivalently transform all nonlinear constraints to linear ones, by properly introducing some free auxiliary variables. We establish the fundamental principle and general theory of GQL via the geometric properties of convex regions and propose three simple effective methods for constructing GQL. We apply the GQL approach to a variety of partial differential equations and demonstrate its effectiveness and remarkable advantages for studying bound-preserving schemes, using diverse challenging examples and applications which cannot be easily handled by direct or traditional approaches.},

  abstract     = {This issue&#39;s two Research Spotlights highlight techniques for obtaining ever more realistic solutions to challenging systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Although borne from different fields of applied mathematics, both papers aim to leverage prior information to improve the fidelity and practical solution of PDEs. How predictive is a model if it violates constraints known to be satisfied by the underlying physical phenomena or otherwise imposed by numerical stability requirements? Fundamentally, one desires to avoid nonlinear instabilities, nonphysical solutions, and numerical method divergence whenever these constraints are known a priori, but this pursuit is often easier said than done. In this issue&#39;s first Research Spotlight, “Geometric Quasilinearization Framework for Analysis and Design of Bound-Preserving Schemes,” authors Kailiang Wu and Chi-Wang Shu extend the range of systems of PDEs for which bound constraints can be imposed on solutions. For example, solutions of the special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations have fluid velocities upper bounded by the speed of light. Such constraint equations, and many others illustrated by the authors, are nonlinear and hence challenging to enforce. The authors lift such problems into a higher-dimensional space with the benefit of representing the original nonlinear constraints with higher-dimensional linear constraints based on the geometric properties of the underlying convex regions. The authors illuminate when such lifting results in an equivalent representation---a geometric quasilinearization (GQL)---and derive three techniques for constructing GQL-based bound-preserving methods in practice. The applicability of the resulting framework is based on the form of the nonlinear constraint, in this case based on convex feasible regions, but provides a potential path forward for satisfying even more general constraints. The second Research Spotlight addresses the estimation of unknown, spatially varying PDE system parameters from data. Of particular interest to authors David Aristoff and Wolfgang Bangerth are Bayesian formulations for such inverse problems since these formulations yield predictive distributions on the unknown parameters. Obtaining such a distribution can be highly beneficial for uncertainty quantification and other downstream uses, but Bayesian inversion quickly becomes computationally impractical as the dimension of the unknown parameters grows. More difficult still is validating the obtained distributions. In “A Benchmark for the Bayesian Inversion of Coefficients in Partial Differential Equations” the authors seek to advance the field and understanding of the state of the art through a comprehensive specification of a 64-dimensional benchmark problem. The authors provide a complete description of the underlying physical problem, data-generating process, likelihood, and prior, as well as open-source, multilanguage versions of the simple code to define the problem. The authors also provide the results of a comprehensive numerical examination of the problem, including 30 CPU-years worth of samples from the posterior distribution, and lower- and higher-dimensional extensions of the problem. The benchmark should be helpful for researchers wanting to test the efficacy of new algorithms and sampling approaches.},

The main goal of this review is to present in a unified manner a large set of powerful verification methods, centered around the concept of equilibrium. Methods based on that concept provide error bounds that are fully computable and mathematically certified. We discuss recovery methods, residual methods, and duality-based methods for the estimation of the whole solution error (i.e., the error in energy norm), as well as goal-oriented error estimation (to assess the error on specific quantities of interest). We briefly survey the possible extensions to nonconforming numerical methods, as well as more complex (e.g., nonlinear or time-dependent) problems.

  abstract     = {The metric dimension $\beta(G)$ of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is the smallest cardinality of a subset $S$ of vertices such that all other vertices are uniquely determined by their distances to the vertices in the resolving set $S$. Finding the metric dimension of a graph is an NP-hard problem. Determining whether the metric dimension is less than a given value is NP-complete. In the first article in the Survey and Review section of this issue, “Getting the Lay of the Land in Discrete Space: A Survey of Metric Dimension and Its Applications,” Richard C. Tillquist, Rafael M. Frongillo, and Manuel E. Lladser provide an exhaustive introduction to metric dimension. The overview of its vital results includes applications in game theory, source localization in transmission processes, and preprocessing in the computational analysis of biological sequence data. The paper is worth reading for a broad audience. The second Survey and Review article, by Ludovic Chamoin and Frédéric Legoll, is “An Introductory Review on A Posteriori Error Estimation in Finite Element Computations.” It is devoted to basic concepts and tools for verification methods that provide computable and mathematically certified error bounds and also addresses the question on the localization of errors in the spatial domain. The focus of this review is on a particular method and problem, namely, a conforming finite element method for linear elliptic diffusion problems. The tools of dual analysis and the concept of equilibrium enable a unified perspective on different a posteriori error estimation methods, e.g., flux recovery methods, residual methods, and duality-based constitutive relation error methods. Other topics considered are goal-oriented error estimation, computational costs, and extensions to other finite element schemes and other mathematical problems. While the presentation is self-contained, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with finite element methods. The text is written in an interdisciplinary style and aims to be useful for applied mathematicians and engineers.},

We kick off with an insightful featured review by Chris Oats on the book Probabilistic Numerics, written by Philipp Hennig, Michael A. Osborne, and Hans P. Kersting. Oats expresses his own fascination with the topic and highly recommends delving into the substantial tome. Continuing in the same vein of numerics for data science, we have the book Advances in Artificial Intelligence, Computation, and Data Science: For Medicine and Life Science, edited by Tuan D. Pham, Hong Yan, Muhammad W. Ashraf, and Folke Sjöberg. Reviewer Florian Frommlet notes the heterogeneity of topics covered in the book and suggests that readers focus on certain chapters of the book rather than the entire text. Moving onto differential equations and modeling, Alexander Bors “strongly recommends” the book Emmy Noether: Mathematician Extraordinaire, penned by David E. Rowe. Rua Murray reviews the book A Modern Introduction to Differential Equations, by Henry J. Ricardo and provides a nuanced evaluation. Meanwhile, David Simpson praises the book Principles and Applications of Dimensional Analysis and Similarity, by Sandro G. Longo, for bringing even somewhat dry aspects of the topic to life. The section concludes with the volume Nonlocal and Fractional Operators, edited by Luisa Beghin, Francesco Mainardi, and Roberto Garrappa, which covers a diverse range of topics. Yue Yu commends the book for its breadth of the topics of coverage and its ability to provide insight into cutting-edge research in the field of nonlocal and fractional models.},

  abstract     = {Some simple models of a child swinging on a playground swing are presented. These are analyzed using techniques from Lagrangian mechanics with a twist: the child changes the configuration of the system by sudden movements of their body at key moments in the oscillation. This can lead to jumps in the generalized coordinates describing the system and/or their velocities. Jump conditions can be determined by integrating the Euler--Lagrange equations over a short time interval and then taking the limit as this time interval goes to zero. These models give insights into strategies used by swingers, and answer such vexed questions such as whether it is possible for the swing to go through a full 360$^\circ$ turn over its pivot. A model of an instability at the pivot observed by Colin Furze in a rigid swing constructed to rotate through 360$^\circ$ is also described. This uses a novel double pendulum configuration in which the two components of the pendulums are constrained to move in orthogonal planes.},

Despite the importance of these theorems, they are often treated rather superficially, if at all, in upper level undergraduate courses on dynamical systems or differential equations. This is mainly because of the depth and length of the proofs. In this module, we formulate and prove the one-dimensional analogues of Peixoto&#39;s theorems in an intuitive and fairly simple way using only concepts and results that for the most part should be familiar to upper level undergraduate students in the mathematical sciences or related fields. The intention is to provide students who may be interested in further study in dynamical systems with an accessible one-dimensional treatment of structural stability theory that should help make Peixoto&#39;s theorems and their more recent generalizations easier to appreciate and understand. Further, we believe it is important and interesting for students to know the historical context of these discoveries since the mathematics was not done in isolation. The historical context is perhaps even more appropriate as it is the 100th anniversary of Marília Chaves Peixoto&#39;s and Maurício Matos Peixoto&#39;s births, February 24th and April 15th, 1921, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this issue, the Education section presents two contributions. “The One-Dimensional Version of Peixoto&#39;s Structural Stability Theorem: A Calculus-Based Proof,” by Aminur Rahman and D. Blackmore, proposes, in the one-dimensional setting, a novel proof of Peixoto&#39;s structural stability and density theorem, which is fundamental in dynamical systems theory. In this framework the structural stability theorem says that a $C^1$ dynamical system $\dot x =f(x)$ on $\mathbb{S} ^1$ is structurally stable if and only if it has finitely many equilibrium points, all of which are hyperbolic. In the above $\mathbb{S} ^1$ denotes the unit circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and a point $x_\star$ is called hyperbolic if $f&#39;(x_\star) \neq 0$. The Peixto density result says that the set of all $C^1$ structurally stable systems on $\mathbb{S}^1$ is open and dense in the space of all $C^1$ dynamical systems on $\mathbb{S} ^1$ endowed with the $C^1$ norm. The original Peixoto&#39;s theorem is more complex and is valid for any smooth closed surface. Its proof, however, is long and not accessible using the tools available to advanced undergraduates, in contrast with the proposed one-dimensional proof, which an undergraduate could follow. This does not mean that the proof itself is elementary. Preliminaries recall all the basic definitions that are needed to successfully conduct the task. The style is rigorous and self-contained. The article also provides some historical comments, making the reading lively and encouraging further learning. The second paper, “Piecewise Smooth Models of Pumping a Child&#39;s Swing,” is presented by Brigid Murphy and Paul Glendinning. It concerns models of a child, in either a seated or standing position, swinging on a playground swing. In the article, which arose from the MSc dissertation by one of the authors, these models are analyzed using Lagrangian mechanics and may serve as an introduction to the different ways in which piecewise smooth systems do arise in modeling. The authors describe control strategies of swingers, and, in particular, whether it is possible for the swing to go through a full turn over its pivot. Piecewise smooth terms do naturally appear while discussing the strategies, and this future is analyzed in detail. Indeed the instantaneous reposition of the body of the swinger leads to a jump in the configuration of the swing. Numerical simulations are performed with a standard software package. These investigations would be suitable for undergraduate projects related to classical mechanics courses. At a higher degree level, projects could include further refinement of the existing methods and/or getting more accurate numerical solutions using available specialized software packages. The final section also discusses various related mathematical questions that would be interesting to investigate in this context and mentions other models involving jumps described using piecewise smooth terms.},

  abstract     = {Inverse problems describe the task of blending a mathematical model with observational data---a fundamental task in many scientific and engineering disciplines. The solvability of such a task is usually classified through its well-posedness. A problem is well-posed if it has a unique solution that depends continuously on input or data. Inverse problems are usually ill-posed, but can sometimes be approached through a methodology that formulates a possibly well-posed problem. Usual methodologies are the variational and the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. For the Bayesian approach, Stuart [Acta Numer., 19 (2010), pp. 451--559] has given assumptions under which the posterior measure---the Bayesian inverse problem&#39;s solution---exists, is unique, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the Hellinger distance and, thus, well-posed. In this work, we simplify and generalize this concept: Indeed, we show well-posedness by proving existence, uniqueness, and continuity in Hellinger distance, Wasserstein distance, and total variation distance, and with respect to weak convergence, respectively, under significantly weaker assumptions. An immense class of practically relevant Bayesian inverse problems satisfies those conditions. The conditions can often be verified without analyzing the underlying mathematical model---the model can be treated as a black box.},

  abstract     = {The SIGEST article in this issue, which comes from the SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification, is “Bayesian Inverse Problems Are Usually Well-Posed,” by Jonas Latz. The author investigates the well-posedness of Bayesian approaches to inverse problems, generalizing the framework of well-posedness introduced by Andrew Stuart to a set of weaker assumptions. Well-posedness here is understood in the sense of Hadamard, that is, a solution exists, is unique, and continuously depends on the input data. Inverse problems are typically ill-posed due to properties of the model, a lack of data, and measurement noise. The Bayesian approach to inverse problems reformulates the quest for a solution to the inverse problem in terms of a quest for its posterior distribution, which is determined by the data likelihood and prior distribution of the solution, and which in contrast to the inverse problem itself should be well-posed. In the Bayesian context, well-posedness typically relates to existence, uniqueness, and Lipschitz continuity of the posterior distribution with respect to the data in the so-called Hellinger distance. In many practical applications such well-posedness is difficult, if not impossible, to verify. Moreover, the choice of the Hellinger distance as the right metric might not always be the best fitted depending on the problem at hand. This sets the starting point for the paper where the author introduces a new framework for well-posedness of Bayesian inverse problems in which he shows existence, uniqueness, and continuity with respect to various metrics for a large class of Bayesian inverse problems, with conditions that are either nonrestrictive or verifiable in practical settings. This paper gives a strong new mathematical foundation for Bayesian inverse problems. The underlying statistical and probabilistic concepts are explained comprehensively and comprehensibly and, thus, in a way that opens up the Bayesian approach for a large readership. For the SIGEST version of the paper the author introduced more background material to make it more accessible to a general audience and extended the conclusion and outlook section, summarizing developments in the field that happened since the publication of the original work and discussing future research directions.},

  abstract     = {In $d$ dimensions, accurately approximating an arbitrary function oscillating with frequency $\lesssim k$ requires $\sim$$k^d$ degrees of freedom. A numerical method for solving the Helmholtz equation (with wavenumber $k$ and in $d$ dimensions) suffers from the pollution effect if, as $k→∞$, the total number of degrees of freedom needed to maintain accuracy grows faster than this natural threshold (i.e., faster than $k^d$ for domain-based formulations, such as finite element methods, and $k^{d-1}$ for boundary-based formulations, such as boundary element methods). It is well known that the $h$-version of the finite element method (FEM) (where accuracy is increased by decreasing the meshwidth $h$ and keeping the polynomial degree $p$ fixed) suffers from the pollution effect, and research over the last $\sim$30 years has resulted in a near-complete rigorous understanding of how quickly the number of degrees of freedom must grow with $k$ to maintain accuracy (and how this depends on both $p$ and properties of the scatterer). In contrast to the $h$-FEM, at least empirically, the $h$-version of the boundary element method (BEM) does not suffer from the pollution effect (recall that in the boundary element method the scattering problem is reformulated as an integral equation on the boundary of the scatterer, with this integral equation then solved numerically using a finite element--type approximation space). However, the current best results in the literature on how quickly the number of degrees of freedom for the $h$-BEM must grow with $k$ to maintain accuracy fall short of proving this. In this paper, we prove that the $h$-version of the Galerkin method applied to the standard second-kind boundary integral equations for solving the Helmholtz exterior Dirichlet problem does not suffer from the pollution effect when the obstacle is nontrapping (i.e., does not trap geometric-optic rays). While the proof of this result relies on information about the large-$k$ behavior of Helmholtz solution operators, we show in an appendix how the result can be proved using only Fourier series and asymptotics of Hankel and Bessel functions when the obstacle is a 2-d ball.},

These contexts, however, often involve compartment-to-compartment flows that are incongruent with the conventional assumption of complete mixing that results in exponential residence times in linear models. Here we detail a general method for assigning any desired residence time distribution to a given intercompartmental flow, extending compartment modeling capability to transport operations, power-law residence times, diffusions, etc., without resorting to composite compartments, fractional calculus, or partial differential equations (PDEs) for diffusive transport. This is achieved by writing the mass exchange rate coefficients as functions of age-in-compartment as done in one of the first compartment models in 1917, at the cost of converting the usual ordinary differential equations to a system of first-order PDEs. The PDEs are readily converted to a system of integral equations for which a numerical method is devised. Example calculations demonstrate incorporation of advective lags, advective-dispersive transport, power-law residence time distributions, or diffusive domains in compartment models.},

These objectives are tackled and achieved from the perspective of the simultaneous control of systems of NODEs. For instance, in the context of classification, each item to be classified corresponds to a different initial datum for the control problem of the NODE, to be classified, all of them by the same common control, to the location (a subdomain of the Euclidean space) associated to each label. Our proofs are genuinely nonlinear and constructive, allowing us to estimate the complexity of the control strategies we develop. The nonlinear nature of the activation functions governing the dynamics of NODEs under consideration plays a key role in our proofs, since it allows deforming half of the phase space while the other half remains invariant, a property that classical models in mechanics do not fulfill. This very property allows us to build elementary controls inducing specific dynamics and transformations whose concatenation, along with properly chosen hyperplanes, allows us to achieve our goals in finitely many steps. The nonlinearity of the dynamics is assumed to be Lipschitz. Therefore, our results apply also in the particular case of the ReLU activation function. We also present the counterparts in the context of the control of neural transport equations, establishing a link between optimal transport and deep neural networks.},

  abstract     = {The three articles in this issue&#39;s Research Spotlight section highlight the breadth of problems and approaches that have differential equations as a central component. In the first article, “Neural ODE Control for Classification, Approximation, and Transport,” authors Domènec Ruiz-Balet and Enrique Zuazua seek to expand understanding of some of the main properties of deep neural networks. To this end, the authors develop a dynamical control theoretical analysis of neural ordinary differential equations, a discretization of which is commonly known as a ResNet in machine learning. In this approach, time-dependent parameters are defined by piecewise-constant controls used to achieve targets associated with classification and regression tasks. A key aspect of the article&#39;s treatment is the reliance on an activation function characterization that only deforms one half space, leaving the other half space invariant; the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is a popular example of such an activation function. The authors derive constructive universal approximation results that can be used to understand how the complexity of the control depends on the target function&#39;s properties. Among other applications, these results are used to control a neural transport equation with the Wasserstein distance, common in optimal transport problems, measuring the approximation quality. Ruiz-Balet and Zuazua conclude with a number of open problems. Differential equation--based compartment models date back at least a century, when they were used to model the dynamics of malaria in a mixed population of humans and mosquitoes. Since then, compartment models have been used in areas far beyond epidemiology, typically with the simplifying assumption that each compartment is internally well mixed. As a consequence, all members in a compartment are treated the same, independent of how long they have resided in the compartment. In “Compartment Models with Memory,” authors Timothy Ginn and Lynn Schreyer expand the fields for which compartment models can provide insight by incorporating age in compartment in the underlying rate coefficients. This has the benefit of being able to account for a wide array of residence time distributions and comes at a cost of having to numerically solve a system of Volterra integral equations instead of a system of ordinary differential equations. The authors demonstrate and validate this approach on a number of examples and conclude by incorporating a delay in contagiousness of infected persons in a nonlinear SARS-CoV-2 transmission model. The authors also summarize several open questions based on this approach of allowing model parameters to be written as functions of age in compartment. “Does the Helmholtz Boundary Element Method Suffer from the Pollution Effect?” This is the question posed by (and the title of) the final Research Spotlights article in this issue. Authors Jeffrey Galkowski and Euan A. Spence consider Helmholtz problems that arise when a plane wave is scattered by a smooth obstacle. Of particular interest are very high frequency waves, which necessarily require a large number of discretized degrees of freedom to accurately resolve solutions. A so-called pollution effect arises if the number of degrees of freedom required grows faster than a particular polynomial of the wave number as the wave number tends to infinity.

  abstract     = {Network-based modeling of complex systems and data using the language of graphs has become an essential topic across a range of different disciplines. Arguably, this graph-based perspective derives its success from the relative simplicity of graphs: A graph consists of nothing more than a set of vertices and a set of edges, describing relationships between pairs of such vertices. This simple combinatorial structure makes graphs interpretable and flexible modeling tools. The simplicity of graphs as system models, however, has been scrutinized in the literature recently. Specifically, it has been argued from a variety of different angles that there is a need for higher-order networks, which go beyond the paradigm of modeling pairwise relationships, as encapsulated by graphs. In this survey article we take stock of these recent developments. Our goals are to clarify (i) what higher-order networks are, (ii) why these are interesting objects of study, and (iii) how they can be used in applications.},

  abstract     = {Over the last 30 years a plethora of variational regularization models for image reconstruction have been proposed and thoroughly inspected by the applied mathematics community. Among them, the pioneering prototype often taught and learned in basic courses in mathematical image processing is the celebrated Rudin--Osher--Fatemi (ROF) model [L. I. Rudin, S. Osher, and E. Fatemi, Phys. D, 60 (1992), pp. 259--268], which relies on the minimization of the edge-preserving total variation (TV) seminorm as a regularization term. Despite its (often limiting) simplicity, this model is still very much employed in many applications and used as a benchmark for assessing the performance of modern learning-based image reconstruction approaches, thanks to its thorough analytical and numerical understanding. Among the many extensions to TV proposed over the years, a large class is based on the concept of space variance. Space-variant models can indeed overcome the intrinsic inability of TV to describe local features (strength, sharpness, directionality) by means of an adaptive mathematical modeling which accommodates local regularization weighting, variable smoothness, and anisotropy. Those ideas can further be cast in the flexible Bayesian framework of generalized Gaussian distributions and combined with maximum likelihood and hierarchical optimization approaches for efficient hyperparameter estimation. In this work, we review and connect the major contributions in the field of space-variant TV-type image reconstruction models, focusing, in particular, on their Bayesian interpretation which paves the way to new exciting and unexplored research directions.},

  abstract     = {Apart from a short erratum, which concerns the correction of some coefficients in a differential equation in the original paper, this issue contains two Survey and Review articles. “On and Beyond Total Variation Regularization in Imaging: The Role of Space Variance,” authored by Monica Pragliola, Luca Calatroni, Alessandro Lanza, and Fiorella Sgallari, reviews total variation (TV)-type image reconstruction algorithms with a focus on Bayesian interpretations. The paper scientifically travels across various disciplines by considering a standard example problem to highlight extensions for the TV regularization model. A main contribution is a space-variant framework which allows one to describe the contents of an image at a local scale. Important applications of space-variant models are tomography, e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, electrical impedance tomography, positron emission tomography, and photoacoustic tomography, or noninvasive digital reconstruction, e.g., for ancient frescoes, illuminated manuscripts, surface colorization, etc. The unified view of many of the different models within the Bayesian framework enables one to design flexible and adaptive image regularization functionals which take advantage of the form of the underlying gradient distributions through statistical approaches. The paper contains theoretical results as well as sections on algorithmic optimization (based on the alternating direction methods of multipliers) and numerical tests for examples from image deblurring. Thus it should be interesting for researchers from several disciplines. “What Are Higher-Order Networks” is a question raised and answered by Christian Bick, Elizabeth Gross, Heather A. Harrington, and Michael T. Schaub. In short, higher-order networks are a refurbishment of graphs, removing/overcoming some of the limitations of pairwise relationships by enabling the modeling of polyadic relations in real-world systems, such as reactions in biochemical systems with several species or reagents, or interactions of multiple people in social networks. The main topics of discussion are the understanding of the “shape” of data (by identifying and classifying topological and geometrical properties of the data), the modeling of relational data via higher-order networks, and network dynamical systems (describing couplings between dynamical units). The focus of the presentation is on the mathematical aspects of the topics, but a multitude of applications are mentioned. The impressive list of references comprises 316 entries. We believe the paper to be interesting for a broad audience.},

Our reviewer describes it as a classic in the field of inverse problems and recommends it to all readers inclined to the theory and solution of inverse problems. The next review discusses the book Nonlinear Solid Mechanics for Finite Element Analysis: Dynamics, by Javier Bonet, Antonio J. Gil, and Richard D. Wood. The reviewer Josip Tambača praises in particular the free source code that comes with the book and which is an extra feature the reviewer found most beneficial. The next three books are in one way or another related to biological aspects of mathematics. Yuan Gao and Jian-Guo Liu review the book Stochastic Chemical Reaction Systems in Biology, by Hong Qian and Hao Ge. The reviewers describe the textbook as accessible for any graduate student with a background in differential equations. Russell Milne reviews the book Introduction to Quantitative Ecology, by Timothy E. Essington. He recommends the book as an excellent resource to an undergraduate-level and also graduate-level quantitative ecology course. Phylogenetic Comparative Methods in R, by Liam J. Revell and Luke J. Harmon, is reviewed by Emmanuel Paradis. He recalls the description of the field as “a specialized branch of evolutionary biology that aims to study the evolution of species traits and its mechanisms” and discusses the features of the book in great detail. He finally recommends the book to students and evolutionary biologists interested in the field. The section ends on a meta level. The book An Applied Mathematician&#39;s Apology is written by L. N. Trefethen, who is a very well known applied mathematician. Rather than mathematical concepts, this book contemplates attitudes towards mathematics---specifically applied mathematics.

  abstract     = {The Education section in this issue presents two contributions. In `&quot;Nesterov&#39;s Method for Convex Optimization,&quot; Noel J. Walkington proposes a teaching guide for a first course in optimization of this well-known algorithm for computing the minimum of a convex function. This algorithm, first proposed in 1983 by Yuri Nesterov, though well recognized in computational optimization in the presence of large data as a more efficient tool than the steepest descent method, is still absent in most modern textbooks on optimization. The author of the present article develops an elementary analysis of Nesterov&#39;s first order algorithm that parallels that of steepest descent but with an additional requirement proposed by Nesterov. Two cases are discussed. The first concerns an unconstrained minimization problem, while the second includes closed convex constraints represented using infinite penalization of the cost. More generally, the cost function becomes the sum of a smooth convex function and a lower semicontinuous convex function. Several student-level exercises are included in this paper. Results are nicely illustrated by an example of a signal recovery problem and a discussion of the Uzawa algorithm for optimization problems with constraints defined by inequalities involving convex functions. The second paper, &quot;A Comprehensive Proof of Bertrand&#39;s Theorem,&quot; is presented by Patrick De Leenheer, John Musgrove, and Tyler Schimleck. It concerns the behavior of the solutions of the classical two-body problem and states that, among all possible gravitational laws, there are only two exhibiting the property that all bounded orbits are closed: Newtonian gravitation and Hookean gravitation. Historically, even if Newton was aware that there are to specific gravitational laws having the above property, it was only two centuries later, in 1873, that Bertrand realized that these are the only ones. Bertrand&#39;s theorem, due to its important consequences, has been integrated into the undergraduate curriculum in theoretical mechanics, but its proof, accessible to undergraduate mathematics or physics students, seems to be absent from modern textbooks. Although Bertrand&#39;s original paper did not contain a precise proof, V. Arnold proposed a sketch of it based on six subproblems. Among other contributions, this article provides a complete proof of the sixth subproblem under a specific assumption imposed on the magnitude of the force in the motion model. Under this assumption, a complete proof of Bertrand&#39;s theorem is then given, incorporating also earlier contributions by other authors. Still, comprehensive does not mean simple here, and this paper may be used to conceive several research projects for advanced-level undergraduate students in mathematics or physics.},

  abstract     = {We present a unifying Perron--Frobenius theory for nonlinear spectral problems defined in terms of nonnegative tensors. By using the concept of tensor shape partition, our results include, as a special case, a wide variety of particular tensor spectral problems considered in the literature and can be applied to a broad set of problems involving tensors (and matrices), including the computation of operator norms, graph and hypergraph matching in computer vision, hypergraph spectral theory, higher-order network analysis, and multimarginal optimal transport. The key to our approach is to recast the eigenvalue problem as a fixed point problem on a suitable product of projective spaces. This allows us to use the theory of multihomogeneous order-preserving maps to derive new and unifying Perron--Frobenius theorems for nonnegative tensors, which either imply earlier results of this kind or improve them, as weaker assumptions are required. We introduce a general power method for the computation of the dominant tensor eigenpair and provide a detailed convergence analysis. This paper is directly based on our previous work [A. Gautier, F. Tudisco, and M. Hein, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 40 (2019), pp. 1206--1231] and complements it by providing an extended introduction and several new results.},

  abstract     = {The SIGEST article in this issue is “Nonlinear Perron--Frobenius Theorems for Nonnegative Tensors,” by Antoine Gautier, Francesco Tudisco, and Matthias Hein. Most computational and applied mathematicians will be aware of the results that Perron published in 1907 about the eigensystems of positive matrices, which were then extended by Frobenius in 1912 to the case of nonnegative matrices. This theory has impacted many areas of mathematics, including graph theory, Markov chains, and matrix computation, and it forms a fundamental component in the analysis of a range of models in areas such as demography, economics, wireless networking, and search engine optimization. Our SIGEST article, which first appeared in SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications in 2019, extends Perron--Frobenius theory in two directions. First, the authors generalize from matrices to multidimensional arrays. This ties in with one of SIAM Review&#39;s most highly cited offerings: •Tensor decompositions and applications, T. G. Kolda and B. W. Bader, SIAM Review, 51 (3) (2009), pp. 455--500. It may also be viewed as extending the theory from graphs to hypergraphs---objects that are currently of much interest, as evidenced by several recent SIAM Review articles, including •Hypergraph cuts with general splitting functions, N. Veldt, A. R. Benson and J. Kleinberg, SIAM Review, 64 (3) (2022), pp. 650--685. By studying this higher-order setting, the authors open up new applications in network science, computer vision, and machine learning. The second major direction of the article is to develop and study nonlinear versions of the underlying spectral problems, and corresponding extensions of the traditional power method. This makes available new classes of iterations for which a comprehensive and satisfactory convergence theory is available. In preparing this SIGEST version, the authors have included new material. The introduction has been extended, and section 2 has been added to provide nontrivial examples of tensor eigenvalue problems in applications, including problems from computer vision and optimal transport. Moreover, subsection 4.1 includes a new nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theorem (Theorem 4.4) that builds on the previously known results in Theorems 4.2. and 4.3.},

  abstract     = {Most models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume mass-action contact patterns and undirected contact networks, meaning that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most at risk of contracting it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproduction number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (``risk” and “spread&#39;&#39;), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds, we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack--McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so-called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and why some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by realistic complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed graphs have a forward and a backward version of the classic “friendship paradox&#39;&#39;---forward edges tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward edges lead to individuals with high spread---such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.},

We briefly survey this class of algorithms, establishing a relationship to system realization and rational interpolation techniques in control theory. This connection casts contour integral methods for linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems in a general framework that gives perspective on existing methods and suggests a broad class of new algorithms. These methods replace the usual block Hankel matrix pencils (which interpolate at infinity) with Loewner matrix pencils (enabling interpolation at many points in the complex plane). While this framework is novel for linear eigenvalue problems, we focus our presentation on the nonlinear case. The old and new methods share the same intensive computations (the solution of linear systems associated with contour integration), allowing one to explore a vast range of new eigenvalue approximations with little additional work. Numerical examples illustrate the potential of this approach. We also discuss how the concept of filter functions can be employed in this new framework, and we close with a discussion of interpolation point selection.},

In this issue&#39;s first Research Spotlights article, “Contour Integral Methods for Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems: A Systems Theoretic Approach,” authors Michael C. Brennan, Mark Embree, and Serkan Gugercin illuminate new algorithmic approaches for these challenging problems. The authors reimagine Loewner matrix methods and demonstrate how significant gains in accuracy can be achieved with relatively little additional computational expense over conventional approaches. The article ties together several active areas of applied mathematics. For example, the authors seek to avoid explicitly computing an inverse map in the contour integral by employing randomized sketching-like techniques. The authors&#39; intention in making these connections is to open up for further research and refinement a broad family of algorithms for the solution of challenging nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) and related compartmental models for disease spread have received heightened attention by a global community seeking to better query and understand epidemic dynamics. “The Role of Directionality, Heterogeneity, and Correlations in Epidemic Risk and Spread,” the second Research Spotlights article, highlights key differences from treating such models via directed connections (that distinguish between risk and spread) rather than via simple undirected graph abstractions. Authors Antoine Allard, Cristopher Moore, Samuel V. Scarpino, Benjamin M. Althouse, and Laurent Hébert-Dufresne explore how the in-degree and out-degree distributions for random directed graphs jointly affect model dynamics. By using results from branching processes, this model allows one to examine characteristics such as epidemic size and the probability that a single infection generates a large-scale epidemic. The authors provide several examples to illustrate when established asymptotic theory holds and when it does not, highlighting important implicit assumptions regarding the Poisson distribution of risk as well as the independence of risk and spread.},

  abstract     = {Convex nonsmooth optimization problems, whose solutions live in very high dimensional spaces, have become ubiquitous. To solve them, the class of first-order algorithms known as proximal splitting algorithms is particularly adequate: they consist of simple operations, handling the terms in the objective function separately. In this overview, we demystify a selection of recent proximal splitting algorithms: we present them within a unified framework, which consists in applying splitting methods for monotone inclusions in primal-dual product spaces, with well-chosen metrics. Along the way, we easily derive new variants of the algorithms and revisit existing convergence results, extending the parameter ranges in several cases. In particular, we emphasize that when the smooth term in the objective function is quadratic, e.g., for least-squares problems, convergence is guaranteed with larger values of the relaxation parameter than previously known. Such larger values are usually beneficial for the convergence speed in practice.},

  abstract     = {A point process is called self-exciting if the arrival of an event increases the probability of similar events for some period of time. Typical examples include earthquakes, which frequently cause aftershocks due to increased geological tension in their region; raised intrusion rates in the vicinity of a burglary; retweets in social media incited by some provocative posting; or trading frenzies following a huge stock order. A Hawkes process is a point process that models self-excitement among time events. In contrast to a Markov chain (in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event), chances of arrival of events are increased for some time period after the initial arrival in a Hawkes process. The first Survey and Review paper in this issue, “Hawkes Processes Modeling, Inference, and Control: An Overview,” by Rafael Lima, discusses recent advances in Hawkes process modeling and inference. The parametric, nonparametric, deep learning, and reinforcement learning approaches are covered. Current research challenges for the topic and the real-world limitations of each approach are also addressed. The paper should be of interest to experts in the field, but it also aims to be suitable for newcomers. The second Survey and Review paper, “Proximal Splitting Algorithms for Convex Optimization: A Tour of Recent Advances, with New Twists,” by Laurent Condat, Daichi Kitahara, Andrés Contreras, and Akira Hirabayashi, is dedicated to the solution of convex nonsmooth optimization problems in high-dimensional spaces. The objective function $f$ is assumed to be a sum of simple convex functions $f_j$ with the property that the minimization problem for each $f_j$ is simple, but for $f$ it is hard. For nonsmooth functions, gradient-based optimization algorithms are infeasible. In proximal algorithms, the gradient is replaced by the so-called proximity operator. While closed forms of proximity operators are known for many functions of practical interest, there is no general closed form for the proximity operator of a sum of functions. Therefore, splitting algorithms handle the proximity operators of the functions $f_j$ individually. The paper provides a constructive and self-contained introduction to the class of proximal splitting algorithms. New variants of the algorithms under consideration are developed. Existing convergence results are revisited, unified, and, in some cases, improved. Reading the paper will be rewarding for anyone interested in high-dimensional nonsmooth convex optimization.},

Its reviewer, Kristin Kirchner, praises in particular its approach based on the variational formulation. The section is concluded by two books in the data science realm. Aretha Teckentrup reviews the book Mathematical Foundations for Data Analysis, by Jeff Phillips, and warns the strongly mathematically oriented reader of episodically increased heart rate because some formulations may lack the mathematical rigor that a mathematician is used to. The last book in our section is the second edition of Transformers for Natural Language Processing, by Denis Rothman.

  abstract     = {In this issue the Education section presents two contributions. The first paper is “Chaos Game Representation” (CGR), written by Eunice Y. S. Chan and Robert M. Corless. The chaos game is an algorithm which allows us to produce pictures like fractal structures associated with one-dimensional sequences of integers and, in this way, to “visualize” such sequences. In particular, these pictures can help to generate conjectures and give an intuition of the “distance” between sequences. CGR is based on an algorithm from chaotic dynamics called the “chaos game,” popularized by Barnsley. It involves a polygon, a dividing rate, and randomly chosen sequences of vertices of the polygon leading to various fractal-like patterns depending on the game board and the dividing rate. For a triangular game board and some choices of dividing rate, one gets the Sierpinski triangle. The appearance of patterns is explained by the overlapping of the attractors of CGR. This overlapping can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the dividing rate. The authors also demonstrate, in an experimental way, that the number of vertices in the game board may influence the final patterns. The article provides a nice description of how CGR has been applied to DNA and protein (amino acids) sequencing and visualization. Finally, the CGR is also discussed when the random choice of vertices is replaced by digits of $\pi$, Fibonacci sequence, and prime numbers, getting various patterns in each case. The construction of CGR given in this paper can be introduced in a “dynamical systems” or “modeling” courses classroom. This teaching module also aims to stimulate a discussion about randomness and its meaning. The second paper, “Surprises in a Classic Boundary-Layer Problem,” is presented by William A. Clark, Mario W. Gomes, Arnaldo Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Leo C. Stein, and Steven H. Strogatz. It provides a detailed analysis of a nonlinear boundary-value problem $$ (1.1) \varepsilon y ” = yy&#39; - y , \quad y(0) = 1 ,\quad y(1) = -1 $$ and exhibits a number of previously overlooked properties of its solutions. Equation (1.1) is considered in the classic textbook by Mark Holmes [Introduction to Perturbation Methods, Springer, New York, 1995], where it is argued that it has a unique solution, however after imposing some convexity/concavity assumptions on solutions near the boundary. In the absence of such an assumption it turns out that (1.1) actually has three solutions whenever $\varepsilon &gt;0$ is sufficiently small. In particular, the authors show the existence of a pitchfork bifurcation parameter $\varepsilon_c=0.2159869288903\dots$ such that for all $0 0$ is sufficiently small. For two of them it is transcendentally close to 1, and explicit estimates of this closeness are explained. Then the occurring pitchfork bifurcation is discussed in more detail. The study relies on converting the second order ODE into a system of two first order ODEs and then investigating the phase portrait to understand qualitative properties of solutions. In particular, solutions are conservative and some of them enjoy symmetry-like properties. Finally, using the obtained estimates, the shooting method is applied to solve (1.1) numerically. The detailed proofs and calculations make this paper almost self-contained and provide a methodology of a complete analysis of (1.1). This problem could be included in courses on perturbation methods, applied dynamical systems, or numerical analysis.},

The main result is that the set of initial configurations which lead to finite-time collision, although nonempty, has Lebesgue measure zero. This is an elegant and highly nontrivial extension to general bounded domains with $C^{2, \alpha}$ boundary of a result previously known only for three domains: the full plane, a disk, and the complement of a disk. It is notable that the result also extends to point-vortex dynamics in multiply connected domains. In preparing this SIGEST version, the author has added a new introductory section that explains the context of the new results. Moreover, some of the technical details from the original article have been replaced by more accessible high-level explanations. Recent references on the topics of vortex collisions and desingularization problems are also included.

Side information is any knowledge we might have about the dynamical system we would like to learn, besides trajectory data, and is typically inferred from domain-specific knowledge or basic principles of a scientific discipline. We are interested in explicitly integrating side information into the learning process in order to compensate for scarcity of trajectory observations. We identify six types of side information that arise naturally in many applications and lead to convex constraints in the learning problem. First, we show that when our model for the unknown dynamical system is parameterized as a polynomial, we can impose our side information constraints computationally via semidefinite programming. We then demonstrate the added value of side information for learning the dynamics of basic models in physics and cell biology, as well as for learning and controlling the dynamics of a model in epidemiology. Finally, we study how well polynomial dynamical systems can approximate continuously differentiable ones while satisfying side information (either exactly or approximately). Our overall learning methodology combines ideas from convex optimization, real algebra, dynamical systems, and functional approximation theory, and can potentially lead to new synergies among these areas.},

  abstract     = {Bump attractors are wandering localized patterns observed in in vivo experiments of spatially extended neurobiological networks. They are important for the brain&#39;s navigational system and specific memory tasks. A bump attractor is characterized by a core in which neurons fire frequently, while those away from the core do not fire. These structures have been found in simulations of spiking neural networks, but we do not yet have a mathematical understanding of their existence because a rigorous analysis of the nonsmooth networks that support them is challenging. We uncover a relationship between bump attractors and traveling waves in a classical network of excitable, leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. This relationship bears strong similarities to the one between complex spatiotemporal patterns and waves at the onset of pipe turbulence. Waves in the spiking network are determined by a firing set, that is, the collection of times at which neurons reach a threshold and fire as the wave propagates. We define and study analytical properties of the voltage mapping, an operator transforming a solution&#39;s firing set into its spatiotemporal profile. This operator allows us to construct localized traveling waves with an arbitrary number of spikes at the core, and to study their linear stability. A homogeneous “laminar&quot; state exists in the network, and it is linearly stable for all values of the principal control parameter. Sufficiently wide disturbances to the homogeneous state elicit the bump attractor. We show that one can construct waves with a seemingly arbitrary number of spikes at the core; the higher the number of spikes, the slower the wave, and the more its profile resembles a stationary bump. As in the fluid-dynamical analogy, such waves coexist with the homogeneous state, and the solution branches to which they belong are disconnected from the laminar state; we provide evidence that the dynamics of the bump attractor displays echoes of unstable waves, which form its building blocks.},

  abstract     = {What surprising patterns do fluid dynamics and neurobiological networks have in common? In this issue&#39;s first Research Spotlights article, “Bump Attractors and Waves in Networks of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neurons,” a connection is made between the waves at the onset of pipe turbulence and the localized traveling waves in spiking neural networks. Authors Daniele Avitabile, Joshua L. Davis, and Kyle Wedgwood consider a so-called “discrete integrate-and-fire model” to describe the dynamics of a connected neuron firing via a system of piecewise linear ordinary differential equations. Constructing a solution to this system effectively amounts to determining firing times of the neurons. One can then witness “bump” patterns, in this case characterized by a core of neurons that fire frequently, while neurons away from the core do not fire. Such a model&#39;s deterministic chaotic behavior can then be studied around a firing set and used to construct waves and analyze their stability. Simulations and analysis demonstrate oscillatory and nested branching of these waves, and such behavior can accumulate in a bump attractor and wandering wave. The authors show that such complex spatiotemporal patterns, and their conditions for stability, are not unlike those witnessed in the transition to turbulence in a pipe. The paper concludes with a challenge to future researchers: can further dynamical systems characterizations of such event-driven models uncover links between localized waves and bumps in complex spatial networks? The second Research Spotlights article addresses the problem of identifying a system from noisy observations of dynamical data. In “Learning Dynamical Systems with Side Information” authors Amir Ali Ahmadi and Bachir El Khadir present a way to incorporate system knowledge to improve the learning process beyond what is possible using data alone. Such knowledge, or “side information,” arises when one has contextual information about the unknown dynamics without knowing the dynamics precisely. Examples of side information covered by the authors&#39; framework include known trajectories (e.g., when one has knowledge of some equilibrium points), group symmetry, and coordinatewise properties (e.g., nonnegativity or monotonicity). Restricting attention to a particular class of functions to be learned and particular side information allows the learning process to be posed as a semidefinite optimization formulation amenable to efficient solution. This approach is demonstrated numerically on systems modeling the diffusion of a contagion, behavior of a simple pendulum, and time evolution of a cancerous tumor, as well as on the classical Lorenz system. In each case, imposing side information via semidefinite programming allows the authors to learn the unknown dynamics from far fewer observations than otherwise possible and provides a potential road map for addressing even broader classes of systems and side information.},

  abstract     = {Clustering points in a vector space or nodes in a graph is a ubiquitous primitive in statistical data analysis, and it is commonly used for exploratory data analysis. In practice, it is often of interest to “refine” or “improve” a given cluster that has been obtained by some other method. In this survey, we focus on principled algorithms for this cluster improvement problem. Many such cluster improvement algorithms are flow-based methods, by which we mean that operationally they require the solution of a sequence of maximum flow problems on a (typically implicitly) modified data graph. These cluster improvement algorithms are powerful, both in theory and in practice, but they have not been widely adopted for problems such as community detection, local graph clustering, semisupervised learning, etc. Possible reasons for this are the steep learning curve for these algorithms, the lack of efficient and easy-to-use software, and the lack of detailed numerical experiments on real-world data that demonstrate their usefulness. Our objective here is to address these issues. To do so, we guide the reader through the whole process of understanding how to implement and apply these powerful algorithms. We present a unifying fractional programming optimization framework that permits us to distill, in a simple way, the crucial components of all these algorithms. This also makes apparent similarities and differences among related methods. Viewing these cluster improvement algorithms via a fractional programming framework suggests directions for future algorithm development. Finally, we develop efficient implementations of these algorithms in our LocalGraphClustering Python package, and we perform extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of these methods on social networks and image-based data graphs.},

  abstract     = {Marginal likelihood and Bayes factors are key components of the Bayesian analysis used in hypothesis testing and model selection. In many applications in statistics, applied mathematics, signal processing, and machine learning, the computation of normalizing constants of probability models or ratios of these constants plays a fundamental role. The first Survey and Review paper in this issue, “Marginal Likelihood Computation for Model Selection and Hypothesis Testing: An Extensive Review,” by F. Llorente, L. Martino, D. Delgado, and J. López-Santiago, provides a comprehensive study of the state of the art of this topic. The authors highlight respective benefits and limitations of many computational schemes for approximating the marginal likelihood of different models or the ratio of two marginal likelihoods. Connections and differences among these techniques are worked out. Some of the most relevant methodologies are compared through theoretical comparisons and numerical experiments. The chief accomplishment is the presentation of various methods introduced independently in the literature in a unified framework. The second Survey and Review paper, “Flow-Based Algorithms for Improving Clusters: A Unifying Framework, Software, and Performance,” by Kimon Fountoulakis, Meng Liu, David F. Gleich, and Michael W. Mahoney, addresses the improvement of clusters of points in a vector space or nodes in a graph, which is a primary problem in statistical data analysis. Clustering means grouping of objects in a set such that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It is a main task of exploratory data analysis and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in pattern recognition, image analysis, data compression, machine learning, and many other fields. A frequent practice is improving a given cluster such that conductance is minimized. Cluster analysis can be achieved by various algorithms. While the literature is rich on global spectral methods, flow-based methods have attracted less attention so far, since they lack the simplicity of related spectral methods and seeded graph diffusion methods like PageRank. These spectral methods are often easy to explain in terms of random walks, Markov chains, linear systems, and intuitive notions of diffusion. On the other hand, at the expense of complex graph constructions, the flow-based methods often yield impressive theoretical results. The goal of this review is to provide a unified framework for flow-based methods, based on a class of optimization methods known as fractional programming. The fractional programming optimization perspective unifies all existing flow-based cluster improvement methods, showing that these methods are attractive alternatives to global spectral methods.},
