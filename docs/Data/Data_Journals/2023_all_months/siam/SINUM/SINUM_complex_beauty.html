  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), on compact manifolds in Euclidean space. It utilizes Hamiltonian dynamics to generate samples approximating a target distribution in high dimensions efficiently. The efficiency of HMC is characterized by its convergence property, called geometric ergodicity. This property is important to generate low-correlated samples. It also plays a crucial role in establishing the error estimate for the quadrature of bounded functions by HMC sampling, referred to as the Hoeffding-type inequality. While the geometric ergodicity has been proved for HMC on Euclidean space, it has not been established on manifolds. In this paper, we prove the geometric ergodicity for HMC on compact manifolds. As an example to confirm the efficiency of the proposed HMC method, we consider a sampling problem associated with the -vortex problem on the unit sphere, which is a statistical model of two-dimensional turbulence. We apply HMC to approximate the statistical quantities with respect to the invariant measure of the -vortex problem, called the Gibbs measure. We observe the organization of large vortex structures as seen in two-dimensional turbulence.},

In the author’s previous paper [R. Zhang, SIAM J. Numer. Math., 60 (2022), pp. 804–823], this result has been proved for periodic surfaces in two-dimensional spaces, when the wave number is not a half-integer. In this paper, we prove that the method has a high-order convergence rate in the three-dimensional biperiodic surface scattering problems. We extend the two-dimensional results and prove that the exponential convergence still holds when the wave number is smaller than 0.5. For larger wave numbers, although exponential convergence is no longer proved, we are able to prove a higher-order convergence for the PML method.},

The pressure velocity coupling and the viscous terms are treated implicitly, while the convection term is treated explicitly. Both the second-order backward differentiation and the Crank–Nicolson methods are considered for time discretization, resulting in a scheme similar to Gear’s method on the one hand and to the Adams–Bashforth of second order on the other. For the discretization in space, we consider finite element methods with stabilization on the gradient jumps. The stabilizing terms ensures inf-sup stability for equal-order interpolation and robustness at a high Reynolds number. Under suitable Courant conditions we prove stability of Gear’s scheme in this regime. The stabilization allows us to prove error estimates of order . Here is the mesh parameter, is the polynomial order, and the time step. Finally we show that for inviscid flow (or underresolved viscous flow) the IMEX scheme can be written as a fractional step method in which only a mass matrix is inverted for each velocity component and a Poisson-type equation is solved for the pressure.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Can Monte Carlo (MC) solvers be directly used in gradient-based methods for PDE-constrained optimization problems? In these problems, a gradient of the loss function is typically presented as a product of two PDE solutions, one for the forward equation and the other for the adjoint. When MC solvers are used, the numerical solutions are Dirac measures. As such, one immediately faces the difficulty in explaining the multiplication of two measures. This suggests that MC solvers are naturally incompatible with gradient-based optimization under PDE constraints. In this paper, we study two different strategies to overcome the difficulty. One is to adopt the discretize-then-optimize technique and conduct the full optimization on the algebraic system, avoiding the Dirac measures. The second strategy stays within the optimize-then-discretize framework. We propose a correlated simulation where, instead of using MC solvers separately for both forward and adjoint problems, we recycle the samples in the forward simulation in the adjoint solver. This frames the adjoint solution as a test function and hence allows a rigorous convergence analysis. The investigation is presented through the lens of the radiative transfer equation, either in the inverse setting from optical imaging or in the optimal control framework. We detail the algorithm development, convergence analysis, and complexity cost. Numerical evidence is also presented to demonstrate the claims.},

The nonlocal model of interest is defined by a time-dependent semilinear partial integro-differential equation (PIDE), in which the integro-differential operator consists of both local convection-diffusion and nonlocal diffusion operators. Our numerical scheme is based on the direct approximation of the nonlinear Feynman–Kac formula that establishes a link between nonlinear PIDEs and stochastic differential equations. The exploitation of the Feynman–Kac representation avoids solving dense linear systems arising from nonlocal operators. Compared with existing stochastic approaches, our method can achieve first-order convergence after balancing the temporal and spatial discretization errors, which is a significant improvement of existing probabilistic/stochastic methods for nonlocal diffusion problems. Error analysis of our numerical scheme is established. The effectiveness of our approach is shown in two numerical examples. The first example considers a three-dimensional nonlocal diffusion equation to numerically verify the error analysis results. The second example presents a physics problem motivated by the study of heat transport in magnetically confined fusion plasmas.},

For the magnetic potential and the order parameter, the discrete scheme adopts the second type Nedélec element and the linear element for spatial discretization, respectively; and a linearized backward Euler method and the first order exponential time differencing method for time discretization, respectively. The maximum bound principle (MBP) of the order parameter and the energy dissipation law in the discrete sense are proved. The discrete energy stability and MBP preservation can guarantee the stability and validity of the numerical simulations, and further facilitate the adoption of an adaptive time-stepping strategy, which often plays an important role in long-time simulations of vortex dynamics, especially when the applied magnetic field is strong. An optimal error estimate of the proposed scheme is also given. Numerical examples verify the theoretical results of the proposed scheme and demonstrate the vortex motions of superconductors in an external magnetic field.},

Simply speaking, fSDEs are SDEs in the context of noncommutative random variables (e.g., large random matrices). By applying the theory of multiple operator integrals, we derive a free Itô formula from Taylor expansion of operator-valued functions. Iterating the free Itô formula allows us to motivate and define fEMM. Then we consider weak and strong convergence in the fSDE setting and prove strong convergence order of and weak convergence order of 1. Numerical examples support the theoretical results and show solutions for equations where no analytical solution is known.},

Our results are obtained by augmenting the lightning approximation set with either a low-degree polynomial basis or partial fractions with poles clustering toward infinity in order to obtain a robust approximation of the smooth behavior of the function. This leads to a significant increase in the achievable accuracy as well as the convergence rate of the numerical scheme. For the approximation of on , the optimal convergence rate as shown by Stahl [Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 28 (1993), pp. 116–122] is now achieved simply by least-squares fitting.},

For this case, many predominant time-stepping methods, including the correction of high-order backward differentiation formula (BDF) schemes [B. Jin, B. Y. Li, and Z. Zhou, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 39 (2017), pp. A3129–A3152], may suffer from a severe order reduction. To fill in this gap, we propose a smoothing method for time-stepping schemes, where the singular term is regularized by using an -fold integral-differential calculus and the equation is discretized by the -step BDF convolution quadrature, called the ID-BDF method. We prove that the desired th-order convergence can be recovered even if the source term is weakly singular and the initial data is not compatible.

Since the swept region may add material, subtract material, or do both when it intersects itself, we cannot apply the conventional divergence theorem without accounting for orientation and self-overlaps. In this work, we encode the swept region orientation and geometry with a map from the unit -dimensional cube, and then apply an oriented analog of divergence theorem to compute the material flux. We present efficient implementation strategies for the presented method. We also provide numerical evidence supporting our results and discuss extensions to more general mesh topologies.},

The basic idea is to choose some junctions between and that can be joined by geodesics locally and then adjust these junctions. It was proved that the sequence of piecewise geodesics generated by this algorithm converges to a geodesic joining and . The present paper investigates leapfrog’s convergence rate of ith junction depending on the manifold M. A relationship is found with the maximal root of a polynomial of degree , where n is the number of geodesic segments. That is, the minimal is upper bounded by , where is a sufficiently small positive constant depending on the curvature of the manifold M. Moreover, we show that increases as n increases. These results are illustrated by implementing leapfrog on two Riemannian manifolds: the unit 2-sphere and the manifold of all symmetric positive definite matrices.},

This paper describes a locally corrected trapezoidal quadrature method for the discretization of singular and hypersingular boundary integral operators (BIOs) that arise in solving boundary value problems for elliptic partial differential equations. The quadrature is based on a uniform grid in parameter space coupled with the standard punctured trapezoidal rule. A key observation is that the error incurred by the singularity in the kernel can be expressed exactly using generalized Euler–Maclaurin formulas that involve the Riemann zeta function in 2 dimensions (2D) and the Epstein zeta functions in 3 dimensions (3D). These expansions are exploited to correct the errors via local stencils at the singular point using a novel systematic moment-fitting approach. This new method provides a unified treatment of all common BIOs (Laplace, Helmholtz, Stokes, etc.). We present numerical examples that show convergence of up to -order in 2D and -order in 3D with respect to the mesh size.},

Then certain variational energy dissipation laws at discrete levels of the corresponding variable-step Crank–Nicolson-type methods are established for time-fractional Allen–Cahn and time-fractional Klein–Gordon-type models. They are shown to be asymptotically compatible with the associated energy laws of the classical Allen–Cahn and Klein–Gordon equations in the associated fractional order limits.

It combines a superconvergent postprocessing technique for the primal variable with an adaptive finite element method via residual minimization. Such a residual minimization procedure is performed on a local postprocessing scheme, commonly used in the context of mixed finite element methods. Given the local nature of that approach, the underlying saddle point problems associated with residual minimizations can be solved with minimal computational effort. We propose and study a posteriori error estimators, including the built-in residual representative associated with residual minimization schemes; and an improved estimator which adds, on the one hand, a residual term quantifying the mismatch between discrete fluxes and, on the other hand, the interelement jumps of the postprocessed solution. We present numerical experiments in two dimensions using Brezzi–Douglas–Marini elements as input for our methodology.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Solution methods for the nonlinear PDE of the Rudin–Osher–Fatemi (ROF) and minimum-surface models are fundamental for many modern applications. Many efficient algorithms have been proposed. First-order methods are common. They are popular due to their simplicity and easy implementation. Some second-order Newton-type iterative methods have been proposed, such as Chan–Golub–Mulet method. In this paper, we propose a new Newton–Krylov solver for primal-dual finite element discretization of the ROF model and the minimum-surface model. The method is so simple that we just need to use some diagonal preconditioners during the iterations. Theoretically, the proposed preconditioners are further proved to be robust and optimal with respect to the mesh size, the penalization parameter, the regularization parameter, and the iterative step; essentially, it is a parameter-independent preconditioner. We first discretize the primal-dual system by using mixed finite element methods and then linearize the discrete system by Newton’s method. Exploiting the well-posedness of the linearized problem on appropriate Sobolev spaces equipped with proper norms, we propose block diagonal preconditioners for the corresponding system solved with the minimum residual method. Numerical results are presented to support the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we develop a conditional Monte Carlo method for solving PDEs involving an integral fractional Laplacian on any bounded domain in arbitrary dimensions. We first construct the Feynman–Kac representation based on the Green function and Poisson kernel for the fractional Laplacian operator on the unit ball in arbitrary dimensions. Then, a conditional trajectory sampling algorithm is proposed for solving fractional PDEs in the complex domain, inspired by the “walk-on-spheres” algorithm proposed in [A. E. Kyprianou, A. Osojnik, and T. Shardlow, IMA J. Numer. Anal., 38 (2018), pp. 1550–1578]. The proposed method finds it remarkably efficient in solving fractional PDEs: it only needs to evaluate the integrals of expectation form over a sequence of balls maximally inscribed in the domains with the known Green function. Moreover, we prove the proposed method is unbiased and develop bounds on the error and mean stopping time. Finally, ample numerical results are presented to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of this approach for fractional PDEs in unit disk and complex domains, and even in ten-dimensional cases.},

In the present paper it is shown that for the class of complete monotonicity-preserving ( -preserving) schemes (which includes the L1 and Grünwald–Letnikov schemes) on uniform meshes , the discrete solution also has decay as . This result is then extended to -preserving discretizations of certain time-fractional nonlinear subdiffusion problems such as the time-fractional porous media and -Laplace equations. For the L1 scheme, the decay result is shown to remain valid on a very general class of nonuniform meshes. Our analysis uses a discrete comparison principle with discrete subsolutions and supersolutions that are carefully constructed to give tight bounds on the discrete solution.

The hybridization combines computational efficiency of finite difference methods on Cartesian grids and geometrical flexibility of discontinuous Galerkin methods on unstructured meshes. The two spatial discretizations are coupled with a penalty technique at the interface such that the overall semidiscretization satisfies a discrete energy estimate to ensure stability. In addition, optimal convergence is obtained in the sense that when combining a fourth order finite difference method with a discontinuous Galerkin method using third order local polynomials, the overall convergence rate is fourth order. Furthermore, we use a novel approach to derive an error estimate for the semidiscretization by combining the energy method and the normal mode analysis for a corresponding one-dimensional model problem.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose a high-order multiscale method for an elliptic model problem with rough and possibly highly oscillatory coefficients. Convergence rates of higher order are obtained using the regularity of the right-hand side only. Hence, no restrictive assumptions on the coefficient, the domain, or the exact solution are required. In the spirit of localized orthogonal decomposition, the method constructs coarse problem-adapted ansatz spaces by solving auxiliary problems on local subdomains. More precisely, our approach is based on the strategy presented by Maier [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 59 (2021), pp. 1067–1089]. The unique selling point of the proposed method is an improved localization strategy curing the effect of deteriorating errors with respect to the mesh size when the local subdomains are not large enough. We present a rigorous a priori error analysis and demonstrate the performance of the method in a series of numerical experiments.},

The purpose of this paper is to analyze a mixed method for the linear elasticity eigenvalue problem, which approximates numerically the stress, displacement, and rotation, by piecewise , and th degree polynomial functions , respectively. The numerical eigenfunction of stress is symmetric. By the discrete -stability of numerical displacement, we prove an approximation to the -orthogonal projection of the eigenspace of exact displacement for the eigenvalue problem with a proper regularity assumption. Thus via postprocessing, we obtain a better approximation to the eigenspace of exact displacement for the eigenproblem than conventional methods. We also prove that numerical approximation to the eigenfunction of stress is locking free with respect to the Poisson ratio. We introduce a hybridization to reduce the mixed method to a condensed eigenproblem and prove an initial approximation (independent of the inverse of the elasticity operator) of the eigenvalue for the nonlinear eigenproblem by using the discrete -stability of numerical displacement, while only an approximation can be obtained if we use the traditional inf-sup condition. Finally, we report some numerical experiments.},

Similar to Runge–Kutta methods, a BIM can be defined by a tableau including two matrices and two vectors. In addition to the general methodology of BIM, we show a special scheme defined by a positive definite matrix and a positive diagonal matrix; both matrix properties are desirable but not available in Runge–Kutta methods. Moreover, we show that the traditional finite element theory for parabolic problems discretized by the backward Euler or Crank–Nicolson schemes can also be extended to BIM. Finally, we introduce some domain decomposition preconditioners for the linear systems of algebraic equations arising from the block implicit discretization in time and the finite element in space. Some numerical results are also reported to show the effectiveness of BIM.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A new approach to solving eigenvalue optimization problems for large structured matrices is proposed and studied. The class of optimization problems considered is related to computing structured pseudospectra and their extremal points, and to structured matrix nearness problems such as computing the distance to instability or to singularity under structured perturbations. The perturbation structure can be a general linear structure. We focus on the practically important cases of large matrices with a given sparsity pattern and on perturbation matrices with given range and corange. It is known that analogous eigenvalue optimization for unstructured complex matrices favorably works with rank-1 matrices. The novelty of the present paper is that structured eigenvalue optimization can still be performed with rank-1 matrices, which yields a significant reduction of storage and in some cases of the computational cost. Optimizers are shown to be rank-1 matrices orthogonally projected onto the given structure. This is used in the numerical algorithms. The numerical approach comes in two different versions. If the rank-1 matrices projected onto the structure form a manifold and if the orthogonal projection onto the corresponding tangent spaces is known and computationally inexpensive, as is the case for matrices with given range and corange, then the method relies on a gradient system on this manifold. Otherwise, in particular for matrices with a given sparsity pattern, the method relies on the orthogonal projection of the free gradient onto the tangent space of the manifold of complex rank-1 matrices. The solution of this rank-1 system is then projected onto the structure. It is shown that there is a bijective correspondence between the stationary points of the gradient system on the structure space and of the rank-1 system. Near a local minimizer the rank-1 tangent projection is very close to the identity map, and so the computationally favorable rank-1 projected system behaves locally like the gradient system. Numerical experiments illustrate the two approaches for large matrices with a given sparsity pattern and for perturbation matrices with given range and corange.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Koopman operators globally linearize nonlinear dynamical systems and their spectral information is a powerful tool for the analysis and decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. However, Koopman operators are infinite dimensional, and computing their spectral information is a considerable challenge. We introduce measure-preserving extended dynamic mode decomposition (mpEDMD), the first Galerkin method whose eigendecomposition converges to the spectral quantities of Koopman operators for general measure-preserving dynamical systems. mpEDMD is a data-driven algorithm based on an orthogonal Procrustes problem that enforces measure-preserving truncations of Koopman operators using a general dictionary of observables. It is flexible and easy to use with any preexisting dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-type method, and with different types of data. We prove convergence of mpEDMD for projection-valued and scalar-valued spectral measures, spectra, and Koopman mode decompositions. For the case of delay embedding (Krylov subspaces), our results include the first convergence rates of the approximation of spectral measures as the size of the dictionary increases. We demonstrate mpEDMD on a range of challenging examples, its increased robustness to noise compared to other DMD-type methods, and its ability to capture the energy conservation and cascade of a turbulent boundary layer flow with Reynolds number and state-space dimension .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, a generalized finite element (FE) method with optimal local approximation spaces for solving high-frequency heterogeneous Helmholtz problems is systematically studied. The local spaces are built from selected eigenvectors of carefully designed local eigenvalue problems defined on generalized harmonic spaces. At both continuous and discrete levels, (i) wavenumber explicit and nearly exponential decay rates for local and global approximation errors are obtained without any assumption on the size of subdomains and (ii) a quasi-optimal convergence of the method is established by assuming that the size of subdomains is ( is the wavenumber). A novel resonance effect between the wavenumber and the dimension of local spaces on the decay of error with respect to the oversampling size is implied by the analysis. Furthermore, for fixed dimensions of local spaces, the discrete local errors are proved to converge as ( denoting the mesh size) toward the continuous local errors. The method at the continuous level extends the plane wave partition of unity method [I. Babuška and J. M. Melenk, Internat. J. Numer. Methods Engrg., 40 (1997), pp. 727–758] to the heterogeneous-coefficients case, and at the discrete level, it delivers an efficient noniterative domain decomposition method for solving discrete Helmholtz problems resulting from standard FE discretizations. Numerical results are provided to confirm the theoretical analysis and to validate the proposed method.},

In particular, we consider problems set in -dimensional periodic domains, with analytic right-hand sides and coefficients. Our analysis covers diffusion-reaction problems, parametric diffusion equations, and certain elliptic systems such as linear isotropic elastostatics in heterogeneous materials. In the constructive proofs, we leverage the exponential convergence of spectral collocation methods for boundary value problems whose solutions are analytic. In the present periodic and analytic setting, this follows from classical elliptic regularity. Within the branch and trunk ONet architecture of Chen and Chen [IEEE. Trans.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, an efficient ensemble domain decomposition algorithm is proposed for fast solving the fully mixed random Stokes–Darcy model with the physically realistic Beavers–Joseph interface conditions. We utilize the Monte Carlo method for the coupled model with random inputs to derive some deterministic Stokes–Darcy numerical models and use the idea of the ensemble to realize the fast computation of multiple problems. One remarkable feature of the algorithm is that multiple linear systems share a common coefficient matrix in each deterministic numerical model, which significantly reduces the computational cost and achieves comparable accuracy with the traditional methods. Moreover, by domain decomposition, we can decouple the Stokes–Darcy system into two smaller subphysics problems naturally. Both mesh-dependent and mesh-independent convergence rates of the algorithm are rigorously derived by choosing suitable Robin parameters. Optimized Robin parameters are derived and analyzed to accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Especially, for small hydraulic conductivity in practice, the almost optimal geometric convergence can be obtained by finite element discretization. Finally, two groups of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the exclusive features of the proposed algorithm.},

A mixed finite element method is proposed, and its stability and convergence are rigorously analyzed.

For Gauss–Hermite quadrature, we obtain matching lower and upper bounds, which turn out to be merely of the order with function evaluations, although the optimal rate for the best possible linear quadrature is known to be . Our proof of the lower bound exploits the structure of the Gauss–Hermite nodes; the bound is independent of the quadrature weights, and changing the Gauss–Hermite weights cannot improve the rate .

The order conditions are further used for constructing numerical methods. The convergence analysis is performed in a Hilbert space setting, where the smoothing effect of the resolvent family is heavily used. For the linear case, we derive the order conditions for general order and prove convergence of order , whenever these conditions are satisfied. In the semilinear case, we consider in addition spatial discretization by a spectral Galerkin method, and we require locally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities. We derive the order conditions for orders one and two, construct methods satisfying these conditions, and prove their convergence.

We consider kernel-based meshfree methods, which are methods of lines with collocation and overtesting spatially, for solving parabolic partial differential equations on surfaces without parametrization.

The approximation at the initial velocity can be replaced by the mean value of the velocities at the different times so that when implementing the method to the fluctuations, as done mostly in practice, only approximations to the time derivatives are included in the set of snapshots. For the POD method we study the differences between projecting onto and . In both cases pointwise in time error bounds can be proved.

In electromagnetism, such a transmission problem can occur if the domain of interest is made of a classical dielectric material and a metal or a metamaterial, with, for instance, an electric permittivity that is strictly negative in the metal or metamaterial. The method is based on an optimal control reformulation of the problem. Contrary to other existing approaches, the convergence of this method is proved without any restrictive condition. In particular, no condition is imposed on the a priori regularity of the solution to the problem, and no condition is imposed on the meshes, other than that they fit with the interface between the two media. Our results are illustrated by some two-dimensional numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We prove that the recently developed semiexplicit symplectic integrators for nonseparable Hamiltonian systems preserve any linear and quadratic invariants possessed by the Hamiltonian systems. This is in addition to being symmetric and symplectic as shown in our previous work; hence, it shares the crucial structure-preserving properties with some of the well-known symplectic Runge–Kutta methods such as the Gauss–Legendre methods. The proof follows two steps: First we show how the extended Hamiltonian system proposed by Pihajoki inherits linear and quadratic invariants in the extended phase space from the original Hamiltonian system. Then we show that this inheritance in turn implies that our integrator preserves the original linear and quadratic invariants in the original phase space. We also analyze preservation/nonpreservation of these invariants by Tao’s extended Hamiltonian system and the extended phase space integrators of Pihajoki and Tao. The paper concludes with numerical demonstrations of our results using a simple test case and a system of point vortices.},

The solution of the model exhibits rapid temporal oscillations with -amplitude and -frequency, which makes classical numerical methods inefficient. We apply the two-scale formulation approach to the problem and propose two new time-symmetric numerical integrators. The methods are proved to have the uniform second order accuracy for all at finite times and some near-conservation laws in long times.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The paper is concerned with the analysis of a popular convex-splitting finite element method (FEM) for the Cahn–Hilliard–Navier–Stokes system, which has been widely used in practice. Since the method is based on a combined approximation to multiple variables involved in the system, the approximation to one of the variables may seriously affect the accuracy for others. Optimal-order error analysis for such combined approximations is challenging. The previous works failed to present optimal error analysis in -norm due to the weakness of the traditional approach. Here we first present an optimal error estimate in -norm for the convex-splitting FEMs. We also show that optimal error estimates in the traditional (interpolation) sense may not always hold for all components in the coupled system due to the nature of the pollution/influence from lower-order approximations. Our analysis is based on two newly introduced elliptic quasi-projections and the superconvergence of negative norm estimates for the corresponding projection errors. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate our theoretical results. More important is that our approach can be extended to many other FEMs and other strongly coupled phase field models to obtain optimal error estimates.},

For the numerical solutions of waveguide scattering problems, an important task is to approximate the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map efficiently. From previous results, the physical solution can be decomposed into a family of generalized eigenfunctions, and thus we can write the DtN map explicitly by these functions. From the exponential decay of the generalized eigenfunctions, we approximate the DtN map by a finite truncation and the approximation is proved to converge exponentially. With the help of the truncated DtN map, the unbounded domain is truncated into a bounded one, and a variational formulation for the problem is set up in this bounded domain. The truncated problem is then solved by a finite element method. The error estimation is also provided for the numerical algorithm, and numerical examples are shown to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.},

In such cases, one is forced to approximate the domain by a sequence of polyhedral domains arising from inexact mesh. We deduce conditions on the quality of these approximations that ensure rates of error convergence between discrete solutions—in the approximate domains—to the continuous one in the original domain. Moreover, we present numerical results validating our claims.},

For coupling problems such as the Navier–Stokes–Darcy problem in porous and fluid layers, a natural question is that, while the orders of polynomials approximating the variables are different, could the lower order elements pollute the higher ones? In this paper, the numerical pollution of a decoupled algorithm for the unsteady convection model in superposed fluid and porous layers is studied. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution to the convection model with Beavers–Joseph–Saffman interface conditions, by using vanishing viscosity methods together with backward-Euler time discretization. Second, an efficient decoupled algorithm of the model based on the Lagrange multiplier method is proposed, and its stability is proved under some restrictions on coefficients and initial values. Then the optimal error estimates are provided revealing that the optimal convergence orders can be achieved without using equal or similar order finite elements for the fluid velocities in fluid and porous layers. This means that there is no numerical pollution between lower and higher order elements when the matched finite element pairs are used. Finally, numerical tests are implemented to verify our theoretical results.},

Optimal control problem is typically solved by first finding the value function through the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (HJE) and then taking the minimizer of the Hamiltonian to obtain the control. In this work, instead of focusing on the value function, we propose a new formulation for the gradient of the value function (value-gradient) as a decoupled system of partial differential equations in the context of a continuous-time deterministic discounted optimal control problem. We develop an efficient iterative scheme for this system of equations in parallel by utilizing the fact that they share the same characteristic curves as the HJE for the value function. For the theoretical part, we prove that this iterative scheme converges linearly in sense for some suitable exponent in a weight function. For the numerical method, we combine a characteristic line method with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we generate multiple characteristic curves at each policy iteration from an ensemble of initial states and compute both the value function and its gradient simultaneously on each curve as the labeled data. Then supervised machine learning is applied to minimize the weighted squared loss for both the value function and its gradients. Experimental results demonstrate that this new method not only significantly increases the accuracy but also improves the efficiency and robustness of the numerical estimates, particularly with less characteristics data or fewer training steps.},

When the underlying function has a singularity, it was observed by Trefethen in 2011 that its Chebyshev interpolants exhibit an error localization property, that is, their errors in a neighborhood of the singularity are obviously larger than elsewhere. In this paper, we first present a pointwise error analysis for Chebyshev projections of functions with a singularity and prove that the rate of convergence of Chebyshev projections of degree at each point away from the singularity is one power of faster than that of at the singularity. This gives a rigorous justification for the error localization of Chebyshev projections. We then extend the framework of our analysis to Chebyshev interpolants, Chebyshev spectral differentiations, and Legendre projections and justify their error localization using similar arguments. As a result, we find that Chebyshev spectral differentiations converge faster than their best counterparts except in a neighborhood of the singularity and, in the particular case where the singularity is located in the interior of interval, they converge even faster than their best counterparts in the maximum norm.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with new error analysis of a lowest-order backward Euler Galerkin-mixed finite element method for the time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau equations. The method is based on a commonly-used nonuniform approximation, in which a linear Lagrange element, the lowest-order Nédélec edge element, and the Raviart–Thomas face element are used for the order parameter , the magnetic field , and the magnetic potential , respectively. This mixed method has been widely used in practical simulations due to its low cost and ease of implementation. In the Ginzburg–Landau model, the order parameter is the most important variable, which indicates the state of the superconductor. An important feature of the method is the inconsistency of the approximation orders. A crucial question is how the first-order approximation of influences the accuracy of . The main purpose of this paper is to establish the second-order accuracy for the order parameter in a spatial direction, although the accuracy for is first order only. Previous analysis only gave the first-order convergence for all three variables due to certain artificial pollution involved in the analysis. Our analysis is based on a nonstandard quasi-projection for and the corresponding more precise estimates, including the -norm. With the quasi-projection, we prove that the lower-order approximation to does not pollute the accuracy of . Our numerical experiments confirm the optimal convergence of . The approach can be extended to many other multiphysics models.},

The numerical attractors are shown to have an optimized bound, which leads to the continuous convergence of the numerical attractors when the graph of the nonlinearity closes to the vertical axis or when the external force vanishes. A new type of Taylor expansion without Fréchet derivatives is established and applied to show the discretization error of order two, which is crucial to prove that the numerical attractors converge upper semicontinuously to the global attractor of the original continuous-time system as the step size of the time goes to zero. It is also proved that the truncated numerical attractors for finitely dimensional systems converge upper semicontinuously to the numerical attractor and the lower semicontinuity holds in special cases.},

Strong stability (or monotonicity)-preserving time discretization schemes preserve the stability properties of the exact solution and have proved very useful in scientific and engineering computation, especially in solving hyperbolic partial differential equations. The main aim of this work is to further extend this to exponential stability-preserving numerical methods for a general coercive system whose solution is exponentially growing or decaying and the rate of growth or decay can be quantified by a function in general vector space with a convex functional. Under the same stepsize condition as for strong stability, sharper exponential stability results are derived for explicit and diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta methods and variable coefficients linear multistep methods for nonlinear problems.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we present, analyze, and test a novel low-complexity time-stepping finite element method for natural convection problems utilizing a time filter (TF). First, via a TF to postprocess the solutions of backward Euler (BE) schemes, we make a minimally intrusive modification to the existing codes to improve the time accuracy by one order. This also provides, at no extra complexity, an estimate of the temporal error,which is easy to construct a novel adaptive algorithm. Additionally, the TF can remove the overdamping of the BE scheme while remaining unconditionally energy stable. Hence, this paper addresses the question, how can one improve the time accuracy without increasing computational and cognitive complexity? Then long time stability and error estimates of BE plus time filter (BETF) with constant time stepsize are proved. Moreover, we construct adaptive algorithms by extending the approach to variable time stepsize, and we extend the methods to higher order algorithms. Finally, numerical tests confirm the convergence rates of our method and validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An extra-stabilized Morley finite element method (FEM) directly computes guaranteed lower eigenvalue bounds with optimal a priori convergence rates for the bi-Laplacian Dirichlet eigenvalues. The smallness assumption in 2D (resp., in 3D) on the maximal mesh-size makes the computed th discrete eigenvalue a lower eigenvalue bound for the th Dirichlet eigenvalue . This holds for multiple and clusters of eigenvalues and serves for the localization of the bi-Laplacian Dirichlet eigenvalues, in particular for coarse meshes. The analysis requires interpolation error estimates for the Morley FEM with explicit constants in any space dimension , which are of independent interest. The convergence analysis in 3D follows the Babuška–Osborn theory and relies on a companion operator for the Morley finite element method. This is based on the Worsey–Farin 3D version of the Hsieh–Clough–Tocher macro element with a careful selection of center points in a further decomposition of each tetrahedron into 12 subtetrahedra. Numerical experiments in 2D support the optimal convergence rates of the extra-stabilized Morley FEM and suggest an adaptive algorithm with optimal empirical convergence rates.},

The main advantage of this discretization is that the divergence of the fluid velocity is pointwise zero at the discrete level. This exactness ensures pressure robustness.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a novel energy-based numerical analysis of semilinear diffusion-reaction boundary value problems, where the nonlinear reaction terms need to be neither monotone nor convex. Based on a suitable variational setting, the proposed computational scheme can be seen as an energy reduction approach. More specifically, this procedure aims to generate a sequence of numerical approximations, which results from the iterative solution of related (stabilized) linearized discrete problems, and tends to a critical point of the underlying energy functional in a stable way. Simultaneously, the finite-dimensional approximation spaces are adaptively refined. This is implemented in terms of a new mesh refinement strategy in the context of finite element discretizations, which again relies on the energy structure of the problem under consideration. In particular, in contrast to more traditional approaches, it does not involve any a posteriori error estimators, and is based on local energy reduction indicators instead. In combination, the resulting adaptive algorithm consists of an iterative linearization procedure on a sequence of hierarchically refined discrete spaces, which we prove to converge toward a solution of the continuous problem in an appropriate sense. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our approach for a series of examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Summation-by-parts (SBP) operators are popular building blocks for systematically developing stable and high-order accurate numerical methods for time-dependent differential equations. The main idea behind existing SBP operators is that the solution is assumed to be well approximated by polynomials up to a certain degree, and the SBP operator should therefore be exact for them. However, polynomials might not provide the best approximation for some problems, and other approximation spaces may be more appropriate. In this paper, a theory for SBP operators based on general function spaces is developed. We demonstrate that most of the established results for polynomial-based SBP operators carry over to this general class of SBP operators. Our findings imply that the concept of SBP operators can be applied to a significantly larger class of methods than is currently known. We exemplify the general theory by considering trigonometric, exponential, and radial basis functions.},

We propose a novel turbulence model, NS- -C, from the recently introduced family of LES-C (large eddy simulation with correction) models. Combining it with the so-called geometric averaging (GA) partitioning method, we obtain the NS- -C-GA model that is shown to possess several key properties. First, the preexisting solvers for the subdomains can be used, which is critical, e.g., for atmosphere-ocean applications. Second, the LES-C turbulence models use defect correction to efficiently reduce the modeling error of the corresponding LES models; we demonstrate numerically that the NS- -C model outperforms its LES counterpart, the NS- model. It has also been shown recently that it is favorable for an LES model to have the nonfiltered velocity in the interface terms. The NS- -C-GA model possesses this important property; we also show it to be stable and have optimal convergence properties.},

Continuity of flux (mass conservation) across space-time interfaces is imposed via a coarse-scale space-time mortar variable that approximates the primary variable. Uniqueness, existence, and stability as well as a priori error estimates for the spatial and temporal errors are established. A space-time nonoverlapping domain decomposition method is developed that reduces the global problem to a space-time coarse-scale mortar interface problem. Each interface iteration involves solving in parallel space-time subdomain problems. The spectral properties of the interface operator and the convergence of the interface iteration are analyzed.

The two-level PHSI method may compute simple eigenpairs, multiple eigenpairs, and clustered eigenpairs. It is very efficient and robust for solving Maxwell eigenvalue problems since the method reduces solutions of fine eigenvalue problems to a series of solutions of parallel preconditioned systems and Helmholtz projected systems. After solving a small dimensional eigenvalue problem in a trial subspace, we finally get the total error reduction of the first several discrete eigenvalues as , where is a positive parameter, is the overlapping size among subdomains, and is the diameter of subdomains. The positive number is independent of the mesh size and internal gaps among the first several Maxwell eigenvalues, i.e., the method is optimal corresponding to the degrees of freedom and cluster robust. The number increases with increasing, and decreases with increasing. The -dependent constant decreases monotonically to 1 as , which means the more the number of subdomains, the better the convergence rate. Numerical results supporting our theory are given.},

By introducing a novel surface energy matrix which depends on the Cahn–Hoffman -vector and a stabilizing function , we first reformulate the equation into a conservative form and derive a new symmetrized variational formulation for anisotropic surface diffusion with weakly or strongly anisotropic surface energies. Then, a semidiscretization in space for the variational formulation is proposed, and its area conservation and energy dissipation properties are proved. The semidiscretization is further discretized in time by an implicit structural-preserving scheme (SP-PFEM) which can rigorously preserve the enclosed area in the fully discrete level. Furthermore, we prove that the SP-PFEM is unconditionally energy-stable for almost any anisotropic surface energy under a simple and mild condition on .

  abstract     = {Abstract. Neural field models are nonlinear integro-differential equations for the evolution of neuronal activity, and they are a prototypical large-scale, coarse-grained neuronal model in continuum cortices. Neural fields are often simulated heuristically and, in spite of their popularity in mathematical neuroscience, their numerical analysis is not yet fully established. We introduce generic projection methods for neural fields and derive a priori error bounds for these schemes. We extend an existing framework for stationary integral equations to the time-dependent case, which is relevant for neuroscience applications. We find that the convergence rate of a projection scheme for a neural field is determined to a great extent by the convergence rate of the projection operator. This abstract analysis, which unifies the treatment of collocation and Galerkin schemes, is carried out in operator form, without resorting to quadrature rules for the integral term, which are introduced only at a later stage, and whose choice depends on the choice of the projector. Using an elementary time stepper as an example, we demonstrate that the error in a time stepper has two separate contributions: one from the projector and one from the time discretization. We give examples of concrete projection methods: two collocation schemes (piecewise linear and spectral collocation) and two Galerkin schemes (finite element and spectral Galerkin); for each of them we derive error bounds from the general theory, introduce several discrete variants, provide implementation details, and present reproducible convergence tests.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A method to compute guaranteed lower bounds to the eigenvalues of the Maxwell system in two or three space dimensions is proposed as a generalization of the method of Liu and Oishi [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51 (2013), pp. 1634–1654] for the Laplace operator. The main tool is the computation of an explicit upper bound to the error of the Galerkin projection. The error is split into two parts. One part is controlled by a hypercircle principle and an auxiliary eigenvalue problem. The second part requires a perturbation argument for the right-hand side replaced by a suitable piecewise polynomial. The latter error is controlled through the use of the commuting quasi-interpolation by Falk and Winther and computational bounds on its stability constant. This situation is different from the Laplace operator where such a perturbation is easily controlled through local Poincaré inequalities. The practical viability of the approach is demonstrated in test cases for two and three space dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Importance sampling (IS) is valuable in reducing the variance of Monte Carlo sampling for many areas, including finance, rare event simulation, and Bayesian inference. It is natural and obvious to combine quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods with IS to achieve a faster rate of convergence. However, a naive replacement of Monte Carlo with QMC may not work well. This paper investigates the convergence rates of randomized QMC-based IS for estimating integrals with respect to a Gaussian measure, in which the IS measure is a Gaussian or distribution. We prove that if the target function satisfies the so-called boundary growth condition and the covariance matrix of the IS density has eigenvalues no smaller than 1, then randomized QMC with the Gaussian proposal has a root mean squared error of for arbitrarily small . Similar results with a distribution as the proposal are also established. These sufficient conditions help to assess the effectiveness of IS in QMC. For some particular applications, we find that the Laplace IS, a very general approach to approximate the target function by a quadratic Taylor approximation around its mode, has eigenvalues smaller than 1, making the resulting integrand less favorable for QMC. From this point of view, when using Gaussian distributions as the IS proposal, a change of measure via Laplace IS may transform a favorable integrand into an unfavorable one for QMC although the variance of Monte Carlo sampling is reduced. We also study the effect of positivization tricks on the error rate when the integrand has mixed sign. If the smooth positivization proposed by Owen and Zhou (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc., 95 (2000), pp. 135–143) is used, the rate is retained. This is not the case if taking the positive and negative parts of the integrand. We also give some examples to verify our propositions and warn against naive replacement of Monte Carlo with QMC under IS proposals. Numerical results suggest that using Laplace IS with distributions is more robust than that with Gaussian distributions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Preintegration is an extension of conditional Monte Carlo to quasi–Monte Carlo and randomized quasi–Monte Carlo. Conditioning can reduce but not increase the variance in Monte Carlo. For quasi–Monte Carlo it can bring about improved regularity of the integrand with potentially greatly improved accuracy. We show theoretically that, just as in Monte Carlo, preintegration can reduce but not increase the variance when one uses scrambled net integration. Preintegration is ordinarily done by integrating out one of the input variables to a function. In the common case of a Gaussian integral one can also preintegrate over any linear combination of variables. For continuous functions that are differentiable almost everywhere, we propose to choose the linear combination by the first principal component in an active subspace decomposition. We show that the lead eigenvector in an active subspace decomposition is closely related to the vector that maximizes a computationally intractable criterion using a Sobol’ index. A numerical example of Asian option pricing finds that this active subspace preintegration strategy is competitive with preintegrating the first principal component of the Brownian motion, which is known to be very effective. The new method outperforms others on some basket and rainbow options where there is no generally accepted counterpart to the principal components construction.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the present paper we initiate the challenging task of building a mathematically sound theory for adaptive virtual element methods (AVEMs). Among the realm of polygonal meshes, we restrict our analysis to triangular meshes with hanging nodes in two dimensions—the simplest meshes with a systematic refinement procedure that preserves shape regularity and optimal complexity. A major challenge in the a posteriori error analysis of AVEMs is the presence of the stabilization term, which is of the same order as the residual-type error estimator but prevents the equivalence of the latter with the energy error. Under the assumption that any chain of recursively created hanging nodes has uniformly bounded length, we show that the stabilization term can be made arbitrarily small relative to the error estimator provided the stabilization parameter of the scheme is sufficiently large. This quantitative estimate leads to stabilization-free upper and lower a posteriori bounds for the energy error. This novel and crucial property of VEMs hinges on the largest subspace of continuous piecewise linear functions and the delicate interplay between its coarser scales and the finer ones of the VEM space. An important consequence for piecewise constant data is a contraction property between consecutive loops of AVEMs, which we also prove. Our results apply to -conforming (lowest order) VEMs of any kind, including the classical and enhanced VEMs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Filtering for stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) is an important problem in systems/synthetic biology aiming to estimate the state of unobserved chemical species. A good solution to it can provide scientists valuable information about the hidden dynamic state and enable optimal feedback control. Usually, the model parameters need to be inferred simultaneously with state variables, and a conventional particle filter can fail to solve this problem accurately due to sample degeneracy. In this case, the regularized particle filter (RPF) is preferred to the conventional ones, as the RPF can mitigate sample degeneracy by perturbing particles with artificial noise. However, the artificial noise introduces an additional bias to the estimate, and, thus, it is questionable whether the RPF can provide reliable results for SRNs. In this paper, we aim to identify conditions under which the RPF converges to the exact filter in the filtering problem determined by a bimolecular network. First, we establish computationally efficient RPFs for SRNs on different scales using different dynamical models, including the continuous-time Markov process, tau-leaping model, and piecewise deterministic process. Then, by parameter sensitivity analyses, we show that the established RPFs converge to the exact filters if all reactions leading to an increase of the molecular population have linearly growing propensities and some other mild conditions are satisfied simultaneously. This ensures the performance of the RPF for a large class of SRNs, and several numerical examples are presented to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we propose a novel thermodynamically compatible finite volume scheme for the numerical solution of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in one and two space dimensions. As shown by Godunov in 1972, the MHD system can be written as overdetermined symmetric hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible (SHTC) system. More precisely, the MHD equations are symmetric hyperbolic in the sense of Friedrichs and satisfy the first and second principles of thermodynamics. In a more recent work on SHTC systems [E. Romenski, Math. Comput. Modelling, 28 (1998), pp. 115–130], the entropy density is a primary evolution variable, and total energy conservation can be shown to be a consequence that is obtained after a judicious linear combination of all other evolution equations. The objective of this paper is to mimic the SHTC framework also on the discrete level by directly discretizing the entropy inequality, instead of the total energy conservation law, while total energy conservation is obtained via an appropriate linear combination as a consequence of the thermodynamically compatible discretization of all other evolution equations. As such, the proposed finite volume scheme satisfies a discrete cell entropy inequality by construction and can be proven to be nonlinearly stable in the energy norm due to the discrete energy conservation. In multiple space dimensions the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field is taken into account via a new thermodynamically compatible generalized Lagrangian multiplier (GLM) divergence cleaning approach. The fundamental properties of the scheme proposed in this paper are mathematically rigorously proven. The new method is applied to some standard MHD benchmark problems in one and two space dimensions, obtaining good results in all cases.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce an unfitted finite element method with Lagrange-multipliers to study an Eulerian time stepping scheme for moving domain problems applied to a model problem where the domain motion is implicit to the problem. We consider a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) in the bulk domain, and the domain motion is described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE), coupled to the bulk PDE through the transfer of forces at the moving interface. The discretization is based on an unfitted finite element discretization on a time-independent mesh. The method-of-lines time discretization is enabled by an implicit extension of the bulk solution through additional stabilization, as introduced by Lehrenfeld and Olshanskii [M2AN Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 53 (2019), pp. 585–614]. The analysis of the coupled problem relies on the Lagrange-multiplier formulation, the fact that the Lagrange-multiplier solution is equal to the normal stress at the interface and that the motion of the interface is given through rigid body motion. This paper covers the complete stability analysis of the method and an error estimate in the energy norm, under an assumption on the discrete interface velocity. This includes the dynamic error in the domain motion resulting from the discretized ODE and the forces from the discretized PDE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first error analysis of this type of coupled moving domain problem in a fully Eulerian framework. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the numerical simulation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), keeping the pressure and density always positive is essential for both physical considerations and numerical stability. This is however a challenging task, due to the underlying relation between such a positivity-preserving (PP) property and the magnetic divergence-free (DF) constraint as well as the strong nonlinearity of the MHD equations. In this paper, we present the first rigorous PP analysis of the central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) methods and construct arbitrarily high-order provably PP CDG schemes for ideal MHD. By the recently developed geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach, our analysis reveals that the PP property of standard CDG methods is closely related to a discrete magnetic DF condition, whose form was unknown prior to our analysis and differs from that for the noncentral discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite volume methods in [K. Wu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 56 (2018), pp. 2124–2147]. The discovery of this relation lays the foundation for the design of our PP CDG schemes. In the one-dimensional (1D) case, the discrete DF condition is naturally satisfied, and we rigorously prove that the standard CDG method is PP under a condition that can be enforced easily with an existing PP limiter. However, in the multidimensional cases, the corresponding discrete DF condition is highly nontrivial, yet critical, and we analytically prove that the standard CDG method, even with the PP limiter, is not PP in general, as it generally fails to meet the discrete DF condition. We address this issue by carefully analyzing the structure of the discrete divergence terms and then constructing new locally DF CDG schemes for Godunov’s modified MHD equations with an additional source term. The key point is to find out the suitable discretization of the source term such that it exactly cancels out all the terms in the discovered discrete DF condition. Based on the GQL approach, we prove in theory the PP property of the new multidimensional CDG schemes under a CFL condition. The robustness and accuracy of the proposed PP CDG schemes are further validated by several demanding 1D, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional numerical MHD examples, including the high-speed jets and blast problems with very low plasma beta.},

This is followed by rank truncation within a specified error tolerance. The memory requirements are linear in the order of the tensor and linear in the maximal mode dimension. The integrator is robust to small singular values of matricizations of the connection tensors. Up to the rank truncation error, which is controlled by the given error tolerance, the integrator preserves norm and energy for Schrödinger equations, and it dissipates the energy in gradient systems.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, a difference finite element method for the 3D steady Navier–Stokes equations is presented. This new method consists of transmitting the finite element solution of the three-dimensional (3D) steady Navier–Stokes equations into a series of the finite element solutions of the 2D steady Oseen iterative equations, which are solved by using the finite element pair satisfying the discrete inf-sup condition in a 2D domain . In addition, we use finite element pair to solve the 3D steady Oseen iterative equations, where the velocity-pressure pair satisfies the discrete inf-sup condition in a 3D domain under the quasi-uniform mesh condition. To overcome the difficulty of nonlinearity, we apply the Oseen iterative method and present the weak formulation of the difference finite element method for solving the 3D steady Oseen iterative equations. Moreover, we provide the existence and uniqueness of the difference finite element solutions of the 3D steady Oseen iterative equations and deduce the first order convergence with respect to of the difference finite element solutions to the exact solution of the 3D steady Navier–Stokes equations. Finally, some numerical tests are presented to show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we analyze a method for approximating the distribution function and density of a random variable that depends in a nontrivial way on a possibly high number of independent random variables, each with support on the whole real line. Starting with the integral formulations of the distribution and density, the method involves smoothing the original integrand by preintegration with respect to one suitably chosen variable, and then applying a suitable quasi–Monte Carlo method to compute the integral of the resulting smoother function. Interpolation is then used to reconstruct the distribution or density on an interval. The preintegration technique is a special case of conditional sampling, a method that has previously been applied to a wide range of problems in statistics and computational finance. In particular, the pointwise approximation studied in this work is a specific case of the conditional density estimator previously considered by L’Ecuyer, Puchhammer, and Ben Abdellah INFORMS J. Comput., 34 (2022), pp. 1729–1748]. Our theory provides a rigorous regularity analysis of the preintegrated function, which is then used to show that the errors of the pointwise and interpolated estimators can both achieve nearly first-order convergence. Numerical results support the theory.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We construct two new classes of log orthogonal functions in semi-infinite intervals, log orthogonal functions (LOFs-II) and generalized log orthogonal functions (GLOFs-II), by applying a suitable log mapping to Laguerre polynomials. We develop basic approximation theory for these new orthogonal functions and show that they can provide uniformly good exponential convergence rates for problems in semi-infinite intervals with slow decay at infinity. We apply them to solve several linear and nonlinear differential equations whose solutions decay algebraically or exponentially with very slow rates, and we present ample numerical results to show the effectiveness of the approximations by LOFs-II and GLOFs-II.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method with the convex-concave splitting temporal discretization for solving the Cahn–Hilliard equation. We establish optimal convergence rates for the scalar variables and the flux variables in the norm for polynomials of degree . The error constants depend on inverse of the interface thickness in polynomial orders, which is obtained by utilizing a spectral-type estimate of the discrete Cahn–Hilliard operator in the HDG framework. In terms of degrees of freedom of the globally coupled unknowns, the scalar variables are superconvergent. Numerical results are reported to corroborate the theoretical convergence rates and the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we consider the density estimation problem associated with the stationary measure of ergodic Itô diffusions from a discrete-time series that approximate the solutions of the stochastic differential equations. To take advantage of the characterization of density function through the stationary solution of a parabolic-type Fokker–Planck PDE, we proceed as follows: First, we employ deep neural networks to approximate the drift and diffusion terms of the SDE by solving appropriate supervised learning tasks. Subsequently, we solve a steady-state Fokker–Planck equation associated with the estimated drift and diffusion coefficients with a neural-network–based least squares method. We establish the convergence of the proposed scheme under appropriate mathematical assumptions, accounting for the generalization errors induced by regressing the drift and diffusion coefficients and the PDE solvers. This theoretical study relies on a recent perturbation theory of Markov chain result that shows a linear dependence of the density estimation to the error in estimating the drift term and generalization error results of nonparametric regression and PDE regression solution obtained with neural-network models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by numerical simulations of a two-dimensional Student t-distribution and a 20-dimensional Langevin dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Quantum-classical molecular dynamics, as a partial classical limit of the full quantum Schrödinger equation, is a widely used framework for quantum molecular dynamics. The underlying equations are nonlinear in nature, containing a quantum part (representing the electrons) and a classical part (standing for the nuclei). An accurate simulation of the wave function typically requires a time step comparable to the rescaled Planck constant , resulting in a formidable cost when . We prove an additive observable error bound of Schwartz observables for the proposed time-splitting schemes based on semiclassical analysis, which decreases as becomes smaller. Furthermore, we establish a uniform-in- observable error bound, which allows for an time step to accurately capture the physical observable regardless of the size of .

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stokes variational inequalities arise in the formulation of glaciological problems involving contact. We consider the problem of a two-dimensional marine ice sheet with a grounding line, although the analysis presented here is extendable to other contact problems in glaciology, such as that of subglacial cavitation. The analysis of this problem and its discretization is complicated by the nonlinear rheology commonly used for modelling ice, the enforcement of a friction boundary condition given by a power law, and the presence of rigid modes in the velocity space, which render the variational inequality semicoercive. In this work, we consider a mixed formulation of this variational inequality involving a Lagrange multiplier and provide an analysis of its finite element approximation. Error estimates in the presence of rigid modes are obtained by means of a specially-built projection operator onto the subspace of rigid modes and a Korn-type inequality. These proofs rely on the fact that the subspace of rigid modes is at most one-dimensional. Numerical results are reported to validate the error estimates.},
