  abstract     = {Abstract. Lionel Levine’s hat challenge has players, each with a (very large or infinite) stack of hats on their head, each hat independently colored at random black or white. The players are allowed to coordinate before the random colors are chosen, but not after. Each player sees all hats except for those on her own head. They then proceed to simultaneously try and each pick a black hat from their respective stacks. They are proclaimed successful only if they are all correct. Levine’s conjecture is that the success probability tends to zero when the number of players grows. We prove that this success probability is strictly decreasing in the number of players, and present some connections to problems in graph theory: relating the size of the largest independent set in a graph and in a random induced subgraph of it, and bounding the size of a set of vertices intersecting every maximum-size independent set in a graph.},

We show that no orientation of an odd cycle is quasirandom-forcing. In the case of even cycles, we find sufficient conditions on an orientation to be quasirandom-forcing, which we complement by identifying necessary conditions. Using our general results and spectral techniques used to obtain them, we classify which orientations of cycles of length up to 10 are quasirandom-forcing.},

We prove that for every sufficiently large integer , it is -hard to decide whether the orthogonality dimension of a given graph over is at most or at least . We further prove such hardness results for the orthogonality dimension over finite fields as well as for the closely related minrank parameter, which is motivated by the index coding problem in information theory. This in particular implies that it is -hard to approximate these graph quantities to within any constant factor. Previously, the hardness of approximation was known to hold either assuming certain variants of the unique games conjecture or for approximation factors smaller than . The proofs involve the concept of line digraphs and bounds on their orthogonality dimension and on the minrank of their complement.},

Inspired by the FPT algorithm for Perfect Code, we further explore two more domination problems on the graphs of bounded closure. The other problems that we study are Connected Dominating Set and Partial Dominating Set. We show that Perfect Code and Connected Dominating Set are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by , whereas Partial Dominating Set, parameterized by is -hard even when . We also show that for each fixed , Perfect Code admits a polynomial kernel on the class of -closed graphs.

We create a framework for hereditary graph classes built on a two-dimensional grid of vertices and edge sets defined by a triple of objects that define edges between consecutive columns, edges between nonconsecutive columns (called bonds), and edges within columns. This framework captures a large family of minimal hereditary classes of graphs of unbounded clique-width, some previously identified and many new ones, although we do not claim this includes all such classes. We show that a graph class has unbounded clique-width if and only if a certain parameter is unbounded. We further show that is minimal of unbounded clique-width (and, indeed, minimal of unbounded linear clique-width) if another parameter is bounded, and also has defined recurrence characteristics. Both the parameters and are properties of a triple and measure the number of distinct neighborhoods in certain auxiliary graphs. Throughout our work, we introduce new methods to the study of clique-width, including the use of Ramsey theory in arguments related to unboundedness, and explicit (linear) clique-width expressions for subclasses of minimal classes of unbounded clique-width.},

Noting that , signed projective cube of dimension , is the signed (Cayley) graph built on where two binary strings at Hamming distance 1 are adjacent by a positive edge and those at Hamming distance are adjacent by a negative edge.

In special cases we have the following: I. A simple graph is 4-colorable if and only if . II. A signed bipartite graph maps to if and only if noting that is the same as , that is, a signed graph on where the set of negative edges forms a perfect matching. On restriction to planar graphs, I is then a restatement of the 4-color theorem, and II is implied by an unpublished work of Guenin. After further development of this theory of packing in signed graphs, we give an independent proof of II, which works on the larger class of -minor-free graphs. More precisely, we prove the following theorem. Theorem. If is a -minor-free bipartite simple graph, then for any signature we have . The statement is shown to be strictly stronger than the 4-color theorem and is proved assuming it. Furthermore, we show that I cannot be extended to the class of all signed planar simple graphs.

We identify all events where the structure of the Voronoi diagram changes, bound the number of such events, and then develop a kinetic data structure (KDS) that maintains the geodesic Voronoi diagram as the sites move. To this end, we first analyze how often a single bisector, defined by two sites, or a single Voronoi center, defined by three sites, can change. For both these structures we prove that the number of such changes is at most , and that this is tight in the worst case. Moreover, we develop compact, responsive, local, and efficient KDSs for both structures. Our data structures use linear space and process a worst-case optimal number of events. Our bisector and Voronoi center KDSs handle each event in time. Both structures can be extended to efficiently support updating the movement of the sites as well. Using these data structures as building blocks, we obtain a compact KDS for maintaining the full geodesic Voronoi diagram.},

The Metric Dimension problem takes as input a graph and a positive integer , and asks whether there exists a resolving set of size at most . This problem was introduced in the 1970s and is known to be NP-hard [M. R. Garey and D. S. Johnson, Computers and Intractability—A Guide to NP-Completeness, Freeman, San Francisco, 1979]. In the realm of parameterized complexity, Hartung and Nichterlein [28th Conference on Computational Complexity, IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, 2013, pp. 266–276] proved that the problem is W[2]-hard when parameterized by the natural parameter . They also observed that it is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the vertex cover number and asked about its complexity under smaller parameters, in particular, the feedback vertex set number. We answer this question by proving that Metric Dimension is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the combined parameter feedback vertex set number plus pathwidth. This also improves the result of Bonnet and Purohit [IPEC 2019] which states that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the pathwidth. On the positive side, we show that Metric Dimension is FPT when parameterized by either the distance to cluster or the distance to cocluster, both of which are smaller parameters than the vertex cover number.},

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events partition a gene tree , and thus its leaf set , into subsets of genes whose evolutionary history is described by speciation and duplication events alone. Two genes thus are xenologs if and only if they belong to two different sets of this partition . Indirect phylogenetic methods can be used to infer the partition of from sequence similarity or evolutionary distances without any a priori knowledge about the underlying tree . In this contribution, we assume that a partition of the gene set and a usually incompletely resolved estimate of the original gene tree on are known. We then ask to what extent and can be combined to determine the horizontal transfer edges in and thus the orientation of the HGT events that separate the sets of . If and are compatible, it can be decided for each pair of genes and whether there always exists or never exists a horizontal gene transfer in along the path connecting and the most recent common ancestor of and , and thus a directed edge in the so-called Fitch graph of the gene family. We generalize this result to insufficiently resolved gene trees. We show that the classification of a gene pair can be computed in constant time after linear-time preprocessing. Using simulated gene family histories, we observe empirically that the vast majority of horizontal transfer edges in the gene tree can be recovered unambiguously from the knowledge of the partition .

  abstract     = {Abstract. The influence of a variable is an important concept in the analysis of Boolean functions. The more general notion of influence of a set of variables on a Boolean function has four separate definitions in the literature. In the present work, we introduce a new definition of influence of a set of variables which is based on the auto-correlation function and develop its basic theory. Among the new results that we obtain are generalizations of the Poincaré inequality and the edge expansion property of the influence of a single variable. Further, we obtain new characterizations of resilient and bent functions using the notion of influence. We show that the previous definition of influence due to Fischer et al. [Proceedings of the 43rd Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 2002), Vancouver, BC, Canada, IEEE Computer Society, 2002, pp. 103–112] and Blais [Proceedings of the 41st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, STOC 2009, M. Mitzenmacher, ed., Bethesda, MD, ACM, 2009, pp. 151–158] is half the value of the auto-correlation based influence that we introduce. Regarding the other prior notions of influence, we make a detailed study of these and show that each of these definitions does not satisfy one or more desirable properties that a notion of influence may be expected to satisfy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by an application in cancer genomics, Hajirasouliha and Raphael [Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics, 2014, pp. 354–367] proposed the split-row problem (SR). In this problem, an binary matrix is given. A split-row operation on is defined as replacing a row by rows whose bitwise OR is equal to . The cost of the operation is the number of additional rows induced, that is, . The goal is to find a sequence of split-row operations that transforms into a matrix corresponding to a perfect phylogeny and the total cost is minimized. Recently, Hujdurović et al. [ACM Trans. Algorithms, 14 (2018), 26] proved the APX-hardness of SR and presented efficient exact and approximation algorithms. The parameterized study of SR was left as a direction for future work. Let denote the minimum total cost. This paper gives an -time exact algorithm for SR. This result indicates that SR is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by . In addition, in the worst case, our algorithm requires time, significantly improving the previous upper bound of . Hujdurović et al.’s exact algorithm can be modified to solve a variant of SR, called the distinct split-row problem (DSR). Our algorithm can be adapted to this variant as well. In addition, our algorithms can be extended to solve SR and DSR with the following additional constraint: only the rows in a given subset are allowed to be split.},

In this work, we describe the general class of tensor codes and we study their invariants corresponding to different families of anticodes. In our context, an anticode is a perfect space that has some additional properties. A perfect space is one that is spanned by tensors of rank 1. Our use of the anticode concept is motivated by an interest in capturing structural properties of tensor codes. In particular, we indentify four different classes of tensor anticodes and show how these gives different information on the codes they describe. We also define the binomial moments and the weight distribution of a code with respect to a family of anticodes and establish a bijection between these invariants. We use the binomial moments to define the concept of a binomial moment determined code, which is an extremal code in relation to an inequality arising from them. Finally, we give MacWilliams identities for binomial moments.},

We prove that for any and any graph with vertices, there exists a constant such that for any sufficiently large with , if is an -vertex graph with and is a -bounded incompatibility system, then there exists a compatible -factor in , where the value is either the chromatic number or the critical chromatic number and we provide a dichotomy as in the Kühn–Osthus result.

In the second model, each vertex independently chooses a subset of edge labels from uniformly at random. Edge is then defined to be exactly those vertices whose -subsets include label .

Furthermore, we obtain nearly matching asymptotic upper bounds on the discrepancy. Specifically, we apply the partial coloring lemma of Lovett and Meka to show that, in the dense regime, with high probability the two random hypergraph models each have discrepancy .

The celebrated dependent random choice lemma states that in a bipartite graph, an average vertex (weighted by its degree) has the property that almost all small subsets in its neighborhood have a common neighborhood almost as large as in the random graph of the same edge-density. There are two well-known applications of this lemma. The first is a theorem of Füredi [Combinatorica, 11 (1991), pp. 75–79] and Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov [Combin. Probab. Comput., 12 (2003), pp. 477–494] showing that the maximum number of edges in an -vertex graph not containing a fixed bipartite graph with maximum degree at most on one side is . This was recently extended by Grzesik, Janzer, and Nagy [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 156 (2022), pp. 299–309] to the family of so-called -blowups of a tree. A second application is a theorem of Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov [Geom. Funct. Anal., 20 (2010), pp. 1354–1366], confirming a special case of a conjecture of Erdős and Simonovits and of Sidorenko, showing that if is a bipartite graph that contains a vertex that is completely joined to the other part and is a graph, then the probability that the uniform random mapping from to is a homomorphism is at least . In this paper, we introduce a nested variant of the dependent random choice lemma, which might be of independent interest. We then apply it to obtain a common extension of the theorem of Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov and the theorem of Grzesik, Janzer, and Nagy regarding Turán and Sidorenko properties of so-called tree-degenerate graphs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Dynamic pricing schemes were introduced as an alternative to posted-price mechanisms. In contrast to static models, the dynamic setting allows us to update the prices between buyer-arrivals based on the remaining sets of items and buyers, and so it is capable of maximizing social welfare without the need for a central coordinator. In this paper, we study the existence of optimal dynamic pricing schemes in combinatorial markets. In particular, we concentrate on multidemand valuations, a natural extension of unit-demand valuations. The proposed approach is based on computing an optimal dual solution of the maximum social welfare problem with distinguished structural properties. Our contribution is twofold. By relying on an optimal dual solution, we show the existence of optimal dynamic prices in unit-demand markets and in multidemand markets up to three buyers, thus giving new interpretations of results of Cohen-Addad et al. [Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation, 2016, pp. 383–400] and Berger, Eden, and Feldman [Proceedings of the International Conference on Web and Internet Economics, Springer, 2020, pp. 206–219], respectively. Furthermore, we provide an optimal dynamic pricing scheme for bidemand valuations with an arbitrary number of buyers. In all cases, our proofs also provide efficient algorithms for determining the optimal dynamic prices.},

For a regular polyhedron (or polygon) centered at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices are eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian for the skeleton of that polyhedron (or polygon) associated with the first nontrivial eigenvalue. In this paper, we generalize this relationship. For a given graph, we study the eigenvalue optimization problem of maximizing the first nontrivial eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian over nonnegative edge weights. We show that the spectral realization of the graph using the eigenvectors corresponding to the solution of this problem, under certain assumptions, is a centered, unit-distance graph realization that has maximal total variance. This result gives a new method for generating unit-distance graph realizations and is based on convex duality. A drawback of this method is that the dimension of the realization is given by the multiplicity of the extremal eigenvalue, which is typically unknown prior to solving the eigenvalue optimization problem. Our results are illustrated with a number of examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Approximating the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model with general external fields is known to be #BIS-hard in the worst case, even for bounded-degree graphs, and it is widely believed that no polynomial-time approximation scheme exists. This motivates an average-case question: are there classes of instances for which polynomial-time approximation schemes exist? We investigate this question for the random field Ising model on graphs with maximum degree . We establish the existence of fully polynomial-time approximation schemes and samplers with high probability over the random fields if the external fields are independent and identically distributed Gaussians with variance larger than a constant depending only on the inverse temperature and . Our methods work more generally for external fields that are large in absolute value with high probability. The main challenge is that such a hypothesis does not rule out the existence of a positive density of vertices at which the external field is small. These regions, which may have connected components of size , are a barrier to algorithms based on establishing zero-free regions of partition functions and cause worst-case analyses of Glauber dynamics to fail. The analysis of our algorithm is based on percolation on a self-avoiding walk tree.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For many algorithmic problems on graphs of treewidth , a standard dynamic programming approach gives algorithms with time and space complexity . It turns out that when one considers the more restrictive parameter treedepth, it is often the case that a variation of this technique can be used to reduce the space complexity to polynomial, while retaining time complexity of the form , where is the treedepth. This transfer of methodology is, however, far from automatic. For instance, for problems with connectivity constraints, standard dynamic programming techniques give algorithms with time and space complexity on graphs of treewidth , but it is not clear how to convert them into time-efficient polynomial space algorithms for graphs of low treedepth. Cygan et al. [ACM Trans. Algorithms, 18 (2022), 17] introduced the Cut&amp;Count technique and showed that a certain class of problems with connectivity constraints can be solved in time and space complexity . Recently, Hegerfeld and Kratsch (STACS’20) showed that, for some of those problems, the Cut&amp;Count technique can be also applied in the setting of treedepth, and it gives algorithms with running time and polynomial space usage. However, several important problems eluded such a treatment, with the most prominent examples being Hamiltonian Cycle and Longest Path. In this paper, we clarify the situation by showing that Hamiltonian cycle, Hamiltonian Path, Long Cycle, Long Path, and Min Cycle Cover all admit -time and polynomial space algorithms on graphs of treedepth . The algorithms are randomized Monte Carlo with only false negatives.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In 1993, Savage, Squire, and West described an inductive construction for generating every acyclic orientation of a chordal graph exactly once, flipping one arc at a time. We provide two generalizations of this result. First, we describe Gray codes for acyclic orientations of hypergraphs that satisfy a simple ordering condition, which generalizes the notion of perfect elimination order of graphs. This unifies the Savage–Squire–West construction with a recent algorithm for generating elimination trees of chordal graphs. Second, we consider quotients of lattices of acyclic orientations of chordal graphs, and we provide a Gray code for them, addressing a question raised by Pilaud. This also generalizes a recent algorithm for generating lattice congruences of the weak order on the symmetric group. Our algorithms are derived from the Hartung–Hoang–Mütze–Williams combinatorial generation framework, and they yield simple algorithms for computing Hamilton paths and cycles on large classes of polytopes, including chordal nestohedra and quotientopes. In particular, we derive an efficient implementation of the Savage–Squire–West construction. Along the way, we give an overview of old and recent results about the polyhedral and order-theoretic aspects of acyclic orientations of graphs and hypergraphs.},

Soon afterward, Chakraborti and Chen answered the version of this question in which we ask that the graph have edges and fixed maximum degree (without imposing any constraint on the number of vertices). In this paper we address these problems on hypergraphs. For -graphs with a number of issues arise that do not appear in the graph case. For instance, for general -graphs we can assign degrees to any -subset of the vertex set with . We establish bounds on the number of -cliques in an -graph with -degree bounded by in three contexts: has vertices; has (hyper)edges; and (generalizing the previous case) has a fixed number of -cliques for some with . When is of a special form we characterize the extremal -graphs and prove that the bounds are tight. These extremal examples are the shadows of either Steiner systems or partial Steiner systems. On the way to proving our uniqueness results, we extend results of Füredi and Griggs on uniqueness in Kruskal–Katona from the shadow case to the clique case.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Assume players are placed on vertices of a graph . The following game was introduced by Winkler: An adversary puts a hat on each player, where each hat has a color out of available colors. The players can see the hat of each of their neighbors in but cannot see their own hats. Using a predetermined guessing strategy, the players then simultaneously guess the color of their hats. The players win if at least one of them guesses correctly; otherwise, the adversary wins. The largest integer such that there is a winning strategy for the players is denoted by , and this is called the hat guessing number of . Although this game has received much attention in recent years, not much is known about how the hat guessing number relates to other graph parameters. For instance, a natural open question is whether the hat guessing number can be bounded from above in terms of degeneracy. In this paper, we prove that the hat guessing number of a graph can be bounded from above in terms of a related notion, which we call strong degeneracy. We further give an exact characterization of graphs with bounded strong degeneracy. As a consequence, we significantly improve the best known upper bound on the hat guessing number of outerplanar graphs from to 40 and further derive upper bounds on the hat guessing number for any class of -free graphs with bounded expansion, such as the class of -free planar graphs; more generally, for -free graphs with bounded Hadwiger number or without a -subdivision; and for Erdős–Rényi random graphs with constant average degree.},

Edmonds’ fundamental theorem provides a min-max characterization for the unweighted setting, while Frank’s weight-splitting theorem provides one for the weighted case. Several efficient algorithms were developed for these problems, all relying on the usage of one of the conventional oracles for both matroids. In the present paper, we consider the tractability of the matroid intersection problem under restricted oracles. In particular, we focus on the rank sum, common independence, and maximum rank oracles. We give a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for weighted matroid intersection under the rank sum oracle. In the common independence oracle model, we prove that the unweighted matroid intersection problem is tractable when one of the matroids is a partition matroid and that even the weighted case is solvable when one of the matroids is an elementary split matroid. Finally, we show that the common independence and maximum rank oracles together are strong enough to realize the steps of our algorithm under the rank sum oracle.},

The circular chromatic number of , denoted , is the infimum of such that admits a circular -coloring. This notion was recently defined by Naserasr, Wang, and Zhu, who, among other results, proved that for any signed -degenerate simple graph we have . For , examples of signed -degenerate simple graphs of circular chromatic number are provided. But for only examples of signed 2-degenerate simple graphs of circular chromatic number arbitrarily close to 4 are given, noting that these examples are also signed bipartite planar graphs. In this work we first observe the following restatement of the 4-color theorem: If is a signed bipartite planar simple graph where vertices of one part are all of degree 2, then . Motivated by this observation, we provide an improved upper bound of for the circular chromatic number of a signed 2-degenerate simple graph on vertices and an improved upper bound of for the circular chromatic number of a signed bipartite planar simple graph on vertices. We then show that each of the bounds is tight for any value of .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recently, the saturation problem of 0-1 matrices has gained a lot of attention. This problem can be regarded as a saturation problem of ordered bipartite graphs. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of the saturation problem of ordered and cyclically ordered graphs. We prove that dichotomy also holds in these two cases, i.e., for a (cyclically) ordered graph its saturation function is either bounded or linear. We also determine the order of magnitude for large classes of (cyclically) ordered graphs, giving infinitely many examples exhibiting both possible behaviors, answering a problem of Pálvölgyi. In particular, in the ordered case we define a natural subclass of ordered matchings, the class of linked matchings, and we start their systematic study, concentrating on linked matchings with at most three links and prove that many of them have bounded saturation function. In both the ordered and cyclically ordered case we also consider the semisaturation problem, where dichotomy holds as well and we can even fully characterize the graphs that have bounded semisaturation function.},

These are the problem of computing the asymptotic density of MRD codes in the rank metric, and the Critical Problem for combinatorial geometries by Crapo and Rota. In the first part of the paper, we use methods from semifield theory to derive two lower bounds for the density function of full-rank, square MRD codes. The first bound is sharp when the matrix size is a prime number and the underlying field is sufficiently large, while the second bound applies to the binary field. We then take a new look at the Critical Problem for combinatorial geometries, approaching it from a qualitative, often asymptotic, viewpoint. We illustrate the connection between this very classical problem and that of computing the asymptotic density of MRD codes. Finally, in the third part of the paper we study the asymptotic density of some special families of codes in the rank metric, including the symmetric, alternating, and Hermitian ones. In particular, we show that the optimal codes in these three contexts are sparse.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the problem of optimizing a coverage function under an -matchoid of rank . We design fixed-parameter algorithms as well as streaming algorithms to compute an exact solution. Unlike previous work that presumes linear representativity of matroids, we consider the general oracle model. For the special case where the coverage function is linear, we give a deterministic fixed-parameter algorithm parameterized by and . This result, combined with the lower bounds of Lovasz [Algebraic Methods in Graph Theory, Vol. II (Colloquium Szeged 1978), North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1981, pp. 495–517] and Jensen and Korte [SIAM J. Comput., 11 (1982), pp. 184–190], demonstrates a separation between the -matchoid and the matroid -parity problems in the setting of fixed-parameter tractability. For a general coverage function, we give both deterministic and randomized fixed-parameter algorithms, parameterized by and , where is the number of points covered in an optimal solution. The resulting algorithms can be directly translated into streaming algorithms. For unweighted coverage functions, we show that we can find an exact solution even when the function is given in the form of a value oracle (and so we do not have access to an explicit representation of the set system). Our result can be implemented in the streaming setting and stores a number of elements depending only on and but is completely independent of the total size of the ground set. This shows that it is possible to circumvent the recent space lower bound of Feldman et al. [Proceedings of STOC, 2020, pp. 1363–1374] by parameterizing the solution value. This result, combined with existing lower bounds, also provides a new separation between the space and time complexity of maximizing an arbitrary submodular function and a coverage function in the value oracle model.},

Still as an open problem, the constant PoA conjecture states that the Price of Anarchy (PoA) is constant for any . When tackling this problem distinct behaviors must be taken into the account depending on whether has either large or low value. It is known that for every ne is a tree and for with the diameter of networks that are in equilibrium when restricting to deviations that consist only in buying links (buying equilibria) is at most a constant. These results imply that the PoA is constant for the disjoint union of the two ranges, and thus the constant PoA conjecture seems to be true for most of all the possible values . In this paper we study the PoA for the remaining range of and we show the following: (i) For the PoA is constant by proving that the size of any biconnected component of an equilibrium graph is constant.

In particular, we investigate whether the class of exactly representable functions strictly increases by adding more layers (with no restrictions on size). As a by-product of our investigations, we settle an old conjecture about piecewise linear functions by Wang and Sun [IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 51 (2005), pp. 4425–4431] in the affirmative. We also present upper bounds on the sizes of neural networks required to represent functions with logarithmic depth.},

We focus on the cases in which is a clique, a cycle, or a forest, and for Waiter-Client and monotone Avoider-Enforcer games our results apply to any fixed graph . We show that, similarly to the edge version of -games, there is a strong connection between the threshold probability for these games and the one for the corresponding vertex Ramsey property (that is, the property that every -vertex-coloring of spans a monochromatic copy of ).

We prove that this problem is equivalent to the discrete version of the inverse interior spectral problem, provided that there does not exist a nonzero eigenfunction of the weighted graph Laplacian vanishing identically on . In particular, we consider inverse problems for discrete-time random walks on finite graphs. We show that under a novel geometric condition (called the Two-Points Condition), the graph structure and the transition matrix of the random walk can be uniquely recovered from the distributions of the first passing times on , or from the observation on of one realization of the random walk.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Given a graph with arboricity , we study the problem of decomposing the edges of into disjoint forests in the distributed model. Here may be a simple graph or multigraph. While there is a polynomial time centralized algorithm for -forest decomposition (e.g., [H. Imai, J. Oper. Res. Soc. Japan, 26 (1983), pp. 186–211]), it remains an open question how close we can get to this exact decomposition in the model. Barenboim and Elkin [L. Barenboim and M. Elkin, Sublogarithmic distributed MIS algorithm for sparse graphs using Nash-Williams decomposition, Distrib. Comput., 22 (2010), pp. 363–379] developed a algorithm to compute a -forest decomposition in rounds. Ghaffari and Su [Proc. 28th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2017, pp. 2505–2523] made further progress by computing a -forest decomposition in rounds when ; i.e., the limit of their algorithm is an -forest decomposition. This algorithm, based on a combinatorial construction of Alon, McDiarmid, and Reed [Combinatorica, 12 (1992), pp. 375–380], in fact provides a decomposition of the graph into star-forests, i.e., each forest is a collection of stars. Our main goal is to reduce the threshold of in -forest decomposition. We obtain a number of results with different parameters; some notable examples are the following: (1) An -round algorithm when in multigraphs, where is any arbitrary constant; (2) an -round algorithm when in multigraphs; (3) an -round algorithm when in multigraphs (this also covers an extension of the forest-decomposition problem to list-edge-coloring); (4) an -round algorithm for star-forest decomposition for in simple graphs (when , this also covers a list-coloring variant). Our techniques also give an algorithm for -outdegree-orientation in rounds, which is the first algorithm with linear dependency on . At a high level, the first three results come from a combination of network decomposition, load balancing, and a new structural result on local augmenting sequences. The fourth result uses a more careful probabilistic analysis for the construction of Alon, McDiarmid, and Reed; the bounds on star-forest decomposition were not previously known even non constructively.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We revisit the discrete heterogeneous two-facility location problem, in which there is a set of agents that occupy nodes of a line graph and have private approval preferences over two facilities. When the facilities are located at some nodes of the line, each agent suffers a cost that is equal to her total distance from the facilities she approves. The goal is to decide where to locate the two facilities so as to (a) incentivize the agents to truthfully report their preferences and (b) achieve a good approximation of the minimum total (social) cost or the maximum cost among all agents. For both objectives, we design deterministic strategyproof mechanisms with approximation ratios that significantly outperform the state of the art and complement these results with (almost) tight lower bounds.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies linear and affine error-correcting codes for correcting synchronization errors such as insertions and deletions. We call such codes linear/affine insdel codes. Linear codes that can correct even a single deletion are limited to having an information rate at most (achieved by the trivial two fold repetition code). Previously, it was (erroneously) reported that more generally no nontrivial linear codes correcting deletions exist, i.e., that the -fold repetition codes and its rate of are basically optimal for any . We disprove this and show the existence of binary linear codes of length and rate just below capable of correcting insertions and deletions. This identifies rate as a sharp threshold for recovery from deletions for linear codes and reopens the quest for a better understanding of the capabilities of linear codes for correcting insertions/deletions. We prove novel outer bounds and existential inner bounds for the rate vs. (edit) distance trade-off of linear insdel codes. We complement our existential results with an efficient synchronization-string-based transformation that converts any asymptotically good linear code for Hamming errors into an asymptotically good linear code for insdel errors. Last, we show that the -rate limitation does not hold for affine codes by giving an explicit affine code of rate which can efficiently correct a constant fraction of insdel errors.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In 1966, Gallai asked whether there is a vertex which passes through all longest paths of a connected graph. Although this has been verified for some special classes of graphs such as outerplanar graphs, circular arc graphs, and series-parallel graphs, the answer is negative for general graphs. In this paper, we prove among other results that if we replace the vertex by a bond, then the answer is affirmative. A bond of a graph is a minimal nonempty edge-cut. In particular, in any 2-connected graph, the set of all edges incident to a vertex is a bond, called a vertex-bond. Clearly, for a 2-connected graph, a path passes through a vertex if and only if it meets the vertex-bond with respect to . Therefore, a very natural approach to Gallai’s question is to study whether there is a bond meeting all longest paths. Let denote the length of a longest path of connected graphs. We show that there is a bond meeting all paths of length at least and for any 2- and 3-connected graph, respectively. For any -connected graph , we show that there is a bond meeting all paths of length at least , where if is even and if is odd. Our results also provide analogs of the results on bonds meeting long cycles given in [P.-L. Wu, Combin. Probab. Comput., 6 (1997), pp. 107–113; and S.

This decoder can be applied to exact for-all sparse recovery over any field, improving upon previous results with the same number of measurements. Furthermore, computation of the syndrome from a received word can be done in nearly linear time in the block length.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Given a graph and a set of pairs, the Vertex-Disjoint Paths (resp., Edge-Disjoint Paths) problems asks us to determine whether there exist pairwise vertex-disjoint (resp., edge-disjoint) paths in such that connects to for each . Unlike their undirected counterparts which are FPT (parameterized by ) from graph minor theory, both the edge-disjoint and vertex-disjoint versions in directed graphs were shown by Fortune, Hopcroft, and Wyllie (TCS ’80) to be NP-hard for . This strong hardness for Disjoint Paths on general directed graphs led to the study of parameterized complexity on special graph classes, e.g., when the underlying undirected graph is planar. For Vertex-Disjoint Paths on planar directed graphs, Schrijver (SICOMP ’94) designed an time algorithm which was later improved upon by Cygan et al. (FOCS ’13), who designed an FPT algorithm running in time. To the best of our knowledge, the parameterized complexity of Edge-Disjoint Paths on planar) directed graphs is unknown. We resolve this gap by showing that Edge-Disjoint Paths is W[1]-hard parameterized by the number of terminal pairs, even when the input graph is a planar directed acyclic graph (DAG). This answers a question of Slivkins (ESA ’03, SIDMA ’10). Moreover, under the exponential time hypothesis (ETH), we show that there is no algorithm for Edge-Disjoint Paths on planar DAGs, where is the number of terminal pairs, is the number of vertices, and is any computable function. Our hardness holds even if both the maximum in-degree and the maximum out-degrees of the graph are at most 2. We now place our result in the context of previously known algorithms and hardness for Edge-Disjoint Paths on special classes of directed graphs. Implications for Edge-Disjoint Paths on DAGs: Our result shows that the algorithm of Fortune, Hopcroft, and Wyllie (TCS ’80) for Edge-Disjoint Paths on DAGs is asymptotically tight, even if we add an extra restriction of planarity. The previous best lower bound (also under ETH) for Edge-Disjoint Paths on DAGs was by Amiri et al. (MFCS ’16, IPL ’19), which improved upon the lower bound implicit in Slivkins (ESA ’03, SIDMA ’10). Implications for Edge-Disjoint Paths on planar directed graphs: As a special case of our result, we obtain that Edge-Disjoint Paths on planar directed graphs is W[1]-hard parameterized by the number of terminal pairs. This answers a question of Cygan et al. (FOCS ’13) and Schrijver (pp. 417–444, Building Bridges II, ’19) and completes the landscape of the parameterized complexity status of edge and vertex versions of the Disjoint Paths problem on planar directed and planar undirected graphs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. While useful probability bounds for pairwise independent Bernoulli random variables adding up to at least an integer have been proposed in the literature, none of these bounds are tight in general. In this paper, we provide several results in this direction. First, when , the tightest upper bound on the probability of the union of pairwise independent events is provided in closed-form for any input marginal probability vector . To prove the result, we show the existence of a positively correlated Bernoulli random vector with transformed bivariate probabilities, which is of independent interest. Building on this, we show that the ratio of the Boole union bound to the tight pairwise independent bound is upper bounded by and that the ratio is attained. Applications of the result in correlation gap analysis and distributionally robust bottleneck optimization are discussed. The result is extended to find the tightest lower bound on the probability of the intersection of pairwise independent events. Second, for any and input marginal probability vector , new upper bounds are derived by exploiting ordering of probabilities. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate when the bounds provide improvement over existing bounds. Lastly, we identify specific instances when the existing and the new bounds are tight, for example, with identical marginal probabilities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Given a graph property , we consider the problem EdgeSub , where the input is a pair of a graph and a positive integer , and the task is to compute the number of -edge subgraphs in that satisfy . Specifically, we study the parameterized complexity of EdgeSub with respect to both approximate and exact counting, as well as its decision version EdgeSub . Among others, our main result fully resolves the case of minor-closed properties : the decision problem EdgeSub always admits a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, and the counting problem EdgeSub always admits a fixed-parameter tractable randomized approximation scheme. For exact counting, we present an exhaustive and explicit criterion on the property which, if satisfied, yields fixed-parameter tractability and otherwise -hardness. Additionally, our hardness results come with an almost tight conditional lower bound under the exponential time hypothesis. Our main technical result concerns the exact counting problem: Building upon the breakthrough result of Curticapean, Dell, and Marx (Symposium on Theory of Computing 2017), we express the number of subgraphs satisfying as a finite linear combination of graph homomorphism counts and derive the complexity of computing this number by studying its coefficients. Our approach relies on novel constructions of low-degree Cayley graph expanders of -groups, which might be of independent interest. The properties of those expanders allow us to analyze the coefficients in the aforementioned linear combinations over the field which gives us significantly more control over the cancelation behavior of the coefficients.},

We also investigate local conditions that can be certified by looking at only a subset of the vertex set. In these cases a capacity-type asymptotic invariant is defined and when the condition is to contain a certain subgraph this invariant is shown to be a simple function of the chromatic number of this required subgraph.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The terminal backup problems ([E. Anshelevich and A. Karagiozova, SIAM J. Comput., 40 (2011), pp. 678–708]) form a class of network design problems: Given an undirected graph with a requirement on terminals, the goal is to find a minimum-cost subgraph satisfying the connectivity requirement. The node-connectivity terminal backup problem requires a terminal to connect other terminals with a number of node-disjoint paths. This problem is not known whether is NP-hard or tractable. Fukunaga [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 30 (2016), pp. 777–800] gave a -approximation algorithm based on an LP-rounding scheme using a general LP-solver. In this paper, we develop a combinatorial algorithm for the relaxed LP to find a half-integral optimal solution in time, where is the number of nodes, is the number of edges, is the number of terminals, is the maximum edge-cost, is the maximum edge-capacity, and is the time complexity of a max-flow algorithm in a network with nodes and edges. The algorithm implies that the -approximation algorithm for the node-connectivity terminal backup problem is also efficiently implemented. For the design of algorithm, we explore a connection between the node-connectivity terminal backup problem and a new type of a multiflow, which is called a separately capacitated multiflow. We show a min-max theorem which extends the Lovász–Cherkassky theorem to the node-capacity setting. Our results build on discrete convexity in the node-connectivity terminal backup problem.},

For a positive integer , the -recoloring graph of a graph has as vertex set all proper -colorings of with two -colorings being adjacent if they differ by the color of exactly one vertex. A result of Dyer et al. regarding graphs of bounded degeneracy implies that the 7-recoloring graphs of planar graphs, the 5-recoloring graphs of triangle-free planar graphs and the 4-recoloring graphs planar graphs of girth at least six are connected. On the other hand, there are planar graphs whose 6-recoloring graph is disconnected, triangle-free planar graphs whose 4-recoloring graph is disconnected, and planar graphs of any given girth whose 3-recoloring graph is disconnected. The main result of this paper consists in showing, via a novel application of the discharging method, that the 4-recoloring graph of every planar graph of girth five is connected. This completes the classification of the connectedness of the recoloring graph for planar graphs of given girth. We also prove some theorems regarding the diameter of the recoloring graph of planar graphs.},

No such tight concentration (within two consecutive values) was previously known for induced paths and cycles. As a corollary, a significant additive improvement is obtained over a 40-year-old result of Erdős and Palka [Discrete Math., 46 (1983), pp. 145–150] concerning the size of the largest induced tree in a dense random graph. Further, the induced path decomposition number and induced tree decomposition number, i.e., the smallest number of parts into which the vertex set of a graph can be partitioned such that every part induces a (i) path or (ii) tree, respectively, are studied for . The arguments involve the second moment method together with an adaptation of a martingale-based technique of Krivelevich et al.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Finding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that best encodes the conditional independence statements observable from data is a central question within causality. Algorithms that greedily transform one candidate DAG into another given a fixed set of moves have been particularly successful, for example, the greedy equivalence search, greedy interventional equivalence search, and max-min hill climbing algorithms. In 2010, Studený, Hemmecke, and Lindner introduced the characteristic imset (CIM) polytope, whose vertices correspond to Markov equivalence classes, as a way of transforming causal discovery into a linear optimization problem. We show that the moves of the aforementioned algorithms are included within classes of edges of and that restrictions placed on the skeleton of the candidate DAGs correspond to faces of . Thus, we observe that greedy equivalence search, greedy interventional equivalence search, and max-min hill climbing all have geometric realizations as greedy edge-walks along . Furthermore, the identified edges of strictly generalize the moves of these algorithms. Exploiting this generalization, we introduce a greedy simplex-type algorithm called greedy CIM, and a hybrid variant, skeletal greedy CIM, that outperforms current competitors among hybrid and constraint-based algorithms.},

We present a -approximation algorithm for the matching augmentation problem (MAP): given a multigraph with edges of cost either zero or one such that the edges of cost zero form a matching, find a 2-edge connected spanning subgraph (2-ECSS) of minimum cost. A -approximation algorithm for the same problem was presented recently; see Cheriyan et al. [Math. Program., 182 (2020), pp. 315–354]. Our improvement is based on new algorithmic techniques, and some of these may lead to advances on related problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Previous work on convexity of neural codes has produced codes that are open-convex but not closed-convex—or vice-versa. However, why a code is one but not the other, and how to detect such discrepancies are open questions. We tackle these questions in two ways. First, we investigate the concept of nondegeneracy introduced by Cruz et al. We extend their results to show that nondegeneracy precisely captures the situation when taking closures or interiors of open or closed realizations, respectively, does not change the code that is realized. Second, we give the first general criteria for precluding a code from being closed-convex (without ruling out open-convexity), unifying ad-hoc geometric arguments in prior works. One criterion is built on a phenomenon we call a rigid structure, while the other can be stated algebraically, in terms of the neural ideal of the code. These results complement existing criteria having the opposite purpose: precluding open-convexity but not closed-convexity. Finally, we show that a family of codes shown by Jeffs to be not open-convex is in fact closed-convex and realizable in dimension three.},

Let denote the smallest minimum degree of over all graphs that are minimal -Ramsey for (with respect to subgraph inclusion). The study of this parameter was initiated in 1976 by Burr, Erdős, and Lovász, who determined its value precisely for a pair of cliques. Over the past two decades the parameter has been studied by several groups of authors, their main focus being on the symmetric case, where for all . The asymmetric case, in contrast, has received much less attention. In this paper, we make progress in this direction, studying asymmetric tuples consisting of cliques, cycles, and trees. We determine when is a pair of one clique and one tree, a pair of one clique and one cycle, and a pair of two different cycles. We also generalize our results to multiple colors and obtain bounds on in terms of the size of the cliques , the number of cycles, and the number of cliques. Our bounds are tight up to logarithmic factors when two of the three parameters are fixed.},
