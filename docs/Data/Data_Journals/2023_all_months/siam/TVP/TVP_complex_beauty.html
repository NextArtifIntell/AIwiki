We also find upper bounds for the probability of a ``false alarm” on a given time interval. An asymptotic expansion for the mean delay time of the alarm signal relative to the change-point time is obtained. To get this result, we establish the exponential convergence rate in the ergodic theorem for Markov chains with a positive atom; chains of this kind describe the monitoring of control systems. A game-theoretic approach is employed to obtain asymptotically optimal solutions of the change-point problem.},

  abstract     = {The statistical inference on missing mass aims to estimate the weight of elements not observed during sampling. Since the pioneer work of Good and Turing, the problem has been studied in many areas, including statistical linguistics, ecology, and machine learning. Proving the sub-Gaussian behavior of the missing mass has been notoriously hard, and a number of complicated arguments have been proposed: logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, thermodynamic approaches, and information-theoretic transportation methods. Prior works have argued that the difficulty is inherent, and classical tools are inadequate. We show that this common belief is false, and all that we need to establish the sub-Gaussian concentration is the classical inequality of Bernstein. The strong educational value of our work is in its demonstration of this inequality in its full generality, an aspect not well recognized by researchers.},

A cost optimization problem is solved. As control parameters, we use the probability $\alpha$ of the vacation and its duration. Under fairly general assumptions about the system behavior during vacations, we show that the optimal value of the probability $\alpha$ is either 0 or 1. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a vacation to be carried out, i.e., $\alpha=1$. With constant vacation durations, we find conditions such that $\alpha=1$, and the vacation duration is optimal. Two examples are considered. In the first example, the revenue from the vacation is a linear function of its duration, and, in the second example, the revenue is a quadratic function.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by an application in neuroimaging, we consider the problem of establishing global minimax lower bound in a high order tensor model. In particular, the methodology we describe provides the global minimax bound for the integral curve estimator proposed in [O. Carmichael and L. Sakhanenko, Linear Algebra Appl., 473 (2015), pp. 377--403] under a semiparametric estimation setting. The theoretical results in this paper guarantee that the estimator used for tracing the complex fiber structure inside a live human brain obtained from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data is not only optimal locally but also optimal globally. The global minimax bound on the asymptotic risk of the estimators thus will provide a quantification of uncertainty for the estimation method in the whole domain of the imaging field. In addition to theoretical results, we also provide a detailed simulation study in order to find the optimal number of gradient directions for the imaging protocols, which we further illustrate with a real data analysis of a live human brain scan to showcase the uncertainty quantification of the estimation method in [O. Carmichael and L. Sakhanenko, Linear Algebra Appl., 473 (2015), pp. 377--403]. Furthermore, based on the global minimax bound, we propose a method for comparing the relative accuracy of several commonly used neuroimaging protocols in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).},

Three cases are studied: the case where the option price is the same as for the hedging problem without transaction costs, the case of increasing volatility, and the case where the option price equals the option price of the “buy and hold” strategy for European call options.},

Such a specification reflects the fact that time preferences used by agents to assess different types of losses evolve in opposite directions.

We provide conditions for the existence of an alternative control strategy, which is also optimal and is based on a solution of an algebraic Riccati equation.},

Probab., 34 (2006), pp. 2118--2143] asserts that the fluctuations of the linear eigenvalue statistics $\sum_{i=1}^n f(\lambda_i)$ converge to a Gaussian distribution for sufficiently nice test functions $f$. We study the fluctuations of $\sum_{i=1}^{n-K} f(\lambda_i)$, where $K$ randomly chosen eigenvalues have been removed from the sum. In this case, we identify the limiting distribution and show that it need not be Gaussian. Our results hold for the case when $K$ is fixed as well as for the case when $K$ tends to infinity with $n$. The proof utilizes the predicted locations of the eigenvalues introduced by E. Meckes and M. Meckes, [Ann. Fac. Sci. Toulouse Math. (6), 24 (2015), pp. 93--117]. As a consequence of our methods, we obtain a rate of convergence for the empirical spectral distribution of $X_n$ to the circular law in Wasserstein distance, which may be of independent interest.},

These scenarios are described by a priori given compact sets depending on the price history: at each time instant, the price increments must lie in the corresponding compact sets. We assume no transaction costs. The problem statement is game-theoretic and leads to the Bellman--Isaacs equations in pure and mixed “market” strategies. In the case of no trading constraints, we study the relationship between the Bellman functions in the “deterministic” and “probabilistic” statements of the superhedging problem. As established under very general conditions, the “probabilistic” Bellman function does not exceed the “deterministic” counterpart. Sufficient conditions for their coincidence are found.},

  abstract     = {We consider a Galton--Watson branching process with particles of two types in which particles of type one produce both particles of types one and two, and particles of type two generate offsprings of only type two. It is known that if both types are critical, then, for a process that is initiated at time $0$ by a single type-one particle, the number of particles of type two at time $n$ (provided that the process is not degenerate by this time) is proportional to $n$. We find the asymptotics of the probability that the number of type-two particles at time $n$ is of the order $o(n) $ (provided that the process is not degenerate by this time).},

  abstract     = {This paper, which is a continuation of [I. A. Alexeev, Theory Probab. Appl., 67 (2022), pp. 335--351], is concerned with $\alpha$-stable distributions with complex stability index $\alpha$. Sufficient conditions for membership in the domain of attraction of $\alpha$-stable random variables (r.v.&#39;s) are given, and $\alpha$-stable Lévy processes and the corresponding semigroups of operators are constructed. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for membership in the class of limit laws for sums of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex r.v.&#39;s with complex normalization and centering.},
