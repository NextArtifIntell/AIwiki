  abstract     = {The data generated and stored in mobile devices owned by individuals as well as in various organizations contains a large amount of valuable and important information that can be used to improve service quality, user experience, and satisfaction. However, due to privacy concerns, many entities are reluctant to share their data with others, and this is a major barrier to developing comprehensive models that can provide accurate predictions. Federated learning is a state-of-the-art distributed machine learning approach where multiple clients are allowed to collaboratively train a model while keeping their private training data locally. Although federated learning seems to be a viable solution for jointly training a machine learning model without compromising privacy, sensitive privacy information may still be leaked through shared model parameters and query results. Over the past six years, the researchers have extensively studied privacy protection enhancements of federated learning, and they have revealed that general privacy protection mechanisms can be adopted to mitigate privacy issues of federated learning. However, protecting privacy through federated learning while maintaining data utility is still an open issue. This article provides an overview of federated learning while discussing privacy leakages, possible defense mechanisms, and future research directions of privacy-preserved federated learning.},

  abstract     = {In large online volunteer systems, inefficiency and low volunteer retention are existing challenges that compromise the success of online communities particularly given the uncertainty in volunteer participation behavior. A strategy that matches volunteers to a host of fields will alleviate these challenges, yet creating an all-in-one volunteer recommendation system is an unexplored but promising area. We propose VolRec, a session-based recommendation for large volunteer networks that employs temporal dynamics to capture uncertainty caused by the changing structure of volunteers’ participation behaviour. To optimize the recommendations, we construct a probabilistic volunteer network graph that denotes co-participation in an activity. We then model individual and inferred neighbours’ preferences as dynamic and context-aware sessions. VolRec can be adapted to recommend volunteers to organizers, tasks, groups and communities, creating a comprehensive and efficient recommendation system. Experiments using Pioneers data, a mobile based app launched in the wake of Covid-19 to mobilize volunteers and record their participation activities demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.},

Properly managing the ED department requires to optimise the service, while maintaining a high quality care. This trade-off implies to properly arrange the schedule for the personnel, so the service can duly attend all patients. In this regard, a key point is to know in advance how many patients will arrive to the service and the number that should be derived to hospitalisation. To provide such information, we present the results of applying different algorithms for forecasting ED admissions and hospitalisations for both seven days and four months ahead. To do this, we have employed the ED admissions and inpatients series from a Spanish civil and military hospital. The ED admissions have been aggregated on a daily basis and on the official workers’ shifts, while the hospitalisations series have been considered daily. Over that data we employ two algorithms types: time series (AR, H-W, SARIMA and Prophet) and feature matrix (LR, EN, XGBoost and GLM). In addition, we create all possible ensembles among the models in order to find the best forecasting method. The findings of our study demonstrate that the ensembles can be beneficial in obtaining the best possible model.},

Predicting churn customers become an urgent need in webcast industry because the market is getting saturated and identifying potential churn customers and developing recall marketing strategies can save companies significant costs. Despite the importance of customer churn prediction in many fields, little prior academic attention has been attached to the webcast area. To address this gap, We apply an ensemble learning method to build a binary classification model for customer churn prediction. Our proposed model uses a weighted voting ensemble method and the Nelder-Mead optimal algorithm with a specific focus on the speed of Internet customers’ mobility, extracting high-dimensional features from time series data to incorporate more detailed customer behavior information. In addition, a new customer churn indicator based on time decline is introduced to more accurately define churned customers in the training data. The experimental data is collected from a webcast application developed by a Chinese Internet company. Experimental evaluations show that compared to the traditional ensemble models, our proposed model is operationally efficient and outperforms other approaches, providing valuable insights for companies to intervene with churned customers and adopt targeting retention interventions.},

  abstract     = {Process mining provides a collection of techniques to gain insights into business processes by analyzing event logs. Organizations can gain various insights into their business processes by using process mining techniques. Such techniques use event logs extracted from relational databases supporting the business process as input. However, extracting event logs is challenging due to the size of the data, and it remains ad-hoc. Existing commercial tools partly support the extraction of event logs, but they are proprietary and focus on the mainstream processes such as Purchase-To-Pay (P2P) and Order-To-Cash (O2C). Moreover, the extracted event logs suffer from well-known deficiency, convergence, and divergence issues. For example, due to convergence events are unintentionally duplicated causing unreliable or confusing performance diagnostics. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract event logs while avoiding the aforementioned issues. More in detail, we extract object-centric event logs by using an abstraction layer of the database, called Graph of Relationships (GoRs), designing blueprints with domain knowledge, and converting the database and blueprint into object-centric event logs.We fully implemented the proposed approach, which can extract object-centric event logs from SAP ERP systems, and evaluate the utility and scalability of the proposed approach.},

Through the use of deep learning, the multi-information fusion-based deep recommendation method has gained popularity in the field of music recommendation systems research. However, most existing studies only consider the different kinds of information of users or music and fail to capture information’s internal and external associations. In this work, we propose a hierarchical multi-information fusion method for deep music recommendation (MMusic), to fully exploit the features of each type of information and to better learn the representation of users and music. Specifically, combined with the features of music recommendation, we identify various kinds of information describing users and music, respectively. Then, we learn about the interactions within and between different kinds of information for fusion. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available dataset NOWPLAYINGRS. The results show that MMusic achieves the best performance compared with the baselines, which verifies the effectiveness and rationality of our model.},

In this work we propose conv-SPAD, a method for convolutional SPectral audio-based Anomaly Detection that takes advantage of common tools for spectral analysis and a simple autoencoder to learn the underlying condition of normality of real scenarios. Using audio data collected from real scenarios and artificially corrupted with anomalous sound events, we test the ability of the proposed model to learn normal conditions and detect anomalous events. It shows performances in line with larger models, often outperforming them. Moreover, the model’s small size makes it usable in contexts with limited resources, such as edge devices hardware.},

Generally, KGE models are trained with positive and negative examples, discriminating positives against negatives. Nevertheless, KGs contain only positive facts; KGE training requires generating negatives from non-observed ones in KGs, referred to as negative sampling. Since KGE models are sensitive to inputs, negative sampling becomes crucial, and the quality of the negatives becomes critical in KGE training. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) and self-adversarial methods have recently been utilized in negative sampling to address the vanishing gradients observed with early negative sampling methods. However, they introduce the problem of false negatives with high probability. In this paper, we extend the idea of reducing false negatives by adopting a Tucker decomposition representation, i.e., TuckerDNCaching, to enhance the semantic soundness of latent relations among entities by introducing a relation feature space. TuckerDNCaching ensures the quality of generated negative samples, and the experimental results reflect that our proposed negative sampling method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art negative sampling methods.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental challenge for recommendation systems is the cold-start problem, i.e., recommending with no or few user-item interactions. An emerging direction alleviates the problem with meta-learning. These methods utilize the prior knowledge learned from previous recommendation tasks to facilitate the learning of a new task with a small number of interactions, i.e., the support set. The new task involves making recommendations for cold users or items. However, a support set may contain uninformative items and fail to capture the personality of new users, jeopardizing the recommendation quality. This paper proposes Information gain driven cold-start Recommendation (InfoRec), which actively acquires informative items for constructing the support set. Specifically, our InfoRec quantifies item informativeness with the reduction of model uncertainty about the user preference for items that are not in the support set. Experiments demonstrate that InfoRec outperforms baseline methods on two benchmark datasets in both non-cold-start and cold-start scenarios.},

The triplet extraction is carried out in an end-to-end way by more recent models; however, they focus a significant amount of emphasis on the interactions between each target word and opinion word. Thus, they are not capable of achieving their goals or expressing thoughts that are comprised of more than one word. More recently, In addition, there are attempts to develop a span-based method that can deal with thoughts comprised of more than one word. However, the spans are built based on the sequential information between words ignoring the syntactic structures and semantic correlations between words. We propose a Span-to-Span Multi-channel Graph Neural Network (SMGCN) to address the above issues to extract aspect and opinion words in pairs. This will allow us to address the concerns that have been raised. When attempting to anticipate the emotional connection that exists between targets and opinions, the method that we have proposed takes into account the interaction that exists between the entire span of targets and opinions. The model leverages both syntactic structures and semantic correlations to build span representations simultaneously. The model is able to make predictions based on the semantics of full spans with more consistency regarding the sentiment. Our model outperforms the baselines to extract the sentiment triplets, as shown by experimental findings obtained from three different publicly available datasets.},

People’s interest in improving their expectancy of life, their life quality, and the significant investments in medical laboratories modify the diagnosis methods, application protocols, and surgical techniques. One of the most significant milestones in the medical field have been incorporating computers to improve data analysis during the last years. Nowadays, it is a fact that computers can help physicians, i.e., the use of artificial intelligence techniques. This paper proposes a multistage prediction-based approach and a rule-based system for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The first step is to develop a neural network model to predict 30-day mortality during and after aortic endovascular procedures. The second step aims to infer a rule-based system from the previous model. The results show that with only eight features the final predictive model can obtain an accuracy of around 87%. Furthermore, a decision tree with the same accuracy can be inferred from this model using three features and four rules},

  abstract     = {Entity resolution (ER), precisely identifying different representations of the same real-world entities, is critical for data integration. The ER question has been studied for many years, and many methods have been proposed to solve it. Although deep learning has achieved good performance in ER tasks, there are some challenges regarding manual labeling and model transfer. This paper proposes a novel ER model, Transformer-based Denoising Adversarial Variational Entity Resolution (TdavER). For entity embedding, we develop an unsupervised entity embedding model based on denoising autoencoders and pre-trained language models, which takes corrupted input as training data to motivate the encoder to generate rather stable and robust high-quality entity representations. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised entity feature transformation model based on adversarial variational autoencoders to ease the constraints on entity representations from training data. This transformation model converts low-level entity embeddings to high-level probability distributions, which are not constrained by the source data and contain deep similarity features. To better implement the feature transformation, we adopt adversarial networks to optimize the variational autoencoder’s training process and help it learn the correct posterior distribution. Extensive experiments confirms that the performance of our proposed TdavER is comparable with the current state-of-the-art ER methods and that its entity feature transformation model is transferable.},

  abstract     = {In recommender system, knowledge graph (KG) is usually leveraged as side information to enhance representation ability, and has been proven to mitigate the cold-start and data sparsity issues. However, due to the complexity of KG construction, it inevitably brings a large amount of noise, thus simply introducing KG into recommender system may hurt the performance of models. In addition, the current KG-based recommendation models mainly include the following issues: (1) The rich facts and semantic knowledge contained in KG are not fully explored. (2) The useless noise in KG is not effectively filtered, and the representation obtained by neighborhood aggregation shows poor quality. (3) Nodes with long-tail distribution are easily ignored and the models fail to balance the attention between popular and unpopular items. Therefore, we propose a Bi-Knowledge Views Recommendation Based on User-Oriented Contrastive Learning architecture (BUCL) to improve the representation quality and alleviate the long-tail distribution of entities. In particular, different graph embedding methods are applied to fully extract the rich facts and semantic knowledge in the KG to obtain multiple views of nodes. Based on the different representation views, a user-oriented item quality estimation method is proposed to guide the model to generate multiple augmented subgraphs. Each node provides enough negative samples to ensure that the model discriminates the same node from other nodes in differentiated subgraphs with contrastive learning. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that BUCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, alleviating the long-tail distribution problem and reducing the impact of noise.},

  abstract     = {RDF (Resource Description Framework), a standard resource description model, is popularized and applied in many application scenarios for its explicit representation of semantics. To represent and process time-aware semantics with RDF, the temporal RDF model is proposed and applied in temporal knowledge graphs. The requirement for efficiently handling diverse temporal RDF data has become increasingly important with the rapid development and popularity of RDF. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal RDF model and effectively tackle the management of temporal RDF data in relational databases. In particular, we propose a temporal RDF model called tRDF to represent both temporal entities and relationships and further propose a temporal query language for the tRDF model. To manage temporal RDF data in an effective manner, we propose to store temporal RDF data with relational databases that follow the SQL:2011 standard and support temporal data manipulation. To query the tRDF data stored in relational databases with the tRDF query language, we implement the transformation from this query language to SQL. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed tRDF model as well as its storage and query methods.},

In addition, we set the foundations for a text classification methodology to recognise the public documents published by the Italian PA, which perform data breaches. We show the effectiveness of the framework over a text corpus of public documents that were published online by the Italian PA. We also perform an inter-annotator study and analyse the agreement of the annotation predictions of the proposed methodology with the annotations by domain experts.

Therefore, it is crucial to study and propose better mechanisms to automatically identify communication that promote hate speech, hostility, and aggressiveness. Traditional approaches have only focused on exploiting the content and writing style of social media posts while ignoring information related to their context. On the other hand, several recent works have reported some interesting findings in this direction, although they have lacked an exhaustive analysis of contextual information, and also an evaluation about if this same premise holds to detect different types of abusive comments, e.g. offensive, hostile and hateful. For this, we have extended seven Twitter benchmark datasets related to the detection of offensive, aggressive, hostile, and hateful communication. We evaluate our hypothesis by using three different learning models, considering classical (Bag of Words), advanced (Glove), and state-of-the-art (BERT) text representations. Experiments show statistically significant differences between the classification scores of all methods that use a combination of text and metadata in comparison to the classical view of only using the text content of the messages, thus suggesting the importance of paying attention to context to spot the different kinds of abusive comments on social networks.},

However, some studies have shown that if patients are detected and treated early, the social impact and economic costs of mental illness can be reduced. With the popularity of social media, people are sharing their feelings on it, which allows data from social media to be used to study mental health conditions. However, past research had been limited to the optimization of the model or using different types of data available on social media, resulting in models that only rely on data to make decisions. Moreover, people judge things not only by the data collected, but also by background knowledge. Therefore, we considered the diagnostic process of doctors and combined the knowledge of psychological screening tools and diagnostic criteria into the model. In addition, we also tested the effect of combining general knowledge. We retrieve the top m most relevant knowledge segments for each user’s post, and then put both into the prediction model. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous studies, and the F1-score is increased more than 10% in some situations. Moreover, because the knowledge segments are automatically retrieved, our method does not require additional manual labeling, and the knowledge set can be freely adjusted. These show that our method can help detect mental health conditions and can be continuously optimized in practice.},

This calls for the need to find influential nodes in a network for a variety of reasons, including the curb of misinformation being spread across the networks, advertising products efficiently, finding prominent protein structures in biological networks, etc. In this paper, we propose Modified Community Diversity (MCD), a novel method for finding influential nodes in a network by exploiting community detection and a modified community diversity approach. We extend the concept of community diversity to a two-hop scenario. This helps us evaluate a node’s possible influence over a network more accurately and also avoids the selection of seed nodes with an overlapping scope of influence.

  abstract     = {High recall Information REtrieval (HIRE) aims at identifying only and (almost) all relevant documents for a given query. HIRE is paramount in applications such as systematic literature review, medicine, legal jurisprudence, among others. To address the HIRE goals, active learning methods have proven valuable in determining informative and non-redundant documents to reduce user effort for manual labeling. We propose a new active learning framework for the HIRE task. REVEAL-HIRE selects a very reduced set of documents to be labeled, significantly mitigating the user’s effort. The proposed approach selects the most representative documents by exploiting a novel, specifically designed active learning strategy for HIRE, called REVEAL (RelEVant rulE-based Active Learning). REVEAL aims at selecting the maximum number of relevant documents for a given query based on discriminative rule-based patterns and a penalization factor. The method is applied to the top-ranked documents to choose the most informative ones to be labeled, a hard task due to data skewness – most documents are irrelevant for a given query. The enhanced active learning process is repeated incrementally until a stopping point is achieved, using REVEAL to identify the point in the process when relevant documents should stop to be sampled. Experimental results in several standard benchmark datasets (e.g. 20-Newsgroups, Trec Total Recall, and CLEF eHealth) demonstrate that REVEAL-HIRE can reduce the user labeling effort up to 3 times (320% of reduction) in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines while keeping the effectiveness at the highest levels.},

Since the ability to determine the degree of the semantic relationship between sentence pairs is an integral part of machines that understand and infer natural language, we intend to improve the performance of the neural network systems computing the degree of the semantic relation. We propose a graph-U-Net model that operates on a dependency graph and is placed on top of a transformer. Our proposed model indicates the importance of the words in the sentence by assigning the words to several levels while a score as a degree of importance is computed for each level. These scores are used as a weighted average to produce the final result. The importance of the words is new information that our proposed model extracts from the STS and Paraphrase Identification (PI) datasets. We examine the effect of the proposed model on the performance of some transformers in computing semantic relation scores. We use STS2017 and MRPC datasets to evaluate our proposed model. Experimental evaluations show that compared to the transformers, our proposed model obtains a higher value of Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients and also generates valuable representations for each input so that they improve the Pearson and Spearman values of the systems computing the degree of semantic equivalence between two texts.},

However, most aspect-level sentiment analysis targets aspect objects that appear directly in the text, which is limited in many scenarios. Furthermore, existing methods for aspect-category sentiment analysis rarely focus on the implicit location of aspect-category information in the context. To this end, the concept of Aspect-Location Attention Networks (ALAN) is proposed to integrate aspect-specific sentiment features for sentiment classification. In ALAN, a novel module is designed to differentially integrate aspect-category information into various locations of the context. The proposed models and their ablation models have been evaluated on three publicly available social review datasets, including two in English and one in Chinese.

The increase in the utilization of online social networks (OSNs) as the primary source of information and the increase of online social platforms providing such news has increased the scope of spreading fake news. People spread fake news in multimedia formats like images, audio, and video. Visual-based news is prone to have a psychological impact on the users and is often misleading. Therefore, Multimodal frameworks for detecting fake posts have gained demand in recent times. This paper proposes a framework that flags fake posts with Visual data embedded with text. The proposed framework works on data derived from the Fakeddit dataset, with over 1 million samples containing text, image, metadata, and comments data gathered from a wide range of sources, and tries to exploit the unique features of fake and legitimate images. The proposed framework has different architectures to learn visual and linguistic models from the post individually. Image polarity datasets, derived from Flickr, are also considered for analysis, and the features extracted from these visual and text-based data helped in flagging news. The proposed fusion model has achieved an overall accuracy of 91.94%, Precision of 93.43%, Recall of 93.07%, and F1-score of 93%. The experimental results show that the proposed Multimodality model with Image and Text achieves better results than other state-of-art models working on a similar dataset.},

They cannot accurately select knowledge entities that are highly relevant to the aspect. They also ignore the semantic interaction between the review text and external knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge-enhanced interactive graph convolutional network (KE-IGCN). First, we introduce a subgraph construction strategy to construct a syntax-guided knowledge subgraph, which can guide KE-IGCN in selecting highly relevant knowledge entities. Second, we propose a knowledge interaction mechanism to exploit the semantic interaction between external knowledge and the review text. We then use multilayer graph convolutional networks to learn aspect-specific sentiment features from the review text and external knowledge jointly and interactively. We also use a multilevel feature fusion mechanism to aggregate aspect-specific sentiment features from semantic and syntactic information of the review and external knowledge. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that KE-IGCN outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal summarization with multi-modal output (MSMO) aims to generate multi-modal summaries for a multi-modal document to improve readability of summaries by making use of information of different modalities. Most existing Seq2Seq-based MSMO models cannot well capture multi-modal relations which are significant for generating high-quality multi-modal summaries. To address this issue, this paper proposes a relation-enhanced graph attention network for extractive text-image summarization (ReGAT-Summ) to capture inter-modal and intra-modal relations in the multi-modal document. Firstly, a multi-modal graph is constructed from the document. Then, node representations are calculated by proposed graph neural network. Finally, a sentence-image selector is trained to select salient sentences and images, which are further aligned by training. To our knowledge, we are the first to explore the graph-based model for MSMO. Experiments on two news datasets E-DailyMail and NYTime800k demonstrate that ReGAT-Summ achieves the state-of-the-art performance in terms of automatic metrics and human evaluations.},

  abstract     = {The most frequently used approach for imbalance learning is resampling. In this technique, the minority class is oversampled. Most of the algorithms used for this purpose are variants of the well-known algorithm named as SMOTE, which is based on creating synthetic samples on the lines connecting selected minority instances. The variants are mainly designed to alleviate the shortcomings of SMOTE where, the idea of generating synthetic samples to avoid the bias on the majority class is preserved. This study aims at following a different path. Instead of balancing, the proposed approach is based on repositioning the samples. In particular, the classifier is enforced to learn the decision regions of the minority class by repositioning the majority class samples. Consequently, the regions in which positive instances exist will not be outnumbered the majority class samples. Hence the classifier labels these regions as the minority class. To tackle the outliers, the minority samples are repositioned in small steps to avoid distorting the original distribution. The potential of the proposed repositioning scheme is also evaluated as a preprocessing algorithm for SMOTE. The experiments that are conducted on 52 datasets from the KEEL repository have shown that the proposed approach is highly effective, when evaluated in terms of F-score, G-mean and AUC.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a new type of social network, the event-based social network (EBSN), has become popular. Typical EBSN platforms include Meetup, Plancast, Doublan, etc. In an EBSN platform, users usually participate in events not as a single person, but as a member of a group. An issue with these networks is that the amount of events posted in them makes it difficult for users to find the events they are interested in. One effective way to solve this problem for the EBSN is to utilize a group event recommendation system. However, though existing group event recommendation methods have achieved good performance, they still suffer from two challenges: 1) many existing methods only use the explicit attribute information in EBSN and fail to exploit implicit social information and high-order structure information, resulting in the problem of data sparsity and 2) most of the existing methods treat user preferences as static rather than considering their dynamic variability of user preferences. In this paper, we propose to build a novel group event recommendation model based on a Heterogeneous Attribute Graph (HAG) considering users’ long-term and short-term preferences. Specifically, considering that the group event scoring matrix in EBSN is a sparse matrix, we make full use of a variety of information in EBSN, including explicit attribute information, implicit social information and high-order structure information in the social network. We then make use of graph attention networks (GAN), which encode that information by propagating embedding over the graph, to learn the representations of users and events. We conduct in-depth learning on the recent interactions between users and events, and the obtained implicit vector is represented as the user’s short-term preference. In the same way, we also conduct in-depth learning on the complete history of interactions between users and events, except for recent interactions, and regard the learned implicit vector as the user&#39;s long-term preference. Finally, we fuse the users’ long- and short-term preference representations using a multi-layer perceptron and attention mechanism to generate group preference representation. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed HAG model provides performance improvement over the baseline methods on group event recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Product recommendation systems have become an effective tool to help users make choices under information overload. For sequence recommendation, the user’s dynamic preferences and the correlations between items are essential for exploring temporal information in hidden states and latent relationships, which previous research has rarely considered. This paper proposes a novel model named MhSa-GRU that combines Multi-head Self-attention with a Gated Recurrent Unit, and integrates the prices, user behavior, and category features of items to help generate the next recommendation. In this model, an improved self-attention layer captures the items’ correlations, and multiple heads learn thorough local information about the vector. The mask and attention threshold mechanisms can exclude disturbing information commonly observed in product recommendation systems. Moreover, the GRU module introduces users’ global and local preferences to capture their behavior. Universal experiments on three real-world datasets verify that MhSa-GRU outperforms competitive baseline models, such as HR@10, HR@20, MRR@10, and MRR@20, in evaluation metrics for prediction. MhSa-GRU improves performance by 5% on the Cosmetics 2019-Nov and Cosmetics 2020-Jan datasets, and by about 10% on the Ta Feng dataset. Ablation experiments help determine the interpretability and effectiveness of the multi-head self-attention module, and show this module can strengthen efficiency by about 5%–10%. We also find that the predicted efficacy is optimal when the attention-head dimension is roughly 10% to 20% of the embedding vector. In addition, the sparse dataset should use high-dimensional attention-head vectors since the local information is too sparse to capture the relevance between items.},

The goal of this work is to develop a new measure Attribute Average Conflict to effectively approximate top-k attributes, without actually calculating MI. Our proposed method is based on using the database concept of approximate functional dependency to quantify MI rank of attributes which to our knowledge has not been studied before. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed measure with a Monte-Carlo simulation. We also perform extensive experiments using high dimensional synthetic and real datasets with millions of records. Our results show that our proposed method demonstrates perfect accuracy in selecting the top-k attributes, yet is significantly more efficient than state-of-art baselines, including exact methods for computing Mutual Information based feature selection, as well as adaptive random- sampling based approaches. We also investigate the upper and lower bounds of the proposed new measure and show that tighter bounds can be derived by using marginal frequency of attributes in specific arrangements. The bounds on the proposed measure can be used to select top-k attributes without full scan of the dataset in a single pass. We perform experimental evaluation on real datasets to show the accuracy and effectiveness of this approach.},

  abstract     = {As we all know, the performance of database management system is directly linked to a vast array of knobs, which control various aspects of system operation, ranging from memory and thread counts settings to I/O optimization. Improper settings of configuration parameters are shown to have detrimental effects on performance, reliability and availability of the overall database management system. This is also true for multi-model databases, which use a single platform to support multiple data models. Existing approaches for automatic DBMS knobs tuning are not directly applicable to multi-model databases due to the diversity of multi-model database instances and workloads. Firstly, in cloud environment, they have difficulty adapting to changing environments and diverse workloads. Secondly, they rely on large-scale high-quality training samples that are difficult to obtain. Finally, they focus primarily on throughput metrics, ignoring tuning requirements for resource utilization. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-model database configuration parameters tuning solution named MMDTune. It selects influential parameters, recommends the optimal configurations in a high-dimensional continuous space. For different workloads, the TD3 algorithm is improved to generate reasonable parameter adjustment plans according to the internal state of the multi-model databases. We conduct extensive experiments under 5 different workloads on real cloud databases to evaluate MMDTune. Experimental results show that MMDTune adapts well to a new hardware environment or workloads, and significantly outperforms the representative tuning tools, such as OtterTune, CDBTune.},

  abstract     = {Various methods using machine and deep learning have been proposed to tackle different tasks in predictive process monitoring, forecasting for an ongoing case e.g. the most likely next event or suffix, its remaining time, or an outcome-related variable. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more specifically long short-term memory nets (LSTMs), stand out in terms of popularity. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of such an LSTM to actually learn the underlying process model structure of an event log. We introduce an evaluation framework that combines variant-based resampling and custom metrics for fitness, precision and generalization. We evaluate 4 hypotheses concerning the learning capabilities of LSTMs, the effect of overfitting countermeasures, the level of incompleteness in the training set and the level of parallelism in the underlying process model. We confirm that LSTMs can struggle to learn process model structure, even with simplistic process data and in a very lenient setup. Taking the correct anti-overfitting measures can alleviate the problem. However these measures did not present themselves to be optimal when selecting hyperparameters purely on predicting accuracy. We also found that decreasing the amount of information seen by the LSTM during training, causes a sharp drop in generalization and precision scores. In our experiments, we could not identify a relationship between the extent of parallelism in the model and the generalization capability, but they do indicate that the process’ complexity might have impact.},

The present paper investigates the combined use of Instance Graphs and Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Networks to predict which activity will be performed next given a partial process execution. In addition to the exploitation of graph structures to encode the control-flow information, we investigate how to couple it with additional data perspectives. Experiments show the feasibility of the proposed approach, whose outcomes are consistently placed in the top ranking then compared to those obtained by well-known state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {The goal of rank fusion in information retrieval (IR) is to deliver a single output list from multiple search results. Improving performance by combining the outputs of various IR systems is a challenging task. A central point is the fact that many non-obvious factors are involved in the estimation of relevance, inducing nonlinear interrelations between the data. The ability to model complex dependency relationships between random variables has become increasingly popular in the realm of information retrieval, and the need to further explore these dependencies for data fusion has been recently acknowledged. Copulas provide a framework to separate the dependence structure from the margins. Inspired by the theory of copulas, we propose a new unsupervised, dynamic, nonlinear, rank fusion method, based on a nested composition of non-algebraic function pairs. The dependence structure of the model is tailored by leveraging query-document correlations on a per-query basis. We experimented with three topic sets over CLEF corpora fusing 3 and 6 retrieval systems, comparing our method against the CombMNZ technique and other nonlinear unsupervised strategies. The experiments show that our fusion approach improves performance under explicit conditions, providing insight about the circumstances under which linear fusion techniques have comparable performance to nonlinear methods.},

Customer conversation with customer support services through social networks channel provides a wealth of information for understanding customer perception. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid framework that integrated sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques is developed to analyze interactive conversations among customers and service providers in order to identify the change of polarity of such conversation. This framework aims to detect the conversation polarity switch as well as predict the sentiment of the end of the customer conversation with the service provider. This would help companies to improve customer satisfaction and enhance the customer engagement. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is measured by extracting a real dataset that expresses more than 5000 conversational threads between a customer service agent of an online retail service provider (AmazonHelp) and different customers using the retailer’s twitter public account for the duration of one month. Different classical and ensemble machine learning classifiers were applied, and the results showed that the decision trees outperformed all other techniques.},

While a column-oriented DBMS reduces the inherent latency found in relational DBMS, there is still the question of how to index the data, especially so as to support complex joins. Equi-joins that involve a many-to-many relationship are an example of complex joins that arise frequently and whose efficient processing is essential for fast query processing. We present OVI-3, a NoSQL visual query system based on incremental querying that uses a simple directory-based indexing scheme for faster processing of such complex joins. The system has been piloted using real data from a student database at Aalto University. The results demonstrated that for certain complex joins the presented indexing scheme outperforms SQL queries from a data server, especially for queries involving anti-joins (negation), where OVI-3 provided an orders of magnitude speed improvement.},

  abstract     = {Aspect sentiment classification is an important branch of sentiment classification that has gained increasing attention recently. Existing aspect sentiment classification methods typically use different network branches to encode context and aspect words separately, and then use an attention mechanism to capture their associations. This attention-based approach cannot completely ignore the contexts unrelated to the current aspect words, which brings noise interference. In this paper, a gated filtering network based on BERT is suggested as a solution to this issue. We employ BERT to encode the text semantics of contexts and sentence pairs consisting of context and aspect words respectively, and to extract lexical features as well as associative features of context and aspect words. Based on this, we designed a gating module that, unlike the attention mechanism, uses association features to precisely filter irrelevant contexts. Additionally, because the BERT network parameters are so big, there is a tendency to over-fitting during training. To effectively combat this problem, we developed a loss function with a threshold. We carried out extensive experiments using three benchmark datasets to verify the performance of our proposed model. The experimental results show that the method improves the accuracy by 0.5%, 1.39% and 2.57% on the Laptop, Restaurant and Twitter datasets respectively, and 1.564%, 2.36% and 4.144% on Macro-F1 respectively, compared to the recent RA-CNN (BERT), proving that our method is effective in improving the presentation of aspect sentiment classification in comparison to other cutting-edge sentiment classification methods.},

  abstract     = {Software defect prediction (SDP) plays a vital role in enhancing the quality of software projects and reducing maintenance-based risks through the ability to detect defective software components. SDP refers to using historical defect data to construct a relationship between software metrics and defects via diverse methodologies. Several prediction models, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have been developed and adopted to recognize software module defects, and many methodologies and frameworks have been presented. Class imbalance is one of the most challenging problems these models face in binary classification. However, When the distribution of classes is imbalanced, the accuracy may be high, but the models cannot recognize data instances in the minority class, leading to weak classifications. So far, little research has been done in the previous studies that address the problem of class imbalance in SDP. In this study, the data sampling method is introduced to address the class imbalance problem and improve the performance of ML models in SDP. The proposed approach is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) combined with a synthetic minority oversampling technique plus the Tomek link (SMOTE Tomek) to predict software defects. To establish the efficiency of the proposed models, the experiments have been conducted on benchmark datasets obtained from the PROMISE repository. The experimental results have been compared and evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC), the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR), and mean square error (MSE). The experimental results showed that the proposed models predict the software defects more effectively on the balanced datasets than the original datasets, with an improvement of up to 19% for the CNN model and 24% for the GRU model in terms of AUC. We compared our proposed approach with existing SDP approaches based on several standard performance measures. The comparison results demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art SDP approaches on most datasets.},

Six neural embeddings on top of the baseline bag-of-words (BoW) representation were explored to compute the cosine similarity score between 100,000 DS tweets with 1,024 gold standard happiness tweets in EmoTweet-28 (ET). Our results show that the augmented training set obtained from USE embedding with the similarity threshold of 0.7 trained on BiLSTM produced the best model in predicting whether a tweet contains expressions of happiness or not (F1 score = 0.599). However, most augmented training sets obtained from InferSent-GloVe embedding produced BiLSTM classifiers with more consistent F1 scores above the base classifier in the fixed increment experiments. We show that our proposed text augmentation strategy can improve or maintain classification performance in small but cleaner increment sets as opposed to adding DS tweets randomly as training data.},

  abstract     = {The widespread presence of offensive content is a major issue in social media. This has motivated the development of computational models to identify such content in posts or conversations. Most of these models, however, treat offensive language identification as an isolated task. Very recently, a few datasets have been annotated with post-level offensiveness and related phenomena, such as offensive tokens, humor, engaging content, etc., creating the opportunity of modeling related tasks jointly which will help improve the explainability of offensive language detection systems and potentially aid human moderators. This study proposes a novel multi-task learning (MTL) architecture that can predict: (1) offensiveness at both post and token levels in English; and (2) offensiveness and related subjective tasks such as humor, engaging content, and gender bias identification in multilingual settings. Our results show that the proposed multi-task learning architecture outperforms current state-of-the-art methods trained to identify offense at the post level. We further demonstrate that MTL outperforms single-task learning (STL) across different tasks and language combinations.},

  abstract     = {Aspect sentiment triplet extraction is an important research in the field of sentiment analysis, aiming at extracting aspect, opinion expression, and aspect-based sentiment at once. Most of existing end-to-end methods are tagging-based, which neglect the interaction between aspect term and opinion term while predicting the sentiment polarity. Besides, these methods cannot accurately resolve the complex correspondence between aspect terms and opinion terms. To address above concerns, we propose a span-level framework to extract aspect sentiment triplets, which is enhanced by introducing syntactic dependency relation and part-of-speech combination features through graph convolutional networks to deal with the complex relationships between aspect terms and opinion terms. Moreover, the proposed model explicitly considers the interaction between aspect and opinion spans generated by dual-channel pruning strategy when predicting their sentiment polarity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance over the baselines, especially on triplets including multi-word entities and complex corresponding relationships.},

  abstract     = {In most biomedical research paper corpus, document classification is a crucial task. Even due to the global epidemic, it is a crucial task for researchers across a variety of fields to figure out the relevant scientific research papers accurately and quickly from a flood of biomedical research papers. It can also assist learners or researchers in assigning a research paper to an appropriate category and also help to find the relevant research paper within a very short time. A biomedical document classifier needs to be designed differently to go beyond a “general” text classifier because it’s not dependent only on the text itself (i.e. on titles and abstracts) but can also utilize other information like entities extracted using some medical taxonomies or bibliometric data. The main objective of this research was to find out the type of information or features and representation method creates influence the biomedical document classification task. For this reason, we run several experiments on conventional text classification methods with different kinds of features extracted from the titles, abstracts, and bibliometric data. These procedures include data cleaning, feature engineering, and multi-class classification. Eleven different variants of input data tables were created and analyzed using ten machine learning algorithms. We also evaluate the data efficiency and interpretability of these models as essential features of any biomedical research paper classification system for handling specifically the COVID-19 related health crisis. Our major findings are that TF-IDF representations outperform the entity extraction methods and the abstract itself provides sufficient information for correct classification. Out of the used machine learning algorithms, the best performance over various forms of document representation was achieved by Random Forest and Neural Network (BERT). Our results lead to a concrete guideline for practitioners on biomedical document classification.},

Firstly, our platform involves engaging participants using citizen science strategies and generate music emotion annotations – the platform presents didactic information and musical recommendations as incentivization, and collects data regarding demographics, mood, and language from each participant. Participants annotated each music excerpt with single free-text emotion words (in native language), distinct forced-choice emotion categories, preference, and familiarity. Additionally, participants stated the reasons for each annotation – including those distinctive of emotion perception and emotion induction. Secondly, our dataset was created for personalized MER and contains information from 181 participants, 4721 annotations, and 1161 music excerpts. To showcase the use of the dataset, we present a methodology for personalization of MER models based on active learning. The experiments show evidence that using the judgment of the crowd as prior knowledge for active learning allows for more effective personalization of MER systems for this particular dataset. Our dataset is publicly available and we invite researchers to use it for testing MER systems.},

In our case, the context is both crucial for effective anomaly detection and volatile, which calls for streaming solutions that take into account only the recent values. We propose two novel techniques, a 2-stage proximity-based one and context-aware transformers along with advanced thresholding. In addition, to allow for testing PdM techniques for vehicle fleets in a fair and reproducible manner, we build a new fleet-like benchmarking dataset based on an existing dataset of turbofan simulations.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, multimedia-based digital ecosystem (e.g., social media sites) has become a great source of user-contributed multimedia documents for many types of real-world events. Very often social media posts about events are multimedia (e.g., image, video, text, and others), multi-features (e.g., 5W1H), and multi-sources. Such events might be related to each other, implying that they can be linked by different kinds of relationships (e.g., spatial, temporal, and causal relations). Additionally, a single event may contain two or more than two parts of event and some event relationships may involve more than two events. The traditional pairwise graphical representation method is insufficient to capture this complicated event structure. Thus, the problem of how to represent such complex events in an inclusive representation remains unsolved. To address this, we proposed a comprehensive event representation model based on advanced hypergraph notation. Our event hypergraph contains different kinds of nodes and links between them. Specifically, we first detect real-world events including their elements based on event-only descriptive features from social media documents. Using these detected events, we identify temporal, spatial, and causal relationships between events by comparing their associated dimensions. Finally, each node type is linked together using different kinds of relationships in the form of hierarchical hypergraph structure. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our method.},

  abstract     = {Complex system development and maintenance face the challenge of dealing with different types of models due to language affordances, preferences, sizes, and so forth that involve interaction between users with different levels of proficiency. Current conceptual data modelling tools do not fully support these modes of working. It requires that the interaction between multiple models in multiple languages is clearly specified to ensure they keep their intended semantics, which is lacking in extant tools. The key objective is to devise a mechanism to support semantic interoperability in hybrid tools for multi-modal modelling in a plurality of paradigms, all within one system. We propose FaCIL, a framework for such hybrid modelling tools. We design and realise the framework FaCIL, which maps UML, ER and ORM2 into a common metamodel with rules that provide the central point for management among the models and that links to the formalisation and logic-based automated reasoning. FaCIL supports the ability to represent models in different formats while preserving their semantics, and several editing workflows are supported within the framework. It has a clear separation of concerns for typical conceptual modelling activities in an interoperable and extensible way. FaCIL structures and facilitates the interaction between visual and textual conceptual models, their formal specifications, and abstractions as well as tracking and propagating updates across all the representations. FaCIL is compared against the requirements, implemented in crowd 2.0, and assessed with a use case. The proof-of-concept implementation in the web-based modelling tool crowd 2.0 demonstrates its viability. The framework also meets the requirements and fully supports the use case.},

  abstract     = {The use of supervised Machine Learning (ML) to enhance Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has been the subject of significant research. Supervised ML is based upon learning by example, demanding significant volumes of representative instances for effective training and the need to retrain the model for every unseen cyber-attack class. However, retraining the models in-situ renders the network susceptible to attacks owing to the time-window required to acquire a sufficient volume of data. Although anomaly detection systems provide a coarse-grained defence against unseen attacks, these approaches are significantly less accurate and suffer from high false-positive rates. Here, a complementary approach referred to as “One-Shot Learning”, whereby a limited number of examples of a new attack-class is used to identify a new attack-class (out of many) is detailed. The model grants a new cyber-attack classification opportunity for classes that were not seen during training without retraining. A Siamese Network is trained to differentiate between classes based on pairs similarities, rather than features, allowing to identify new and previously unseen attacks. The performance of a pre-trained model to classify new attack-classes based only on one example is evaluated using three mainstream IDS datasets; CICIDS2017, NSL-KDD, and KDD Cup’99. The results confirm the adaptability of the model in classifying unseen attacks and the trade-off between performance and the need for distinctive class representations.},

  abstract     = {Technological advances have led to a tremendous increase in complexity and volume of specialized malware, affecting computational devices across the globe. Along with malware targeting Windows devices, IoT devices having lesser computational power, have also been affected by malware attacks in the recent past. Due to a scarcity of updated malware datasets, malware recognition and classification has become trickier, particularly in IoT environments where malware samples are limited and scarce. Identifying a malware family can reveal the underlying intent of malware and traditional machine learning algorithms have performed well in this area. However, since such methods necessitate a large amount of feature engineering, deep learning algorithms for malware recognition and classification have been developed. In particular, the malware visualization-based approaches, which have shown decent success in the past have scope of improvement, which has been exploited in the current study. The current work aims at utilizing malware images (grayscale, RGB, markov) and deep CNNs for effective Windows and IoT malware recognition and classification using traditional learning and transfer learning approaches. First, grayscale, RGB and markov images were created from malware binaries. In particular, the idea of markov image generation by using markov probability matrix is to retain the global statistics of malware bytes which are generally lost during image transformation operations. A Gabor filter-based approach is utilized to extract textures and then a custom-built deep CNN and pretrained Xception CNN trained on 1.5 million images from ImageNet dataset, which is fine-tuned for malware images are employed for classifying malware images into families. To assess the effectiveness of the suggested framework, two public benchmark Windows malware image datasets, one custom built Windows malware image dataset and one custom built IoT malware image dataset were utilized. In particular, the methods demonstrate excellent classification results for the 500 GB Microsoft Malware Challenge dataset. A comparison of the suggested solutions with state-of-the-art methods clearly indicates the effectiveness and low computational cost of our malware recognition and classification solution.},

This has occurred under many guises, such as: Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS), Click Fraud and even secondary effects of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. With the advent of commercial offerings of serverless computing circa 2015, a variant of the EDoS attack has emerged, termed, Denial-of-Wallet (DoW). We describe our development of a simulation tool as safe means to research these attacks as well as to generate datasets for the training of future mitigation systems to combat DoW. We believe that DoW may become increasingly prevalent as applications further utilise services based on a pay-per-invocation cost model. Given that the damage caused is purely financial, such attacks may not be disclosed as application users are not directly effected. As such, we believe that the development of an attack simulator and specific testing of security measures against this niche attack will be able to provide previously unavailable data and insights for the research community. We have developed a prototype DoW simulator that can emulate multiple months worth of API calls in a matter of hours for ease of training data generation. Our aspiration for the future of this work is to provide a system and starting point for research on this form of attack. We present our work on such a system Denial-of-Wallet Test Simulator (DoWTS) - a system that allows for safe testing of theorised DoW attacks against serverless applications via synthetic data generation. We also expand upon prior research on DoW and provide an analysis on the lack of specific safety measures for DoW.},

We employ a machine learning technique to create a model of the traffic mix based on observing network traffic during the attack and normal period. The model is subsequently converted into the filtering rules. We evaluate our approach on several datasets. We experiment with various setups of hyperparameters as well as the various intensity of the attack traffic. The results of our experiments show that the proposed approach is feasible in terms of the capability of inferring successful filtering rules as well as inferring them in a reasonable time.},

  abstract     = {Penetration testing (PT) is a method for assessing and evaluating the security of digital assets by planning, generating, and executing possible attacks that aim to discover and exploit vulnerabilities. In large networks, penetration testing becomes repetitive, complex and resource consuming despite the use of automated tools. This paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) to make penetration testing more intelligent, targeted, and efficient. The proposed approach called Intelligent Automated Penetration Testing Framework (IAPTF) utilizes model-based RL to automate sequential decision making. Penetration testing tasks are treated as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) which is solved with an external POMDP-solver using different algorithms to identify the most efficient options. A major difficulty encountered was solving large POMDPs resulting from large networks. This was overcome by representing networks hierarchically as a group of clusters and treating each cluster separately. This approach is tested through simulations of networks of various sizes. The results show that IAPTF with hierarchical network modeling outperforms previous approaches as well as human performance in terms of time, number of tested vectors and accuracy, and the advantage increases with the network size. Another advantage of IAPTF is the ease of repetition for retesting similar networks, which is often encountered in real PT. The results suggest that IAPTF is a promising approach to offload work from and ultimately replace human pen testing.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, we are witnessing a paradigm shift from the conventional approach of working from office spaces to the emerging culture of working virtually from home. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, many organisations were forced to allow employees to work from their homes, which led to worldwide discussions of this trend on Twitter. The analysis of this data has immense potential to change the way we work but extracting useful information from this valuable data is a challenge. Hence in this study, the microblogging website Twitter is used to gather more than 450,000 English language tweets from 22nd January 2022 to 12th March 2022, consisting of keywords related to working from home. A state-of-the-art pre-processing technique is used to convert all emojis into text, remove duplicate tweets, retweets, username tags, URLs, hashtags etc. and then the text is converted to lowercase. Thus, the number of tweets is reduced to 358,823. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyse Twitter data. The input to our deep learning model is an annotated set of tweets that are effectively labelled into three sentiment classes, viz. positive negative and neutral using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning). We also use a variation in the input vector to the embedding layer, by using FastText embeddings with our model to train supervised word representations for our text corpus of more than 450,000 tweets. The proposed model uses multiple convolution and max pooling layers, dropout operation, and dense layers with ReLU and sigmoid activations to achieve remarkable results on our dataset. Further, the performance of our model is compared with some standard classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. From the results, it is observed that on the given dataset, the proposed CNN with FastText word embeddings outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 0.925969. As a result of this classification, 54.41% of the tweets are found to show affirmation, 24.50% show a negative disposition, and 21.09% have neutral sentiments towards working from home.},

Scandal or mockery is used harshly, often crudely and contemptuously, for destructive purposes in sarcasm. To extract the actual sentiment of a sentence for code-mixed language is complex because of the unavailability of sufficient clues for sarcasm. In this work, we proposed a model consisting of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) stacked with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (BERT-LSTM). A pre-trained BERT model is used to create embedding for the code-mixed dataset. These embedding vectors were used by an LSTM network consisting of a single layer to identify the nature of a sentence, i.e., sarcastic or non-sarcastic. The experiments show that the proposed BERT-LSTM model detects sarcastic sentences more effectively compared to other models on the code-mixed dataset, with an improvement of up to 6 % in terms of F1-score.},

  abstract     = {Recommending Smart Social Network (SSN) items which are in line with user preferences is one of the significant applications in SSNs such as Event-Based Social Networks (EBSNs) and Smart object Based Social Network (SBSN). It is well acknowledged that geographical and social contextual influences play an important role in SSN item Recommender System (RS). Whereas incorporating such contextual influences into SSN item RSs is a challenging issue which needs to be addressed along with the conventional RS challenges (cold-start problem and data sparsity). To this end, a novel SSN item recommendation architecture (named as 3T-IEC*) based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed. Specifically, 3T-IEC* constructs an SSN item location graph based on physical distance between two SSN items and leverages a GCN-based representation learning method to capture geographical influence of SSN items; which not only incorporates the geographical preferences but also delivers a convincing idea to solve the data sparsity problem. Sequentially, 3T-IEC* deploys one more GCN to incorporate users’ social associations. Furthermore, 3T-IEC* leverages self-attention technique with multiple heads to incorporate user’s preferences over SSN items’ multiple features. The experimental results on four real life datasets demonstrate superior performance of 3T-IEC* compared with state-of-the-art methods such as SkyLine (149%), 3T-IEC (54%), DeepWalk (38%), SORec (9%), and NGCF (7%).},

However, the current research on fine-grained view focuses on recognizing sentiment, but pays little attention to their impact on the overall feeling. To use topic information to assist sentiment analysis, this paper proposes a topic-enhanced sentiment analysis model. Through the multi-task learning framework, the topic information is learned and used to guide the model for sentiment classification. The multi-stage learning strategy guarantees the accuracy of prior knowledge. With the help of the alternating co-attention mechanism, the essential topics and emotional expression are concerned. In this paper, the labels of Chinese bank forum data and restaurant review data are automatically transformed to obtain supervised topic information. The experimental results show that the model has achieved state-of-the-art over the baseline in two datasets. The Kappa coefficient of sentiment prediction has increased by more than 1%. The model also has apparent advantages in interpretability and noise resistance.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has emerged as the greatest threat in recent times, causing extensive mortality and morbidity in the entire world. India is among the highly affected countries suffering severe disruptions due this pandemic. To overcome the adverse effects of COVID-19, vaccination has been identified as the most effective preventive measure globally. However, a growing amount of hesitancy has been observed among the general public regarding the efficacy and possible side-effects of vaccination. Such hesitancy may proved to be the greatest hindrance towards combating this deadly pandemic. This paper introduces a multimodal deep learning method for Indian Twitter user classification, leveraging both content-based and network-based features. To explore the fundamental features of different modalities, improvisations of transformer models, BERT and GraphBERT are utilized to encode the textual and network structure information. The proposed approach thus integrates multiple data representations, utilizing the advances in both transformer based deep learning as well as multimodal learning. Experimental results demonstrates the efficacy of proposed approach over state of the art approaches. Aggregated feature representations from multiple modalities embed additional information that improves the classification results. The findings of the proposed model has been further utilized to perform a study on the dynamics of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in India.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation system utilizes user-item interactions and information on user’s attributes to infer the user’s interests and use them to make recommendations for the user. Graph neural network(GNN) has become more widely used in recommendation systems in recent years, because of their ability to naturally integrate node information and topology. However, most of the current recommendation methods based on graph structure only focus on a single recommendation domain (for example,session-based recommendation models or social recommendation models), without taking into account both the user’s behavior information and the user’s social relationships; Furthermore, session-based recommendation models usually use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model user session, while RNN only focuses on the short-term impact of sessions and cannot cover all the information of sessions. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel session-based social recommendation model called GNNRec, which first utilizes gated graph neural network (GGNN) to represent users’ session information, and then uses graph attention network (GAT) to aggregate social information of users and friends on social networks to effectively model users’ interests. In this paper, experiments are conducted on two large datasets——Douban and Epinions, and the results show that the GNNRec model performs significantly better than current mainstream recommendation models.},

Weighted, unweighted, directed, and undirected networks can all be used for detecting communities depending on the network structure and content. The proposed model framework for community detection is based on weighted networks. We use two important and effective concepts in graph analysis. The structural density between nodes is the first concept, and the second is the weight of edges between nodes. The proposed model advantage is using a probabilistic generative model that estimates the latent parameters of the probabilistic model and detecting the community based on the probability of the presence or absence of weighted edge. The output of the proposed model is the intensity of belonging each weighted node to the communities. A relationship between the observation of a pair of nodes in multiple communities and the probability of an edge with a high weight between them, is one of the important outputs that interpret the detected communities by finding relevancy between membership of nodes to communities and edge weight. Experiments are performed on real-world weighted networks and synthetic weighted networks to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The results will show that the proposed algorithm is more density and accurate than other algorithms in weighted community detection.},

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for aspect-based sentiment classification has attracted a lot of attention recently due to their promising performance in handling complex structure information. However, previous methods based on GCN focused mainly on examining the structure of syntactic dependency relationships, which were subject to the noise and sparsity problem. Furthermore, these methods tend to focus on one kind of structural information (namely syntactic dependency) while ignoring many other kinds of rich structures between words. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel GCN based model, named Structure-Enhanced Dual-Channel Graph Convolutional Network (SEDC-GCN). Specifically, we first exploit the rich structure information by constructing a text sequence graph and an enhanced dependency graph, then design a dual-channel graph encoder to model the structure information from the two graphs. After that, we propose two kinds of aspect-specific attention, i.e., aspect-specific semantic attention and aspect-specific structure attention, to learn sentence representation from two different perspectives, i.e., the semantic perspective based on the text encoder, and the structure perspective based on the dual-channel graph encoder. Finally, we merge the sentence representations from the above two perspectives and obtain the final sentence representation. We experimentally validate our proposed model SEDC-GCN by comparing with seven strong baseline methods. In terms of the metric accuracy, SEDC-GCN achieves performance gains of 74.42%, 77.74%, 83.30%, 81.73% and 90.75% on TWITTER, LAPTOP, REST14, REST15, and REST16, respectively, which are 0.35%, 4.22%, 1.62%, 0.70% and 2.01% better than the best performing baseline BiGCN. Similar performance improvements are also observed in terms of the metric macro-averaged F1 score. The ablation study further demonstrates the effectiveness of each component of SEDC-GCN.},

  abstract     = {Given the recent availability of large volumes of social media discussions, finding temporal unusual phenomena, which can be called events, from such data is of great interest. Previous works on social media event detection either assume a specific type of event, or assume certain behavior of observed variables. In this paper, we propose a general method for event detection on social media that makes few assumptions. The main assumption we make is that when an event occurs, affected semantic aspects will behave differently from their usual behavior, for a sustained period. We generalize the representation of time units based on word embeddings of social media text, and propose an algorithm to detect durative events in time series in a general sense. In addition, we also provide an incremental version of the algorithm for the purpose of real-time detection. We test our approaches on synthetic data and two real-world tasks. With the synthetic dataset, we compare the performance of retrospective and incremental versions of the algorithm. In the first real-world task, we use a novel setting to test if our method and baseline methods can exhaustively catch all real-world news in the test period. The evaluation results show that when the event is quite unusual with regard to the base social media discussion, it can be captured more effectively with our method. In the second real-world task, we use the event captured to help improve the accuracy of stock market movement prediction. We show that our event-based approach has a clear advantage compared to other ways of adding social media information.},

  abstract     = {Word embedding is the process of converting words into vectors of real numbers which is of great interest in natural language processing. Recently, the performance of word embedding models has been the subject of some studies in emotion analysis. They mainly try to embed affective aspects of words into their vector representations utilizing some external sentiment/emotion lexica. The underlying emotion models in the existing studies follow basic emotion theories in psychology such as Plutchik or VAD. However, none of them investigate the Mixed Emotions (ME) model in their work which is the most precise theory of emotions raised in the recent psychological studies. According to ME, feelings can be the consequent of multiple emotion categories at the same time with different intensities. Relying on the ME model, this article embeds mixed emotions features into the existing word-vectors and performs extensive experiments on various English datasets. The analyses in both lines of intrinsic evaluations and extrinsic evaluations prove the improvement of the presented model over the existing emotion-aware embeddings such as SAWE and EWE.},

  abstract     = {Negative information plays an important role in the way we express our preferences and desires. However, it has not received the same attention as positive feedback in recommender systems. Here we show how negative user preferences can be exploited to generate recommendations. We rely on a logical semantics for the recommendation process introduced in a previous paper and this allows us to single out three main conceptual approaches, as well as a set of variations, for dealing with negative user preferences. The formal framework provides a common ground for analysis and comparison. In addition, we show how existing approaches to recommendation correspond to alternatives in our framework.},

  abstract     = {The world has to face health concerns due to huge spread of COVID. For this reason, the development of vaccine is the need of hour. The higher vaccine distribution, the higher the immunity against coronavirus. Therefore, there is a need to analyse the people’s sentiment for the vaccine campaign. Today, social media is the rich source of data where people share their opinions and experiences by their posts, comments or tweets. In this study, we have used the twitter data of vaccines of COVID and analysed them using methods of artificial intelligence and geo-spatial methods. We found the polarity of the tweets using the TextBlob() function and categorized them. Then, we designed the word clouds and classified the sentiments using the BERT model. We then performed the geo-coding and visualized the feature points over the world map. We found the correlation between the feature points geographically and then applied hotspot analysis and kernel density estimation to highlight the regions of positive, negative or neutral sentiments. We used precision, recall and F score to evaluate our model and compare our results with the state-of-the-art methods. The results showed that our model achieved 55% &amp; 54% precision, 69% &amp; 85% recall and 58% &amp; 64% F score for positive class and negative class respectively. Thus, these sentimental and spatial analysis helps in world-wide pandemics by identify the people’s attitudes towards the vaccines.},
