  abstract     = {Our long-term project involves performing general-purpose computation on 2D amorphous computing media, which consist of arbitrary many, small, identical processing elements that are homogeneously spread in 2D Euclidian space, and that communicate locally in space. While the minimal assumptions on hardware provide the fascinating perspective of arbitrary large computing power, they also make programming notoriously difficult. Furthermore, our project involves simulating objects extended in 2D-space, called “blobs”. Maintaining the connectedness of blobs while they move in space adds another layer of difficulty since it demands to process the topology of 2D space. This paper describes a new parallel data structure that can simplify the programming task, in this context. In computer graphics, processing related to 2D topology is performed by using triangle meshes. We consider synchronous media whose underlying network is also a triangle mesh. Our data structure, derived from computer graphics, is anchored on that mesh so that its operations can be compiled on the medium. More precisely, our compiler produces a circuit of logic gates, which enables a high-performance simulation, in the case of crystalline media (Cellular Automata). We demonstrate the expressiveness of the data structure’s operation by using an incremental and modular programming style. We program, first small, then larger building-block functions, and re-use them. Blobs are implemented and re-used to compute the Voronoï diagram. What is the scope of the data-structure? This poses the question of whether there exists a universal set of primitives able to program any processing specified only in terms of 2D-geometry.},

  abstract     = {Quantum annealing, a method of computing where optimization and machine learning problems are mapped to physically implemented energy landscapes subject to quantum fluctuations, allows for these fluctuations to be used to assist in finding the solution to some of the world’s most challenging computational problems. Recently, this field has attracted much interest because of the construction of large-scale flux-qubit based quantum annealing devices. These devices have since implemented a technique known as reverse annealing which allows the solution space to be searched locally, and algorithms based on these techniques have been tested. In this paper, I develop a formalism for algorithmic design in quantum annealers, which I call the ‘inference primitive’ formalism. This formalism naturally lends itself to expressing algorithms which are structurally similar to genetic algorithms, but where the annealing processor performs a combined crossover/mutation step. I demonstrate how these methods can be used to understand the algorithms which have already been implemented and the compatibility of such controls with a wide variety of other current efforts to improve the performance of quantum annealers.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study quantum Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams( $$\mathrm {OBDD}$$ ) model; it is a restricted version of read-once quantum branching programs, with respect to “width” complexity. It is known that the maximal gap between deterministic and quantum complexities is exponential. But there are few examples of functions with such a gap. We present a new technique (“reordering”) for proving lower bounds and upper bounds for OBDD with an arbitrary order of input variables if we have similar bounds for the natural order. Using this transformation, we construct a total function $$\mathrm {REQ}$$ such that the deterministic $$\mathrm {OBDD}$$ complexity of it is at least $$2^{\varOmega (n / \log n)}$$ , and the quantum $$\mathrm {OBDD}$$ complexity of it is at most $$O(n^2/\log n)$$ . It is the biggest known gap for explicit functions not representable by $$\mathrm {OBDD}$$ s of a linear width. Another function(shifted equality function) allows us to obtain a gap $$2^{\varOmega (n)}$$ vs $$O(n^2)$$ . Moreover, we prove the bounded error quantum and probabilistic $$\mathrm {OBDD}$$ width hierarchies for complexity classes of Boolean functions. Additionally, using “reordering” method we extend a hierarchy for read-k-times Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams ( $${\textit{k}}\text {-}\mathrm {OBDD}$$ ) of polynomial width, for $$k = o(n / \log ^3 n)$$ . We prove a similar hierarchy for bounded error probabilistic $${\textit{k}}\text {-}\mathrm {OBDD}$$ s of polynomial, superpolynomial and subexponential width.

The prediction models categorize the insolvency/non-insolvency of a firm one year in advance from a large set of financial ratios. Different selection strategies based on two evolutionary algorithms were used to reduce the dimensionality of the financial features considered. The first method considers the combination between the global search provided by an evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution) with a simple classifier, together with the possible use of classical filters in a first step of feature selection. Secondly, genetic programming is used as a feature selector. In addition, these selection approaches will be compared when GP is used exclusively as a classifier. The results show that, when using GP as a classifier method, the proposed selection method with GP stands out from the rest. Moreover, the use of GP as a classifier improves the results with respect to other classifier methods. This shows an added value to the use of GP in this field, in addition to the interpretability of GP prediction models.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty pervades real life and supposes a challenge for all industrial processes as it makes it difficult to predict the outcome of otherwise risk-free activities. In particular, time deviation from projected objectives is one of the main sources of economic losses in manufacturing, not only for the delay in production but also for the energy consumed by the equipment during the additional unexpected time they have to work to complete their labour. In this work we deal with uncertainty in the flexible job shop, one of the foremost scheduling problems due to its practical applications. We show the importance of a good model to avoid introducing unwanted imprecision and producing artificially pessimistic solutions. In our model, the total energy is decomposed into the energy required by resources when they are actively processing an operation and the energy consumed by these resources simply for being switched on. We propose a set of metrics and carry out an extensive experimental analysis that compares our proposal with the more straightforward alternative that directly translates the deterministic model. We also define a local search neighbourhood and prove that it can reach an optimal solution starting from any other solution. Results show the superiority of the new model and the good performance of the new neighbourhood.},

  abstract     = {The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known optimisation problem that has been widely studied over the last century. As a result, a variety of exact and approximate algorithms have been proposed in the literature. When it comes to solving large instances in real-time, greedy algorithms guided by priority rules represent the most common approach, being the nearest neighbour (NN) heuristic one of the most popular rules. NN is quite general but it is too simple and so it may not be the best choice in some cases. Alternatively, we may design more sophisticated heuristics considering the particular features of families of instances. To do that, we have to consider problem attributes other than the proximity of the next city to build priority rules. However, this process may not be easy for humans and so it is often addressed by some learning procedure. In this regard, hyper-heuristics as Genetic Programming (GP) stands as one of the most popular approaches. Furthermore, a single heuristic, even being good in average, may not be good for a number of instances of a given set. For this reason, the use of ensembles of heuristics is often a good alternative, which raises the problem of building ensembles from a given set of heuristic rules. In this paper, we study the application of two kinds of ensembles to the TSP. Given a set of TSP instances having similar characteristics, we firstly exploit a GP to build a set of heuristics involving a number of problem attributes, and then we build ensembles combining these heuristics by means of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The experimental study provided valuable insights into the construction and utilisation of single rules and ensembles. It clearly demonstrated that the performance of ensembles justifies the time invested when compared to using individual heuristics.},

A novel Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is proposed where the classical layout is simplified, increasing the algorithm’s speed and reducing the number of parameters to set up. We also take into account the fundamental principles of exploration around a local solution and attraction to a global solution to improve diversity in the hive. The increase on speed and diversity allows to include a Local Search phase to better exploit promising areas of the search space. A parametric analysis is conducted and the contribution of the new strategies is analysed. The results of the new approach are competitive with those obtained with previous methods in the literature, but taking less runtime. The addition of Local Search improves the results even further, outperforming the best-known ones from the literature.

  abstract     = {The gate-based model is one of the leading quantum computing paradigms for representing quantum circuits. Within this paradigm, a quantum algorithm is expressed in terms of a set of quantum gates that are executed on the quantum hardware over time, subject to a number of constraints whose satisfaction must be guaranteed before running the circuit, to allow for feasible execution. The need to guarantee the previous feasibility condition gives rise to the Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem (QCCP). The QCCP has been demonstrated to be NP-Complete, and can be considered as a Planning and Scheduling problem. In this paper, we consider quantum compilation instances deriving from the general Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), applied to the MaxCut problem, devised to be executed on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware architectures. More specifically, in addition to the basic QCCP version, we also tackle other variants of the same problem such as the QCCP-X (QCCP with crosstalk constraints), the QCCP-V (QCCP with variable qubit state initialization), as well as the QCCP-VX that includes both previous variants. All problem variants are solved using genetic algorithms. We perform an experimental study across a conventional set of instances taken from the literature, and show that the proposed genetic algorithm, termed $$GA_{VX}$$ , outperforms previous approaches in the literature.},

For this reason, metaheuristics are one of the most widely applied optimisation techniques. Makespan is one of the main objectives in this problem. However, this metric needs to be complemented with a quality measure with respect to the actual execution time in order to avoid incurring more costs than expected by using an over-optimistic approximation. This research applies a new enhanced disk-network-computing evaluation model, that takes into account the communication among the storage devices involved, which plays an important role in actual schedules. The model is implemented in a genetic algorithm and the well-known heuristic HEFT. We propose different hybridisation metaheuristics in conjunction with a new accuracy metric to measure the difference between the makespan approximations and the real one. The new evaluation model is able to improve accuracy with respect to the standard model, and the proposed hybrid methods significantly improve makespan in the case of heterogeneous infrastructures.},

  abstract     = {Oritatami is a mathematical model of co-transcriptional folding, a phenomenon in which, while being synthesized (transcribed) sequentially, an RNA sequence folds upon itself into complex structures via hydrogen bonds between its nucleotides (A, C, G, and U). RNA sequences fold co-transcriptionally to perform computations in-vivo such as gene expression regulation and splicing. Co-transcriptional folding has been recently proven modularly programmable for assembling structures in-vitro in the RNA origami framework as well as for computing arbitrary computable functions in-silico using the oritatami model. In this tutorial, we overview computations in oritatami and their “bricks” to build up from, that is, modules, and then discuss what should be done along with concrete open problems as a seed for further fruitful developments in computation by co-transcriptional folding.},

Two sufficient conditions for non-regularity are having a proper sofic image or having a point in the image with no preimage of the same period. We show that the non-regular ECA 9 and 28 cannot be proven non-regular using these methods. We also show that a random cellular automaton is non-regular with high probability.},

It corresponds to the asymptotic behavior of the Hamming distance on longer and longer prefixes. Though dynamics of cellular automata were already studied in the literature, we propose the first study of the dynamics of substitutions. We characterize those that yield a well-defined dynamical system as essentially the uniform ones. We also explore a variant of this pseudometric, the Feldman–Katok pseudometric, where the Hamming distance is replaced by the Levenshtein distance. Like in the Besicovitch space, cellular automata are Lipschitz in this space, but here also all substitutions are Lipschitz. In both spaces, we discuss equicontinuity of these systems, give a number of examples, and generalize our results to the class of dill maps, that embeds both cellular automata and substitutions.},

These relations provide additional links between computer science and category theory, and also give a new point of view on the famous Curtis–Hedlund theorem of cellular automata from the extended topological point of view provided by category theory.

Most of the CA-based PRNGs proposed in the literature, however, suffer from poor diffusion since a change in a single cell can propagate only within its neighborhood during a single time step. This might pose a problem especially when such PRNGs are used for cryptographic purposes. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to generate pseudorandom sequences through orthogonal CA (OCA), which guarantees a better amount of diffusion. After defining the related PRNG, we perform an empirical investigation of the maximal cycles in OCA pairs up to diameter $$d=8$$ . Next, we focus on OCA induced by linear rules, giving a characterization of their cycle structure based on the rational canonical form of the associated Sylvester matrix. Finally, we devise an algorithm to enumerate all linear OCA pairs characterized by a single maximal cycle, and apply it up to diameter $$d=16$$ and $$d=13$$ for OCA respectively over the binary and ternary alphabets.},

Several dynamical interpretations have been proposed based on the same logical structure that captures the interactions between Boolean components. They reproduce, in different degrees, the behaviours emerging in more quantitative models. In particular, regulatory conflicts can prevent the standard asynchronous dynamics from reproducing some trajectories that might be expected upon inspection of more detailed models. We introduce and study the class of networks with linear cuts, where linear components—intermediates with a single regulator and a single target—eliminate the aforementioned regulatory conflicts. The interaction graph of a Boolean network admits a linear cut when a linear component occurs in each cycle and in each path from components with multiple targets to components with multiple regulators. Under this structural condition the attractors are in one-to-one correspondence with the minimal trap spaces, and the reachability of attractors can also be easily characterized. Linear cuts provide the base for a new interpretation of the Boolean semantics that captures all behaviours of multi-valued refinements with regulatory thresholds that are uniquely defined for each interaction, and contribute a new approach for the investigation of behaviour of logical models.},

A swarm of distributed autonomous agents with no possibility of coordination tracks a unique target. The goal is to reach the target as efficiently as possible, i.e. with as few agents moving from their current position as possible. We show in two models how, by adopting features of randomness and altruism in the agent’s motion (which, in our case, translates to yielding to other agents), this objective can be reached. In the first, simplistic representation, agents are dimensionless. The system is formulated as a unidimensional Markov chain, and we show how correctly setting the level of randomness in agents’ movement enables optimization of the swarm total energy expenditure. In the second representation, the agent embodiment raises the question of interference in movement. Again, we show how with no possibility of coordination, and based solely on a partial knowledge of the current system state, it is possible to optimize the swarm movements by dynamically adapting the agent level of randomness in movement. These are but two possible representations of a swarm of simple non-cooperating agents sharing a common target. Yet, they demonstrate how moderating the individual agent attraction to the target by introducing the precise level of randomness in the decision to move or not, helps in breaking ties between agents in their race to the target, and to optimize the overall swarm energy expenditure.},

In general, the most appropriate population size varies for different types of problems and problems with different dimensions. As a result, the performance of an algorithm with a fixed population size is limited to some extent. In this paper, a new enhanced algorithm with a population entropy based population adaptation strategy has been proposed under the framework of SHADE (PE-SHADE). Firstly, a method to calculate the entropy of the population is introduced, through which the distribution state of the population is also characterized. Secondly, the population size is adapted according to the distribution state with a population increasing strategy and a population reduction strategy. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments on the standard benchmark CEC2014 have been conducted, as well as the sensitivity experiments for the extra parameters. The performance comparisons with SHADE, L-SHADE, and some other well-known DE variants are analyzed, which statistically supports the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we discuss some of the shortcomings of the crowding distance-based methods such as inaccurate estimates of the density of neighboring solutions in the search space. We propose a new classification for the selection operations of Pareto-based multi-modal multi-objective optimization algorithms. This classification is based on utilizing nearby solutions from other fronts to calculate the crowding values. Moreover, to address some of the drawbacks of existing crowding methods, we propose two algorithms whose selection mechanisms are based on each of the introduced types of selection operations. These algorithms are called NxEMMO and ES-EMMO. Our proposed algorithms are evaluated on 14 test problems of various complexity levels. According to our results, in most cases, the NxEMMO algorithm with the proposed selection mechanism produces more diverse solutions in the search space in comparison to other competitive algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world engineering design optimization problems, objective function evaluations are very time costly and often conducted by solving partial differential equations. Gradients of the objective functions can be obtained as a byproduct. Naturally, these problems can be solved more efficiently if gradient information is used. This paper studies how to do expensive multiobjective optimization when gradients are available. We propose a method, called MOEA/D–GEK, which combines MOEA/D and gradient-enhanced kriging. The gradients are used for building kriging models. Experimental studies on a set of test instances and an engineering problem of aerodynamic design optimization for a transonic airfoil show the high efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Pathfinding, also known as route planning, is one of the most important aspects of logistics, robotics, and other applications where engineers must balance many competing interests. There is a significant challenge in pathfinding problems with multiple objectives because many paths can map to the same objective value. Such multi-modal solutions cannot easily be found in multi-objective optimisation algorithms, which are typically geared towards selection mechanisms in the objective space. A niching approach for preserving good diverse solutions in the decision space is proposed in this paper, which is tailored for pathfinding problems. The criteria used to compare the solutions within the decision space are path similarity metrics, which we extend from a previous study, and are used instead of the well-established crowding distance. In two variations, we investigate the proposed meta-heuristic approach on a range of benchmark instances and compare the methodology to a deterministic optimisation approach.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, it is widely known that the Pareto dominance-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are unable to deal with many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) well, as it is hard to maintain a good balance between convergence and diversity. Instead, most researchers in this domain tend to develop EAs that do not rely on Pareto dominance (e.g., decomposition-based and indicator-based techniques) to solve MaOPs. However, it is still hard for these non-Pareto-dominance-based methods to solve MaOPs with unknown irregular PF shapes. In this paper, we develop a general framework for enhancing relaxed Pareto dominance methods to solve MaOPs, which can promote both convergence and diversity. During the environmental selection step, we use M different cases of relaxed Pareto dominance simultaneously, where each expands the dominance area of solutions for $$M\,-$$ 1 objectives to improve the selection pressure, while the remaining one objective keeps unchanged. We conduct the experiments on a variety of test problems, the result shows that our proposed framework can obviously improve the performance of relaxed Pareto dominance in solving MaOPs, and is very competitive against or outperform some state-of-the-art many-objective EAs.},

  abstract     = {Single-objective continuous optimization can be challenging, especially when dealing with multimodal problems. This work sheds light on the effects that multi-objective optimization may have in the single-objective space. For this purpose, we examine the inner mechanisms of the recently developed sophisticated local search procedure SOMOGSA. This method solves multimodal single-objective continuous optimization problems based on first expanding the problem with an additional objective (e.g., a sphere function) to the bi-objective domain and subsequently exploiting local structures of the resulting landscapes. Our study particularly focuses on the sensitivity of this multiobjectivization approach w.r.t. (1) the parametrization of the artificial second objective, as well as (2) the position of the initial starting points in the search space. As SOMOGSA is a modular framework for encapsulating local search, we integrate Nelder–Mead local search as optimizer in the respective module and compare the performance of the resulting hybrid local search to its original single-objective counterpart. We show that the SOMOGSA framework can significantly boost local search by multiobjectivization. Hence, combined with more sophisticated local search and metaheuristics, this may help solve highly multimodal optimization problems in the future.},

In turn, such internal cluster validity measures rely on quantifying dissimilarity between entities. This article explores the interaction between dissimilarity measures and internal cluster validity techniques in the context of multi-objective clustering. It does so by contrasting two conceptually different approaches to multi-objective clustering: the multi-criterion clustering algorithm $$\Delta$$ -MOCK, designed to optimise different measures of internal cluster validity over a single dissimilarity space, and the multi-view clustering algorithm MVMC, designed to optimise a single measure of internal cluster validity over distinct dissimilarity spaces. Our comparison highlights the interchangeable roles of distance functions and measures of internal cluster validity, which paves the way for the future design of a flexible, dual-purpose approach to multi-objective clustering.},

Further, the decomposition method is used in a cooperative coevolution framework with orthogonal sampling mutation. The algorithm’s performances are compared against the weighted optimization framework. The results show that the proposed decomposition method has much better accuracy compared to the traditional method. The results also show that the cooperative coevolution framework with a good grouping is very competitive. Additionally, the number of search directions in orthogonal sampling can be easily configured. A small number of search directions will reduce the search space greatly while also restricting the area that can be explored and vice versa.},

Then the focus shifts on a new class of problems proposed and studied for the first time only recently: the priority-levels mixed-pareto-lexicographic multi-objective-problems (PL-MPL-MOPs). This class of programs preserves the original preference ordering of pure many-objective lexicographic optimization, but instantiates it over multi-objective problems rather than scalar ones. Interestingly, PL-MPL-MOPs seem to be very well qualified for modeling real world tasks, such as the design of either secure or fast vehicles. The work also describes the implementation of an evolutionary algorithm able to solve PL-MPL-MOPs, and reports its performance when compared against other popular optimizers.},

The traditional food quality assessment technologies have the limitations of inconsistent and different technical defects for each method. Data mining technology has significant advantages in dealing with the problems of uncertainty and fuzziness. Therefore, this study proposes a food quality assessment model based on data mining, which aims to realize the standardization and consistency of food quality assessment, and can achieve or exceed the accuracy of existing technologies, so as to solve the obvious problems existing in traditional assessment methods. The core of the proposed model is to design a deep learning framework based on double layer rough-refinement optimization. The first layer is rough optimization, which introduces the thought of multi-objective optimization to optimize the topological structure of neural networks with various candidate types and candidate depths. The second layer is refinement adjustment, which uses meta heuristic algorithm to globally optimize the weight parameters of the network model. The combination of rough and refinement optimization can greatly reduce the computation of overall simultaneous optimization and globally optimize the neural network model with the highest accuracy from the neural network type, topology, and network parameters. Two kinds of food quality assessment problems are used to simulate and verify the proposed deep learning framework. The results prove that the framework is effective, feasible, and adaptability, and the proposed assessment model can well solve different types of food quality assessments.},

It has numerous applications, especially related to machine learning. Most of these applications require a custom variant of SNP systems, differing by the rule form and by semantics. The model of network of cells and the formal framework for SNP systems were developed to help the analysis of such custom models, to compare and relate them to each other and to other models of computing. The model specifies the data structure, the rules and the update procedure, while the formal framework concentrates on how the input, output and the choice of the update strategy are handled. Together, these concepts specify a concrete instance of a network of cells that strongly bisimulates the desired model, thus making easier the process of the creation of new models and the extension of existing ones. Since the formal framework is rather generic, it might be slightly complex to use it for concrete cases. This paper provides a tutorial that explains the model of networks of cells and the basic concepts used in the formal framework for SNP systems. It gives a series of examples for the analysis of existing models, their bisimulation and their extension by different features.},

Using previous results on representing SN P system computations using linear algebra, we analyze and implement a computation simulation algorithm on web browsers that runs on the GPU. Since web browsers (at this time) do not have any capabilities for General Purpose computing on GPUs (for short, GPGPU), we exploit the Web Graphics Library (for short, WebGL) and create shaders to generate textures that correspond to computational results of our SN P simulation algorithm.

  abstract     = {In the framework of Membrane Computing, several efficient solutions to computationally hard problems have been given. To find new borderlines between families of P systems that can solve them and the ones that cannot is an important task to tackle the P versus NP problem. Adding syntactic and/or semantic ingredients can mean passing from non-efficiency to presumed efficiency. Here, we try to get narrow frontiers, setting the stage to adapt efficient solutions from a family of P systems to another one. In order to do that, a solution to the SAT problem is given by means of a family of tissue P systems with evolutional symport/antiport rules and cell separation with the restriction that both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the rules have at most two objects; that is, with recognizer P systems from $${\mathcal {TSEC}}(2, 2)$$ . This result improves a previous one, when 3 objects could be used in the left-hand side of the evolutional communication rules},

  abstract     = {Face recognition technology has been widely used in the field of artificial intelligence. The technology needs to be carried out normally under the appropriate light, however, there is not ideal light, even poor-lighted for the face recognition device, and with the head in deflect angle. The poor-lighted under various head poses will influence the face recognition significantly. To address the issue, we present a novel and practical architecture based on deep fully convolutional neural network and generative adversarial networks for illumination normalization of facial images. The proposed method is termed as illumination normalization generative adversarial network. Compared with previous methods based on deep learning, our approach does not require identity and illumination label as input. We preserve identities of faces by an elaborately-designed generator together with content loss. Moreover, the framework of our scheme is simpler than previous methods based on deep learning. It can address the illumination of frontal and non-frontal face. In order to fairly evaluate the proposed method against state-of-the-art models, the peak signal to noise ratio is employed to estimate the performance of illumination normalization algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves favorable normalization results against previous models under various head poses and illumination challenges.},

  abstract     = {Even though the giant panda’s extinction status is downgraded from endangered to vulnerable, but the animals still face an uphill battle for survival. Moreover, the number of giant pandas is also rare. With the increase of captive individuals, wild release has become an inevitable task that human face. It is important to evaluate at least how much giant pandas are remained for being released to the wild. Several methods have been presented in the literature to assess minimum viable population (MVP) of giant pandas. However, each of these methods is designed only based on population sizes. In this paper, a membrane computing model based on behavioral biology is proposed to evaluate the MVP of the species. An application of the proposed data processing to binary tree whose nodes are composed of population sizes is also proposed. An binary tree is generated by integrating the following three techniques: (a) a random technique to generate the vast majority of populations; (b) a modified binary search method to obtain an order population size sequence; (c) a modified inorder traversal to generate an order binary tree and a parent tree. This is the first attempt to apply membrane computing model to assess the MVP of giant pandas. The effectiveness of the presented general PDP system is verified by means of the numbers or amounts of subpopulations. Besides, we also provide the population distribution of the obtained MVP.},

The automatic design of an arithmetic operation spiking neural P system (SN P system) in the literature usually considered the selection of the set of redundant rules under the condition of known initial spikes and connection between neurons. In this work, an automatic design method of arithmetic operation SN P systems including the encoding method and evolutionary strategy of arithmetic operation SN P systems is proposed to evolve an SN P system to achieve arithmetic operation. Experimental results show that the automatic design method of arithmetic operation SN P systems is feasible and effective for arithmetic operations.},

The current state of the environment is represented by a finite set of objects and the current state of the agent is given by a finite multiset of objects. By execution of a program from a set of programs associated with the agent, the agent can change the objects in its own state and possibly in the environment, too. Reaction systems are a  bio-inspired computational model where reactants are transformed into products only if some inhibitors are not present. We define sP colonies without input influence and prove that to any reversible sP colony of such type an inverse sP colony can be constructed that performs inverse computation. In the second part of the paper, we show that the concept of a reversible reaction system and the notion of an inverse reaction system can be defined in a similar way, and partially reversible reaction systems can simulate reversible logic gates and reversible Turing machines.},

In order to illustrate how these systems work we give an example of a spiking neural P system with astrocytes producing calcium that generates all even numbers using only two neurons and one astrocyte and without using either forgetting rules or delay in the evolution rules. We prove that in this framework, we can provide semi-uniform and uniform constructions of spiking neural P system with astrocytes producing calcium working in a non-deterministic way that are able to solve the subset sum problem in a polynomial number of steps without using either forgetting rules or delay in the evolution rules.},
