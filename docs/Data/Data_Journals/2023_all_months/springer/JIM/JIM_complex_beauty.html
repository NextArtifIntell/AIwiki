  abstract     = {Numerical control (NC) codes verification is an important issue in computer numerical control (CNC) machining simulation because wrong NC codes will lead to the workpiece scrap and collision. The NC code verification methods both in physical space and cyber space (such as 3D computer graphics environment) have been widely investigated in recent years. However, physical verification methods have the problems that the simulation takes time and improper operations may cause danger. On the other hand, cyber verification methods only support some types of machines and cannot reflect the actual conditions of machine tools. This study proposes a cyber-physical prototype system for NC codes verification and CNC machining simulation. Based on the RGB-D camera, the depth-to-stereo model is constructed to obtain the 3D information in images. Without connecting with the CNC controller, the cutting tool and workpiece coordinate system (WCS) movement information in physical space can be got from images captured by the RGB-D camera through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Workpiece size and NC codes are imported into cyber space to render virtual workpiece with augmented reality (AR) technology. So that the operator can directly see the virtual workpiece in the physical machining scene. The virtual workpiece is machined by the cyber-physical system according to cutting tool movement in physical space. This research further confirms the feasibility of using computer vision (CV) methods to build the cyber-physical CNC simulation system based on an RGB-D camera. The potential application of the system is to obtain simulation results from CNC machine tools (especially those that are forbidden to connect the controller) and transfer the machining results to the Internet of Things (IoT).},

  abstract     = {Injection molding is a widely used manufacturing technology for the mass production of plastic parts. Despite the importance of process optimization for achieving high quality at a low cost, process conditions have often been heuristically sought by field engineers. Here, we propose two systematic data-driven optimization frameworks for the injection molding process based on a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MBO) framework and a constrained generative inverse design network (CGIDN) framework. MBO, an extension of Bayesian optimization, uses Gaussian process regression adopting a multidimensional acquisition function based on the concepts of hypervolume and Pareto front. The CGIDN, which is an improved version of the original generative inverse design network (GIDN), uses backpropagation to calculate the analytical gradients of the objective function with respect to design variables. Both methods can be used for multi-objective optimization with trade-off relationships, for example, between the cycle time and deflection after extraction. We demonstrate the applicability of the optimization methods utilizing simulation data from Moldflow software for the manufacturing process of a door trim part. We showed that the optimal process parameters which simultaneously minimized deflection and cycle time were obtained with a relatively small dataset. We expect that in a realistic manufacturing facility, the optimal conditions found from simulations can guide the process design of the injection molding machine, or the proposed methods can be directly utilized because they do not require a very large dataset. We also note that the proposed optimization schemes are readily applicable to the optimization of other types of plastic manufacturing processes.},

  abstract     = {The combination of feature extraction and classification methods is an often used approach for wafer map failure pattern recognition. Recently, the convolutional neural network (CNN) method is used to raw wafer map data without feature extraction. CNN can improve the accuracy, but the drawback is the expensive computation cost. In our study, we have extracted local property analysis based features and used them with the traditional classification methods, ensemble methods, and CNN for wafer map failure pattern recognition. The decision tree showed better performance than the other methods when evaluating single traditional classification methods. Therefore, we used the decision tree as the base classifier of the proposed ensemble learning. We built a constituent model on a single type of feature set first and then made an ensemble of models to produce the final decision. We found that it is better than directly building a model on total features. Also, we have tested and compared CNN on extracted feature sets and raw wafer map image data. The results showed that raw image based CNN outperforms extracted features under the same number of epochs. However, the training cost of the raw image is much expensive. Furthermore, the performance of extracted features becomes closer to the raw image when increasing the number of epochs with a much lower training cost.},

The goal of DT is to create a virtual real-time intelligent system that is a typical twin of the physical system. DT provides analysis, prognosis, planning, and rapid response when needed. Digital shadow (DS) is an artifact concept of DT that provides a real-time replica of the physical system. Information in a DS is passed in one direction only, from the physical system to the virtual one. While in DT, the information goes in both directions. The definition and roles of DS and DT are overlapping. However, DS can be defined as the main component of a DT system. In this paper, DS roles are specified. Based on these roles, A DS framework architecture is proposed, and the communication system between its components. The proposed framework design is built using distributed system concepts such as event-driven architecture, microservices, and containerization. These concepts are well defined and utilized in the software engineering domain. The originality of the proposed framework is the definition of a systematic approach for designing and integrating digital models (DMs) from different vendors and domains. An experiment is designed to prove the framework’s ability to shadow a physical system in real-time. Multiple DMs are implemented and deployed on the proposed DS framework. These DMs are used to shadow a natural gas compressor system. Experimental results prove the practicality of our proposed DS framework to operate in real-time.},

To solve this problem, we design a computation-efficient particle detection network (PAD-Net) with an encoder–decoder architecture, making a good trade-off between inference efficiency and accuracy. In the encoder part, MobileNetV3 is tailored to greatly reduce parameters at a little cost of accuracy drop. And the decoder part is designed by using the light-weight RefineNet, which can further boost particle detection performance. Besides, the proposed network adopts the adaptive attention loss (termed AAL), which improves the detection accuracy with a negligible increase in computation cost. Finally, we employ a knowledge distillation strategy to further enhance the final detection performance without increasing the parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs) of PAD-Net. Experimental results on the real datasets demonstrate that our methods can achieve high-accuracy and real-time detection performance on valid particles compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Thus, we develop a new variant of the AOA, namely, Augmented AOA (AAOA), integrated with the opposition-based learning (OLB) and Lévy flight (LF) distribution. The main idea of applying OLB and LF is to improve the traditional AOA exploration and exploitation trends in order to find the best clusters. To evaluate the AAOA, we implemented extensive experiments using twenty-three well-known benchmark functions and eight data clustering datasets. We also evaluated the proposed AAOA with extensive comparisons to different optimization algorithms. The outcomes verified the superiority of the AAOA over the traditional AOA and several MH optimization algorithms. Overall, the applications of the LF and OLB have a significant impact on the performance of the conventional AOA.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based defect recognition in the metal industry is an important and challenging task. Many mainstream methods based on supervised learning need a large amount of annotated defect data. However, the data acquisition in industrial scenarios is quite difficult and time-consuming. To alleviate the problem, in this paper, we propose a few-shot defect recognition (FSDR) method for metal surfaces by attention-embedding and self-supervised learning. The proposed method includes two stages,pre-training and meta learning. In the pre-training stage, an attention embedding network (AEN) is designed for better learning the defect local correlation of multi-receptive field and reducing the background interference, and to train a robust AEN without any annotations, a multi-resolution cropping self-supervised method (MCS) is developed for better generalizing the few-shot recognition task. Then, in the meta learning stage, to generate the embedding features, the defect images are encoded by the pre-trained AEN, and we also design a query-guided weight (QGW) to address the bias of embedding feature vector. The classification information is gained by computing the distance of the embedding feature vector of each category. We evaluate the proposed FSDR on the NEU dataset and the experiments show competitive results in 1-shot and 5-shot defect recognition tasks compared with the mainstream methods.},

  abstract     = {Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is a key aspect of health condition monitoring, which can reduce maintenance costs and improve system operational efficiency. The most existing approaches only extract temporal features or spatial features, and ignore raw mapping features in RUL prediction. However, these different features are highly complementary and relevant for RUL prediction. Different from these approaches, we propose a novel feature-fusion-based end-to-end approach for RUL prediction in this paper, which combines spatiotemporal features and raw mapping features. To begin with, the time attention mechanism is used for the input to weight different time steps. Then convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for the weighted input to extract spatial feature maps. Between the CNNs, channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms are applied to the feature maps to learn the importance of channel and spatial distribution. Meanwhile, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit is adopted to capture temporal dependency features. In addition, the raw mapping features are obtained from the input through a fully connected layer to provide additional information. Finally, the three types of obtained features are fused for the final RUL prediction through fully connected networks. Extensive experiments are carried out on the C-MAPSS engine dataset. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the current deep learning approaches.},

  abstract     = {Fault diagnosis is an important technology for performing intelligent manufacturing. To simultaneously maintain high manufacturing quality and low failure rate for manufacturing systems, it is of great value to accurately locate the fault element, evaluate the fault severity and find the fault root cause. In order to effectively and accurately perform fault diagnosis for rotating machinery, a novel feature selection method named unified discriminant manifold learning (UDML) is proposed in this research. To be specific, the local linear relationship, the distance between adjacent points, the intra-class and inter-class variance are unified in UDML. Based on these, the local structure, global information and label information of high-dimensional features are effectively preserved by UDML. Through this dimension reduction method, homogeneous features become more concentrated while heterogeneous features become more distant. Consequently, mechanical faults could be diagnosed accurately with the help of proposed UDML. More importantly, local linear embedding algorithm, locality preserving projections algorithm, and linear discriminant analysis algorithm could be regarded as a special form of UDML. Moreover, a novel weighted neighborhood graph is constructed to effectively reduce the interference of outliers and noise. The corresponding model parameters are dynamically adjusted by the gray wolf optimization algorithm to find a subspace that discovers the intrinsic manifold structure for classification tasks. Based on the above innovations, a fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery is proposed. Through experimental verifications and comparisons with several classical feature selection algorithms, rotating machinery fault diagnosis can be more accurately performed by the proposed method.},

In addition, in practice, inventory is an important link between manufacturers and customers. Therefore, we firstly propose an optimal scheduling problem of integrated production, inventory and imperfect maintenance with mutual feedback of supply side and demand side, shortened to PIM-DCSP. In PIM-DCSP, production resources and inventory work together to provide spare parts for demand side, while demand side makes imperfect maintenance scheduling for its distributed equipment to postpone deterioration and finally extend the operating time of equipment. The goal of PIM-DCSP is to make an optimal scheduling that jointly optimizes the scheduling of both sides, that is, reasonably arrange production resources, inventory and workers to realize the minimization of the total cost of supplier and the total cost of demander respectively. A mathematical model is established to describe the presented problem and an improved adaptive cooperative algorithm (IACA) is designed. Effective operators including two heuristic initialization methods, six problem-oriented and two random local search structures are developed to strengthen population diversity and search capability.

In tandem with these, an online intelligent design system for roller path was developed with the aid of intelligent sensing, learning, optimization and execution. It enables the multi-functional of spinning condition monitoring, real-time prediction of spinning status, online dynamic processing optimization, and autonomous execution of the optimal processing. Through system implementation and verification by case studies, the results show that the intelligent processing optimization and self-adaptive control of the spinning process can be efficiently realized. The optimal roller path and matching spinning parameters (mandrel speed, feed ratio) can be efficiently obtained by only one simulation of the spinning process and no traditional trial-and-error is needed. Moreover, the optimized process can compromise the multi-objectives, including forming qualities (wall thickness reduction and flange fluctuation) and forming efficiency. The developed methodology can be generalized to handle other incremental forming processes.},

  abstract     = {In the initial stage of the establishment of photovoltaic (PV) module production lines or the upgrading of production processes, the available data for some defects are limited. The detection for these data-scarce defects of photovoltaic (PV) modules is a challenging task, because most detectors hardly extract meaningful high-level features from limited information of several samples. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end meta-learning based few-shot detector (Meta-FSDet). Firstly, a prototype vector extractor (PVE) is proposed, which utilizes locational prior knowledge of data-scarce defects to extract corresponding prototype vectors. Then, a novel saliency highlighting network (SHN), which measures the similarity between extracted prototype vectors from PVE and each spatial-position vector of the query feature map, is proposed to infer a class-agnostic saliency map, in which the defective areas are well highlighted. Next, a remodel region proposal network (RRPN), which further leverages the saliency map from SHN to pixel-wisely reweight the inputted feature map of region proposal network (RPN), is presented to better infer meaningful high-level region-of-interest (RoI) features of data-scarce defects. Finally, these RoI features from RRPN are further processed by downstream classification and regression module to generate final prediction results. Extensive experiments on PV module dataset demonstrate our Meta-FSDet owns superior performance compared to other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The problem of manufacturing process classification is to identify manufacturing processes that are suitable for a given part design. Previous research on automating manufacturing process classification was limited by small datasets and low accuracy. To solve the first problem, a larger dataset composed of 12,463 examples with four manufacturing processes was constructed. To improve classification accuracy, a deep learning-based method for CAD models was proposed. To begin with, the heat kernel signature (HKS) is computed from a triangle mesh representation of the part. To deal with different numbers of vertices within different models, i.e., different sizes for HKS within each model, two alternative methods are proposed. The first one applies binning to sort all vertices into constant bins, which is further fed into a conventional CNN for classification. The other method searches the most representative local HKS by farthest point sampling, and the representative local HKS are then sent into a pointwise CNN for classification. The scope of this paper focuses on the use of only part shapes for manufacturing process classification, while acknowledging that other information such as size scales, tolerances, and materials, play important roles in manufacturing process selection. Results demonstrate excellent process classification performance with only part shape information.},

  abstract     = {On-machine monitoring of tool wear is of great significance in machining processes to enhance machining efficiencies and reduce cost. For the data-driven tool wear prediction, the consistent feature distribution is critical to the machining learning model. In CNC machining of complex parts, the data distribution is complex due to the time-varying operational parameters. Even the considered as perform well of transfer learning methods may not mine consistent feature distribution representations and may not explain the transferable components to break through the bottleneck of prediction performance. The attention mechanism has shown its unique advantages with the adaptive weighted structure to capture the specific feature in tool wear state prediction. In order to further capture the specific characteristic frequencies and determine the specific transferable components for different working conditions and enhance the performance of cross-domain tool wear prediction, we propose a new cross-domain adaptation network based on attention mechanism(CDATT). Firstly, a data filtering method based on the singular value decomposition and mixed Gaussian model is proposed for removing the idling signals to avoid the effects of invalid samples adaptively. Then, the attention mechanism is introduced to build a prediction network for highlighting the specific tool wear frequency and making the wear characteristic more significant. Next, the joint distribution adaptation regularization term is utilized to construct a network loss function to build the CDATT model for different working conditions. Finally, experiments are carried out on a machine tool to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The result shows that the proposed CDATT model can capture the specific tool wear frequency and identify the tool wear state accurately under different machining parameters.},

  abstract     = {The primary bottlenecks faced by the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process is the identification of optimal process parameters to obtain high density (&gt; 99.8%) and a good surface finish (&lt; 10 µm) in the fabricated components. Prediction of optimal process maps with the help of machine learning (ML) models is still challenging due to extensive training data, which proves to be expensive in additive manufacturing. In view of this, the present study employs six different supervised ML algorithms on a comparatively small data set of 33 experiments to predict relative density and surface roughness. It has been observed that input data (predictor) curation can increase the accuracy of the ML models even with a small data set. In the ML prediction model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was reduced by 30% (relative density) and 21.94% (surface roughness) with volumetric energy density as an input parameter instead of laser power, scanning speed, hatch space, and layer thickness. The choice of non-dimensional energy input as a universal predictor allows for an increase in training size and the translation capability of trained ML models from one machine/material combination to another. The ML model based on increased training data size (198 for relative density and 173 for surface roughness) procured from the material processed/fabricated on different LPBF machines showcased reasonable R2 values of 79.11% and 80.3% for relative density and surface roughness, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Laser beam powder bed fusion (LB-PBF) is a widely-used metal additive manufacturing process due to its high potential for fabrication flexibility and quality. Its process and performance optimization are key to improving product quality and promote further adoption of LB-PBF. In this article, the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) applications for process and performance optimization in LB-PBF are reviewed. In these applications, ML is used to model the process-structure–property relationships in a data-driven way and optimize process parameters for high-quality fabrication. We review these applications in terms of their modeled relationships by ML (e.g., process—structure, process—property, or structure—property) and categorize the ML algorithms into interpretable ML, conventional ML, and deep ML according to interpretability and accuracy. This way may be particularly useful for practitioners as a comprehensive reference for selecting the ML algorithms according to the particular needs. It is observed that of the three types of ML above, conventional ML has been applied in process and performance optimization the most due to its balanced performance in terms of model accuracy and interpretability. To explore the power of ML in discovering new knowledge and insights, interpretation with additional steps is often needed for complex models arising from conventional ML and deep ML, such as model-agnostic methods or sensitivity analysis. In the future, enhancing the interpretability of ML, standardizing a systemic procedure for ML, and developing a collaborative platform to share data and findings will be critical to promote the integration of ML in LB-PBF applications on a large scale.},

However, most previous studies have focused only on the utilization of defect samples with visible defects and underestimated the value of template samples without surface defects. In fact, template samples can provide sufficient prior information to identify defects and are not difficult to obtain in many manufacturing scenarios. Therefore, an adaptive feature reconstruction network (AFRNet) is proposed in this paper to utilize these two types of samples. Specifically, AFRNet consists of two main components: a Siamese encoder with shared parameters for extracting features from the input sample pair, and a symmetrical feature reconstruction module for adaptively fusing these extracted features. Similar image-level and feature-level fusion schemes, as well as spatial misalignment caused by unaligned sample pairs have been carefully studied. Extensive experiments on a real-world PCB surface-defect dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that it can significantly improve the segmentation performance of multiple baselines, such as DANet, PSPNet and DeepLabv3.},

First, the intrinsic dimension of manufacturing process data is estimated by combining multiple geometric features on the data manifold. Second, considering the angle information and distance information in the neighborhood of process data, the method to construct local features of the data manifold is given; further, a fusion method of local features and global–local features of manifold data based on the eigendimension is proposed, which constructs the data dimension-reduction mapping matrix to improve the integrity of data information extraction. Then, the data index of process monitoring is given and employed to monitor the manufacturing process. Finally, Tennessee Eastman (TE) process simulation data were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that compared with other methods, the anomaly detection rate of the proposed method was increased by more than 50%, while the false alarm rate was decreased by 21.4%, which proves that the method can significantly improve the efficiency of manufacturing process anomaly monitoring.},

Many methods were presented for imbalanced fault diagnosis only by resampling labeled fault dataset, which limited the diagnostic performance due to information loss from unlabeled fault dataset. To perfectly exploit the information from unlabeled and labeled datasets, this study proposed a semi-supervised ensemble learning method termed as SSTI for imbalanced fault diagnosis. First, the sample information was evaluated based on Mahalanobis distance, and a novel sample information-based synthetic minority oversampling technique (SI-SMOTE) was presented for balancing the labeled dataset. Second, the tri-training architecture-based imbalanced co-training technique (Tri-ImCT) was developed to exploit the information contained in the unlabeled dataset. In the Tri-ImCT, rebalancing the training subsets and variable weighted voting were utilized to improve the performance of proposed method for imbalanced fault diagnosis. To verify the performance of proposed method, several experiments were carried out on several imbalanced datasets derived from two bearing datasets and one subway wheel dataset. We utilized three indicators of G-mean, average precision, and average F-score for evaluating the performance of classifiers. Experimental results show that the performance of proposed method exceeds that of other methods, which is very close to the upper bound of fully-supervised performance. It substantially indicates that this study provides a very promising methodology for imbalanced fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {A layer-wise neural network architecture is proposed for classification and regression of time series data where multiple instances have a single output. This data format is encountered in the manufacturing industry where parts are produced in batches—due to the short production cycle—and labelled as a whole for defects. The end-to-end neural network approach is benchmarked against a previously proposed feature engineering method based upon mean shift clustering and K nearest neighbours with dynamic time warping, and a naive approach of flattening the instances and training a support vector machine. An ablation study is performed on a layer-wise 1D-convolutional neural network (CNN) to understand which of the architectural design choices are critical for prediction performance. Based on a transfer moulding production dataset, it is found that the layer-wise 1D-CNN and multilayer perceptron (MLP) have the best performance across most of the common classification and regression metrics, but the layer-wise MLP has a lower computational cost. Finally, it is shown that the proposed parameter sharing in the dense layers of both networks is key to reducing the number of parameters and improving prediction performance.},

In turn, RBE values are characterized by substantial uncertainty and vary during the RSW processes. To reduce their dispersions, preliminary low-current pulses are applied. In some cases, the quality of the formed RSW joints are controlled using dynamic resistances obtained by feedback from advanced power sources. In these studies, the effect of four preheating current diagrams on the stabilization of the RBE values was investigated for a wide range of parts made of copper, brass, bronze, austenitic stainless steel, as well as aluminum, titanium and zirconium alloys with thicknesses from 0.2 to 1.0 mm in various combinations. Also, the RSW process control capabilities were assessed using feedback from an up-to-date digital synthesizer of unipolar current pulses. As a result, the RBE values were stabilized in all studied cases. Ranges of the variations between the maximum and minimum RBE values decreased from about 5–11 down to 2–5 times. However, the applied algorithms of the preheating current pulses had no effect on the RBE dispersions. It was found that dynamic electrical processes in a welding gun cause distortion of actual RBE curves, which makes it difficult to control heat input and, respectively, the formation of weld nuggets.},

Deep learning based automated systems may provide a better way for real time monitoring to ensure quality production. These systems are usually trained in a fully supervised manner which require large amount of labeled data. Obtaining labeled training data in large quantities is a tedious and time consuming process. To overcome this, a novel semi-supervised deep learning approach is proposed in this work, which can be trained using both labeled and unlabeled data, and hence, reducing the manual labeling efforts needed to train the system. Experimental results on a SLS powder bed defect detection dataset show that the proposed approach is the new state-of-the-art, and shows its potential as a standalone real time monitoring system for SLS. In this dataset the proposed approach beats the state-of-the-art accuracy of $$98\%$$ with only $$25\%$$ of the labeled training data compared to other approaches. In addition, an extensive set of experiments were conducted on three additional public defect inspection datasets (NEU steel surface defects, KolektorSDD surface images of plastic electronics commutators, and surface textures) to show the applicability of the proposed approach on other computer integrated manufacturing environments for quality inspection. In all of these datasets the proposed approach beats the state-of-the-art results with relatively small amounts of training data compared to other approaches, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach for real time, automated, and accurate quality inspection.},

The ability to precisely address material handling processes for manufacturability analysis further connects the physical and cyber components of today’s smart manufacturing systems. In this work, we propose a product-centered signature mapping approach to automated digital twinning featuring a hybrid implementation of smart sensing, signature-based feature extractor, and knowledge taxonomy. First, we integrate 3D scanning and surface reconstruction at to implement shape retrieval from both the virtual environment (from Computer-Aided Engineering data) and the real-world production environment (from scanned point cloud frames). Second, Shape Terra, an algorithm for intrinsic curvatures, simulates Persistent Heat Values for fast signature extraction from retrieved shape files. Finally, a systematic integration of the proposed shape analysis based on knowledge taxonomy is prototypically implemented. The objective of this testbed is to illustrate a proof-of-concept DT-aided process autonomy fed by rapid 3D surface signatures. As a result, by hybridizing smart sensing and simulative approaches, we exploit shape signatures as manufacturing knowledge by integrating domain knowledge and data-driven decision-makings. Moreover, human–machine interoperability enabling system-level intelligent controls becomes feasible in complex material handling, shape forming, measuring, and inspection processes.},

Depending on the estimated operator intentions, the robotic system can adjust tasks or motions, while regulating the robot compliance with respect to the co-worker physical guidance.

  abstract     = {Regenerative chatter in machining operations such as milling is a common process anomaly that limits productivity and part quality, which in turn lead to increased manufacturing costs. The industrial relevance of the problem has sparked many research efforts over the recent decades, with a growing interest in real-time chatter detection and suppression. Inspired by learning from human demonstration frameworks, this paper proposes a new approach to milling chatter detection via effective human–machine interaction, which facilitates knowledge transfer from an experienced machine tool operator to a “Digital Apprentice.” The proposed chatter detection approach acquires chatter-specific knowledge through a learnable skill primitive (LSP) algorithm designed to establish a robust chatter detection threshold from few-shot real-time demonstrations by an experienced human operator. In this work, digital audio data were acquired from milling experiments through a microphone mounted inside the milling machine. During the training phase, data for the human operator’s natural reaction to chatter were collected via a specially designed human–machine interface. The learned chatter detection thresholds were obtained via the LSP algorithm by temporally mapping the reaction time data to the audio signal. During the testing phase, experiments were conducted to validate the detection accuracy and detection speed of the learned chatter detection thresholds under different cutting conditions. The experimental validation results of the learned thresholds indicate an average chatter detection accuracy of 94.4%, with 55.6% of chatter cases detected before chatter marks are produced on a 4140 Steel workpiece, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of human–machine interaction in chatter detection.},

  abstract     = {The manufacturing of complex parts, such as aircraft structural parts and aero-engine casing parts, has always been one of the focuses in the manufacturing field. The machining process involves a variety of hard problems (e.g. tool wear prediction, smart process planning), which require assumptions, simplifications and approximations during the mechanism-based modelling. For these problems, supervised machine learning methods have achieved good results by fitting input–output relations from plenty of labelled data. However, the data acquisition is difficult, time consuming, and of high cost, thus the amount of data in a single enterprise is often limited. To address this issue, this research aims to realise the equivalent manufacturing data sharing based on federated learning (FL), which is a new machine learning framework to use the scattered data while protecting the data privacy. An enterprise-oriented framework is first proposed to find FL participants with similar data resources. Then, the machining parameter planning task for aircraft structural parts is taken as an example to propose an FL model, which mines the knowledge and rules in the historical processing files from multiple enterprises. In addition, to solve the data difference among enterprises, domain adaptation method in transfer learning is used to obtain domain-invariant features. In the case study, a prototype platform is developed, and to validate the performance of the proposed model, a data set is built based on the historical processing files from three aircraft manufacturing enterprises. The proposed model achieves the best performance compared with the model trained only with the data from a single enterprise, and the model without domain adaptation.},

Initially, the furnace was identified using an AutoRegressive eXogenous (ARX) model. The model was tested using a cross-validation method with 10-steps-ahead prediction tests. The prediction showed results higher than 93.70% with Final Prediction Error (FPE) lower than 0.0007. The controllers were simulated and their parameters were tuned using the identified model. The tuned algorithms were implemented through a PC-based instrumentation in real-time. The Fuzzy-PI controller presented the best results regarding the steady-state error, controlling the temperature of the furnace with a variation less than $$\pm 1.06~^{\circ }\mathrm{C}$$ in the flat zone at the process temperature of $$900~^{\circ }\mathrm{C}$$ with fast settling time.

However, implementing deep learning technology at actual manufacturing sites remains challenging because the data acquired during the manufacturing process are not only unlabeled but also imbalanced time series data. In this study, we constructed semi-supervised manufacturing fault detection methods to deal with the imbalanced time series data obtained from manufacturing applications, based on recently proposed deep generative models: variational autoencoder-reconstruction along projection pathway (VAE-RaPP) and Fence generative adversarial network (Fence GAN). To apply a semi-supervised learning algorithm, 1000 labeled samples of good product were prepared. The deep generative models learned the features of good product from these labeled samples during training. Consequently, the model was sufficiently trained to distinguish good and defective product in unlabeled samples. Additionally, we converted the time series data acquired during the manufacturing process into images to improve the feature extraction capability of deep neural networks based on three encoding methods: Gramian angular difference field (GADF), Markov transition field (MTF), and recurrence plot (RP). The performance of these methods was then compared using four evaluation indicators: area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), average precision (AP) score, precision-recall (PR) curve, and accuracy. The VAE-RaPP exhibited outstanding performance in all types of encoding methods when compared with the Fence GAN. This research provides a novel approach that combines the encoding of time series into images and deep generative models for manufacturing fault detection.},

To solve the problem, a mixed-integer programming model is first built to characterize it mathematically, and a novel extended network graph is designed to represent and solve this problem visually. Then, an improved artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed that can solve the IPPS problem of remanufacturing systems with disassembly, reworking and reassembly shops simultaneously. In this introduced algorithm, a 3-level real-number solution representation scheme is adopted for encoding and decoding processes, and efficient neighborhood search structures are designed to improve the quality and diversity of the population.

Compared with the traditional usage of CNNs in image recognition, IRGs require high recognition accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the existing methodologies for CNN architecture design often rely on human experience and numerous trial-and-error attempts, which make it a very challenging task to obtain an optimal CNN for IRGs. To tackle this challenge, this paper develops a new differentiable architecture search (DARTS) method considering the floating-point operations (FLOPs) of CNNs, named the DARTS-F method, which converts the discrete CNN architecture search to a gradient-based continuous optimization problem and considers both the prediction accuracy and the computational cost of the CNN during the optimization. To efficiently identify the optimal neural network, this paper adopts a bilevel optimization, which first trains the neural network weights in the inner level and then optimizes the neural network architecture by fine-tuning the operational variables in the outer level. In addition, a new digital twin (DT) of IRG is developed considering the physics of realistic robotic grasping in the DT’s virtual space, which could not only improve the IRG accuracy but also avoid the expensive training time. In the experiments, the proposed DARTS-F method could generate an optimized CNN with higher prediction accuracy and lower FLOPs than those obtained by the original DARTS method. The DT framework improves the accuracy of real robotic grasping from 61 to 71%.},

  abstract     = {Foreign object detection in manufacturing processes based on machine vision remains a challenge. The vastly different foreign objects and the complex background, as well as the scarcity of images with foreign objects constrain the application of traditional and deep learning methods, respectively. This paper discusses a novel method for intelligent foreign object detection and automatic data generation. A cascaded convolutional neural network to detect foreign objects on the surface of the tobacco pack is proposed. The cascaded network transforms the inspection into a two-stage YOLO based object detection, consisting of the tobacco pack localization and the foreign object detection. To address the scarcity of images with foreign objects, several data augmentation methods are introduced to avoid overfitting. Furthermore, a data generation methodology based on homography transformation and image fusion is developed to generate synthetic images with foreign objects. Models trained using synthetic images generated by this method show superior performance, which presents a viable approach to detecting newly introduced foreign objects. Extensive experimental results and comparisons on the tobacco pack foreign object dataset with several state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The proposed cascaded foreign object detection network and synthetic data generation methodology have the potential for widespread applications.},

  abstract     = {Femtosecond laser processing is widely used in the micromachining of hard and brittle materials. Preparation of tapered microchannels with customizable cross-sections in silica glass using ultrafast lasers is of great significance in the field of microfluidic applications. In this paper, the width and depth of tapered microchannel in silica glass are predicted by combining theoretical modeling and machine learning. The functional relationship between laser processing parameters and microchannel width is obtained by theoretical modeling and introducing correction coefficients. The estimated model width is highly consistent with the experimental results. To solve the complex nonlinear mapping relationship between microchannel depth and processing parameters, a machine learning method based on a backpropagation neural network algorithm is proposed. By reasonably selecting model parameters, accurate prediction of microchannel depth is achieved with the corresponding average relative prediction error of 5.174%. Based on the proposed method, an effective parameter optimization strategy for achieving microchannels of specific sizes is developed. This method provides a new scheme for size prediction and controllable fabrication of silica glass microchannels with a femtosecond laser. Moreover, the proposed approach significantly reduces the time and cost of trial and error during actual processing and product development.},

  abstract     = {Demands for more accurate machine learning models have given rise to rethinking current modeling approaches that were deemed unsuitable, primarily due to their computational complexity and the lack of availability and accessibility to representative data. In Industry 4.0, rapid advancements in Digital Twin (DT) technologies and the pervasiveness of cost-effective sensor technologies have pushed the incorporation of artificial intelligence, particularly data-driven machine learning models, for use in smart manufacturing. However, the persistent issue with such models is their high sensitivity to the training data and the lack of interpretability in the outcomes, at times generating unrealistic results. The incorporation of knowledge into the machine learning pipeline has been earmarked as the most promising approach to address such issues. This paper aims to answer this call through a Knowledge-embedded Machine Learning (KML) framework for smart manufacturing, which embeds knowledge from experience and, or physics information into the machine learning pipeline, thus making the outcomes from these models more representative of real applications. The merits of KML were then presented through comparative studies showing its capability to outperform knowledge-based and data-driven models. This promising outcome led to the development of frameworks that can potentially incorporate KML for smart manufacturing applications such as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) and DT, further supporting the usefulness of the proposed KML framework.},

As a part family-oriented manufacturing system paradigm, D-RMS should concern delayed reconfiguration at the outset of part family formation. To bring the characteristics of delayed reconfiguration into the part family of D-RMS, an exclusive part family formation method for D-RMS based on machine learning is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a similarity coefficient that considers the characteristics of D-RMS is put forward based on the operation sequence of part. The positions of the common operations in the corresponding operation sequences are investigated. The more former common operations there are, the more probability it is that the parts are grouped into the same part family. The relative positions of the common operations are considered by proposing a concept of the longest relative position common operation subsequence (LPCS). Additionally, the position difference and discontinuity of the LPCSs in the corresponding operation sequences are analyzed. A similarity coefficient is proposed that incorporates the abovementioned factors. Secondly, a machine learning method named K-medoids is adopted to group parts into families based on the calculation result of the similarity coefficient. Finally, a case study is presented to implement the proposed part family formation method for D-RMS, where the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through comparison.},

However, considering the diversity of part construction directions and accuracy requirements, as well as the limitations of time and materials, the printing layout still lacks comprehensive optimization models and methods, and the existing placement algorithms have not effectively utilized the holes inside parts and gaps between parts. In this paper, a comprehensive weighted general optimization model for 2D nesting is proposed to maximize time and economic benefits in AM. Moreover, a contour similarity matching method based on chain code for part placement is proposed to solve the problems about utilizing holes and gaps for the compact layout, and the approximate optimal solution is obtained by integrating annealing evolution algorithm. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for regular geometry and real-world part layout.},

The multispectral images captured by a self-developed multispectral imaging system is firstly converted into color images in CIELAB color space and three principal components are calculated by applying principal component analysis to reduce the dimensions of the multispectral images. During the multispectral image processing, the noise pixels are removed by calculating the local stability of each pixel, and then the remaining stable pixels are clustered using proposed GDPC algorithm based on three CIELAB color channels and three principal components.

To replace conventional methods making use of naked eye measurements, the images inside a reactor were acquired and processed using three different methods. Several models to detect irregular nozzle spray patterns in processed images have been developed through transfer learning. We combined these individual models to develop an ensemble model that exhibited better performance than the individual models.

  abstract     = {Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) is a newly proposed metaheuristic algorithm, which primarily works based on the cooperative system and chasing behavior of Harris’ hawks. In this paper, an augmented modification called HHMV is proposed to alleviate the main shortcomings of the conventional HHO that converges tardily and slowly to the optimal solution. Further, it is easy to trap in the local optimum when solving multi-dimensional optimization problems. In the proposed method, the conventional HHO is hybridized with Multi-verse Optimizer to improve its convergence speed, the exploratory searching mechanism through the beginning steps, and the exploitative searching mechanism in the final steps. The effectiveness of the proposed HHMV is deeply analyzed and investigated by using classical and CEC2019 benchmark functions with several dimensions size. Moreover, to prove the ability of the proposed HHMV method in solving real-world problems, five engineering design problems are tested. The experimental results confirmed that the exploration and exploitation search mechanisms of conventional HHO and its convergence speed have been significantly augmented. The HHMV method proposed in this paper is a promising version of HHO, and it obtained better results compared to other state-of-the-art methods published in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Layer-wise surface morphology information plays a critical role in the quality monitoring and control of additive manufacturing (AM) processes. 3D scan technologies can provide effective means to obtain accurate surface morphological data. However, most of the existing 3D scan technologies are time consuming due to either contact mode or algorithm complexity, which are not capable of obtaining the surface morphology data in an online manner during the printing process. To implement online layer-wise surface morphological data acquisition in AM processes, one practical solution is to model the correlation between 2D images and 3D point cloud data. In practice, since this correlation is usually highly complex due to the high dimensionality and non-linearity, it is usually impractical to find an explicit mathematical transfer function to quantify this correlation effectively. To address this issue, a deep learning-based model is developed in this study, in which a powerful deep learning algorithm, namely, convolutional neural network (CNN), is incorporated. With the trained CNN model, the 3D surface data can be predicted directly without the relatively time consuming triangulation computation by the 3D scanner. Thus, the speed of surface data acquisition and morphology measurement can be improved. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology, both simulation and real-world AM case studies were performed. The results show that the prediction accuracy using the proposed method is promising. In terms of averaged relative prediction error, it can be mostly lower than 10% in the experiments. Therefore, the proposed method has a great potential for online layer-wise surface morphology measurement in AM.},

Suitable product structures are decided by comparing PAs of design structures with PAs of FRs. Relations between structures and FRs are defined by the association relation to decide the best product structure from all potential solutions using a pairwise comparison method.

  abstract     = {Fault monitoring plays a vital role in ensuring operating safety and product quality of industrial manufacturing processes. However, modern industrial processes are generally developing towards the direction of large scale, diversification, and individuation, complexity, and refinement, exhibiting strong non-linearity and dynamically time-varying characteristics, leading to a great challenge in fault monitoring. This paper addresses a fault monitoring method based on a dynamically-recursive kernel principal component analysis (DRKPCA) model with a variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VBGMM), called DRKPCA-VBGMM, for the continuous, time-varying process monitoring. Specifically, a computationally efficient DRKPCA scheme is derived for the anomaly/fault detection of time-varying processes. Successively, a variational inference-induced optimal Gaussian mixture model, called VBGMM, is introduced for the fault type identification, which can automatically converge to the real number of Gaussian components based on the empirical Bayes approach to achieve the optimal probability distribution model. Extensive confirmatory and comparative experiments on a benchmark continuous stirred tank reactor process and a continuous casting process from a top steelmaking plant in China have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, the proposed method can effectively improve the fault detection and identification accuracies while reducing false alarm rates, laying a foundation to ensure stable and optimized production of complex manufacturing processes.},

The problem is challenging due to the fact that the system dynamics are significantly affected by the operation modes. Specifically, the condition monitoring signals may behave quite differently for different operation modes. To overcome this difficulty, an operation-adjusted hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed by combining the operation information into the construction of HMM observation models. Modeling and classification methods using the formulated HMM are provided for system condition identification under variable operation conditions. Using numerical studies and real-world data, it is demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms commonly used machine learning methods by providing more accurate condition identification results.},

However, the traditional rule-based feature recognition methods are only suitable for analyzing simple and specific features. Although the existing methods based on deep learning are no longer limited to recognizing particular features, they cannot recognize complex overlapping features. To solve the above issues, this paper proposed a machining feature recognition approach based on the hierarchical neural network to recognize the multiple features on point cloud models. Firstly, the 3D models were converted into point cloud samples to construct the dataset, so that the approach could be applied to different 3D model formats. Then a hierarchical neural network called PointNet++ for single feature recognition was constructed. For the multi-feature point cloud models, a feature segmentation method was proposed to divide a complex multi-feature model into single feature models for recognition. Finally, the approach was evaluated on the created test data sets. The test results show that the overlapping machining feature on point cloud models can be accurately recognized with low computational cost.},

Loosening in threaded joints causing the problem of fluid or gas leakage may induce disastrous consequences. Regular loosening detection of threaded pipe fittings cannot be overemphasized. In engineering applications, marked bars are drawn on the threaded pipe fittings to indicate loosening/tightening state. Traditional visual inspection requires laborious workloads. An automated method for loosening detection of marked threaded pipe fittings is still lacking. In this paper, a T-junction threaded pipe fitting was chosen as the research object. We proposed a novel vision-based method to conduct the loosening detection of three threaded joints in a T-junction pipe fitting for the first time. Our method contains three integrated modules. A new generative adversarial network-based segmentation module is constructed to accurately segment marked bars first. Then skeleton algorithm is used to extract the center lines of segmented marked bars and three sensitive angle features for loosening detection are constructed. Last, these features are fed into support vector machine-based classification module to differentiate the loosening state from tightening state. The experimental results indicated that the average segmentation accuracy denoted by dice similarity coefficient was 0.96 and the average detection accuracy was 94.7% based on our method. Moreover, our proposed method has been validated having a strong loosening detection ability in different environments, and great potentials in engineering applications.},

To solve these issues, process monitoring and control is a powerful approach. Recently, a variety of monitoring methods have been proposed and integrated with metal AM machines, which enables a large volume of data to be collected during the process. However, the data analytics faces great challenges due to the complexity of the process, bringing difficulties on developing effective models for defects detection as well as feedback control to improve quality. To overcome these challenges, machine learning methods have been frequently employed in the model development. By using machine learning methods, the models can be built based on the collected dataset, while it is not necessary to fully understand the process.

The rise of numeric era, ruled by the keywords industry 4.0 or industry of the future imposes to companies to invent new processes and solve an ever increasing quantity of problems. Paradoxically, even if techniques of inventive problem-solving progress in diversity, their ability to face this world-wide challenge do not grow accordingly. However, thanks to Natural Languages Processing (NLP), actors of invention can now count on information contents as an assistant through its textual data. Patent texts are of particular interest since they are an important and constantly renewed source of inventive information. This situation leads to the difficulty, for scientists and engineers, to permanently manage new masses of information from recent domains well beyond their reading capacity. Our research, based on the combination of the theory of inventive problem-solving (also known as TRIZ) and NLP, has made it possible to extract quickly and in a relevant way from patent texts, concepts that contain information useful for formulating an inventive problem. In this paper, we present our methodology for the automatic extraction of inventive information from patent texts and measure our technique to a classical human-led information gathering. Our results show a significant reduction of experts time solicitation, for an increase of 36% in the extraction of useful information.

  abstract     = {The selection of the building orientations is the key to the pretreatment stage of models for additive manufacturing (AM) technology, which plays a significant role in product accuracy, material consumption, printing layout, etc., affecting the economy and time efficiency of printing. In this paper, an automatic selection system of the building orientation based on the double-layer priority aggregation multi-attribute decision-making (DLPA-MADM) method is proposed to select the optimal building orientation (OBO). The priority compensation restricted average (PCRA) aggregation operator is designed to handle the priority relationships among attributes. The alternative building orientations (ABOs) are constructed according to the reference orientations of the surface features via the STEP AP242 file. The models of the surface precision with feature (P&amp;F), printing time (PT), layout area (LA), and support volume (SV) attributes who participate in decision-making are established. According to the tolerances given from the STEP file, the sub-precision values of ABOs for surface features with distinct priorities are aggregated in the first layer to obtain the precision value. Four attributes are aggregated in the second layer with priority to acquire the comprehensive evaluation value (CEV), through the ranking of which, the OBO can be found. The effectiveness and rapidity of the developed system are proved by experiments on the model.},

  abstract     = {An effective lithium-ion battery (LIB) recycling infrastructure is of great importance to alleviate the concerns over the disposal of waste LIBs and the sustainability of critical elements for producing LIB components. The End-of-life (EOL) LIBs are in various sizes and shapes, which create significant challenges to automate a few unit operations (e.g., disassembly at the cell level) of the recycling process. Meanwhile, hazardous and flammable materials are contained in LIBs, posing great threats to the human exposure. Therefore, it is difficult to dismantle the LIBs safely and efficiently to recover critical materials. Automation has become a competitive solution in manufacturing world, which allows for mass production at outstanding speeds and with great repeatability or quality. It is imperative to develop automatic disassembly solution to effectively disassemble the LIBs while safeguarding human workers against the hazards environment. In this work, we demonstrate an automatic battery disassembly platform enhanced by online sensing and machine learning technologies. The computer vision is used to classify different types of batteries based on their brands and sizes. The real-time temperature data is captured from a thermal camera. A data-driven model is built to predict the cutting temperature pattern and the temperature spike can be mitigated by the close-loop control system. Furthermore, quality control is conducted using a neural network model to detect and mitigate the cutting defects. The integrated disassembly platform can realize the real-time diagnosis and closed-loop control of the cutting process to optimize the cutting quality and improve the safety.},

But most of them focused on the innovation of models and algorithms, and rarely discussed and optimized from the perspective of data and samples. However, the reliability of sample quality directly determines the effectiveness of machine learning models. In this paper, a novel data-driven method based on sample reliability assessment (SRA) and improved convolutional neural network (ICNN) for mechanical fault diagnosis was designed. First, multinomial logistic regression (MLR) was conducted to construct the assessment model and a statistical approach named influence function was used to compute the sample weights efficiently. Then, ICNN with the improved loss function was proposed based on the strategies of sample weights, class weights and early-stopping. Compared with traditional deep learning models, ICNN can better eliminate the negative impact of the problems during the model training including sample quality imbalance, class imbalance, and overfitting phenomenon. Therefore, the fault diagnosis performance can be improved. Finally, the trained ICNN can automatically extract the fault characteristics and achieve the fault diagnosis with the input of compressed time–frequency images. Experiments on a benchmarking dataset and a gear dataset from a practical experimental platform verified the superiority of the proposed fault diagnosis method.},

This paper proposes an effective, lightweight detection method for aluminum strip surface defects in industry, which improves the disadvantages of low efficiency and high calculation cost of the YOLOv4 framework. The backbone network GMANet is constructed based on a new convolution Ghost module, in which the union attention module is embedded in the stacked Ghost block. It realizes the compression of the network scale and focuses on the channel information of important feature maps. On this basis, the fusion neck network is redesigned and lightened by utilizing depthwise separable convolution and the sampling blocks of pixelshuffle and passthrough. It can reduce the information loss caused by sampling, and improve the extraction ability to multi-size features and the adaptive learning capability to weights. Moreover, the proposed method is trained and tested on the database of seven types of common defects collected from the quality inspection station of the cold rolling workshop. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves that the value of mAP is 94.68%, the model volume is reduced by 80.41%, and the detection speed is increased by three times, thereby outperforming the original YOLOv4 model. And it provides a research idea for the subsequent real-time detection of the aluminum strip surface on the embedded system.},

The inverse heat transfer problem (IHTP) is a needed task to be solved in many casting processes to evaluate this coefficient. In this work, four different nature inspired algorithms [genetic algorithm (GA), evolutionary strategy (ES), artificial immune system (AIS) and particle swarm algorithm (PSO)] have been integrated to a numerical model of solidification to solve the IHTP problem with a view to evaluating the transient profile of h during solidification of three different cylindrical casting setups (outward, inward and upward). The aim is to reduce the number of iterations to achieve successful results by the association between metaheuristics and different sets of h values. Therefore, an objective function was modeled to match the temperatures predicted by the numerical model to those of experimental measurements. Sets of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 h values used to compose its transient profile have been evaluated by the four metaheuristics approaches aiming to characterize each casting situation.},

  abstract     = {Raise boring is an important method to construct underground shafts of mines and other underground infrastructures by drilling down the pilot hole and then reaming up to the desired diameter. As a typical cyber-physical system, the raise boring construction project is full of high heterogeneity, complexity and intrinsic uncertainty. Currently, its decision making loop is mainly based on the document-based system engineering and expertise experience. Regarding the intrinsic invisibility and uncertain risks in the underground engineering, especially for the remotely underground constructions on the extraterrestrial planets, it is absolutely required to shift the document-based and experience-dependent decision making paradigm into a digital and smart way. To this end, a systematic framework of the digital twin-driven process planning system for the raise boring method was conceived and presented. Then following the principles of open architecture, modularization and extensibility, a five-dimension architecture of digital twinning was built comprehensively that contained physical entity, digital representation, service entity, cross-systems entity and connection entity. Furthermore, a digital twin-driven decision making prototype system for the raise boring process was developed by the hybrid modeling of data-based model, visual geometric models, domain knowledge-based model and physics-based model. System verification indicated that the presented system had great potentials to facilitate the already very complicated process planning via the planning recommendation, visual simulation and models fusion. Finally, the contributions, novelty and limitations of this endeavour to extend the current digital twin practice were discussed.},

A significant drawback of this process is the poor geometric accuracy largely attributed to material spring-back. This paper presents the use of Convolutional Neural Networks-Forming Prediction (CNN-FP) to predict this error, allowing users to better understand the expected distribution of geometric error prior to actual forming. The reported work differs from other published approaches in that a CNN was used as an automatic and flexible method for quantifying local geometries. The CNN-FP model was trained using a set of SPIF geometries with varying wall angles and corner radii. The performance of the trained model was validated using two SPIF geometries: one consisting of untrained wall angles and the other combining various features to create a complex geometry. The CNN-FP model achieved an RMSE (Root mean squared error) of 0.381 mm at 50 mm depth for the untrained wall angle. For the untrained complex geometry, the CNN-FP performance was found to be 0.391 mm at 30 mm depth. However, a significant deterioration was observed at 50 mm depth of the complex geometry, where the model’s prediction had an RMSE of 0.903 mm. While the model was shown to be efficacious in most of the validation tests, limitations in the breadth of training samples was attributed to the model’s degraded performance in some instances.},

In this paper, we employ the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm to seek suitable model parameter initialization that can rapidly adapt to the given test sample with few-shot training samples. We also propose to build pseudo-meta-RUL task sets for meta-learning by calculating time sequence similarities. To further improve the applicability of the model, we extend the proposed method from few-shot conditions to general conditions.

This low-dimensional description allows an accurate representation of any sample in the database with few independent parameters. Therefore, we propose a reconstruction algorithm that takes as input an incomplete measurement (faster than a complete digitization), identifies the statistical shape parameters and outputs a full scan reconstruction. We showcase an application to the digitization of large aeronautical fuselage panels. A statistical shape model is constructed from a database of 793 shapes that were completely digitized, with a point cloud of about 16 million points for each shape. Tests carried out at the manufacturing facility showed an overall reduction in the digitization time by 80% (using a partial digitization of 3 million points per shape) while keeping a high accuracy (reconstruction precision of 0.1 mm) on the reconstructed surface.},

Due to the limitations of available data and computing capability at the edge location, it is still very challenging to realize edge computing for complex machining monitoring. To satisfy this research need, a calibration-based tool condition monitoring (TCM) is developed to monitor the tool wear progression in repetitive machining processes by comparing the characteristic signals generated by the reference cutting tools in the calibration procedure with the signal generated by the cutting tool being monitored through a concise similarity analysis. The proposed algorithm can be easily integrated into typical cyber-psychical systems to realize the edge computing in a very efficient and flexible way. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a case study is demonstrated for tool wear monitoring of repetitive milling processes. Experimental validation has shown that the proposed calibration-based TCM algorithm can effectively realize the edge computing in tool wear monitoring through a simple calculation.},

However, these methods can only get a single position of the weld seam in each shooting and the detection scope is limited to the laser projection area, leading to low detection efficiency. To extract the narrow butt welds more efficiently, this paper combines the passive methods with the active methods, and proposes a 3D narrow butt weld seam detection system based on the binocular consistency analysis. Specifically, the active light method of fringe projection profilometry is adopted to capture the 3D information of the weldment. The weld seam extraction network based on binocular spatial information mining (BSMNet) is designed to analyze the corresponding passive light data and locate the weld seam position. Besides, a data annotation method based on binocular consistency correction is proposed to achieve more accurate data annotation for the BSMNet training. The experimental results show the max error of the detection is about 0.081mm, and the mean error is about 0.021mm.},

  abstract     = {Ultrafast laser scribing provides a new microscale materials processing capability. Due to the processing speed and high-quality requirement in modern industrial applications, it is important to measure and monitor quality characteristics in real time during a scribing process. Although deep learning models have been successfully applied for quality monitoring of laser welding and laser based additive manufacturing, these models require a large sample for training and a time-consuming data labelling procedure for a new application such as the laser scribing process. This paper presents a study on image-based characterization of laser scribing quality using a deep transfer learning model for several quality characteristics such as debris, scribe width, and straightness of a scribe line. Images taken from the laser scribes on intrinsic Si wafers are examined. These images are labelled in a large and a small dataset, respectively. The large dataset includes 154 and small dataset includes 21 images. A novel transfer deep convolutional neural network (TDCNN) model is proposed to learn and assess scribe quality using the small dataset. The proposed TDCNN is able to overcome the data challenge by leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) model already trained for basic geometric features. Appropriate image processing techniques are provided to measure scribe width and line straightness as well as total scribe and debris area using classified images with 96 percent accuracy. Validating model’s performance based on the small data set, the model trained with the large dataset has a similar accuracy of 97 percent. The trained TDCNN model was also applied to a different scribing application. With 10 additional images to retrain the model, the model accuracy performs as well as the original model at 96 percent. Based on the proposed TDCNN classification of debris on a scribed image of straight lines, two algorithms are proposed to compute scribe width and straightness. The results show that all the three quality characteristics of debris, scribe width, and scribe straightness can be effectively measured based on a much smaller set of images than regular CNN models would require.},

  abstract     = {Industries require, nowadays, to be more adaptable to unforeseen real-time events as well as to the rapid evolution of their market (e.g. multiplication of customers, increasingly personalized and unpredictable demand, etc.). To meet these challenges, manufacturers need new solutions to update their production plan when a change in the production system or its environment occurs. In this context, our research work deals with a dynamic scheduling problem of a real Hybrid Flow Shop considering the specific constraints of a perfume manufacturing company. This paper proposes a Digital Twin-driven dynamic scheduling approach based on the combination of both optimization and simulation. For the optimization, we have developed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) scheduling model taking into account the main specific scheduling requirements of our case study. Regarding the simulation approach, a 3D shop floor model has been developed including the additional stochastic aspects and constraints which are difficult or impossible to model with a MILP approach. These two models are connected with the real shop floor to create a digital twin (DT). The developed DT allows the re-scheduling of production according to internal and external events. Finally, validation scenarios on a perfume case study have been designed and implemented in order to demonstrate the feasibility and the relevance of the proposed digital twin-driven dynamic scheduling approach.},

  abstract     = {Chatter occurring in the milling process can seriously deteriorate the machining efficiency and surface quality. The stability diagram predicted using the tool tip frequency response functions (FRFs) is an effective approach to avoid the chatter vibration. The tool tip FRFs highly depend on the characteristics of the tool-holder-spindle-machine tool frame assembly. Thus, when the tool-holder assembly or only the tool overhang length changed, the FRFs will be reobtained to plot the stability diagrams. Considering this time-consuming situation, this paper introduces the transfer learning to efficiently predict the milling stability of arbitrary tool-holder combinations. First, a source tool-holder assembly is selected to measure sufficient overhang length-dependent tool tip FRFs and then predict the limiting axial cutting depth aplim values under different process parameters for forming the source data. For a new tool-holder assembly, impact tests are only performed under a few key tool overhang lengths to measure the tool tip FRFs and then predict the aplim values to form the target data. Combining the target data and the source data, the transfer learning containing the domain adaptation and adaptative weighting is introduced to train an overhang length-dependent milling stability prediction model of a target tool-holder assembly. A case study has been performed on a vertical machine tool with four different tool-holder assemblies to validate the feasibility of the proposed transfer learning-based milling stability prediction method.},

  abstract     = {Natural disasters usually occur unexpectedly, causing loss of life and property. It is essential to quickly and effectively distribute aid materials to minimize the damage in the aftermath of a disaster. Aid organizations require decision-making mechanisms that provide hard data to make quick and accurate decisions during the distribution of aid materials. In this study, the delivery of aid materials to the victims of disasters is investigated as a vehicle routing problem. For this purpose, a new method is developed by integrating the interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method with the Clarke and Wright savings algorithm. In this way, while determining the routes, different criteria specific to the problem could also be analyzed with the distance criterion. The proposed method is presented with a numerical example to show how it can be implemented in the humanitarian aid distribution problem. As a result of the numerical example, it is determined that the proposed method completed the delivery with 826 distance units in four rounds, and the classical Clarke and Wright savings algorithm completed the delivery at 820 distance units in four rounds. Although the proposed method provides a longer distance solution than the classical Clarke and Wright savings algorithm, it has the advantage of determining safer routes by taking into account the different risks that may arise during a disaster. Finally, well-known benchmark problems are solved using the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The plentiful labeled data is indispensable for data-driven intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. But in the real world, it is difficult to gather sufficient vibration signals in advance when faults occur. Selecting an intelligent model trained by other datasets to diagnose the target signals is an effective strategy in response to the data scarcity. In this paper, a guided deep subdomain adaptation network (GDSAN) is proposed to align the feature distributions across different datasets efficiently by minimizing the discrepancy between the distributions of relevant subdomains. Specifically, the proposed method realizes alignment by comparing the consistency of source labels and target pseudo labels predicted by the source classifier. The guided learning reduces the misjudgment of target pseudo labels, which helps the subdomain with identical label finding the proper common subspace more accurately. To evaluate the superiority of the proposed model, this paper conducts transfer experiments on six rolling bearing datasets and selects four mainstream deep transfer learning networks to compare with GDSAN. The results show the fault recognition accuracy of GDSAN is prominently higher than other approaches, meanwhile verify the need of using guided subdomain adaptation.},

  abstract     = {Remaining useful life is one of the key indicators for mechanical equipment health and condition-based maintenance requirements. In fact, the field of prognostics and health management is heavily reliant on remaining useful life estimation. The availability of industrial big data has enabled promising research efforts in prognostics and health management. Deep learning techniques have been widely adopted, and proven to be successful in big data prognostics applications. However, deep learning approaches are considered black box approaches with interpretation difficulties and loss of information due to high-level feature extraction resulting from layer-by-layer processing. Enriching the deep learning input with temporal features can increase the performance of deep learning based approaches. This paper aims to improve the performance of deep learning techniques by incorporating dynamic mode decomposition into the deep learning schemes for the purposes of remaining useful life estimation. The developed method is capable of accurately predicting the remaining useful life in a data driven manner without prior knowledge of system equations. The input temporal information and health state are enriched by using dynamic mode decomposition which produces dynamic modes that approximate the infinite Koopman operator modes. The modes contain coherent time dynamics of the processed system which contribute to producing a health indicator that is representative of the system degradation. These time dependent dynamics are important characteristics of the system’s health state. The degradation profile is incorporated into deep learning schemes that accurately predict the remaining useful life of the system. To validate the proposed model, two different experimental data repositories are used in this paper. The first one is a spiral bevel gear vibration dataset. The second one consists of turbofan engines vibration datasets. The validation results have shown improved remaining useful life estimation performance when dynamic mode decomposition technique is incorporated into the deep learning schemes presented in this paper.},

  abstract     = {A sustainable and reliable machining process is the main goal of seeking machine digitization. Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) combined with Artificial Intelligence are used for process control. This has become more essential in the case of machining of high-cost aerospace materials and critical product specifications. In this paper, a novel self-healing mechanism was developed to recover a CNC machine from producing parts that do not conform, to surface roughness’s specifications. The machine settings are reconfigured autonomously and online to recover from the effect of tool wear and to keep the surface roughness within the design specifications. The proposed self-healing mechanism is based on a pattern recognition algorithm called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). This algorithm generates patterns that characterize the out-of-specification state, and provides a corrective setting within the recovery patterns of the within-specification state by using various distance approaches. The developed self-healing mechanism is composed of three modules: CPS model of the CNC machine (module 1), classification into, out of, or within-specification states (module 2), and a self-healing controller (module 3) that is activated if the state of out-of-specification is found by module 2. The three modules are software. The current hardware system of the machine is not altered. The proposed self-healing is applicable and integrable to CNC machines with a wide range of machining parameters of feed rate from 20 mm/min to 750 mm/min and spindle speed from 15,000 RPM to 35,000 RPM. To validate the developed mechanism, a deep learning artificial model was developed on physical data to emulate the CNC milling machine in a CPS simulation environment, and test runs were executed. The proposed self-healing mechanism was evaluated under several simulation runs that covered the ranges of CNC machine settings. The measure of performance of the proposed mechanism is the out-of-specification clearing time. The test runs show that the proposed self-healing mechanism was able to clear the out-of- specification state and to recover the within-specification state in less than five seconds, with the best distance metric approach. The results of the time response for each test run are reported.},

In the first method, a practical convolutional neural network (CNN) model is quickly obtained by fine-tuning the VGG net. In the second method, the Release-Compression (RC) block is designed to fully utilize the power of convolution operation and greatly reduce the parameter number, and the information retention strategies are proposed to optimize the bottom and top of the network, so an ad-hoc CNN model named RswNet is obtained by combining RC block and information retention strategies. Experiment results show that the accuracies of the proposed two models are both higher than existing models, and RswNet has the higher accuracy and its parameters are reduced by more than 56% compared with existing models.},

  abstract     = {The demand for individualized products drives modern manufacturing systems towards greater adaptability and flexibility. This increases the focus on data-driven digital twins enabling swift adaptations. Within the framework of cyber-physical systems, the digital twin is a digital model that is fully connected to the physical and digital assets. A digital model must follow a standardization for interoperable data exchange. Established ontologies and meta-models offer a basis in the definition of a schema, which is the first phase of creating a digital twin. The next phase is the standardized and structured modeling with static use-case specific data. The final phase is the deployment of digital twins into operation with a full connection of the digital model with the remaining cyber-physical system. In this deployment phase communication standards and protocols provide a standardized data exchange. A survey on the state-of-the-art of these three digital twin phases reveals the lack of a consistent workflow from ontology-driven definition to standardized modeling. Therefore, one goal of this paper is the design of an end-to-end digital twin pipeline to lower the threshold of creating and deploying digital twins. As the task of establishing a communication connection is highly repetitive, an automation concept by providing structured protocol data is the second goal. The planning and control of a line-less assembly system with manual stations and a mobile robot as resources and an industrial dog as the product serve as exemplary digital twin applications. Along this use-case the digital twin pipeline is transparently explained.},

However, a general purpose lexicon alone is not sufficient, since text sentiment classification is perceived as a context-dependent task in the literature. On the contrary, we observe that many people tend to imitate others while writing reviews. As such, the subject of all the public opinion towards an entity ends up as an imbalanced corpus. In this paper, we intend to induce a context-based lexicon as a resource to explore imbalanced text sentiment classification. This method addresses the above mentioned two critical problems in text sentiment classification. First, it identifies subjective words relative to the context and computes the weight scores for subjective terms and full review. Also, in recent years, the application of RNNs to a variety of problems has been incredible, especially in natural language processing tasks. Thus, we take the advantages of the context-based lexicon as well as a bidirectional LSTM to handle text sentiment classification. Second, it deals imbalanced data by deploying a text based oversampling method for creating new synthetic text samples. The reason behind using a text based oversampling method is to make use of semantics of the information while creating new text samples. Experimental results prove that leveraging sentiment lexicon relative to the context and application of Bidiricetional LSTM with text based oversampling is useful in imbalanced text sentiment classification and in achieving state-of-the-art results over deep neural learning model baselines.},

  abstract     = {Root cause analysis (RCA) is the process through which we find the true cause of a problem. It is a crucial process in manufacturing, as only after finding the root cause and addressing it, it is possible to improve the manufacturing operation. However, this is a very time-consuming process, especially if the amount of data about the manufacturing operation is considerable. With the increase in automation and the advent of Industry 4.0, sensorization of manufacturing environments has expanded, increasing with it the data available. The conjuncture described gives rise to the challenge and the opportunity of automatizing root cause analysis (at least partially), making this process more efficient, using tools from data mining and machine learning to help the analyst find the root cause of a problem. This paper presents an overview of the literature that has been published in the last 17 years on developing automatic root cause analysis (ARCA) solutions in manufacturing. The literature on the topic is disperse and it is currently lacking a connecting thread. As such, this study analyzes how previous studies developed the different elements of an ARCA solution for manufacturing: the types of data used, the methodologies, and the evaluation measures of the methods proposed. The proposed conceptualization establishes the base on which future studies on ARCA can develop results from this analysis, identifying gaps in the literature and future research opportunities.},

  abstract     = {In the era of big data, data-driven product configuration improvement and product line restructuring are two important and interrelated problems, and joint decision-making regarding these two problems needs to be tackled. There are two difficulties to achieve the joint decision-making. One is to obtain consumer choice probabilities related to improved product configurations, and the other is to obtain the best product configuration portfolio. In this study, a framework combining text mining and multitask learning is developed to deal with the difficulties. In the framework, improved product configurations are generated using online reviews and transaction data of the target product and its competitors. A one-to-many mapping from customer requirements to improved product configurations is realized by using a multitask support vector machine to obtain consumer choice probabilities for the improved product configurations. The profit maximization models considering the customer choice probabilities are then developed to obtain the best product configuration portfolio. A case study of Huawei P20 series smartphones is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results indicate that the multitask support vector machine obtained a higher prediction accuracy than two single-task learning and two other multi-task learning methods, and the proposed framework has the ability to increase the profits produced by the best product configuration portfolio.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is an emergingly technology in aerospace such as aero-engine blade fabrication, which has benefits in complex shape creation with little post processing required. In this paper, a machine learning algorithm is proposed for powder-saving and support-free process planning in multi-axis metal AM, improving the printing efficiency and the surface quality of printed blade. Firstly, a self-adaptive spectral clustering algorithm is developed to carry out two functions: one is to decompose the blade into sub-blocks in a global view; the other one is to automatically obtain the optimal clustering number, addressing the contradiction issue between printing efficiency and decomposition performance. Secondly, the global constraint formula and the normalized area weight are introduced to obtain main printing orientations (MPOs). Each sub-block can be built along the corresponding MPO with high-quality surface, free support, and low powder leakage. A sample blade is built on the 3 + 2 axis laser metal deposition (LMD) machine to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method has advantages of less powder consumption, higher decomposition performance and printing efficiency compared to the existed method.},

  abstract     = {Thermal error of machine tools has a huge influence on the accuracy of the workpiece. However, the nonlinearity of the thermal error limits the accuracy and robustness of the prediction model. With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, this paper presents a novel thermal error modeling method based on random forest. The model’s hyper-parameters are easy to be optimized by grid searching method integrating with cross validation. The temperature features are measured as the model input. Based on the out-of-bag data generated during modeling process, the proposed model itself can simultaneously evaluate the temperature feature importance through comparing the decrease in model’s the prediction accuracy after randomly shuffling the value of the target feature. Moreover, to enhance the model performance and reduce the measurement and computational cost, the method of selecting key temperature points are presented to exclude the redundant features through iteratively eliminating the least important feature and comparing the prediction accuracy under different feature combinations. Furthermore, the hysteresis effect between temperature and deformation is also considered. The method of determining the time lag is proposed through permuting the original time series of the target feature while keeping the remainder constant and comparing the resultant relative importance. A thermal error experiment validates the accuracy and robustness of the proposed model which can continuously maintain the prediction accuracy of over 90% in spite of varying operation conditions. Compared to conventional machine learning methods, the proposed model requires less training data, enables faster and more intuitive parameter tuning, achieves higher prediction accuracy, and has stronger robustness.},

  abstract     = {Machine vision-based inspection technologies are gaining considerable importance for automated monitoring and quality control of manufactured products in recent years due to the advent of Industry 4.0. The involvement of advanced deep learning methods is a significant factor contributing to the advent of robust vision-based solutions for improving inspection accuracy at a significantly lower cost in manufacturing industries. The requirement of computational resources and large training datasets hinders the deployment of these solutions to manufacturing shop floors. The present research work develops an image-based framework considering pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), ResNet-101 to detect surface defects with the minimum training datasets and computational requirements. The outcomes of the proposed framework are substantiated through a case study of detecting commonly observed surface defects during the centerless grinding of tapered rollers. The image datasets consisting of standard tapered rollers and three common defect classes are captured and enriched further with the help of the data augmentation technique. The present work employs ResNet-101 for feature extraction combined with and multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier to detect defective images. The effects of the feature extraction layer (fc1000) and pooling layer (pool5) activation are explored to achieve the desired prediction abilities. The testing trials demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively performs image classification, achieving 100% precision for the ‘Good’ class components. The study showed that the proposed approach could overcome the requirements of large training datasets and higher computational power for deep learning models. The proposed system can be of significant importance for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) as an alternative to conventional labor-intensive manual inspection techniques.},

  abstract     = {The underlying complicated spatiotemporal thermo-mechanical processes in additive manufacturing (AM) technology pose challenges in predicting and optimizing the as-built part quality for production use. Physics-based simulations are being developed to provide reliable predictions such as part distortions, residual stresses/strains, microstructure contents, and grain morphology, which can guide the product design and manufacturing process for improved part quality. However, due to the complexity of the problem, e.g., multi-physics and multi-scale, physics-based models need the expertise to build an extensive simulation time preventing its use in real-time monitoring and control. This study proposes an inductive data-driven framework to simulate the part distortion field for additively manufactured components. The part distortion field data were collected from different AM build strategies using finite element (FE) simulations. The FE model consists of multi-layer part distortion fields as outputs constituted by AM process parameters as inputs. The surrogate model consists of two stages: (1) self-organizing map to project the high-dimensional spatial field of the part distortion into a likelihood estimator, (2) hybrid self-organizing methods to predict the extracted features and reconstruct the part distortion field. The data-driven model evaluates different build scenarios’ effects on the distortion field for additively manufactured parts. The results correlated well with FE simulations and established a prediction-based compensation strategy to reduce part distortions. It should be noted that while the framework is currently applied to FE simulation data, the integrated data-driven methods can also be deployed on experimentally measured 3D cloud data or other high throughput field measurements.},

  abstract     = {It is necessary to monitor and evaluate health state of rotating machinery, which directly affects the quality and productivity of manufacturing processes. At present, most of the existing fault diagnosis methods focus on analyzing the single sensor data. There are several problems: (1) single sensor data which only contain partial fault information are used to construct the graph, limiting the diagnosis performance; (2) the extracted traditional features containing shallow fault information have limited application scenarios. Recently, graph feature learning-based diagnosis approach shows its powerful feature learning ability, which can overcome the limitations of shallow feature extraction. In this paper, a deep graph feature learning-based diagnosis approach for rotating machinery using multi-sensor data is proposed. Singular values extracted from samples consisting of multi-sensor vibration signals are regarded as the sample node representation to construct the graph data. On the basis, a graph convolutional network is used to extract high-level features from graph data and achieve feature fusion for fault classification. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on a practical experimental platform considering different working conditions (motor loads), and the results shows that it can perform well even in small training dataset.},

  abstract     = {In industrial settings, it is inevitable to encounter abnormal patterns monitoring a process. These patterns point out manufacturing faults that can lead to significant internal and external failure costs unless treated promptly. Thus, detecting such abnormalities is of utmost importance. Machine learning algorithms have been widely applied to this problem. Nevertheless, the existing control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) method can only deal with a fixed input size rather than dealing with different input sizes according to the actual production needs. In order to tackle this problem, an original CCPR method relying on convolutional neural network (CNN) named as VIS-CNN is proposed. Signal resizing is performed using resampling methods, then CNN is used to extract the abnormal patterns in the dataset. Five different input sizes are generated for model training and testing. The optimal hyperparameters, as well as the best structure of the used CNN are obtained using Bayesian Optimization. Simulation results show that the correct recognition rate of the VIS-CNN is 99.78%, based on different window size control charts. Furthermore, we address the issue of the mixed CCP and provide a modified scheme to achieve high recognition ratio for 8 mixed patterns on top of 6 standard patterns. The modified scheme includes wavelet noise reduction and Adaptive Boosting. A case study on metal galvanization process is presented to show that the method has potential applications in the industrial environment.},

The layer-by-layer fabrication scheme of the AM significantly enhances fabrication flexibility, resulting in the expanded vulnerability space of cyber-physical AM systems. This potentially leads to altered AM parts with compromised mechanical properties and functionalities. Furthermore, those internal alterations in the AM builds are very challenging to detect using the traditional geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) features. Therefore, how to effectively monitor and accurately detect cyber-physical attacks becomes a critical barrier for the broader adoption of AM technology. To address this issue, this paper proposes a machine learning-driven online side channel monitoring approach for AM process authentication. A data-driven feature extraction approach based on the LSTM-autoencoder is developed to detect the unintended process/product alterations caused by cyber-physical attacks. Both supervised and unsupervised monitoring schemes are implemented based on the extracted features. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, real-world case studies were conducted using a fused filament fabrication (FFF) platform equipped with two accelerometers. In the case study, two different types of cyber-physical attacks are implemented to mimic the potential real-world process alterations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional process monitoring methods, and it can effectively detect part geometry and layer thickness alterations in a real-time manner.},

  abstract     = {Rotating machines are frequently subject to a wide range of rough conditions, resulting in mechanical failures and performance degradation. Thus, it is important to apply proper failure detection and recognition techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, to prevent these issues early. In industrial environments, little data exists regarding failure conditions, which hinders the training stage of the classification algorithms responsible for classifying the failures. Therefore, this work proposes a hybrid method of data augmentation to increase the number of minority class instances in order to improve classifier performance. The approach combines the synthetic minority over-sampling and the additive white Gaussian noise techniques to create a set of artificial signals. The results show that the proposal is able to achieve better results than applying those techniques separately and also when using an undersampling strategy. For comparison purposes, four machine learning classification methods were analyzed alongside our data augmentation proposal, namely, support vector machines, K-nearest neighbors, random forest and stacked sparse autoencoder. The proposed hybrid data augmentation method associated with stacked sparse autoencoder outperformed the other models obtaining an accuracy of 100% and a processing time of 0.13 s.},

Additionally, BLS lacks local mapping capability. To address these problems, a cascaded neural network framework based on a sparse polynomial-based RBF neural network and an attention-based broad learning system (SPRBF-ABLS) is proposed. We first propose a sparse polynomial weight-based RBF neural network (SPRBF) for feature mapping. Then an attention mechanism for BLS is proposed to enhance the representation capacity of BLS. The proposed model is evaluated on regression, classification, and face recognition datasets. In regression and classification experiments, the nonlinear approximation capability of the proposed model outperforms other BLS models. In face recognition experiments, the proposed model can improve the representation capacity, especially the robustness against noisy images. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model.},

JSSP is an NP-hard problem and a combinatorial optimization problem. This paper proposes a highly efficient and superior performance strategy for the artificial algae algorithm (AAA) integrated with the differential evolution (DE), denoted AAADE, to solve JSSP. The new movement algae colonies using DE operators are introduced to the proposed hybrid artificial algae algorithm and DE (AAADE). To improve AAA’s intensification ability, the movement using the DE mutation is implemented into the AAA. In the new hybrid method, the DE crossover can update its position based on both movements (helical and DE movements) to increase randomization. Two categories of problems verify the efficiency and validity of the proposed hybrid algorithm, AAADE, namely, CEC 2014 benchmark functions and different job-shop scheduling problems. The AAADE results are compared with other algorithms in the literature. Hence, comparisons numerical experiments validated and verified the quality of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method in producing excellent solutions that are promising and competitive to the state-of-the-art heuristic-based algorithms reported in the literature in most of the benchmark functions in CEC’14 and JSSP.},

However, during manufacturing, the occurrence of small drifts in the robot arms may lead to critical failures and significant product quality damages and, therefore, high financial losses. Hence, this paper aims to develop an effective and practical methodology for online diagnostics of robot drifts based on information fusion of direct and indirect monitoring. The direct monitoring exploits the already installed encoders on each servomotor of the robot while the indirect monitoring uses heterogeneous sensors (current, vibration, force and torque) placed at the robot tool level. The sensor measurements of the robot tool are processed, in an offline phase, to build health indicators and fused to learn a classifier for drifts detection and diagnostics. Then, during the online phase and in the case of presence of new drift patterns, the encoder measurements are used to label these patterns and update the classifier learned previously to diagnose their origin. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed methodology are verified through a real industrial machining multi-axis robot that investigates different drift severities of its arms.},

The most widely used approach is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to detect quality issues in production output images. While the approach achieves high accuracy, many companies face challenges implementing it. Many manufacturers lack both the big data sets required for machine and deep learning model training and the data scientists having the domain knowledge to build and run complex models. Today manufacturers have implemented lean manufacturing and six sigma quality controls which result in small defect samples that are not sufficient for modeling. Some manufacturers also change the production outputs frequently which does not permit enough time for data collection for model building. In this paper, we propose two motif discovery based approaches that work within the constraints of modern manufacturing. The first approach is programmatic motif discovery learning patterns from small data samples. The second approach is a self-service visual motif discovery that is simple and intuitive for engineers not versed in data science. We compare the proposed approaches with a CNN and conclude that our proposed methods achieve higher accuracy, have significantly lower computational costs, and empower engineers to do it themselves.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between nanosecond laser and glass is complicated, and defects such as micro-cracks and fractures are prone to be generated during laser scribing. Acoustic emission (AE) technique is applied in this paper to monitor laser scribing of float glass. Strong consistency between AE signals and width of laser ablation area is found. With laser power increasing from 11.2 to 26.9 W, root mean square (RMS) values increase from 0.160 to 0.634 V, and width of heat affected zone (HAZ) increase from 12.396 to 53.711 $${\upmu }\text{m}$$ . Correlation between AE signals and laser scribing quality is investigated by characteristic analysis. When scanning speed is kept constant (200 mm/s) and laser power is gradually increasing from 11.2 to 24.2 W, RMS values and MARSE are increasing (0.3–1.2 V, 600–1500 correspondingly), and scribing quality is declining continuously ( $$\frac{{W}_{C}}{{W}_{G}}$$ increase from 0 to 0.343). Time-frequency spectrum analysis by CWT could be applied in defects diagnosis. Three prominent frequency bands contents (150 ~ 180 kHz, 200 ~ 250 kHz, and 280 ~ 320 kHz) were generated during laser scribing process. Higher frequency bands contents (200 ~ 250 kHz, and 280 ~ 320 kHz) are demonstrated to reflect defects by analyzing distribution characteristic of frequency contents. Intensity of higher frequency compositions is vigorous (≥ 0.5) when there are defects, while less than 0.5 with no defects.},

  abstract     = {In the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, vibration signal or spectrum is usually used. As a data-driven method, deep learning has been introduced into the field of fault diagnosis. But it often confronts with two critical difficulties: few fault cases and single data source. To this end, we employ the prototype network to solve the problem of few fault cases, and use the two-branch technique to combine data sources in time domain and frequency domain. We introduce the two-branch network structure into the framework of the prototype network and develop a two-branch prototype network (TBPN) for fault diagnosis. The TBPN model is constructed through three main steps. First, we extract information from vibration signals in time domain and frequency domain respectively, and feed them into the model as two branches. Second, the prototype representation of each fault in time domain and frequency domain can be learned through metric learners, and the distances between fault prototypes and query faults features are then calculated. Third, the distances in time domain and frequency domain are integrated and incorporated into the softmax function for multi-classification. The performance of TBNP is verified by a real-world application on fault diagnosis of rotating machinery with the case data accumulated by an industrial Internet enterprise in China. The results show that the TBPN model is suitable for fault diagnosis in the case of small data. Compared with using time domain signals or spectrum alone, their combination use can improve the effectiveness of fault diagnosis.},

EO algorithm not only has strong exploitation and exploration capabilities but also avoids falling into the local optimum. The reason why EO has these advantages is because of the existence of “generation rate”. This paper proposes an Enhanced Equilibrium Optimizer (EEO) Algorithm based on three communication strategies to solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). To prove the accuracy of the algorithm, this paper uses 28 benchmark functions for testing. At the same time, the Enhanced Equilibrium Optimizer (EEO1, EEO2, EEO3) Algorithms are compared with the existing optimization methods, including Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Multi-Version Optimizer (MVO), Differential Evolution (DE), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). Experiments show that the EO algorithm is significantly better than GWO, MVO, DE, WOA. EO algorithm is mainly used to optimize continuous problems, but JSSP is a discrete application, so the standard equilibrium optimizer algorithm needs to be discretized. This paper extends the enhanced equilibrium optimizer algorithm and adds discretization processing to JSSP. The algorithm is also applied for the job shop scheduling problem by discretization and is compared with the three improvement methods of EEO. Experimental results prove that the algorithm has made significant improvements in solving JSSP.},

However, in collaborative product design, complex multitask context information disrupts the perception of engineers’ knowledge needs for every single task.

Facing these challenges, scarcely any reports on context-aware knowledge recommendation in the multitask environment of collaborative product design. Aiming to fill this gap, a multitask context-aware DLK recommendation approach is proposed to assist collaborative product design in a smarter manner. The mutual interference of context information from different tasks is addressed by preprocessing works, multitask knowledge need awareness, DLK recommendation engine, respectively. Therefore, the proposed approach not only effectively acquires engineers’ knowledge needs from different task contexts and pertinently provides the corresponding DLK recommendation list for each task but also guarantees the accuracy of DLK recommendation in multitask context of collaborative product design. To validate the proposed approach, a DLK recommendation system is implemented in a shipbuilding scenario, and some comparative experiments are carried out. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional approaches in the aspects of effectiveness and performance. Therefore, it opens up a promising way to help engineers reuse needed DLK in collaborative product design.},

  abstract     = {Reliable industrial defect inspection is one of the main challenges in manufacturing scenarios, especially for the inspection of structural defects. However, the cost of missing a defect is much higher than the cost of misclassifying a qualified sample, which is seldom emphasized in previous work. Thus, the purpose of our work has two folds: reduce the omission rate of defective samples; classify industrial samples correctly. To that end, in this paper, we first define a position tag for each sample, where samples with the same position tag describe the same product information. We also design the multi-position weighted-resampling (MPWR) method for extracting paired data with identical tags. Then, in order to fully learn from the paired data, we propose a multiple position-based bi-branch (MPB3) neural network architecture to perform similarity measurements and multi-classifications simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and generalization capacity to data from unknown tags by comparing with other methods. For example, the proposed method achieves 2.77 $$\%$$ /1.00 $$\%$$ omission rates and 96.81 $$\%$$ /99.03 $$\%$$ weighted F-Scores on the SMT defect dataset and the motor brush holder dataset, respectively. In addition, the average running time of the method only needs 9.6 ms, which meets requirements of cycle time in manufacturing industries. In conclusion, the omission rate of defective samples can be reduced effectively by the position-based method that consists of MPWR method and MPB3 structure, which greatly improves productivity in real production lines.},

  abstract     = {The traditional calculation methods of the pitting area ratio include artificial vision inspection and rubbing measurement based on cutting tooth. However, these methods have the disadvantages of low efficiency, high cost and static measurement. The non-contact computer vision measurement technology can achieve continuous monitoring without interfering with the machine operation, and have satisfactory detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose an integrated Yolov5-Deeplabv3 + real-time segmentation network (YDRSNet) for gear pitting measurement. The two-stage network is constructed by using Yolov5 and an improve Deeplabv3 + , which can be applied to process the video samples in real time and overcome the problem of sample imbalance. Considering that the second-stage network implements a binary classification task, the dice loss is applied to replace the Cross-entropy loss for reducing the amount of calculation and solving the problem of sample imbalance effectively. Moreover, a DC-Focus module is embedded into the second-stage network for reducing the information loss caused by down sampling. Compared with the existing typical segmentation algorithms, the proposed YDRSNet has stronger segmentation ability, and it can segment the effective tooth surface and different levels of pitting quickly and accurately. The proposed methodology provides a feasible way for online measuring the pitting area ratio and detecting the degree of gear failure.},

  abstract     = {Today’s manufacturing systems are becoming increasingly complex, dynamic and connected hence continual prediction of manufactured product quality is a key to look for patterns that can eventually lead to improved accuracy and productivity. Recent developments in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning have shown great potential to transform the manufacturing domain through analytics for processing vast amounts of manufacturing data generated (Esmaeilian et al. in J Manuf Syst 39:79–100, 2016). Although prediction models have been built to predict product quality with good accuracy, they assume that same distribution applies on training data and testing data hence fail to produce satisfying results when machines work under different conditions with varying data distribution. Naïve re-collection and re-annotation of data for each new working condition can be very expensive thus is not a feasible solution. To cope with this problem, we adopt transfer learning approach called domain adaptation to transfer the knowledge learned from one labelled operating condition (source domain) to another operating condition (target domain) without labels. Particularly, we propose an end-to-end framework for cross-machine product quality prediction, which is able to alleviate domain shift problem. To facilitate the cross-machine prediction performance, a systematic feature selection approach is designed and integrated to generate most suitable feature set to characterize the collected data. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted using actual manufacturing data and the results demonstrate significant improvement on cross-machine product quality prediction as compared to conventional techniques.},

  abstract     = {Most of the reported metaheuristic methods need the control parameters except the essential population size and terminal condition. When these methods are used for solving an unknown problem, how to set the most suitable values for their control parameters to achieve the optimal solution is a great challenge. Group teaching optimization algorithm (GTOA) is a newly presented metaheuristic method, whose remarkable feature is that it only relies on the essential population size and terminal condition for optimization. However, GTOA may get trapped in the local optimal solutions for solving complex optimization problems due to the lack of communication between outstanding group and average group. In order to improve the performance of GTOA, this paper proposes a new variant of GTOA, namely group teaching optimization algorithm with information sharing (ISGTOA). Like GTOA, ISGTOA doesn’t introduce any other control parameters, which enhances the communication between outstanding group and average group by reusing the individuals in the built two archives. The performance of ISGTOA is investigated by CEC 2014 test suite, CEC 2015 test suite, and four challenging constrained engineering design problems. Experimental results prove the superiority of ISGTOA for expensive optimization problems with multimodal properties by comparing with GTOA and other powerful methods. The source codes of the proposed ISGTOA can be found in https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/98629-the-source-code-of-isgtoa and https://github.com/jsuzyy/The-source-code-of-ISGTOA-for-global-optimization .},

  abstract     = {Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are essential elements of manufacturing intralogistics and material handling. Improving the position accuracy along the AGV trajectory allows the vehicle to work on narrower aisles with lower error tolerance. Despite the increasing number of papers in AGVs and mobile robots’ position control research area, there is a lack of curatorial work presenting and analyzing the control strategies applied in the problem domain. Therefore, the main objective is to analyze the published researches of the past seven years on the position control of AGVs to recognize research patterns, gaps, and tendencies, outlining the research field. The paper proposes a systematic literature review to investigate the research field from the controller design perspective. Its protocol and procedures are presented in detail. Four main research topics were addressed: the control strategies used in the AGV position control problem, how the literature presents the AGV operating requirement of position accuracy, how the literature validate the proposed controller and present their results regarding the system’s position accuracy, and the technological tendencies the proposed solutions reveals. Besides, within the main topics, other points were investigated, such as the AGV application area, the considered mathematical model, the sensors and guidance system used, and the maximum payload of the vehicle and operation under different load conditions. The data synthesis shows the predominant control strategies applied to the problem and the interaction among distinct control theory areas, indicating a notable interaction of Intelligent Control techniques to the other strategies. The paper’s contributions are using a systematic literature review method over the AGV position control publications, presenting an overview of the research area, analyzing the research question topics from selected articles, and proposing a research agenda.},

However, this leads to high consumption of time and resources. We propose in this paper a two-level method for automatic welding defect detection and localization. The method is based on the classification of the probability density distributions of the voltage signals underlying the generated stochastic process from the welding operation. In the main phase, we apply a passband filter to the raw signals and use the Kernel Density Estimation to measure the distribution of the filtered signal. The probability density distributions are processed as functional data and classified employing a functional non-parametric kernel classifier. In the second phase, the signal of nonconforming welding is split into segments and their probability density distributions are classified in order to extract the precise location of the defect in the whole signal. The proposed method allows to detect and localize welding defects with high accuracy.},

In the first stage, a heuristic is developed for the generation of setups and the assignments of fixtures to each set of operations. While in the second stage, a genetic algorithm is proposed to determine the best process plan to associate with the generated setup plan, under the economic cost consideration.

Especially, neural network (NN) strategies have focused on finding complex and nonlinear relationships between the sensor signal and the machine status to detect machine faults. However, it is difficult to collect enough amount of fault data as much as normal status data for training general NN models. To resolve the issue, this paper proposes the autoencoder-based anomaly detection framework for industrial robot arms using an internal sound sensor. The autoencoder uses signals in the normal state of the robots for training the model. It reconstructs the input signals as output, and anomalous states are found from high reconstruction error. Two stethoscopes were attached to the surface of the robot joint as sensors, and the sounds were recorded by USB microphone attached to the outlet of the stethoscopes. Features were extracted from STFT spectrogram images of the gathered sound, then used to train and test an autoencoder model. The reconstruction errors of the autoencoder were compared to distinguish the abnormal status from normal one. The experimental results suggest that the stethoscopes prevent the interference of noise, and the collected sound signals can be utilized for detecting machine anomalies.},

The network adopts a derivative Resnet-101d as the backbone to obtain a loss-reduced feature extraction. Meanwhile, an enhanced feature pyramid module is put forward to enhance the feature representation of the network by adding a dense connection of feature layers through the self-attentive block. Moreover, the defect region proposals are optimized by introducing a cascade module to obtain high-quality defective proposal boxes. Experimental results on the augmented data set of relays’ surface defect reveal an average accuracy of 88.57% and an average recall rate of 94.58%, much higher than those of traditional RCNN or FPN detectors, demonstrating the remarkable improvement of the proposed network. Robustness of the method is also verified by performing tests with deteriorative image processing, which indicates an eligible defect detection under relatively complex scenarios such as image blurring.

RFID gates are often deployed, to automatically detect tagged items or load carriers during their passage through the goods receipt gate. At present, however, the design of RFID gates is often based on estimations, and their commissioning is mostly approached via trial and error. Even if the RFID network planning problem is known in the literature, existing algorithms cannot be applied to the design of RFID gates due to some limitations. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary RFID network planning algorithm to design RFID gates optimally. The objective of our algorithm is to minimise the number of antennas and to adjust their mounting heights and angles. The algorithm ensures a tag coverage of at least 99%, prevents reflections on the ground, and can be used in the future as a standard for planning and commissioning RFID-enabled goods receipt gates. To demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm, we deployed it in a case study involving logistics of the automotive sector. The results of the deployment confirm the quality of our approach, as the RFID gate optimised by the algorithm deployed 4 antennas, with a vertical coverage rate of 99.96%, an horizontal coverage rate of 89.66%, and very interesting values of other evaluation functions, namely load balance and overlapping rate.},

  abstract     = {Within maintenance management activities, engineers need to select maintenance strategies so to carry out the technical maintenance actions. A single equipment is composed of several components with different failure modes. There should be a maintenance strategy for each of them; while some of the components can be run-to-failure applying corrective maintenance, some others cannot afford a failure, and preventive or predictive strategies should be implemented. Selecting and assessing maintenance strategies is a complex task for which information from many sources should be retrieved. Information from a Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis, a cost–benefit-risk analysis, Computational Maintenance Management Systems, is often used by engineers to select and assess maintenance strategies. A selected strategy is often not evaluated over time to check its effectiveness. The strategy may need adjustments or substituted by a more efficient one, for example, a condition-based strategy substituting a time-based one. To facilitate maintenance strategies selection and assessment, the current study proposes an Ontology model for Maintenance Strategy Selection and Assessment (OMSSA). OMSSA serves as a formal terminology framework in maintenance strategies that can be used to develop smart computational agents that can help in the decision-making process for selecting and assessing maintenance strategies. To facilitate its future reuse and integration with other ontologies in the industrial domain, OMSSA builds following the state-of-the-art in ontology development by using a top-level domain-neutral ontology, the Basic Formal Ontology.},

  abstract     = {Process recommendation is an essential technique to help process modeler effectively and efficiently model a manufacturing process from scratch. However, the current process recommendation methods suffer from the following problems: (1) To extract all the execution paths from a manufacturing process, the behavior-based methods may occur a state space explosion problem when unfolding a process with multiple parallel patterns, resulting in low efficiency. (2) Current structure-based methods are inefficient since too many expensive computations of the graph edit distance are involved. (3) Most of the existing methods manually design their process similarity metrics with several features, which can only be applied in specific situations. (4) Few works provide visualization tools for process modeling assistance. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a context-aware recommendation system for improving manufacturing process modeling. First, the independent paths and P,Q-grams are efficiently extracted from the manufacturing processes in the repository to represent their typical behavior and structure. Then, the process recommendation problem is transformed into the word prediction problem in natural language processing, where the serialization of an independent path/P,Q-gram and a node in it are separately regarded as a sentence and a word. The Word2vec model is introduced to automatically learn the relationships among nodes from independent paths and P,Q-grams and generate the vectors with hundreds of context-aware features for nodes in the repository. After that, the top-k similar nodes are recommended for the target node in the process fragment under construction based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Finally, a visualization tool is provided for process modelers to efficiently design a new manufacturing process. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method can perform similar or even better than the baseline methods in terms of recommending quality.},

  abstract     = {The surface/subsurface-initiated pitting is one of the most common failure modes in a gear. Although models for predicting the initiation of pitting are available, a model for predicting the growth of an existing pitting is not yet available. The present work proposes a hybrid prognosis approach for estimating the growth of pitting on the gear tooth surface, utilizing both empirical model (i.e., modified Paris law) and measured pitting area. The proposed approach is generic as the pitting growth rate is modelled as a function of gear material properties (such as Poisson’s ratio and modulus of elasticity), oil property (such as dynamic viscosity), gear geometrical parameters (such as pitch circle diameter, module, pressure angle and face width) and operating conditions (such as applied load and speed). The pitting evolution process is likely to be different for similar gear pairs due to inherent variations in material properties, manufacturing process, etc. Hence for a more accurate life prediction, the pit growth model parameters need to be updated, which is done using Bayesian inference.},

  abstract     = {Fabrication areas in semiconductor industry are considered one of the most complex production systems. This complexity is caused by the high-mix of products and end-user market-based demands in that industry. Its dynamic and challenging processing requirements affect the handling capabilities of traditional production management paradigms. In this paper, we propose an application for dispatching and resources allocation through reinforcement learning. The application is based on a discrete-event simulation model for a case study of a real semiconductor manufacturing system. The model is built using both data-driven and agent-based approaches. The model simulates the various processing aspects that are present normally in these complex systems. The model’s agents are responsible for dispatching tasks and allocation of the different system’s resources. They employ Deep-Q-Network reinforcement learning. They learn simultaneously through the model execution. An independent Deep-Q-Network is trained for each agent. The model provides the training environment for the agents in which their decisions are applied and assessed for their adequacy. Our formulation of the environment’s state and the reward function for the learning algorithms creates cooperative decision-making policies for the agents. This results in improving the global performance of the whole system, and the performance of each agent’s resources. Our approach is compared to heuristics-based strategies that are applied in our case study. It achieved better production performance than the currently applied strategy.},

  abstract     = {The recognition of different welding defects is important for the assessment of the safety of welded structures. This study proposes a method to recognize defects in stainless steel welds based on multi-domain feature expression and self-optimization. This is because of the poor detection of feature-related information from signals, inadequate feature extraction by the convolutional network, the limited capability of intelligent techniques, network redundancy, and a lack of self-adaptive capability in prevalent methods, A 1D ultrasonic detection dataset of austenitic stainless steel welds in the time domain (TD) is first constructed and the 1D TD signals are rendered in the time–frequency domain, Gramain angular field, and the Markov transition field. The aim is to enrich the feature expression of 1D ultrasonic echo data of the weld defects. A comparison among a variety of lightweight convolutional neural networks on multi-spatial domain datasets is used to identify a combination of network and spatial domain datasets that are suitable for recognizing welding defects. Finally, a multi-scale depthwise separable convolution is designed, and is subjected to adaptive compression and parameter-adaptive optimization based on the sparrow search algorithm to construct the self-optimizing lightweight multi-scale MobileNetV3 (SLM-MobileNetV3) model. The results of experiments showed that the SLM-MobileNetV3 model has an accuracy of 97.26% for the recognition of five types of defects: inclusion, crack, porosity, incomplete penetration, and a lack of fusion. The time required for testing a single image was 2 ms. Experimental analysis showed that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of defect recognition while using few parameters and computational cost, and is generalizable.},

In this paper, an innovative deep learning-based monitoring system capable of diagnosing the penetration state in real time is introduced in detail. The built monitoring platform can capture the interaction zone images during the laser welding through a high-speed camera. An adaptive fusion method of adjacent monitoring images is proposed to eliminate the interference of metal vapor plume in the image and highlight the keyhole and molten pool. A deep learning model based on convolutional neural network is established to model the relationship between the interaction zone fusion images and the corresponding penetration states. The constructed training set and validation set can improve the robustness and generalization ability of the built model. The verification results on unfused original images show that the average classification accuracy can reach 98.37%, with a latency about 2.9 ms. Finally, a results-evaluation strategy is proposed to eliminate misclassified results to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The evaluation results of the entire verification weld seam indicate that the proposed monitoring system can meet the requirements of real-time monitoring with high accuracy and short latency.

A total of 840 single tracks were fabricated with several combinations of laser power and scanning speed levels. Surface morphologies of the single tracks and bead profiles were thoroughly investigated, providing a track-type map and the evolutions of the bead characteristics as a function of laser power and scanning speed. The results indicate neither severe balling nor keyholing effect for all combinations of laser power and scanning speed. Besides, simple relationships cannot accurately describe the evolutions of the D/W and H/W ratios as a function of laser power and scanning speed. Two Machine Learning-based regression models, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network, were chosen to estimate the D/W and H/W ratios using laser power and scanning speed. The Bayesian optimization algorithm was employed to optimize the model hyperparameter selection. Both Machine Learning-based models appear to be able to predict reasonably well the two aspect ratios, D/W and H/W, with an overall R2 value reaching about 90%, evaluated on the cross-validation dataset after a few seconds of training time, respectively.},

The fused model uses neighborhood rough sets and XGBoost to refine knowledge and constructs implicit relationships. Common logic rules and knowledge are replaced with the model. The model was validated and analyzed based on standardized high-speed train bogie framing engineering data, and the scores obtained were 0.89 for accuracy, 0.92 for Precision, 0.89 for Recall, and 0.89 for F1-score. Based on ensuring the metrics of the model, the interpretable analysis method expresses the implicit knowledge in the decision-making system. The tree model is used to explain the decision process, and the relationships of the attributes involved in the decision can be obtained via SHAP analysis. Moreover, it shows a high degree of consistency between interpretable results and actual engineering knowledge.

  abstract     = {Due to the increasingly competitive nature of the global market, the capability of controlling delivery time is becoming a significant advantage for enterprises. A novel fourth-party logistics (4PL) network design problem with the objective of minimizing the overall cost under service time constraint and stochastic demand is proposed in the paper. To address this problem, a two-stage nonlinear stochastic programming model is proposed. The topological structure of the 4PL network is decided in the first stage, while the network flows are determined in the second stage. By using auxiliary variables to linearize the service time constraint and by adopting the sample average approximation (SAA) method to handle the stochastic demand, the two-stage nonlinear stochastic programming model is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. To overcome the difficulties of solving the MILP model caused by a large number of demand scenarios and integer-valued decision variables, a variable separation (VS) strategy is presented to improve the dual decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation (DDLR) approach to propose a VSDDLR-SAA algorithm. Results of the numerical examples and a real-life case illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and VSDDLR-SAA algorithm. Comparison analysis of the 4PL network and the supply chain network shows that 4PL can deliver products within the prescribed time at a lower cost by cooperating with third-party logistics providers.},

  abstract     = {During the injection molding process, the cooling process represents the largest portion of the cycle time. The effectiveness of the cooling system significantly affects the production efficiency and part quality, where it is limited by the conventional cooling channels manufactured by the drilling and casting process. Although the maturing advanced additive manufacturing (AM) technology allows the design and fabrication of complex conformal cooling channels, the temperature variance caused by non-uniform thickness distribution of the part remains unsolved. This issue is caused by the fact that the existing conformal cooling designs do not create the channels conformal to the part thickness distributions. In this work, a machine learning aided design method is proposed to generate cooling systems which conform not only to the part surface but also to the part thickness values. Three commonly used conformal cooling channel topologies including spiral, zig-zag, and porous are selected. A surrogate model is derived for each cooling channel topology to approximate the relationship between the design parameters of the cooling channels, part thickness, and the resulting part surface temperature. Based on the surrogate model, the design parameters of each type of cooling channels are optimized to minimize the part surface temperature variation. At the end of the paper, design cases are studied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Based on the proposed method, much lower temperature variance and a smaller coolant pressure drop are achieved compared with the conventional conformal cooling design.},

Third, combining multimedia and interactive instruction, the IM training course clusters are reformed by covering overall cognition, module practice, and comprehensive application. In particular, a typical IM production line is depicted to increase students’ interests in participation, which can simultaneously develop disciplinary knowledge and practical skills.

  abstract     = {Detection and avoidance of regenerative chatter play a crucial role in ensuring the high quality and efficiency of machining operations. Predominant analytical approaches provide stability lobe diagrams for machining processes. Deep learning is a general term given to the most recent and successful group of machine learning methods that proved great promise in many areas of human life. This study purposes a novel transfer learning framework that combines analytical solutions and convolution neural network (CNN) under a novel transfer learning framework. Stability lobes and numerical time-domain solutions of analytical methods are used to train and label, arguably one of the most successful CNN architectures, AlexNet. This approach eliminates the need for a time-consuming and costly experimental data collection phase for training. Furthermore, an ensemble empirical mode decomposition based signal pre-processing method is developed. An IMF-based multi-band ensemble approach is proposed where only intrinsic mode functions relevant to each modal frequency of the system are selected based on their entropy increase and used in training multiple AlexNet instances. The measured data were collected during shoulder milling from a CNC-vertical milling machine. The results revealed considerable success in several scenarios ranging from 82 to 100%, without using any experimentally measured data in training.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a Bayesian methodology for layer-by-layer predictive quality control of an additively manufactured part by integrating physics-based simulation with online monitoring data. The model and the sensor data are first used to infer porosity in the printed layers, prediction of porosity in future layers, and adjustment of process parameters. Since porosity is not directly observable during the printing process, the temperature profile obtained from the monitoring (using an infra-red thermal camera) is used to infer porosity in the finished part. The porosity inference model is constructed by first reducing the dimension of the thermal images by employing singular value decomposition. Next, in process control, the porosity in the final part is predicted, and if this predicted porosity is more than a desired threshold, the process parameters for printing the next layer are adjusted based on optimization. To ensure that the prediction model is both fast and accurate, the expensive finite element model is replaced by a surrogate model, and a discrepancy term calibrated using experimental data is used to correct the surrogate model prediction. The prediction model is also updated at every layer based on the monitoring data, and the updated model is used to predict the porosity in the final part. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for controlling porosity in laser powder bed fusion by changing the process parameters such as laser power and laser speed.},

  abstract     = {Failure recovery is an essential discussion in communication to guarantee the network&#39;s undisturbed and reliable service. Failed links have been affecting the communication network performance for various real-time applications for many years. Thus, it is necessary to address the issue, as it affects both users and service provider’s, leading to catastrophic collapse and cascading or interdependent failures. Therefore, designing a survivable network is the primary concern. Estimating and predicting network performance in advance for network survivability and traffic reachability is advantageous for network engineers. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the network performance by failing and recovering network links for multiple time durations. The 6to4 tunneling network has been configured where two isolated IPv6 networks are connected through the tunnel&#39;s to the IPv4 backbone network, and we have failed the links that are connecting these networks. The 6to4 automatic and manual tunneling networks are defined separately. The network is simulated using Routing Information Protocol/Routing Information Protocol Next Generation and Open Shortest Path First/Open Shortest Path First version 3 for real-time voice and video streaming applications. The network&#39;s performance is calculated for links over each routing protocol and tunneling technique in these cases. Therefore, this analysis allows us the pre-computation of performance for failing the main link connecting the IPv6 networks to the IPv4 backbone network or vice-versa. The performance parameters studied and evaluated in this paper are network convergence, traffic dropped, throughput, queuing delay, and router performance. The different route table characteristics for Router A, Router C, and IPv4 backbone are also analyzed as links between them are failed and recovered multiple times. This novel analysis and discussion bring out a practical, realistic analysis of recovery and system vulnerability.},

In this sense, this study aims to analyze women entrepreneurs’ expectations and reality regarding trust factors in a female business network. Besides, this study analyzes the effects of different characteristics related to female entrepreneurship (e.g., the formality of the company, experience of the women entrepreneur, motivation to start a new venture, and motherhood) on trust factors. To this end, a quantitative study was carried out with 34 women entrepreneurs who participate in a female business network, located in Southern Brazil. The model for evaluation of trust proposed by Campos et al. (J Intell Manuf, 1–16, 2017) was applied and the Mann–Whitney and the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were employed in data analysis. One of the main results has implications for women entrepreneurship and the participation in business networks, as it shows that women entrepreneurs have higher expectations in comparison to the perceived reality concerning trust within the business network. The main results suggest that female business network initiatives may constitute an inclusive policy of women entrepreneurship because it does not distinguish between women with or without children, formal and informal companies, and the motivation to start a new venture(necessity or opportunity).},

  abstract     = {Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is commonly used to translate customer requirements into design specifications in the product conceptual design phase. House of Quality (HOQ) is an essential part of QFD to map different requirements of product solutions using a design relationship matrix. In traditional approaches, the way of deciding weights in the relationship matrix can lead to a distortion in ranking of technical measures. Although some methods like Analytic Hierarchy Process have been proposed to improve this problem, they require additional data collection and process. This paper introduces two effective approaches based on Best–Worst Method and Full Consistency Method (FUCOM) to decide weights of technical measures in the relationship matrix of HOQ. The novel integrated approach of FUCOM-QFD is developed for rapid weight allocation in the relationship matrix. The proposed BWM-QFD and FUCOM-QFD approaches use consistency ratio and total deviation measures in reliable decision-making. They not only reduce data collection, but also improve inconsistency problems. The vector-based pairwise comparison and consistency measure are two important features of the proposed approaches. A case study demonstrates improvement in the efficiency and accuracy of weighing solutions for technical measures compared to the existing methods.},

The maximum angle selection method based on vector angle is used to enhance the diversity of the population. The maximum angle rule selects the solution as reference vector can work well on complicated Pareto front. A penalty-based adaptive vector distribution selection criterion is adopted to balance convergence and diversity of the solutions. As the evolution process progresses, the new normalization method dynamically adjusts the implementation of the normalization. The experimental results show that new algorithm obtains 30 best results out of 80 test problems compared with other five many-objective evolutionary algorithms.

  abstract     = {An accurate prediction of the machining tool condition during the cutting process is crucial for enhancing the tool life, improving the production quality and productivity, optimizing the labor and maintenance costs, and reducing workplace accidents. Currently, tool condition monitoring is usually based on machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms, to establish the relationship between sensor signals and tool wear. However, deep mining of feature and fusion information of multi-sensor signals, which are strongly related to the tool wear, is a critical challenge. To address this issue, in this study, an integrated prediction scheme is proposed based on deep learning algorithms. The scheme first extracts the local features of a single sequence and a multi-dimensional sequence from DenseNet incorporating a heterogeneous asymmetric convolution kernel. To obtain more perceptual historical data, a “dilation” scheme is used to extract features from a single sequence, and one-dimensional dilated convolution kernels with different dilation rates are utilized to obtain the differential features. At the same time, asymmetric one-dimensional and two-dimensional convolution kernels are employed to extract the features of the multi-dimensional signal. Ultimately, all the features are fused. Then, the time-series features hidden in the sequence are extracted by establishing a depth-gated recurrent unit. Finally, the extracted in-depth features are fed to the deep fully connected layer to achieve the mapping between features and tool wear values through linear regression. The results indicate that the average errors of the proposed model are less than 8%, and this model outperforms the other tool wear prediction models in terms of both accuracy and generalization.},

  abstract     = {The automatic recognition of labels marked on steel slab surfaces is of significance to information management and intelligent manufacturing in steel plants. However, it is not an easy task due to complex factors like low printing quality, motion distortion and thermal blurring, especially while handling the prone-to-deform dot-matrix labels generated by a hot spray marking (HSM) technique. In this paper, a machine vision system is presented for the HSM dot-matrix label recognition. With a brief description of the imaging system, our emphasis is put on image analysis. First, a coarse-to-fine strategy is applied to locate HSM characters from captured images, where a weighted gravity-center estimation method is extended to search the enclosure of label regions, and an edge projection scheme is adopted to refine the label extraction. Subsequently, a Multidirectional Line Scanning (MLS) method is proposed to determine the boundaries between adjacent dot-matrix characters with tilt, adhesion or dot-missing abnormalities. Finally, by converting the dot-matrix character into a 2D point set, we introduce a Point Cloud registration for DOt-matrix Character (PC4DOC) method to recognize prone-to-deform characters, which appears to accommodate various distortions and abnormalities owing to the inherent deformation correction of affine transformation and fault tolerance of robust correspondence matching. According to our experiments, the proposed method can achieve real-time recognition with an accuracy of 93.84% in spite of severely degraded images and incomplete characters. The system has been installed and run in a steel mill for more than one year, and its stability was also verified.},

  abstract     = {Selective laser melting is the most commonly used additive manufacturing technique for fabricating metal components. However, the SLMed part quality still largely suffered from the porosity defects that can significantly affect the mechanical properties. Recently, in situ monitoring based on machine learning has been recognized as an effective method to overcome this challenge. In this work, a deep learning method is developed for in situ part quality inspection. The layer-wise visual images are used as the inputs without manual feature extraction and a deep transfer learning (DTL) model combining deep convolutional neural network and transfer learning is creatively applied. First, an off-axial in situ monitoring system by a high-resolution digital camera is developed to capture the images of each deposited layer. Then, samples with different part quality levels are produced by varying process parameters. Thereafter, based on the porosity measurement results obtained by optical microscopy, each captured visual image is labeled. An image dataset associated with a label of three categories of poor, medium, and high quality is created. Finally, the proposed DTL is employed to perform the classification tasks, aiming to identify the part quality based on the layer-wise visual images. Results show that a 99.89% classification accuracy of the developed DTL was obtained, revealing the feasibility and effectiveness of using layer-wise visual images without manual feature extraction to realize quality inspection. Overall, the proposed DTL method provides a promising solution to monitor part quality and reduce porosity defects during the printing process.},

  abstract     = {The analytical evaluation of production system performance measures is a difficult task. Over the years, various methods have been developed to solve specific cases of very short production lines. However, formulae for estimating the mean production rate (throughput) are lacking. Recent developments in artificial intelligence simplify their use in the solution of symbolic regression problems. In this work, we use genetic programming (GP) to obtain approximate formulae for calculating the throughput of short reliable approximately balanced production lines, for which the processing times are exponentially distributed. A hybrid GP&amp;GA scheme reduces the search space, in which GP uses genetic algorithms (GA) as a search engine. The scheme produces polynomial formulae for throughput estimation for the first time. To train the GP algorithm we use MARKOV, an accurate algorithm for calculating numerically the exact throughput of short exponential production lines. A few formulae, not previously reported in the literature, are presented. These formulae give close results to the exact results from the MARKOV algorithm, for short (up to five stations) reliable approximately balanced production lines without intermediate buffers. Also, the robustness of these formulae is satisfactory. In addition, the proposed hybrid GP&amp;GA scheme is useful for design/production engineers to adjust the formulae to other ranges of the mean processing rates; the algorithms are quickly retrained to generate a new approximate formula.},

Deep learning is a new technology that can automatically learn complex mapping relationships and high-level data features from a large amount of data. Therefore, this classification technology has been successfully and widely used in various fields. This study examined a three-dimensional convolutional neural network combined with a graph-based approach, taking advantage of deep learning technology and traditional feature recognition methods. First, the convex and concave machining features of a part were determined using an attributed adjacency graph. Then, the machining features were separated using the bounding box method and voxelized. Subsequently, a stretching and zooming method was proposed to obtain the training data. After training, the test and comparison results demonstrated the high accuracy rate of the proposed method and the improvement in recognition efficiency.

  abstract     = {Due to their advantages, there is an increase of applying robotic systems for small batch production as well as for complex manufacturing processes. However, programming and configuring robots is time and resource consuming while being also accompanied by high costs that are especially challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The current way of programming industrial robots by using teach-in control devices and/or using vendor-specific programming languages is in general a complex activity that requires extensive knowledge in the robotics domain. It is therefore important to offer new practical methods for the programming of industrial robots that provide flexibility and versatility in order to achieve feasible robotics solutions for small lot size productions. This paper focuses on the development of a knowledge-driven framework, which should overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art robotics solutions and enhance the agility and autonomy of industrial robotics systems using ontologies as a knowledge-source. The framework includes reasoning and perception abilities as well as the ability to generate plans, select appropriate actions, and finally execute these actions. In this context, a challenge is the fusion of vision system information with the decision-making component, which can use this information for generating the assembly tasks and executable programs. The introduced product model in the form of an ontology enables that the framework can semantically link perception data to product models to consequently derive handling operations and required tools. Besides, the framework enables an easier adaption of robot-based production systems for individualized production, which requires swift configuration and efficient planning. The presented approach is demonstrated in a laboratory environment with an industrial pilot test case. Our application shows the potential to reduce the efforts needed to program robots in an automated production environment. In this context, the benefits as well as shortcomings of the approach are also discussed in the paper.},

The authors are researching 3D printable sensors to measure operating conditions like wear, strain and temperature, as part of a project to develop a large-scale multi-material extrusion 3D printer to print a Gravity Separation Spiral—a piece of mining equipment that separates minerals from slurry. This paper proposes a sensor placement methodology for placing embedded sensors in large 3D printed objects. Voxels, the 3D equivalent of 2D pixels, are used to discretise the object and an optimisation routine optimally positions the 3D printable sensors into a 3D printed object. The optimisation objectives that are used during sensor placement include the information gain from the sensor, the ability to print the sensor using a robot, and the ability to discourage sensors being placed in important structural locations by penalising these voxels. Finite element analysis is employed to measure the information gain, while the robot arm’s manipulability measures the capability to print at each voxel location. The objectives are integrated using 3D kernels, which are represented by voxels shaped in the size of the sensor and different weights related to the intricate traces that need to be printed. Using a weighted objective function the best locations are chosen. A simulation environment has been developed to simulate the printing and Matlab is used to do the voxel-based calculations to identify the ideal location for sensor placement.},

The proposed variational autoencoder regression model is shown capable of predicting the quality measurement values, with a mean square error of $$5.2573\times {10}^{-4}$$ mm.

Moreover, the resulting 2D latent space is capable of distributing and structuring data based on the quality level and of providing a quick visual support. Compared to the t-SNE method, this latent space displays a better structure. Furthermore, the proposed Euclidean distance metric is correlated to the quality level in both the predicted and observed subsets.

The memory of thermal error is theoretically and numerically revealed by error mechanism analysis, and then the applicability of long-short-term memory (LSTM) neural network (NN) in the training of the self-learning error model is proved. To improve the predictive accuracy, the Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to optimize such hyper-parameters as the epoch size, batch size, and the number of hidden nodes of the LSTM NN model. Then the self-learning prediction model of thermal error is proposed based on Bayesian-LSTM NN. The fitting and prediction performance of the proposed Bayesian-LSTM NN is better than that of such models as the LSTM NN with random hyperparameters, back propagation NN, multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM). Finally, the self learning-empowered error control method is proposed based on digital twin, and the Bayesian-LSTM NN error control model is embedded into the self learning-empowered error control framework to realize the real-time thermal error prediction and control. When the predicted thermal error is greater than the preset machining error, the control components are recalculated automatically, and inserted into the machining instructions. It is shown that the machining error can be reduced effectively by the self learning-empowered error control method, which is vital for precision machining of complex parts and improvement of the intelligence level.},

Digital cameras and optical scanners are among these advanced measurement systems that are used for automated surface inspection. They can represent an entire product’s surface with high-density (HD) data in the forms of digital images and point clouds, respectively. Although both measurement systems provide HD data, their datasets are fundamental different and contain different information regarding a part’s surface. Extensive research efforts have been conducted to develop QC tools for each of these datasets individually; however, little research has focused on taking advantage of both point clouds and digital images simultaneously. To fully take advantage of information from both datasets, and more importantly their spatial cross correlation, this paper aims to use fused image/point cloud datasets to advance the capability of QC systems. A key challenge in incorporating both datasets is that the costs of acquiring data from these measurement systems differ drastically, making online monitoring using fused datasets less appealing. To overcome this challenge, a novel off-line/on-line hybrid monitoring scheme is proposed. The effectiveness of this proposed hybrid monitoring scheme is demonstrated with an additive manufacturing case study.},

  abstract     = {The evaporation process is a common step in herbal medicine manufacturing and often lasts for a long time. The degradation of evaporation performance is inevitable, leading to more consumption of steam and electricity, and it may also have an impact on the content of thermosensitive components. Recently, a vast amount of evaporation process data is collected with the aid of industrial information systems, and process knowledge is hidden behind the data. But currently, these data are seldom deeply analyzed. In this work, an exploratory data analysis workflow is proposed to evaluate the evaporation performance and to identify the root causes of the performance degradation. The workflow consists of 6 steps: data collecting, preprocessing, characteristic stage identification, feature extraction, model development and interpretation, and decision making. In the model development and interpretation step, the workflow employs the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm for data annotation and then uses the ccPCA method to compare the differences between clusters for root cause analysis. A full-scale case is presented to verify the effectiveness of the workflow. The evaporation process data of 192 batches in 2018 were collected in the case. Through the steps of the workflow, the features of each batch were extracted, and the batches were clustered into 6 groups. The root causes of the performance degradation were determined as the high Pv,II and high LI by ccPCA. Recommended suggestions for future manufacturing were given according to the results. The proposed workflow can determine the root causes of the evaporation performance degradation.},

  abstract     = {Real-time Action Recognition (ActRgn) of assembly workers can timely assist manufacturers in correcting human mistakes and improving task performance. Yet, recognizing worker actions in assembly reliably is challenging because such actions are complex and fine-grained, and workers are heterogeneous. This paper proposes to create an individualized system of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for action recognition using human skeletal data. The system comprises six 1-channel CNN classifiers that each is built with one unique posture-related feature vector extracted from the time series skeletal data. Then, the six classifiers are adapted to any new worker through transfer learning and iterative boosting. After that, an individualized fusion method named Weighted Average of Selected Classifiers (WASC) integrates the adapted classifiers as an ActRgn system that outperforms its constituent classifiers. An algorithm of stream data analysis further differentiates the actions for assembly from the background and corrects misclassifications based on the temporal relationship of the actions in assembly. Compared to the CNN classifier directly built with the skeletal data, the proposed system improves the accuracy of action recognition by 28%, reaching 94% accuracy on the tested group of new workers. The study also builds a foundation for immediate extensions for adapting the ActRgn system to current workers performing new tasks and, then, to new workers performing new tasks.},

  abstract     = {The variant design node configuration is an effective method to solve a trade-off that exist in mass customization production between the requirements of product diversification and the product’s cost and delivery time. However, configuration changes in a product development network may generate an avalanche effect of design change propagation, which can consume substantial design resources. In order to control design change propagations, an evaluation method based on network nodes importance for variant design node schemes is proposed for a product development network. Firstly, the evaluation indexes, including the betweenness, variant deign node set importance, and network clustering coefficient, are integrated to describe the network characteristics of the set of variant design nodes. Then, combining the time and resource constraints for the variant design, a discrete particle swarm algorithm is employed to optimize the configuration of the nodes. The configuration solution for the variant design nodes satisfies the need to control the variant design propagation. Compared with the established greedy algorithm, the discrete particle swarm optimization can achieve better optimization performance in terms of the algorithm’s convergence and computation time. It is meaningful to understand the mechanism of product configuration change propagation in depth in order to choose the variant design nodes rationally and efficiently in complex product development networks. Lastly, an example of variant design for a type of cleaning robot product verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Inspired by the idea of transfer learning, a novel intelligent approach based on dynamic domain adaptation (DDA) is proposed for the machinery RUL prediction of multiple working conditions in this paper. At first, reverse validation technology is utilized to select appropriate source samples to construct the training dataset. Then two dynamic domain adaptation networks are trained to extract domain invariant degradation feature and predict RUL, namely dynamic distribution adaptation network and dynamic adversarial adaptation network. In the dynamic domain adaptation network, the fuzzy set theory is employed to calculate conditional distribution discrepancy loss, and the dynamic adaptive factor is introduced to dynamically adjust the distribution weights. Finally, the proposed method is proved to be effective through two run-to-failure bearing datasets. Related experimental results indicate that, compared with other related RUL prediction methods, the DDA-based prognostic method not only achieves better prediction performance, but also avoids the influence of negative transfer and distribution weight fluctuation.},

  abstract     = {Selective disassembly is a systematic method to remove target components or high-valuable components from an EOL product for reuse, recycling and remanufacturing as quick and feasible as possible, which plays a key role for the effective application of circular economy. However, in practice, the process of selective disassembly is usually characterized by various unpredictable factors of EOL products. It is very difficult to identify a feasible disassembly sequence for getting the target components before taking actions due to the uncertainty. In this paper, a data-driven method of selective disassembly planning for EOL products under uncertainty is proposed, in which disassemblability is regarded as the degree of difficulty in removing components under uncertainty. Taxonomy of uncertainty metrics that represents uncertain characteristics of components and disassembly transitions of selective disassembly is established. Random and fuzzy assessment data of uncertainty is converted into qualitative values and aggregated to fit a prediction model based on the trapezium cloud model. The turning time of disassemblability is predicted for a given set of certainty degree. Further, the disassemblability values are applied to determine the best selective disassembly sequence in order to get target component with tradeoff between minimum number of disassembly operations and maximum feasibility. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by a numerical example. Moreover, by comparing to selective disassembly planning without considering uncertainty, the proposed method turns selective disassembly of EOL products more realistic than 11% and provide insights on how to design product to facilitate disassembly operations.},

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is becoming data-intensive. The ability to identify Data Analytics (DA) opportunities for effective use of AM data becomes a critical factor in the success of AM. To successfully identify high-potential DA opportunities in AM requires a set of distinctive interdisciplinary knowledge. This paper proposes a methodology that enables collaborative knowledge management for identifying and prioritizing DA opportunities in AM. The framework of the proposed methodology has three components: a team of experts, a DA Opportunity Knowledge Base (DOKB), and a prioritization tool. The team of experts provides diverse knowledge that can be used to identify and prioritize DA opportunities. The DOKB, developed by using the Web Ontology Language (OWL), captures diverse knowledge from the experts to identify DA opportunities. The prioritization tool ranks the identified DA opportunities by using the Fuzzy integrated Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (Fuzzy-TOPSIS). A case study, in which National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) researchers participated, demonstrates our methodology. As a result, 264 DA opportunities for AM’s Laser-Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process are identified and prioritized. The prioritized DA opportunities help set a DA direction for L-PBF AM. Our methodology keeps knowledge sharable, reusable, revisable, and extendable. Thus, this methodology can continue to facilitate collaboration within the AM community to identify high potential and high impact DA opportunities in AM.},

Process drift refers to the shift in sensor measurements over time due to tool aging, and it leads to defective production when it is severe. Tool maintenance is conducted regularly to prevent defects. However, when it is performed improperly, tool aging accelerates, and the drift increases. In this paper, we propose an FD model robust to process drift by modeling process drift with a variational autoencoder (VAE). Because process drift is characterized by time-varying information, the proposed model encodes some time-varying information through separate hidden layers. By adopting a strategy that combines information separately encoded in a feature vector, the proposed model successfully models process drift. With actual chemical vapor deposition process data, we were able to generate many virtual datasets that incorporate process drift with various drift characteristics, such as patterns, degrees, and speeds. The proposed model outperformed four comparison FD methods on these datasets.},

  abstract     = {Surface classification is an effective way to assess the surface quality of parts. During the last decade, the assessment of parts quality has gradually changed from simple geometries to complex three-dimensional (3D) surfaces. Traditional quality assessment methods rely on identifying key product characteristics of parts, e.g., the profile of surface. However, for point cloud data obtained by high-definition metrology, traditional methods cannot make full use of the data and lose a lot of information. This paper proposes a systematic approach for classifying the quality of 3D surfaces based on point cloud data. Firstly, point clouds of different samples are registered to the same coordinate system by point cloud registration. Secondly, the point cloud is divided into several sub-regions by fuzzy clustering. Finally, a novel parallel classification network method based on deep learning is proposed to directly process point cloud data and classify 3D surfaces. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulation and an actual case study of the combustion chamber surfaces of the engine cylinder heads. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the classification accuracy of 3D surfaces based on point cloud data.},

Uncertainties are assumed to occur due to uncontrollable events. A particular class of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) with partial precedence constraints is proposed where some operations are performed with total precedence constraints and others with full routing flexibility (namely partial routing FMSs). Interruptions may occur due to unavailability of resources and interruption of operations. Such interruptions may deviate the trajectory from the planed schedule. For the modeling of the partial routing FMS, a systematic multi-level formalism based on the hierarchical structuration of the operations is introduced. Then, the risk of deviation is integrated and a new cost function is defined accordingly. Finally, a modified beam search algorithm referred to as generation double filtered beam search algorithm that accelerates the convergence of the method is proposed. The new algorithm is based on a new filtering mechanism that uses the cost function to selectively explore the state space of Petri net model in order to find a control sequence from an initial state to a reference one with a trade-off between performance and robustness. Examples are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed scheduling approach.},

It is proved that the impact of the events can be measured with system loss which is the summation of the production loss of the slowest machine and the overall number of defective parts produced in the subsystem where the slowest machine locates in. The data-driven method is integrated into an optimization method to exploit the optimal quality inspection allocations. In the method, a non-linear optimization problem is formulated and solved with an adaptive genetic algorithm to trade off the penalty cost of production loss and the investment cost of quality inspection.

However, the current focus of assembly process planning is assembly sequence planning, whereas little research has been performed on assembly timing planning. A novel assembly timing planning method based on knowledge and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is proposed in this paper. First, a knowledge base of the assembly process for timing planning is constructed using ontology. Then, based on the proposed strategy of dividing assembly timing planning into within-group planning and between-group planning, a MILP model of assembly timing planning for automatic assembly system is constructed. In addition, a software that realizes timing planning through human–machine collaboration is developed to verify and visualize the proposed timing planning method. The implementation is as follows: assembly action sentences are formed by searching the ontology keyword library, then timing knowledge for the action sequence and assembly sequence is established, and finally optimal assembly timing results are obtained after the calculation. Compared with the traditional serial assembly process, this method significantly reduces the assembly time, thereby improving the assembly efficiency, and the assembly schedule can be obtained automatically and quickly to guide the assembly process design.},

  abstract     = {In Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing is facing its next stage, cybermanufacturing, founded upon advanced communication, computation, and control infrastructure. Cybermanufacturing will unleash the potential of multi-modal manufacturing data, and provide a new perspective called computation service, as a part of service-oriented architecture (SOA), where on-demand computation requests throughout manufacturing operations are seamlessly satisfied by data analytics and machine learning. However, the complexity of information technology infrastructure leads to fundamental challenges in modeling and analysis under cybermanufacturing, ranging from information-poor datasets to a lack of reproducibility of analytical studies. Nevertheless, existing reviews have focused on the overall architecture of cybermanufacturing/SOA or its technical components (e.g., communication protocol), rather than the potential bottleneck of computation service with respect to modeling and analysis. In this paper, we review the fundamental challenges with respect to modeling and analysis in cybermanufacturing. Then, we introduce the existing efforts in computation pipeline recommendation, which aims at identifying an optimal sequence of method options for data analytics/machine learning without time-consuming trial-and-error. We envision computation pipeline recommendation as a promising research field to address the fundamental challenges in cybermanufacturing. We also expect that computation pipeline recommendation can be a driving force to flexible and resilient manufacturing operations in the post-COVID-19 industry.},

  abstract     = {Physics-guided machine learning (PGML) offers a new approach to stability modeling during machining that leverages experimental data generated during the machining process while incorporating decades of theoretical process modeling efforts. This approach addresses specific limitations of machine learning models and physics-based models individually. Data-driven machine learning models are typically black box models that do not provide deep insight into the underlying physics and do not reflect physical constraints for the modeled system, sometimes yielding solutions that violate physical laws or operational constraints. In addition, acquiring the large amounts of manufacturing data needed for machine learning modeling can be costly. On the other hand, many physical processes are not completely understood by domain experts and have a high degree of uncertainty. Physics-based models must make simplifying assumptions that can compromise prediction accuracy. This research explores whether data generated by an uncertain physics-based milling stability model that is used to train a physics-guided machine learning stability model, and then updated with measured data, domain knowledge, and theory-based knowledge provides a useful approximation to the unknown true stability model for a specific set of factory operating conditions. Four novel strategies for updating the machine learning model with experimental data are explored. These updating strategies differ in their assumptions about and implementation of the type of physics-based knowledge included in the PGML model. Using a simulation experiment, these strategies achieve useful approximations of the underlying true stability model while reducing the number of experimental measurements required for model update.},

  abstract     = {A multi-physics high-fidelity computational model is required to study the melting and grain growth phenomena in a laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process. The major challenge with the high-fidelity model is long computational time, which makes it unsuited for any feasible process parameter optimization study in a high dimensional process design space. To address this challenge, surrogate models are a good option to replace the high-fidelity model, resulting in a significant shortening of the computational time at the expense of an acceptable drop in accuracy. In this study, a tensor train (TT) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) based methodology is proposed to develop a surrogate of the high-fidelity powder-scale model. An in-house developed powder-scale model is used to generate the training data by simulating a microscale model of the powder-bed for different values of laser power. The trained TT-GPR model can predict the thermal history of the powder-bed and melt pool geometry for a specified value of laser power, while the computation time required for prediction of any set of process conditions is less than one second. Here we can achieve an approximate computational speedup of 10 $$^4$$ with the surrogate model. We provide evidence to claim that the proposed surrogate model provides high computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Today the topic of incremental sheet forming (ISF) is one of the most active areas of sheet metal forming research. ISF can be an essential alternative to conventional sheet forming for prototypes or non-mass products. Single point incremental forming (SPIF) is one of the most innovative and widely used fields in ISF with the potential to form sheet products. The formed components by SPIF lack geometric accuracy, which is one of the obstacles that prevents SPIF from being adopted as a sheet forming process in the industry. Pillow effect and wall displacement are influential contributors to manufacturing defects. Thus, optimal process parameters should be selected to produce a SPIF component with sufficient quality and without defects. In this context, this study presents an insight into the effects of the different materials and shapes of forming tools, tool head diameters, tool corner radiuses, and tool surface roughness (Ra and Rz). The studied factors include the pillow effect and wall diameter of SPIF components of AlMn1Mg1 aluminum alloy blank sheets. In order to produce a well-established study of process parameters, in the scope of this paper different modeling tools were used to predict the outcomes of the process. For that purpose, actual data collected from 108 experimentally formed parts under different process conditions of SPIF were used. Neuron by Neuron (NBN), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), CatBoost, and two different structures of Multilayer Perceptron were used and analyzed for studying the effect of parameters on the factors under scrutiny. Different validation metrics were adopted to determine the quality of each model and to predict the impact of the pillow effect and wall diameter. For the calculation of the pillow effect and wall diameter, two equations were developed based on the research parameters. As opposed to the experimental approach, analytical equations help researchers to estimate results values relatively speedily and in a feasible way. Different partitioning weight methods have been used to determine the relative importance (RI) and individual feature importance of SPIF parameters for the expected pillow effect and wall diameter. A close relationship has been identified to exist between the actual and predicted results. For the first time in the field of incremental forming study, through the construction of Catboost models, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to ascertain the impact of individual parameters on pillow effect and wall diameter predictions. CatBoost was able to predict the wall diameter with R2 values between the range of 0.9714 and 0.8947 in the case of the training and testing dataset, and between the range of 0.6062 and 0.6406 when predicting pillow effect. It was discovered that, depending on different validation metrics, the Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm performed the most effectively in predicting the wall diameter and pillow effect with R2 values in the range of 0.9645 and 0.9082 for wall diameter and in the range of 0.7506 and 0.7129 in the case of the pillow effect. NBN has no results worthy of mentioning, and GBR yields good prediction only of the wall diameter.},

  abstract     = {Part quality manufactured by the laser powder bed fusion process is significantly affected by porosity. Existing works of process–property relationships for porosity prediction require many experiments or computationally expensive simulations without considering environmental variations. While efforts that adopt real-time monitoring sensors can only detect porosity after its occurrence rather than predicting it ahead of time. In this study, a novel porosity detection-prediction framework is proposed based on deep learning that predicts porosity in the next layer based on thermal signatures of the previous layers. The proposed framework is validated in terms of its ability to accurately predict lack of fusion porosity using computerized tomography (CT) scans, which achieves a F1-score of 0.75. The framework presented in this work can be effectively applied to quality control in additive manufacturing. As a function of the predicted porosity positions, laser process parameters in the next layer can be adjusted to avoid more part porosity in the future or the existing porosity could be filled. If the predicted part porosity is not acceptable regardless of laser parameters, the building process can be stopped to minimize the loss.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM), originally used for prototyping, is increasingly adopted for custom final part production across different industries. However, printing speed and production volume are two barriers for the adoption of AM for product customization at large scale. Nevertheless, manufacturers could aim to combine the benefits of AM for product customization with traditional mass customization (MC) technologies over the product life cycle (PLC). This approach is showcased in our paper as a manufacturing opportunity and is addressed via a non convex-concave optimization model that considers a monopolist manufacturer producing horizontally differentiated products at scale. To satisfy individual customer preferences under capacity considerations, the firm jointly decides on the inventory, production quantity, product variety, optimal technology-switching times (between AM and MC) and pricing strategy. Our approach can be implemented by decision-makers to leverage customer-centricity and benefit from this novel hybrid manufacturing practice. By deriving a closed-form solution for the production quantity based on an adaptive inventory policy, the resulting optimization problem is solved using the Sample Average Approximation framework grounded by analytical results. Our results demonstrate that the new usage of AM with MC can benefit a manufacturer for customer-centric driven strategies. Significant profit improvements can be achieved with an AM–MC–AM technology-switching scenario under certain capacity conditions and with an increasing-decreasing pricing strategy. Our results also indicate that the benefits of pricing flexibility are highest when capacity is unlimited or when the firm does not hold inventory. Under capacity constraints, a simple decreasing pricing policy combined with inventory performs very well.},

The proposed method can capture the true distributions of the inputs and outputs of such systems and map these distributions using polygon generation and video-to-video translation techniques. More specifically, the time-series data are represented as polygon streams (videos), then the video-to-video translation is used to transform the input polygon streams into the output ones. This transformation is tuned based on a model trustworthiness metric for optimal video synthesis. Finally, an image processing procedure is used for mapping the output polygon streams back to time-series outputs. The proposed method is based on cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks as an unsupervised approach. This does not need the heavy involvement of the human expert who devotes much effort to labeling the complex industrial data. The performance of the proposed method was validated successfully using a challenging industrial dataset collected from a complex heat exchanger network in a Canadian pulp mill. The results obtained using the proposed method demonstrate better performance than other comparable time-series prediction models. This allows process operators to accurately monitor process key performance indicators (KPIs) and to achieve a more energy-efficient operation.},

  abstract     = {In additive manufacturing, process-induced temperature profiles are directly linked to part properties, and their prediction is crucial for achieving high-quality products. Temperature predictions require an accurate process model, which is usually either a physics-based or a data-driven simulator. Although many high-performance models have been developed, they all suffer from disadvantages such as long execution times, the need for large datasets, and error accumulation in long prediction horizons. These caveats undermine the utility of such modeling approaches and pose problems in their integration within iterative optimization and closed-loop control schemes. In this work, we introduce GPyro, a generative model family specifically designed to address these issues and enable fast probabilistic temperature predictions. GPyro combines physics-informed and parametric regressors with a set of smooth attention mechanisms and learns the evolution of the dynamics inherent to a system by employing Gaussian processes. The model predictions are equipped with confidence intervals quantifying the uncertainty at each timestep. We applied GPyro to Wire-arc additive manufacturing and learned an accurate model from a single experiment on a real welding cell, almost in real-time. Our model can be easily integrated within existing loop-shaping and optimization frameworks.},

Surrogate models are used to couple product-design choices with manufacturing process variables and material systems, hence, to connect and capture knowledge and embed intelligence in the system. Later, optimisation-driven design provides the ability to enhance the human cognitive abilities in decision-making in complex systems. This research proposes a multidisciplinary design optimisation problem to explore and exploit the interactions between different engineering disciplines using a socket prosthetic device as a case study. The originality of this research is in the conceptualisation of a computer-aided expert system capable of exploring process–structure–property–performance linkages in digital manufacturing. Thus, trade-off exploration and optimisation are enabled of competing objectives, including prosthetic socket mass, manufacturing time, and performance-tailored socket stiffness for patient comfort. The material system is modelled by experimental characterisation—the manufacturing time by computer simulations, and the product-design subsystem is simulated using a finite element analysis (FEA) surrogate model. We used polynomial surface response-based surrogate models and a Bayesian Network for design space exploration at the embodiment design stage. Next, at detail design, a gradient descent algorithm-based optimisation exploits the results using desirability functions to isolate Pareto non-dominated solutions. This work demonstrates how advanced engineering design synthesis methods can enhance designers’ cognitive ability to explore and exploit multiple disciplines concurrently and improve overall system performance, thus paving the way for the next generation of computer systems with highly intertwined material, digital design and manufacturing workflows.},

In vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) where liquid thermoset resin is infused into dry carbon reinforcement under vacuum pressure, the design of a resin distribution network to minimize fill time while ensuring the preform is completely full of resin is critical to achieving acceptable quality and cycle time. Complex resin distribution networks in aerospace composites increase the need for quick, optimized virtual design feedback. Framing the problem flow media placement in terms of reinforcement learning, we train a deep neural network agent using a 3D Finite Element based process model of resin flow in dry carbon preforms. Our agent learns to place flow media on thin laminates in order to avoid resin starvation and reduce total infusion time. Due to the knowledge the agent has gained during training on a variety of thin laminate geometries, when presented with a new thin laminate geometry it is able to propose a good flow media layout in less than a second. On a realistic aerospace part with a complex 12-dimensional flow media network, we demonstrate our method reduces fill time by 32% when compared to an expert designed placement, while maintaining the same fill quality.},

  abstract     = {Automated tools which can understand and interface with CAD (computer-aided design) models are of significant research interest due to the potential for improving efficiency in manufacturing processes. At present, most research into the use of artificial intelligence to interpret three-dimensional data takes input in the form of multiple two-dimensional images of the object or in the form of three-dimensional grids of voxels. The transformation of the input data necessary for these approaches inevitably leads to some loss of information and limitations of resolution. Existing research into the direct analysis of model files in STEP (standard for the exchange of product data) format tends to follow a rules-based approach to analyse models of a certain type, resulting in algorithms without the benefits of flexibility and complex understanding which artificial intelligence can provide. In this paper, a novel recursive encoder network for the automatic analysis of STEP files is presented. The encoder network is a flexible model with the potential for adaptation to a wide range of tasks and finetuning for specific CAD model datasets. Performance is evaluated using a machining feature classification task, with results showing accuracy approaching 100% and training time comparable to that of existing multi-view and voxel-based solutions without the need for a GPU.},

  abstract     = {Robotic motion planning in dense and dynamic indoor scenarios constantly challenges the researchers because of the motion unpredictability of obstacles. Recent progress in reinforcement learning enables robots to better cope with the dense and unpredictable obstacles by encoding complex features of the robot and obstacles into the encoders like the long-short term memory (LSTM). Then these features are learned by the robot using reinforcement learning algorithms, such as the deep Q network and asynchronous advantage actor critic algorithm. However, existing methods depend heavily on expert experiences to enhance the convergence speed of the networks by initializing them via imitation learning. Moreover, those approaches based on LSTM to encode the obstacle features are not always efficient and robust enough, therefore sometimes causing the network overfitting in training. This paper focuses on the advantage actor critic algorithm and introduces an attention-based actor critic algorithm with experience replay algorithm to improve the performance of existing algorithm from two perspectives. First, LSTM encoder is replaced by a robust encoder attention weight to better interpret the complex features of the robot and obstacles. Second, the robot learns from its past prioritized experiences to initialize the networks of the advantage actor-critic algorithm. This is achieved by applying the prioritized experience replay method, which makes the best of past useful experiences to improve the convergence speed. As results, the network based on our algorithm takes only around 15% and 30% experiences to get rid of the early-stage training without the expert experiences in cases with five and ten obstacles, respectively. Then it converges faster to a better reward with less experiences (near 45% and 65% of experiences in cases with ten and five obstacles respectively) when comparing with the baseline LSTM-based advantage actor critic algorithm.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a hybrid algorithm based on reinforcement learning and the inventory management methodology called DDMRP (Demand Driven Material Requirement Planning) to determine the optimal time to buy a certain product, and how much quantity should be requested. For this, the inventory management problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process where the environment with which the system interacts is designed from the concepts raised in the DDMRP methodology, and through the reinforcement learning algorithm—specifically, Q-Learning. The optimal policy is determined for making decisions about when and how much to buy. To determine the optimal policy, three approaches are proposed for the reward function: the first one is based on inventory levels; the second is an optimization function based on the distance of the inventory to its optimal level, and the third is a shaping function based on levels and distances to the optimal inventory. The results show that the proposed algorithm has promising results in scenarios with different characteristics, performing adequately in difficult case studies, with a diversity of situations such as scenarios with discontinuous or continuous demand, seasonal and non-seasonal behavior, and with high demand peaks, among others.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) may represent the foundations for implementing the concept of intelligent production, smart products, services, and predictive maintenance (PdM). The majority of the state-of-the-art ML approaches for PdM use different condition monitoring data (e.g. vibrations, currents, temperature, etc.) and run to failure data for predicting the Remaining Useful Lifetime of components. However, the annotation of the component wear is not always easily identifiable, thus leading to the open issue of obtaining quality labeled data and interpreting it. This paper aims to introduce and test a Decision Support System (DSS) for solving a PdM task by overcoming the above-mentioned challenge while focusing on a real industrial use case, which includes advanced processing and measuring machines. In particular, the proposed DSS is comprised of the following cornerstones: data collection, feature extraction, predictive model, cloud storage, and data analysis. Differently from the related literature, our novel approach is based on a feature extraction strategy and ML prediction model powered by specific topics collected on the lower and upper levels of the production system. Compared with respect to other state-of-the-art ML models, the experimental results demonstrated how our approach is the best trade-off between predictive performance (MAE: 0.089, MSE: 0.018, $$R^{2}: 0.868$$ ), computation effort (average latency of 2.353 s for learning from 400 new samples), and interpretability for the prediction of processing quality. These peculiarities, together with the integration of our ML approach into the proposed cloud-based architecture, allow the optimization of the machining quality processes by directly supporting the maintainer/operator. These advantages may impact to the optimization of maintenance schedules and to get real-time warnings about operational risks by enabling manufacturers to reduce service costs by maximizing uptime and improving productivity.},

  abstract     = {The complexity of industrial processes imposes a lot of challenges in building accurate and representative causal models for abnormal events diagnosis, control and maintenance of equipment and process units. This paper presents an innovative data-driven causality modeling approach using interpretable machine learning and process mining techniques, in addition to human expertise, to efficiently and automatically capture the complex dynamics of industrial systems. The approach tackles a significant challenge in the causality analysis community, which is the discovery of high-level causal models from low-level continuous observations. It is based on the exploitation of event data logs by analyzing the dependency relationships between events to generate accurate multi-level models that can take the form of various state-event diagrams. Highly accurate and trustworthy patterns are extracted from the original data using interpretable machine learning integrated with a model enhancement technique to construct event data logs. Afterward, the causal model is generated from the event log using the inductive miner technique, which is one of the most powerful process mining techniques. The causal model generated is a Petri net model, which is used to infer causality between important events as well as a visualization tool for real-time tracking of the system’s dynamics. The proposed causality modeling approach has been successfully tested based on a real industrial dataset acquired from complex equipment in a Kraft pulp mill located in eastern Canada. The generated causality model was validated by ensuring high model fitness scores, in addition to the process expert’s validation of the results.},

  abstract     = {For several industries, the traditional manufacturing processes are time-consuming and uneconomical due to the absence of the right tool to produce the products. In a couple of years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have become more prevalent in manufacturing to develop items and products with reduced labor cost, time, and effort. Digitalization with cutting-edge manufacturing methods and massive data availability have further boosted the necessity and interest in integrating ML and optimization techniques to enhance product quality. ML integrated manufacturing methods increase acceptance of new approaches, save time, energy, and resources, and avoid waste. ML integrated assembly processes help creating what is known as smart manufacturing, where technology automatically adjusts any errors in real-time to prevent any spillage. Though manufacturing sectors use different techniques and tools for computing, recent methods such as the ML and data mining techniques are instrumental in solving challenging industrial and research problems. Therefore, this paper discusses the current state of ML technique, focusing on modern manufacturing methods i.e., additive manufacturing. The various categories especially focus on design, processes and production control of additive manufacturing are described in the form of state of the art review.},

  abstract     = {The last decade saw the rise of digitalization and data-supported decision making in the manufacturing industry: the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This trend, also known as Industry 4.0, allows manufacturing enterprises to discover manufacturing uncertainties and measure their real manufacturing capability. One of the ways in which Industry 4.0 trends have been exploited is in the improvement of maintenance, which went from following planning-focused paradigms to more proactive-focused stances. Enabling the Industry 4.0 vision for maintenance purposes has historically required companies to either replace or upgrade their existing legacy devices. It is through the latter course of action that Smart retrofitting in maintenance (SRM) intends to bring value to enterprises. This work aims to present a systematic literature review on SRM, utilizing the oft-cited PRISMA methodology. Through this analysis, a definition of SRM that reflects the current state of the art is proposed. Furthermore, the research in SRM applied in the context of different maintenance strategies is assessed (i.e. reactive, planned, proactive and strategic maintenance), and the most common drivers and challenges in SRM are presented. Finally, a roadmap for the implementation of SRM is proposed. The analysis of the SRM literature reveals that there are important research opportunities in the exploitation of SRM for strategic maintenance and asset management. The authors hope that this document leads to the consolidation of a new research area that aims to add value to maintenance in enterprises through the application of smart retrofitting in preexisting legacy devices.},
