  abstract     = {Building on work by Chabauty from 1941, Coleman proved in 1985 an explicit bound for the number of rational points of a curve $C$ of genus $g\ge 2$ defined over a number field $F$ , with Jacobian of rank at most $g-1$ . Namely, in the case $F=\mathbb{Q}$ , if $p&gt;2g$ is a prime of good reduction, then the number of rational points of $C$ is at most the number of $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ -points plus a contribution coming from the canonical class of $C$ . We prove a result analogous to Coleman’s bound in the case of a hyperbolic surface $X$ over a number field, embedded in an abelian variety $A$ of rank at most one, under suitable conditions on the reduction type at the auxiliary prime. This provides the first extension of Coleman’s explicit bound beyond the case of curves. The main innovation in our approach is a new method to study the intersection of a $p$ -adic analytic subgroup with a subvariety of $A$ by means of overdetermined systems of differential equations in positive characteristic.},

Let $\rho : \Gamma \to \operatorname{PSL}_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ be a faithful discrete non-Fuchsian representation with boundary map $f:\Lambda \to \mathbb{S}^{2}$ on the limit set. In this paper, we obtain a new rigidity theorem: if $f$ is conformal on $\Lambda $ , in the sense that $f$ maps every circular slice of $\Lambda $ into a circle, then $f$ extends to a Möbius transformation $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ and $\rho $ is the conjugation by $g$ . Moreover, unless $\rho $ is a conjugation, the set of circles $C$ such that $f(C\cap \Lambda )$ is contained in a circle has empty interior in the space of all circles meeting $\Lambda $ . This answers a question asked by McMullen on the rigidity of maps $\Lambda \to \mathbb{S}^{2}$ sending vertices of every tetrahedron of zero-volume to vertices of a tetrahedron of zero-volume. The novelty of our proof is a new viewpoint of relating the rigidity of $\Gamma $ with the higher rank dynamics of the self-joining $(\operatorname{id} \times \rho )(\Gamma )&lt;\operatorname{PSL}_{2}( \mathbb{C})\times \operatorname{PSL}_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ .},

Two consequences of this result are: First, we deduce Banach fixed point properties with respect to all super-reflexive Banach spaces for a large family of higher rank simple Lie groups. For example, we show that for every $n \geq 4$ , the group $\mathrm{SL}_{n} (\mathbb{R})$ and all its lattices have the Banach fixed point property with respect to all super-reflexive Banach spaces. Second, we settle a long standing open problem and show that the Margulis expanders (Cayley graphs of $\mathrm{SL}_{n} (\mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z} )$ for a fixed $n \geq 3$ and $m$ tending to infinity) are super-expanders. All of our results stem from proving Banach property (T) for $\mathrm{SL}_{3} (\mathbb{Z})$ . Our method of proof for $\mathrm{SL}_{3} (\mathbb{Z})$ relies on a novel proof for relative Banach property (T) for the uni-triangular subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}_{3} (\mathbb{Z})$ . This proof of relative property (T) is new even in the classical Hilbert setting and is interesting in its own right.},

We develop a robust well-posedness theory for such PDEs in energy-critical spaces based on concepts of renormalized solutions and the equation’s kinetic form. We establish these properties by proving that renormalized solutions are equivalent to classical weak solutions, extending concepts of (DiPerna and Lions in Invent. Math. 98(3):511–547, 1989; Ambrosio in Invent. Math. 158(2):227–260, 2004) to the nonlinear setting. The relevance of the results toward large deviations in interacting particle systems is demonstrated by applications to the identification of l.s.c. envelopes of restricted rate functions, to zero noise large deviations for conservative SPDE, and to the $\Gamma $ -convergence of rate functions. The first of these solves a long-standing open problem in the large deviations for zero range processes. The second makes rigorous an informal link between the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics approaches of macroscopic fluctuation theory and fluctuating hydrodynamics.},

This bound exhibits a logarithmic dependence on dimension that is sharp when the matrices $A_{i}$ commute, but often proves to be suboptimal in the presence of noncommutativity. In this paper, we develop nonasymptotic bounds on the spectrum of arbitrary Gaussian random matrices that can capture noncommutativity. These bounds quantify the degree to which the spectrum of $X$ is captured by that of a noncommutative model $X_{\mathrm{free}}$ that arises from free probability theory. This “intrinsic freeness” phenomenon provides a powerful tool for the study of various questions that are outside the reach of classical methods of random matrix theory. Our nonasymptotic bounds are easily applicable in concrete situations, and yield sharp results in examples where the noncommutative Khintchine inequality is suboptimal. When combined with a linearization argument, our bounds imply strong asymptotic freeness for a remarkably general class of Gaussian random matrix models that may be very sparse, have dependent entries, and lack any special symmetries. When combined with a universality principle, our bounds extend beyond the Gaussian setting to general sums of independent random matrices.},

Based on Kato’s original construction, we construct our zeta morphisms using many deep results in the theory of $p$ -adic (local and global) Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_{2/\mathbb{Q}}$ . As an application of our zeta morphisms and the recent article (Kim et al. in On the Iwasawa invariants of Kato’s zeta elements for modular forms, 2019, arXiv:1909.01764v2 ), we prove a theorem which roughly states that, under some $\mu =0$ assumption, Iwasawa main conjecture without $p$ -adic $L$ -function for $f$ holds if this conjecture holds for one $g$ which is congruent to $f$ .},

  abstract     = {The celebrated Pólya’s conjecture (1954) in spectral geometry states that the eigenvalue counting functions of the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacian on a bounded Euclidean domain can be estimated from above and below, respectively, by the leading term of Weyl’s asymptotics. Pólya’s conjecture is known to be true for domains which tile Euclidean space, and, in addition, for some special domains in higher dimensions. In this paper, we prove Pólya’s conjecture for the disk, making it the first non-tiling planar domain for which the conjecture is verified. We also confirm Pólya’s conjecture for arbitrary planar sectors, and, in the Dirichlet case, for balls of any dimension. Along the way, we develop the known links between the spectral problems in the disk and certain lattice counting problems. A key novel ingredient is the observation, made in recent work of the last named author, that the corresponding eigenvalue and lattice counting functions are related not only asymptotically, but in fact satisfy certain uniform bounds. Our proofs are purely analytic, except for a rigorous computer-assisted argument needed to cover the short interval of values of the spectral parameter in the case of the Neumann problem in the disk.},

The problem is reformulated into a quasi-linear Hamiltonian equation for a radial displacement from the ellipse. A major difficulty of the KAM proof is the presence of a zero normal mode frequency, which is due to the conservation of the angular momentum. The key novelty to overcome this degeneracy is to perform a perturbative symplectic reduction of the angular momentum, introducing it as a symplectic variable in the spirit of the Darboux-Carathéodory theorem of symplectic rectification, valid in finite dimension. This approach is particularly delicate in a infinite dimensional phase space: our symplectic change of variables is a nonlinear modification of the transport flow generated by the angular momentum itself. This is the first time such an idea is implemented in KAM for PDEs. Other difficulties are the lack of rotational symmetry of the equation and the presence of hyperbolic/elliptic normal modes. The latter difficulties -as well as the degeneracy of a normal frequency- are absent in other vortex patches problems which have been recently studied using the formulation introduced in this paper.},

Furthermore, in certain cases, we show that a random polynomial $f(x)$ with $f(0)\neq 0$ is irreducible with probability tending to 1 as $n\to \infty $ . In particular, this is the case if $\mu $ is the uniform measure on a set of at least 35 consecutive integers, or on a subset of $[-H,H]\cap \mathbb{Z}$ of cardinality $\geq H^{4/5}(\log H)^{2}$ with $H$ sufficiently large. In addition, in all of these settings, we show that the Galois group of $f(x)$ is either $\mathcal{A}_{n}$ or $\mathcal{S}_{n}$ with high probability. Finally, when $\mu $ is the uniform measure on a finite arithmetic progression of at least two elements, we prove a random polynomial $f(x)$ as above is irreducible with probability $\geq \delta $ for some constant $\delta =\delta (\mu )&gt;0$ .

  abstract     = {The main focus of this article concerns the strongly percolative regime of the vacant set of random interlacements on ${\mathbb{Z}}^{d}$ , $d \ge 3$ . We investigate the occurrence in a large box of an excessive fraction of sites that get disconnected by the interlacements from the boundary of a concentric box of double size. The results significantly improve our findings in Sznitman (Probab. Math. Phys. 2–3:563–311, 2021). In particular, if, as expected, the critical levels for percolation and for strong percolation of the vacant set of random interlacements coincide, the asymptotic upper bound that we derive here matches in principal order a previously known lower bound. A challenging difficulty revolves around the possible occurrence of droplets that could get secluded by the random interlacements and thus contribute to the excess of disconnected sites, somewhat in the spirit of the Wulff droplets for Bernoulli percolation or for the Ising model. This feature is reflected in the present context by the so-called bubble set, a possibly quite irregular random set. A pivotal progress in this work has to do with the improved construction of a coarse grained random set accounting for the cost of the bubble set. This construction heavily draws both on the method of enlargement of obstacles originally developed in the mid-nineties in the context of Brownian motion in a Poissonian potential in Sznitman (Ann. Probab. 25(3):1180–1209, 1997; Brownian Motion, Obstacles and Random Media. Springer, Berlin, 1998), and on the resonance sets recently introduced by Nitzschner and Sznitman in (J. Eur. Math.

  abstract     = {We provide the rigorous derivation of the wave kinetic equation from the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation at the kinetic timescale, under a particular scaling law that describes the limiting process. This solves a main conjecture in the theory of wave turbulence, i.e. the kinetic theory of nonlinear wave systems. Our result is the wave analog of Lanford’s theorem on the derivation of the Boltzmann kinetic equation from particle systems, where in both cases one takes the thermodynamic limit as the size of the system diverges to infinity, and as the interaction strength of waves/radius of particles vanishes to 0, according to a particular scaling law (Boltzmann-Grad in the particle case). More precisely, in dimensions $d\geq 3$ , we consider the (NLS) equation in a large box of size $L$ with a weak nonlinearity of strength $\alpha $ . In the limit $L\to \infty $ and $\alpha \to 0$ , under the scaling law $\alpha \sim L^{-1}$ , we show that the long-time behavior of (NLS) is statistically described by the wave kinetic equation, with well justified approximation, up to times that are $O(1)$ (i.e. independent of $L$ and $\alpha $ ) multiples of the kinetic timescale $T_{\text{kin}}\sim \alpha ^{-2}$ . This is the first result of its kind for any nonlinear dispersive system.},

Our goal is to obtain sufficient conditions under which such colorings can be made well-behaved in the sense of topology or measure. To this end, we show that such well-behaved colorings can be produced using certain powerful techniques from finite combinatorics and computer science. First, we prove that efficient distributed coloring algorithms (on finite graphs) yield well-behaved colorings of Borel graphs of bounded degree; roughly speaking, deterministic algorithms produce Borel colorings, while randomized algorithms give measurable and Baire-measurable colorings. Second, we establish measurable and Baire-measurable versions of the Symmetric Lovász Local Lemma (under the assumption $\mathsf{p}(\mathsf{d}+1)^{8} \leqslant 2^{-15}$ , which is stronger than the standard LLL assumption $\mathsf{p}(\mathsf{d}+ 1) \leqslant e^{-1}$ but still sufficient for many applications). From these general results, we derive a number of consequences in descriptive combinatorics and ergodic theory.},

By interpolation, such solutions belong to $$C^0_t B^{s}_{3,\infty }$$ for s approaching $$\frac{1}{3}$$ as $$\beta $$ approaches $$\frac{1}{2}$$ . Hence this result provides a new proof of the flexible side of the $$L^3$$ -based Onsager conjecture. Of equal importance is that the intermittent nature of our solutions matches that of turbulent flows, which are observed to possess an $$L^2$$ -based regularity index exceeding $$\frac{1}{3}$$ . Thus our result does not imply, and is not implied by, the work of Isett (Ann Math 188(3):871, 2018), who gave a proof of the Hölder-based Onsager conjecture. Our proof builds on the authors’ previous joint work with Buckmaster et al. (Intermittent convex integration for the 3D Euler equations: (AMS-217), Princeton University Press, 2023.), in which an intermittent convex integration scheme is developed for the 3D incompressible Euler equations.

As in the real hyperbolic case, our primary result is a superrigidity theorem for certain representations of complex hyperbolic lattices. The proof requires developing new general tools not needed in the real hyperbolic case. Our main results also have a number of other applications. For example, we prove nonexistence of certain maps between complex hyperbolic manifolds, which is related to a question of Siu, that certain hyperbolic 3-manifolds cannot be totally geodesic submanifolds of complex hyperbolic manifolds, and that arithmeticity of complex hyperbolic manifolds is detected purely by the topology of the underlying complex variety, which is related to a question of Margulis.

The above result provides a solution to the Keller–Rubinstein–Sternberg’s problem in the O(n) setting. Our proof relies on two key ingredients. First, in order to construct the approximate solutions by matched asymptotic expansions, as the standard approach does not seem to work, we introduce the notion of quasi-minimal connecting orbits. They satisfy the usual leading order equations up to some small higher order terms. In addition, the linearized systems around these quasi-minimal orbits needs to be solvable up to some good remainders. These flexibilities are needed for the possible “degenerations” and higher dimensional kernels for the linearized operators on matrix-valued functions due to intriguing boundary conditions at the sharp interface. The second key point is to establish a spectral uniform lower bound estimate for the linearized operator around approximate solutions. To this end, we introduce additional decompositions to reduce the problem into the coercive estimates of several linearized operators for scalar functions and some singular product estimates which are accomplished by exploring special cancellation structures between eigenfunctions of these linearized operators.},

This disproves a conjecture of Maier and Tenenbaum. We also prove analogs for the concentration of divisors of a random permutation and of a random polynomial over a finite field. Most of the paper is devoted to a study of the following much more combinatorial problem of independent interest. Pick a random set $${\textbf{A}} \subset {\mathbb {N}}$$ by selecting i to lie in $${\textbf{A}}$$ with probability 1/i. What is the supremum of all exponents $$\beta _k$$ such that, almost surely as $$D \rightarrow \infty $$ , some integer is the sum of elements of $${\textbf{A}} \cap [D^{\beta _k}, D]$$ in k different ways? We characterise $$\beta _k$$ as the solution to a certain optimisation problem over measures on the discrete cube $$\{0,1\}^k$$ , and obtain lower bounds for $$\beta _k$$ which we believe to be asymptotically sharp.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses problems on simultaneous Diophantine approximation on fractals, motivated by a long standing problem of Mahler regarding Cantor’s middle 1/3 set. We obtain the first instances where a complete analogue of Khintchine’s Theorem holds for fractal measures. Our results apply to fractals which are self-similar by a system of rational similarities of $${\mathbb {R}}^d$$ (for any $$d\ge 1$$ ) and have sufficiently small Hausdorff co-dimension. A concrete example of such measures in the context of Mahler’s problem is the Hausdorff measure on the “middle $$1/5$$ Cantor set”; i.e. the set of numbers whose base $$5$$ expansions miss a single digit. The key new ingredient is an effective equidistribution theorem for certain fractal measures on the homogeneous space $${\mathcal {L}}_{d+1}$$ of unimodular lattices; a result of independent interest. The latter is established via a new technique involving the construction of S-arithmetic operators possessing a spectral gap and encoding the arithmetic structure of the maps generating the fractal. As a consequence of our methods, we show that spherical averages of certain random walks naturally associated to the fractal measures effectively equidistribute on $${\mathcal {L}}_{d+1}$$ .},

  abstract     = {A proper q-coloring of a domain in $${\mathbb {Z}}^d$$ is a function assigning one of q colors to each vertex of the domain such that adjacent vertices are colored differently. Sampling a proper q-coloring uniformly at random, does the coloring typically exhibit long-range order? It has been known since the work of Dobrushin that no such ordering can arise when q is large compared with d. We prove here that long-range order does arise for each q when d is sufficiently high, and further characterize all periodic maximal-entropy Gibbs states for the model. Ordering is also shown to emerge in low dimensions if the lattice $${\mathbb {Z}}^d$$ is replaced by $${\mathbb {Z}}^{d_1}\times {\mathbb {T}}^{d_2}$$ with $$d_1\ge 2$$ , $$d=d_1+d_2$$ sufficiently high and $${\mathbb {T}}$$ a cycle of even length.

Moreover we get that if M is a closed oriented 3-manifold that is not a graph manifold, for example a hyperbolic manifold, then every nondegenerate Reeb vector field on M has positive topological entropy.},

We establish several significant facts about their geometry including a unibranch property at special points and a representation theoretic description of the irreducible components of their special fibers. We derive from these geometric results a number of local and global consequences: the Breuil–Mézard conjecture in arbitrary dimension for tamely potentially crystalline deformation rings with small Hodge–Tate weights (with appropriate genericity conditions), the weight part of Serre’s conjecture for U(n) as formulated by Herzig (for global Galois representations which satisfy the Taylor–Wiles hypotheses and are sufficiently generic at p), and an unconditional formulation of the weight part of Serre’s conjecture for wildly ramified representations.},

Moreover, for sampling functions in a residual subset of the space of Hölder continuous functions, the Lyapunov exponent is positive everywhere. If we consider locally constant or globally fiber bunched sampling functions, then the Lyapuonv exponent is positive away from a finite set. Moreover, for sampling functions in an open and dense subset of the space in question, the Lyapunov exponent is uniformly positive. Our results can be applied to any subshift of finite type with ergodic measures that are equilibrium states of Hölder continuous potentials. In particular, we apply our results to Schrödinger operators defined over expanding maps on the unit circle, hyperbolic automorphisms of a finite-dimensional torus, and Markov chains.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the conjecture on the instability of Anti-de Sitter spacetime, put forward by Dafermos–Holzegel (Dynamic instability of solitons in 4 + 1 dimesnional gravity with negative cosmological constant, 2006. https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~md384/ADSinstability.pdf ) and Dafermos (The Black Hole Stability problem, Talk at the Newton Institute, Cambridge, 2006. http://www-old.newton.ac.uk/webseminars/pg+ws/2006/gmx/1010/dafermos/ ) in 2006, has attracted a substantial amount of numerical and heuristic studies. Following the pioneering work (Phys Rev Lett 107(3):031102, 2011) of Bizon–Rostworowski, research efforts have been mainly focused on the study of the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system. The first rigorous proof of the instability of AdS in the simplest spherically symmetric setting, namely for the Einstein-null dust system, was obtained in Moschidis (A proof of the instability of AdS for the Einstein-null dust system with an inner mirror, 2017. arXiv:1704.08681 ). In order to circumvent problems associated with the trivial break down of the Einstein-null dust system occuring at the center $$r=0$$ , Moschidis (2017) studied the evolution of the system in the exterior of an inner mirror placed at $$r=r_{0}$$ , $$r_{0}&gt;0$$ . However, in view of additional considerations on the nature of the instability, it was necessary for Moschidis (2017) to allow the mirror radius $$r_{0}$$ to shrink to 0 with the size of the initial perturbation; well-posedness in the resulting complicated setup (involving low-regularity estimates of uniform modulus with respect to $$r_{0}$$ ) was obtained in Moschidis (The Einstein-null dust system in spherical symmetry with an inner mirror: structure of the maximal development and Cauchy stability, 2017. arXiv:1704.08685 ). In this paper, we establish the instability of AdS for the Einstein-massless Vlasov system in spherical symmetry; this will be the first proof of the AdS instability conjecture for an Einstein-matter system which is well-posed for regular initial data in the standard sense, without the addition of an inner mirror. The necessary well-posedness results for this system are obtained in our companion paper (Moschidis in The characteristic initial-boundary value problem for the Einstein-massless Vlasov system in spherical symmetry, 2018. arXiv:1812.04274 ). Our proof utilises an instability mechanism based on beam interactions which is superficially similar to the one appearing in Moschidis (A proof of the instability of AdS for the Einstein-null dust system with an inner mirror, 2017. arXiv:1704.08681 ). However, new difficulties associated with the Einstein-massless Vlasov system (such as the need for control on the paths of non-radial geodesics in a large curvature regime) will force us to develop a different strategy of proof involving a novel configuration of beam interactions. One of the main novelties of our construction is the introduction of a multi-scale hierarchy of domains in phase space, on which the initial support of the Vlasov field f is localised. The propagation of this hierarchical structure of the support of f along the evolution will be crucial both for controlling the geodesic flow under minimal regularity assumptions and for guaranteeing the existence of the solution until the time of trapped surface formation.},

In general the conjecture is wide open when $$\dim R&gt;3$$ , even in equal characteristic. In this paper, we prove Lech’s conjecture in all dimensions, provided $$(R,\mathfrak {m})$$ is a standard graded ring over a perfect field localized at the homogeneous maximal ideal. We introduce the notions of lim Ulrich and weakly lim Ulrich sequences. Roughly speaking these are sequences of finitely generated modules that are not necessarily Cohen–Macaulay, but asymptotically behave like Ulrich modules. We prove that the existence of these sequences imply Lech’s conjecture. Though the existence of Ulrich modules is known in very limited cases, we construct weakly lim Ulrich sequences for all standard graded domains over perfect fields of positive characteristic.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the notion of conformal walk dimension, which serves as a bridge between elliptic and parabolic Harnack inequalities. The importance of this notion is due to the fact that, for a given strongly local, regular symmetric Dirichlet space in which every metric ball has compact closure (MMD space), the finiteness of the conformal walk dimension characterizes the conjunction of the metric doubling property and the elliptic Harnack inequality. Roughly speaking, the conformal walk dimension of an MMD space is defined as the infimum over all possible values of the walk dimension with which the parabolic Harnack inequality can be made to hold by a time change of the associated diffusion and by a quasisymmetric change of the metric. We show that the conformal walk dimension of any MMD space satisfying the metric doubling property and the elliptic Harnack inequality is two, and provide a necessary condition for a pair of such changes to attain the infimum defining the conformal walk dimension when it is attained by the original pair. We also prove a necessary condition for the existence of such a pair attaining the infimum in the setting of a self-similar Dirichlet form on a self-similar set, and apply it to show that the infimum fails to be attained for the Vicsek set and the N-dimensional Sierpiński gasket with $$N\ge 3$$ , in contrast to the attainment for the two-dimensional Sierpiński gasket due to Kigami (Math Ann 340(4):781–804, 2008).},

  abstract     = {We construct a class of global, dynamical solutions to the 3d Euler equations near the stationary state given by uniform “rigid body” rotation. These solutions are axisymmetric, of Sobolev regularity, have non-vanishing swirl and scatter linearly, thanks to the dispersive effect induced by the rotation. To establish this, we introduce a framework that builds on the symmetries of the problem and precisely captures the anisotropic, dispersive mechanism due to rotation. This enables a fine analysis of the geometry of nonlinear interactions and allows us to propagate sharp decay bounds, which is crucial for the construction of global Euler flows.},

  abstract     = {There are several proofs by now for the famous Cwikel–Lieb–Rozenblum (CLR) bound, which is a semiclassical bound on the number of bound states for a Schrödinger operator, proven in the 1970s. Of the rather distinct proofs by Cwikel, Lieb, and Rozenblum, the one by Lieb gives the best constant, the one by Rozenblum does not seem to yield any reasonable estimate for the constants, and Cwikel’s proof is said to give a constant which is at least about 2 orders of magnitude off the truth. This situation did not change much during the last 40+ years. It turns out that this common belief, i.e, Cwikel’s approach yields bad constants, is not set in stone: We give a substantial refinement of Cwikel’s original approach which highlights a natural but overlooked connection of the CLR bound with bounds for maximal Fourier multipliers from harmonic analysis. Moreover, it gives an astonishingly good bound for the constant in the CLR inequality. Our proof is also quite flexible and leads to rather precise bounds for a large class of Schrödinger-type operators with generalized kinetic energies.},
