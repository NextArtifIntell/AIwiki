  abstract     = {As opposed to the 3D cubic grid, the body-centered cubic (BCC) grid has some favorable topological properties: each set of voxels in the grid is a 3-manifold, with 2-manifold boundary. Thus, the Euler characteristic of an object O in this grid can be computed as half of the Euler characteristic of its boundary $$\partial O$$ . We propose three new algorithms to compute the Euler characteristic in the BCC grid with this surface-based approach: one based on (critical point) Morse theory and two based on the discrete Gauss–Bonnet theorem. We provide a comparison between the three new algorithms and the classic approach based on counting the number of cells, either of the 3D object or of its 2D boundary surface.},

First, we derive a condition under which the exact solution of our differential equation model for time-dependent input $$I=I(t)$$ is described by the convolution integral with a temporal biphasic function. Second, we analyze the model with the input signal $$I=I(t,x)$$ depending on time t and position $$x \in \textbf{R}$$ , and we prove that the solution can be represented in convolution integral form and that $$t_1&gt;0$$ exists such that the spatiotemporal integral kernel $$K_u(t_1,x)$$ is positive for $$x \in \textbf{R}$$ and $$t \in (0,t_1)$$ . Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that there exists $$t_2 (&gt; t_1)$$ such that $$K_u(t_2,x)$$ includes the Mexican-hat function and a temporal biphasic function under certain parameter conditions. From these mathematical and numerical results, we find that there is a time lag before the Mexican-hat function appears in $$K_u(t,x)$$ , and the shape of $$K_u(t,x)$$ is similar to the receptive field structure observed in experiments in the field of neurophysiology. We conclude that the partial differential equations for visual information processing can be used to analytically determine the shape of the spatiotemporal kernel indicating the self-control mechanism.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new color image vectorization method converting raster images to resolution-independent scalable vector graphics. Starting from a quantized raster image, the method builds a hierarchical structure to represent its discontinuity set. The lowest level elements, called curve-elements, separate exactly two colors and end at T-junctions or X-junctions. The middle-level objects, called curvebases, are concatenations of curve-elements following perceptual rules and representing the apparent contours of objects. On the highest level, the jump set coincides with the discontinuity set of the quantized image input. A geometric filtering method removes pixelization effects by affine shortening of the curvebases while resolving the induced topological changes. All junctions are preserved, thus maintaining the highest level of perceptual fidelity even on tiny pixel art images. A single parameter controls the simplification of curves between two junctions. Theoretical bounds are given to guarantee the method’s topological consistency. This allows the method to be iterated such that it yields a smoothing semigroup. In both qualitative and quantitative experiments, our method compares favorably to multiple state-of-the-art algorithms and software.},

However, none provide satisfactory definitions for morphology on probabilistic representations of categorical images. The categorical distribution is a natural choice for representing uncertainty about categorical images. Extending MM to categorical distributions is problematic because categories are inherently unordered. Without ranking categories, we cannot use the standard framework based on supremum and infimum. Ranking categories is impractical and problematic. Instead, we consider the probabilistic representation and operations that emphasize a single category. In this work, we review and compare previous approaches. We propose two approaches for morphology on categorical distributions: operating on Dirichlet distributions over the parameters of the distributions and operating directly on the distributions. We propose a “protected” variant of the latter and demonstrate the proposed approaches by fixing misclassifications and modeling annotator bias.},

Various gray level indicators have been proposed as effective tools for removing different types of non-Gaussian noise in the diffusion equation framework. However, the application of the method is limited since diffusion equations can not recover details and textures in images. In this paper, we consider the time discretization of the method and rewrite each step as the weighted average of the results obtained from the previous step and a mean filter. By replacing the mean filter with another Gaussian denoiser, we establish a general algorithm that extends any off-the-shelf Gaussian denoiser for removing different types of non-Gaussian noise. The weight (i.e., the gray level indicator) varies with the type of noise and is constructed based on the amplitude of the noise to estimate the degree to which each pixel in the noisy image is contaminated. It is shown that the commonly used Gaussian denoisers from classical filters to patch-based approaches are all valid. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm with BM3D outperforms recent methods for image restoration under random-valued noise, Cauchy noise, and multiplicative noise, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) have been successfully applied in geometric deep learning. Typically, G-CNNs have the advantage over CNNs that they do not waste network capacity on training symmetries that should have been hard-coded in the network. The recently introduced framework of PDE-based G-CNNs (PDE-G-CNNs) generalizes G-CNNs. PDE-G-CNNs have the core advantages that they simultaneously (1) reduce network complexity, (2) increase classification performance, and (3) provide geometric interpretability. Their implementations primarily consist of linear and morphological convolutions with kernels. In this paper, we show that the previously suggested approximative morphological kernels do not always accurately approximate the exact kernels accurately. More specifically, depending on the spatial anisotropy of the Riemannian metric, we argue that one must resort to sub-Riemannian approximations. We solve this problem by providing a new approximative kernel that works regardless of the anisotropy. We provide new theorems with better error estimates of the approximative kernels, and prove that they all carry the same reflectional symmetries as the exact ones. We test the effectiveness of multiple approximative kernels within the PDE-G-CNN framework on two datasets, and observe an improvement with the new approximative kernels. We report that the PDE-G-CNNs again allow for a considerable reduction of network complexity while having comparable or better performance than G-CNNs and CNNs on the two datasets. Moreover, PDE-G-CNNs have the advantage of better geometric interpretability over G-CNNs, as the morphological kernels are related to association fields from neurogeometry.},

  abstract     = {Image foresting transform (IFT) is a graph-based framework to develop image operators based on optimum connectivity between a root set and the remaining nodes, according to a given path-cost function. Oriented image foresting transform (OIFT) was proposed as an extension of some seeded IFT-based segmentation methods to directed graphs, enabling them to support the processing of global object properties, such as connectedness, shape constraints, boundary polarity, and hierarchical constraints, allowing their customization to a given target object. OIFT lies in the intersection of generalized graph cut and general fuzzy connectedness frameworks, inheriting their properties. Its returned segmentation is optimal, with respect to an appropriate graph cut measure, among all segmentations satisfying the given constraints. In this work, we propose differential oriented image foresting transform, which allows multiple OIFT executions for different root sets, making the processing time proportional to the number of modified nodes. Experimental results show considerable efficiency gains over the sequential flow of OIFTs in image segmentation, while maintaining a good treatment of tie zones. We also demonstrate that the differential flow makes it feasible to incorporate the prior knowledge about the maximum allowable size for the segmented object, thus avoiding false positive errors in the segmentation of multi-dimensional images. We also propose an algorithm to efficiently create a hierarchy map that encodes area-constrained OIFT results for all possible thresholds, facilitating the quick selection of the object of interest.},

  abstract     = {In a recent work, full convexity has been proposed as an alternative definition of digital convexity. It solves many problems related to its usual definitions, for instance: Fully convex sets are digitally convex in the usual sense, but are also connected and simply connected. However, full convexity is not a monotone property; hence, intersections of fully convex sets may be neither fully convex nor connected. This defect might forbid digital polyhedral models with fully convex faces and edges. This can be detrimental since classical standard and naive planes are fully convex. In this paper, we study several methods that builds a fully convex set from a digital set. One is particularly appealing and is based on an iterative process: This envelope operator solves in arbitrary dimension the problem of extending a digital set into a fully convex set, while leaving fully convex sets invariant. This extension naturally leads to digital polyhedra whose cells are fully convex. Then a relative envelope operator is proposed, which can be used to force digital planarity of fully convex sets. We provide experiments showing that our method produces coherent polyhedral models for any polyhedron in arbitrary dimension. Finally we study how we can speed up full convexity checks and envelope operations, with a worst-case complexity lowered by a factor $$2^d$$ in $${\mathbb {Z}}^d$$ .},

In this article, we focus on an important subfamily of morphological hierarchies, namely the trees that model partial partitions of the image support. This subfamily includes in particular the component-tree and the tree of shapes. In this context, we provide some new graph-based structures (one directed acyclic graph and three trees): the graph of valued shapes, the tree of valued shapes, the complete tree of shapes and the topological tree of shapes. These new objects create a continuum between the two notions of component-tree and tree of shapes. In particular, they allow to establish that these two trees (together with a third notion of adjacency tree generally considered in topological image analysis) can be defined and handled in a unified framework. In addition, this framework enables to enrich the component-tree with additional information, leading on the one hand to a topological description of grey-level images that relies on the same paradigm as persistent homology, and on the other hand to the proposal of a topological version of tree of shapes. This article provides a theoretical analysis of these new morphological hierarchies and their links with the usual ones. It also proposes an algorithmic description of two ways of building these new morphological hierarchies, and a discussion on the links that exist between these morphological hierarchies and certain topological invariants and descriptors.},

For any integer $$k\ge 0$$ , the density function of a periodic set S was previously defined as the fractional volume of all k-fold intersections (within a minimal cell) of balls that have a variable radius t and centers at all points of S. This paper introduces the density functions for periodic sets of points with different initial radii motivated by atomic radii of chemical elements and by continuous events occupying disjoint intervals in time series. The contributions are explicit descriptions of the densities for periodic sequences of intervals. The new densities are strictly stronger and distinguish periodic sequences that have identical densities in the case of zero radii.},

While the traditional approach was based on threshold superposition, we rely instead on threshold summation, and this allows a correct formulation for non-increasing flat operators and also for operators with non-binary outputs. We obtained then some basic properties of flat operators, valid for both increasing and non-increasing operators. Here we pursue this work by investigating further properties of flat operators, which differ in the increasing and non-increasing cases, in particular the composition, join and meet of operators, and the commutation with contrast mappings. We study duality under inversion and characterise discrete linear convolution operators as flat operators. This allows to integrate various hybrid morphological operators into our framework.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion MRI is a modern neuroimaging modality with a unique ability to acquire microstructural information by measuring water self-diffusion at the voxel level. However, it generates huge amounts of data, resulting from a large number of repeated 3D scans. Each volume samples a location in q-space, indicating the direction and strength of a diffusion sensitizing gradient during the measurement. This captures detailed information about the self-diffusion and the tissue microstructure that restricts it. Lossless compression with GZIP is widely used to reduce the memory requirements. We introduce a novel lossless codec for diffusion MRI data. It reduces file sizes by more than 30% compared to GZIP and also beats lossless codecs from the JPEG family. Our codec builds on recent work on lossless PDE-based compression of 3D medical images, but additionally exploits smoothness in q-space. We demonstrate that, compared to using only image space PDEs, q-space PDEs further improve compression rates. Moreover, implementing them with finite element methods and a custom acceleration significantly reduces computational expense. Finally, we show that our codec clearly benefits from integrating subject motion correction and slightly from optimizing the order in which the 3D volumes are coded.},

The contours segmentation or deformations of an object is a preprocessing step of shape retrieval and classification that segment the binary object shape in a shape-preserving sequence of contours segment using a coordination number shape segmentation approach. The proposed local binary pattern extracts the minimum decimal value corresponding to the pattern of object contour points for each and every contours segment. It is one of the most important features in content-based image retrieval. At the matching stage, we find Euclidean distance between eigenvalues of correlation coefficient of Hu’s seven moments corresponding to each contour segment for given two objects. The LBP pattern corresponding to the image contour provides excellent power, which is demonstrated by excellent retrieval performance on several popular shape benchmarks, including MPEG-7 CE-Shape-1 dataset and Kimia’s dataset. Experimental results obtained from popular databases demonstrate that the proposed linear binary pattern can achieve comparably better results than existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Polarization encoded images improve on conventional intensity imaging techniques by providing access to additional parameters describing the vector nature of light. In a polarimetric image, each pixel is related to a $$4 \times 1$$ vector named Stokes vector ( $$3 \times 1$$ in a linear configuration, which is the framework retained afterwards). Such images comprise a valuable set of physical information on the objects they contain, amplifying subsequently the accuracy of the analysis that can be done. A Stokes imaging polarimeter yields data named radiance images from which Stokes vectors are reconstructed, supposed to comply with a physical admissibility constraint. Classical estimation techniques such as pseudo-inverse approach exhibit defects, hampering any relevant physical interpretation of the scene: (i) first, due to their sensitivity to noise and errors that may contaminate the observed radiance images and that may then propagate to the evaluation of the Stokes vector components, thus justifying an ad hoc a posteriori treatment of Stokes vectors; (ii) second, in not taking this physical admissibility criterion explicitly into account. Motivated by this observation, the proposed contribution aims to provide a method of reconstruction addressing both issues, thus ensuring smoothness and spatial consistency of the reconstructed components, as well as compliance with the prescribed physical admissibility constraint. A by-product of the algorithm is that the resulting angle of polarization reflects more faithfully the physical properties of the materials present in the image. The mathematical formulation yields a non-smooth convex optimization problem that is then converted into a min–max problem and solved by the generic Chambolle–Pock primal-dual algorithm. Several mathematical results (such as existence/uniqueness of the minimizer of the primal problem, existence of a saddle point to the associated Lagrangian, etc.) are supplied and highlight the well-posed character of the modelling. Experiments demonstrate that our method provides significant improvements (i) over the least square-based method both in terms of quantitative criteria (physical admissibility constraint automatically met) and qualitative assessment (spatial regularization/coherency), (ii) over the physical consistency of related relevant polarimetric parameters such as the angle and degree of polarization, (iii) robustness of the method when applied on real outdoor scenes acquired in degraded conditions (poor weather conditions, etc.).},

They are defined by a structuring element that is usually shifted pixel-wise over an image, together with a comparison process that takes place within the corresponding mask. This comparison is made in the grey value case by means of maximum or minimum formation. Hence, there is easy access to max-plus algebra and, by means of an algebra change, also to the theory of linear algebra. We show that an approximation of the maximum function forms a commutative semifield (with respect to multiplication) and corresponds to the maximum again in the limit case. In this way, we demonstrate a novel access to the logarithmic connection between the Fourier transform and the slope transformation. In addition, we prove that the dilation by means of a fast Fourier transform depends only on the size of the structuring element used. Moreover, we derive a bound above which the Fourier approximation yields results that are exact in terms of grey value quantisation.},

It is especially difficult to extract the correlation when the involved objects have different variability in separate non-Euclidean spaces. To address these difficulties, this paper proposes geometric and statistical methods to extract the shape correlation from multi-object complexes. In particular, we focus on the shape correlation of the hippocampus and the caudate subject to the development of autism. The proposed methods are designed (1) to capture objects’ shape features (2) to capture shape correlation regardless of different variability between the two objects and (3) to provide interpretable shape correlation in multi-object complexes.

The method’s particularities lay in both the sampling model and the interpolation polynomial we use. Rather than classical uniform grids, we consider an unusual sampling system based on Chebyshev zeros of the first kind. Such optimal distribution of nodes permits to consider near-best interpolation polynomials defined by a filter of de la Vallée-Poussin type. The action ray of this filter provides an additional parameter that can be suitably regulated to improve the approximation. The method has been tested on a significant number of different image datasets. The results are evaluated in qualitative and quantitative terms and compared with other available competitive methods. The perceived quality of the resulting scaled images is such that important details are preserved, and the appearance of artifacts is low. Competitive quality measurement values, good visual quality, limited computational effort, and moderate memory demand make the method suitable for real-world applications.},

In such cases, the 3D pose candidates are found by further enforcing geometric constraints on the solution space and then retrieving such poses from the intersections of multiple quadrics.

  abstract     = {It is often challenging to selectively segment the images with intensity inhomogeneity for the existing region-based variational models. This article proposes a Retinex-based selective segmentation model for inhomogeneous images. The main idea is to employ the Retinex theory to decouple the input inhomogeneous image into illumination bias and reflective parts and then introduce the regularizer of these two parts in the proposed model for selective segmentation. Also, a convex formulation of the model is presented and the relationship between the solutions of the proposed model and its convex relaxation is given. Furthermore, we design an effective algorithm for numerically solving the model by incorporating the alternating minimization method. Experimental results on synthetic binary images and real medical images validate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Anisotropic and high-order diffusion variational models have excellent performances in image coherence and smoothness preserving, respectively. In order to preserve these merits simultaneously in one variational model for image restoration, we propose three second-order anisotropic variational models making use of directional Hessian. The first one is the double-orientational bounded Hessian (DOBH) model; it is an extension to the isotropic bounded Hessian (BH) model. The second is the double-orientational total generalized variation (DOTGV), which is an extension to the total generalized variation (TGV) model. The third is the double-orientational total variation and bounded Hessian (DOTBH) model, which is a hybrid one combining the first-order and second-order directional regularizers. The second-order directional derivatives are designed by Hession and directional vectors which are derived from classic structure tensors. In order to cope with complex calculations of these models, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms are designed, respectively. Thus, the proposed models can be decomposed into a set of simple sub-problems of optimization, which can be solved by fast FFT method or soft thresholding formulas. In order to improve computational efficiency, fast ADMM algorithms with restart strategy are designed and implemented finally. Experimental results demonstrate better performances compared with previous classical models, especially in large-scale texture restoration.},

  abstract     = {Entropy-regularized optimal transport and its multi-marginal generalization have attracted increasing attention in various applications, in particular due to efficient Sinkhorn-like algorithms for computing optimal transport plans. However, it is often desirable that the marginals of the optimal transport plan do not match the given measures exactly, which led to the introduction of the so-called unbalanced optimal transport. Since unbalanced methods were not examined for the multi-marginal setting so far, we address this topic in the present paper. More precisely, we introduce the unbalanced multi-marginal optimal transport problem and its dual and show that a unique optimal transport plan exists under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we generalize the Sinkhorn algorithm for regularized unbalanced optimal transport to the multi-marginal setting and prove its convergence. For cost functions decoupling according to a tree, the iterates can be computed efficiently. At the end, we discuss three applications of our framework, namely two barycenter problems and a transfer operator approach, where we establish a relation between the barycenter problem and the multi-marginal optimal transport with an appropriate tree-structured cost function.},

  abstract     = {Affine invariant features play an important role in many computer vision tasks. But shearing brings inconveniences for the extraction of affine invariant features with conventional inner product (CIP). Affine invariants constructed by moment are sensitive to noise, and affine covariant points other than centroid can hardly be constructed. These inconveniences are caused by difficulties for the elimination of an angular factor with CIP. In order to facilitate the elimination of this angular factor, a general function and a transformation are introduced to the integral along radial direction, and quasi inner product (QIP) is proposed. In terms of QIP, generalized polar coordinate moment (GPCM) is defined. A method is developed for the construction of affine invariants with the proposed GPCM. Almost all the existing moment-based affine invariants are special cases of affine invariants constructed by GPCM. Quasi centroid (QC), which keeps affine covariance, is also derived by GPCM. Experimental results show that affine invariants with better performance can be constructed. QC is also employed for the estimation of parameters in affine transform.},

Wasserstein barycenters—the problem of finding measures in-between given input measures in the optimal transport sense—are even more computationally demanding as it requires to solve an optimization problem involving optimal transport distances. By training a deep convolutional neural network, we improve by a factor of 80 the computational speed of Wasserstein barycenters over the fastest state-of-the-art approach on the GPU, resulting in milliseconds computational times on $$512\times 512$$ regular grids. We show that our network, trained on Wasserstein barycenters of pairs of measures, generalizes well to the problem of finding Wasserstein barycenters of more than two measures.

In this work, we leverage the advantages of both approaches by integrating theoretically founded concepts from transform domain methods and sparse approximations into a CNN-based approach for blind image inpainting. To this end, we present a novel strategy to learn convolutional kernels that applies a specifically designed filter dictionary whose elements are linearly combined with trainable weights. Numerical experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of this approach. Our results show not only an improved inpainting quality compared to conventional CNNs but also significantly faster network convergence within a lightweight network design.

  abstract     = {Images recognition require an extraction technique of feature vectors of these images. These vectors must be invariant to the three geometric transformations: rotation, translation and scaling. In this context, there are several authors who used the theory of orthogonal moments, which are become an indispensable tool in a wide range of pattern recognition applications. In this paper, we generalize the notions of orthogonality and orthogonal moments by introducing the property «p-orthogonality» and «p-orthogonal moments». We show that a p-orthogonal set of functions is composed of p orthogonal subsets. We prove that the set of linear shape functions or hat functions, used in the finite element method (FEM), is 2-orthogonal. Based in these functions we present four types of moments: the set of 2-orthogonal radial shape moments (2ORSMs), the set of orthogonal radial shape moments (1ORSMs) for gray-level images, the set of multi-channel 2-orthogonal radial shape moments (2MRSMs) and the set of multi-channel orthogonal radial shape moments (1MRSMs) for color images. Invariants to translation, scaling and rotation (TSR) of the four proposed moments are derived for image representation and recognition. We present a set of numerical experiments in the field of classification and pattern recognition to evaluate the performance of the proposed invariant moments. From a comparative study with the recent invariant moments, we conclude that our approach is very promising in the pattern recognition field and image analysis.},

The subspace strategy, combined with a majoration–minimization step-size search, takes great advantage of the smoothness of the penalized cost function, while the penalty method allows to handle a wide range of constraints. The main drawback of exterior penalty approaches, namely ill-conditioning for large values of the penalty parameter, is overcome by using a trust-region-like technique. The convergence of the resulting algorithm is analyzed.

Their main ingredients are a highly nonlinear processing, a massive learning made possible by the flourishing of optimization algorithms with the power of computers (GPU) and the use of large available datasets for training. It is far from obvious to say which of these three ingredients has the biggest impact on the performance. While the many stages of nonlinearity are intrinsic to deep learning, the usage of learning with training data could also be exploited by sparsity-based approaches. The aim of our study is to push the limits of sparsity to use, similarly to U-nets, massive learning and large datasets, and then to compare the results with U-nets. We present a new network architecture, called learnlets, which conserves the properties of sparsity-based methods such as exact reconstruction and good generalization properties, while fostering the power of neural networks for learning and fast calculation. We evaluate the model on image denoising tasks. Our conclusion is that U-nets perform better than learnlets on image quality metrics in distribution, while learnlets have better generalization properties.},

In this framework, a network layer is seen as a set of PDE-solvers where geometrically meaningful PDE-coefficients become the layer’s trainable weights. Formulating our PDEs on homogeneous spaces allows these networks to be designed with built-in symmetries such as rotation in addition to the standard translation equivariance of CNNs. Having all the desired symmetries included in the design obviates the need to include them by means of costly techniques such as data augmentation. We will discuss our PDE-based G-CNNs (PDE-G-CNNs) in a general homogeneous space setting while also going into the specifics of our primary case of interest: roto-translation equivariance. We solve the PDE of interest by a combination of linear group convolutions and nonlinear morphological group convolutions with analytic kernel approximations that we underpin with formal theorems. Our kernel approximations allow for fast GPU-implementation of the PDE-solvers; we release our implementation with this article in the form of the LieTorch extension to PyTorch, available at https://gitlab.com/bsmetsjr/lietorch . Just like for linear convolution, a morphological convolution is specified by a kernel that we train in our PDE-G-CNNs. In PDE-G-CNNs, we do not use non-linearities such as max/min-pooling and ReLUs as they are already subsumed by morphological convolutions. We present a set of experiments to demonstrate the strength of the proposed PDE-G-CNNs in increasing the performance of deep learning-based imaging applications with far fewer parameters than traditional CNNs.},

We connect these concepts to residual networks, recurrent neural networks, and U-net architectures. Our findings inspire a symmetric residual network design with provable stability guarantees and justify the effectiveness of skip connections in neural networks from a numerical perspective. Moreover, we present U-net architectures that implement multigrid techniques for learning efficient solutions of partial differential equation models, and motivate uncommon design choices such as trainable nonmonotone activation functions. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed architectures save half of the trainable parameters and can thus outperform standard ones with the same model complexity. Our considerations serve as a basis for explaining the success of popular neural architectures and provide a blueprint for developing new mathematically well-founded neural building blocks.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel algorithm for estimating optimal parameters of linearized assignment flows for image labeling. An exact formula is derived for the parameter gradient of any loss function that is constrained by the linear system of ODEs determining the linearized assignment flow. We show how to efficiently evaluate this formula using a Krylov subspace and a low-rank approximation. This enables us to perform parameter learning by Riemannian gradient descent in the parameter space, without the need to backpropagate errors or to solve an adjoint equation. Experiments demonstrate that our method performs as good as highly-tuned machine learning software using automatic differentiation. Unlike methods employing automatic differentiation, our approach yields a low-dimensional representation of internal parameters and their dynamics which helps to understand how assignment flows and more generally neural networks work and perform.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian methods to solve imaging inverse problems usually combine an explicit data likelihood function with a prior distribution that explicitly models expected properties of the solution. Many kinds of priors have been explored in the literature, from simple ones expressing local properties to more involved ones exploiting image redundancy at a non-local scale. In a departure from explicit modelling, several recent works have proposed and studied the use of implicit priors defined by an image denoising algorithm. This approach, commonly known as Plug &amp; Play (PnP) regularization, can deliver remarkably accurate results, particularly when combined with state-of-the-art denoisers based on convolutional neural networks. However, the theoretical analysis of PnP Bayesian models and algorithms is difficult and works on the topic often rely on unrealistic assumptions on the properties of the image denoiser. This papers studies maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for Bayesian models with PnP priors. We first consider questions related to existence, stability and well-posedness and then present a convergence proof for MAP computation by PnP stochastic gradient descent (PnP-SGD) under realistic assumptions on the denoiser used. We report a range of imaging experiments demonstrating PnP-SGD as well as comparisons with other PnP schemes.},

The associated inverse scale space flow can be obtained using the classical Bregman iteration with quadratic data term. We apply the Bregman iteration to lifted, i.e., higher-dimensional and convex, functionals in order to extend the scope of these approaches to functionals with arbitrary data term. We provide conditions for the subgradients of the regularizer – in the continuous and discrete setting– under which this lifted iteration reduces to the standard Bregman iteration.

  abstract     = {We propose an automatic parameter selection strategy for the single image super-resolution problem for images corrupted by blur and additive white Gaussian noise with unknown standard deviation. The proposed approach exploits the structure of both the down-sampling and the blur operators in the frequency domain and computes the optimal regularisation parameter as the one optimising a suitably defined residual whiteness measure. Computationally, the proposed strategy relies on the fast solution of generalised Tikhonov $$\ell _2$$ – $$\ell _2$$ problems as proposed in Zhao et al. (IEEE Trans Image Process 25:3683–3697, 2016). These problems naturally appear as substeps of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers used to solve single image super-resolution problems with non-quadratic, non-smooth, sparsity-promoting regularisers both in convex and in non-convex regimes. After detailing the theoretical properties allowing to express the whiteness functional in a compact way, we report an exhaustive list of numerical experiments proving the effectiveness of the proposed approach for different type of problems, in comparison with well-known parameter selection strategies such as, e.g., the discrepancy principle.},

  abstract     = {Technologies for 3D data acquisition and 3D printing have enormously developed in the past few years, and, consequently, the demand for 3D virtual twins of the original scanned objects has increased. In this context, feature-aware denoising, hole filling and context-aware completion are three essential (but far from trivial) tasks. In this work, they are integrated within a geometric framework and realized through a unified variational model aiming at recovering triangulated surfaces from scanned, damaged and possibly incomplete noisy observations. The underlying non-convex optimization problem incorporates two regularisation terms: a discrete approximation of the Willmore energy forcing local sphericity and suited for the recovery of rounded features, and an approximation of the $$\ell _0$$ pseudo-norm penalty favouring sparsity in the normal variation. The proposed numerical method solving the model is parameterization-free, avoids expensive implicit volume-based computations and based on the efficient use of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Experiments show how the proposed framework can provide a robust and elegant solution suited for accurate restorations even in the presence of severe random noise and large damaged areas.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a variational model for splines in the image metamorphosis model for the smooth interpolation of key frames in the space of images. The Riemannian manifold of images based on the metamorphosis model defines shortest geodesic paths interpolating two images as minimizers of the path energy which measures the viscous dissipation caused by the motion field and dissipation caused by the material derivative of the image intensity along motion paths. In this paper, we aim at smooth interpolation of multiple key frame images picking up the general observation of cubic splines in Euclidean space which minimize the squared acceleration along the interpolation path. To this end, we propose the spline functional which combines quadratic functionals of the Eulerian motion acceleration and of the second material derivative of the image intensity as the proper notion of image intensity acceleration. We propose a variational time discretization of this model and study the convergence to a suitably relaxed time continuous model via $$\varGamma $$ -convergence methodology. As a byproduct, this also allows to establish the existence of metamorphosis splines for given key frame images as minimizers of the time continuous spline functional. The time discretization is complemented by effective spatial discretization based on finite differences and a stable B-spline interpolation of deformed quantities. A variety of numerical examples demonstrates the robustness and versatility of the proposed method in applications. For the minimization of the fully discrete energy functional, a variant of the iPALM algorithm is used.},

  abstract     = {We propose GOTEX, a general framework for texture synthesis by optimization that constrains the statistical distribution of local features. While our model encompasses several existing texture models, we focus on the case where the comparison between feature distributions relies on optimal transport distances. We show that the semi-dual formulation of optimal transport allows to control the distribution of various possible features, even if these features live in a high-dimensional space. We then study the resulting minimax optimization problem, which corresponds to a Wasserstein generative model, for which the inner concave maximization problem can be solved with standard stochastic gradient methods. The alternate optimization algorithm is shown to be versatile in terms of applications, features and architecture; in particular, it allows to produce high-quality synthesized textures with different sets of features. We analyze the results obtained by constraining the distribution of patches or the distribution of responses to a pre-learned VGG neural network. We show that the patch representation can retrieve the desired textural aspect in a more precise manner. We also provide a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art texture synthesis methods. The GOTEX model based on patch features is also adapted to texture inpainting and texture interpolation. Finally, we show how to use our framework to learn a feed-forward neural network that can synthesize on-the-fly new textures of arbitrary size in a very fast manner. Experimental results and comparisons with the mainstream methods from the literature illustrate the relevance of the generative models learned with GOTEX.},
