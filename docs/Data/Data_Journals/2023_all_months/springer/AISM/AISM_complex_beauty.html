  abstract     = {Estimation of compiler causal treatment effects has been discussed by many authors under different situations but only limited literature exists for interval-censored failure time data, which often occur in many areas such as longitudinal or periodical follow-up studies. Particularly it does not seem to exist a method that can deal with informative interval censoring, which can happen naturally and make the analysis much more challenging. Also, it has been shown that when the informative censoring exists, the analysis without taking it into account would yield biased or misleading results. To address this, we propose an estimated sieve maximum likelihood approach with the use of instrumental variables. The asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators of regression parameters are established, and a simulation study is performed and suggests that it works well. Finally, it is applied to a set of real data that motivated this study.},

  abstract     = {Biclustering is a method for detecting homogeneous submatrices in a given matrix. Although there are many studies that estimate the underlying bicluster structure of a matrix, few have enabled us to determine the appropriate number of biclusters. Recently, a statistical test on the number of biclusters has been proposed for a regular-grid bicluster structure. However, when the latent bicluster structure does not satisfy such regular-grid assumption, the previous test requires a larger number of biclusters than necessary for the null hypothesis to be accepted, which is not desirable in terms of interpreting the accepted structure. In this study, we propose a new statistical test on the number of biclusters that does not require the regular-grid assumption and derive the asymptotic behavior of the proposed test statistic in both null and alternative cases. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to both synthetic and practical data matrices.},

  abstract     = {For the survival of cancer and many other complex diseases, gene–environment (G-E) interactions have been established as having essential importance. G-E interaction analysis can be roughly classified as marginal and joint, depending on the number of G variables analyzed at a time. In this study, we focus on joint analysis, which can better reflect disease biology and is statistically more challenging. Many approaches have been developed for joint G-E interaction analysis for survival outcomes and led to important findings. However, without rigorous statistical development, quite a few methods have a weak theoretical ground. To fill this knowledge gap, in this article, we consider joint G-E interaction analysis under the Cox model. Sparse group penalization is adopted for regularizing estimation and selecting important main effects and interactions. The “main effects, interactions” variable selection hierarchy, which has been strongly advocated in recent literature, is satisfied. Significantly advancing from some published studies, we rigorously establish the consistency properties under high dimensionality. An effective computational algorithm is developed, simulation demonstrates competitive performance of the proposed approach, and analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) further demonstrates its practical utility.},

We address a nonparametric imputation using the regularized M-estimation techniques in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Specifically, we first use kernel ridge regression to develop imputation for handling item nonresponse. Although this nonparametric approach is potentially promising for imputation, its statistical properties are not investigated in the literature. Under some conditions on the order of the tuning parameter, we first establish the root-n consistency of the kernel ridge regression imputation estimator and show that it achieves the lower bound of the semiparametric asymptotic variance. A nonparametric propensity score estimator using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is also developed by the linear expression of the projection estimator. We show that the resulting propensity score estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the kernel ridge regression imputation estimator. Results from a limited simulation study are also presented to confirm our theory. The proposed method is applied to analyze air pollution data measured in Beijing, China.},

Thus, this study aims to provide a data-based bin width selector for rose diagrams using a statistical approach. We consider that the radius of the rose diagram is a nonparametric estimator of the square root of two times the circular density. We derive the mean integrated square error of the rose diagram and its optimal bin width and propose two new selectors: normal reference rule and biased cross-validation. We show that biased cross-validation converges to its optimizer. Additionally, we propose a polygon rose diagram to enhance the rose diagram.},

A finite mixture model is thus most suitable to fit datasets of this nature. In this paper, we propose a two-component mixture of shifted binomial distributions for rating data. We show that this model is identifiable and propose a numerically stable penalized likelihood approach for parameter estimation. We adapt an expectation-maximization algorithm for the penalized maximum likelihood estimation. Our simulation results show that the penalized maximum likelihood estimator is consistent and effective. We fit the proposed model and other models in the literature to some real-world datasets and find the proposed model can have much better fits.},

In this study, we propose a minimum density power divergence estimation procedure for panel data regression models with random effects to achieve robustness against outliers. The robustness, as well as the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator, are rigorously established. The finite-sample properties of the proposed method are investigated through an extensive simulation study and an application to climate data in Oman.

Different from existing literature on the subject, we consider a particular form for all candidates, where there is only one varying coefficient in each sub-model, and all the candidates under investigation may be misspecified. We propose a weight choice criterion based on a leave-more-out cross-validation objective function. Moreover, the resulting averaging estimator is more robust against model misspecification due to the weighted coefficients that adjust the relative importance of the varying and constant coefficients for the same predictors. We prove out statistical properties for each sub-model and asymptotic optimality of the weight selection method. Simulation studies show that the proposed procedure has satisfactory prediction accuracy. An analysis of a skin cutaneous melanoma data further supports the merits of the proposed approach.},

We point out and explore a connection between $$\alpha$$ -slash distributions, which are gaining popularity in statistical practice, and generalized convolutions, which come up in the probability theory as generalizations of the standard concept of the convolution of probability measures and allow for the operation between the measures to be random itself. The stochastic interpretation of Kendall convolution discussed in this work brings this theoretical concept closer to statistical practice, and leads to new results for $$\alpha$$ -slash distributions connected with extremes. In particular, we show that the maximum of independent random variables with $$\alpha$$ -slash distributions is also a random variable with an $$\alpha$$ -slash distribution. Our theoretical results are illustrated by several examples involving standard and novel probability distributions and extremes.},

We show that the excess risk of the selected estimator enjoys the best bias-variance trade-off over the considered collection. To achieve these results, we needed to overcome the dependence difficulties by following a classical approach which consists in restricting to a set where the empirical covariance matrix is equivalent to the theoretical one. We show that this event happens with probability larger than $$1-c_0/n^2$$ with $$c_0&gt;0$$ .

However, in the misspecified case, the asymptotic distribution of the estimator varies by the correction of the misspecification bias, and consistent estimators for the asymptotic variance proposed in the correctly specified case may lose theoretical validity. As one of its solutions, we propose a bootstrap method for approximating the asymptotic distribution.

First, most of these methods require the data to be randomly and uniformly distributed across different machines. Second, the methods are mainly not robust. To solve these problems, we propose a distributed pilot modal regression estimator, which achieves robustness and can adapt when the data are stored nonrandomly. First, we collect a random pilot sample from different machines; then, we approximate the global MR objective function by a communication-efficient surrogate that can be efficiently evaluated by the pilot sample and the local gradients. The final estimator is obtained by minimizing the surrogate function in the master machine, while the other machines only need to calculate their gradients. Theoretical results show the new estimator is asymptotically efficient as the global MR estimator. Simulation studies illustrate the utility of the proposed approach.},

A column-space-decomposition model is adopted incorporating a low-rank structured matrix for the finite population with easy-to-obtain demographic information as covariates. Besides, we propose a computationally efficient projection strategy to identify the model parameters under complex survey sampling. Then, an augmented inverse probability weighting estimator is used to estimate the parameter of interest, and the corresponding asymptotic upper bound of the estimation error is derived. Simulation studies show that the proposed estimator has a smaller mean squared error than other competitors, and the corresponding variance estimator performs well.

Because the responses within a cluster in the FP are correlated, the aforementioned sample mis-specification makes the sample-based so-called GLS (generalized least square) estimators design biased and inconsistent. In this paper, we demonstrate for the exponential family data how to avoid the sampling mis-specification and accommodate the cluster correlations to obtain unbiased and consistent estimates for the FP parameters.

Existing breakdown point notions do not cover ranking problems so far. We propose to define a breakdown of the estimator as a sign-reversal of all components which causes the predicted ranking to be potentially completely inverted; therefore, we call it the order-inversal breakdown point (OIBDP). We will study the OIBDP, based on a linear model, for several different carefully distinguished ranking problems and provide least favorable outlier configurations, characterizations of the order-inversal breakdown point and sharp asymptotic upper bounds.

However, the test and interval estimation deviate from the nominal significance level when integrating a small number of studies. Although a method for constructing more conservative intervals has been recently proposed, the exact distribution of test statistic for the overall treatment effect is not well known. In this paper, we provide an almost-exact distribution of the test statistic in random-effects meta-analysis and propose the test and interval estimation using the almost-exact distribution. Simulations demonstrate the accuracy of estimation and application to existing meta-analysis using the method proposed here. With known variance parameters, the estimation performance using the almost-exact distribution always achieves the nominal significance level regardless of the number of studies and heterogeneity. We also propose some methods to construct a conservative interval estimation, even when the variance parameters are unknown, and present their performances via simulation and an application to Alzheimer’s disease meta-analysis.},

The key feature of the proposed model is that the sojourn times of the states in the semi-Markov chain are time-dependent, making it an inhomogeneous semi-Markov chain. Conjectured consistency of the parameter estimators is checked by simulation study using direct numerical optimization of the log-likelihood function. The proposed models are applied to a global volcanic eruption catalogue to investigate the time-dependent incompleteness of the record by introducing a particular case of IHSMMs with time-dependent shifted Poisson state durations and a renewal process as the observed process. The Akaike Information Criterion and residual analysis are used to choose the best model. The selected IHSMM provides useful insights into the completeness of the global record of volcanic eruptions, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, the main focus of the least squares regression is to study the effects of individual predictor variables, but strongly correlated variables generate multicollinearity which makes it difficult to study their effects. To resolve the multicollinearity issue without abandoning the least squares regression, for situations where predictor variables are in groups with strong within-group correlations but weak between-group correlations, we propose to study the effects of the groups with a group approach to the least squares regression. Using an all positive correlations arrangement of the strongly correlated variables, we first characterize group effects that are meaningful and can be accurately estimated. We then discuss the group approach to the least squares regression through a simulation study and demonstrate that it is an effective method for handling multicollinearity. We also address a common misconception about prediction accuracy of the least squares estimated model.},

  abstract     = {Classical symmetric distributions like the Gaussian are widely used. However, in reality data often display a lack of symmetry. Multiple distributions, grouped under the name “skewed distributions”, have been developed to specifically cope with asymmetric data. In this paper, we present a broad family of flexible multivariate skewed distributions for which statistical inference is a feasible task. The studied family of multivariate skewed distributions is derived by taking affine combinations of independent univariate distributions. These are members of a flexible family of univariate asymmetric distributions and are an important basis for achieving statistical inference. Besides basic properties of the proposed distributions, also statistical inference based on a maximum likelihood approach is presented. We show that under mild conditions, weak consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimators hold. These results are supported by a simulation study confirming the developed theoretical results, and some data examples to illustrate practical applicability.},

Several studies have been proposed in the literature, but almost all of them are based on asymptotic approximation and do not have finite-sample validity. In this study, we propose an exact (non-asymptotic) inference method for the Wasserstein distance inspired by the concept of conditional selective inference (SI). To our knowledge, this is the first method that can provide a valid confidence interval (CI) for the Wasserstein distance with finite-sample coverage guarantee, which can be applied not only to one-dimensional problems but also to multi-dimensional problems. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {It is common to show the confidence intervals or p-values of selected features, or predictor variables in regression, but they often involve selection bias. The selective inference approach solves this bias by conditioning on the selection event. Most existing studies of selective inference consider a specific algorithm, such as Lasso, for feature selection, and thus they have difficulties in handling more complicated algorithms. Moreover, existing studies often consider unnecessarily restrictive events, leading to over-conditioning and lower statistical power. Our novel and widely applicable resampling method via multiscale bootstrap addresses these issues to compute an approximately unbiased selective p-value for the selected features. As a simplification of the proposed method, we also develop a simpler method via the classical bootstrap. We prove that the p-value computed by our multiscale bootstrap method is more accurate than the classical bootstrap method. Furthermore, numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm works well even for more complicated feature selection methods such as non-convex regularization.},

  abstract     = {We investigate hypothesis testing in nonparametric additive models estimated using simplified smooth backfitting (Huang and Yu, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 28(2), 386–400, 2019). Simplified smooth backfitting achieves oracle properties under regularity conditions and provides closed-form expressions of the estimators that are useful for deriving asymptotic properties. We develop a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) (Fan, Zhang and Zhang, Annals of statistics, 29(1),153–193, 2001) and a loss function (LF) (Hong and Lee, Annals of Statistics, 41(3), 1166–1203, 2013)-based testing framework for inference. Under the null hypothesis, both the GLR and LF tests have asymptotically rescaled chi-squared distributions, and both exhibit the Wilks phenomenon, which means the scaling constants and degrees of freedom are independent of nuisance parameters. These tests are asymptotically optimal in terms of rates of convergence for nonparametric hypothesis testing. Additionally, the bandwidths that are well suited for model estimation may be useful for testing. We show that in additive models, the LF test is asymptotically more powerful than the GLR test. We use simulations to demonstrate the Wilks phenomenon and the power of these proposed GLR and LF tests, and a real example to illustrate their usefulness.},

To model the stochastic dominance, we proposed a semiparametric modelling of the log of density ratio. More specifically, when the log of the ratio of two component densities is in a linear regression form, the stochastic dominance is immediately satisfied. For the resulting semiparametric mixture model, we proposed two estimators, maximum empirical likelihood estimator (MELE) and minimum Hellinger distance estimator (MHDE), and investigated their asymptotic properties such as consistency and normality. In addition, to test the validity of the proposed semiparametric model, we developed Kolmogorov–Smirnov type tests based on the two estimators. The finite-sample performance, in terms of both efficiency and robustness, of the two estimators and the tests were examined and compared via both thorough Monte Carlo simulation studies and real data analysis.},
