  abstract     = {Multi-objective optimization problems require the simultaneous optimization of more than one objective function. Image segmentation algorithm partitions an image into different parts according to its features and properties. It is essentially a multi-objective optimization problem because of multiple requirements. Multi-objective evolutionary fuzzy clustering (MOEFC) algorithms behave much better than traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms due to considering several cluster indices and automatically determining the number of clusters. When applied to image segmentation, MOEFC algorithms generally consume a long running time and cannot well preserve the region-level information in images. To solve these problems and meanwhile utilize some prior information derived from images to further improve the performance of MOEFC algorithms, this paper proposes a multiple population-based multi-objective evolutionary semi-supervised multi-kernel region fuzzy clustering image segmentation. First, effective region features considering color, texture and spatial information are extracted. Next, region-level-based semi-supervised fitness functions are designed using the obtained region features and some propagation supervision information. Further, in order to effectively aggregate image features, the constructed fitness functions are extended to a non-linear version utilizing a multi-kernel function. Then, a multi-population evolutionary strategy is adopted to improve the diversity of population. Except for the traditional crossover and mutation operators, the recombination operator between two populations and a center updating based elitist strategy are designed. Finally, a multiple kernel evaluation index with region information and propagation supervision information is constructed to select an optimal solution from the non-dominant solution set. Experimental results on several image datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation performance and running efficiency.},

Electromagnetism-like mechanism for global optimization (EMO) is a physics-inspired optimization algorithm. In this study we propose a novel hybrid metaheuristic evolutionary algorithm that combines aspects from both BSO and EMO. The proposed algorithm, named EMotion-aware brain storm optimization, is inspired by the attraction–repulsion mechanism of electromagnetism, and it is applied in a new emotion-aware brainstorming context, where positive and negative thoughts produce ideas interacting with each other. Novel contributions include a bi-polar clustering approach, a probabilistic selection operator, and a hybrid evolution process, which improves the ability of the algorithm to avoid local optima and convergence speed. A systematic comparative performance evaluation that includes sensitivity analysis, convergence velocity and dynamic fitness landscape analyses, and scalability assessment was performed using several reference benchmark functions from standard benchmark suites. The results validate the performance advantages of the proposed algorithm over relevant state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The method of evaluating the diversity of the solution set can directly affect the final performances of the algorithms. In this article, a point crowding-degree (PC) strategy is proposed to evaluate the diversity of solutions. The proposed PC strategy not only considers the distance between any two points as large as possible, but also considers the gap between each dimension component as large as possible. Moreover, The PC only ponders the influence of surrounding neighbor points on the diversity of a point. A selection strategy is designed to balance convergence and diversity. Based on all, a point crowding-degree based evolutionary algorithm (PCEA) for many-objective optimization problems is proposed. The PCEA is compared experimentally with several state-of-the-art algorithms on the 57 many-objective benchmark functions and the experimental results show that the proposed PCEA algorithm has strong competitiveness and better overall performance. In addition, the proposed PC strategy is integrated into other advanced MaOPs methods. The results show that it is beneficial to improve the performance of other MaOEAs algorithms.},

  abstract     = {A key issue in tackling multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) is achieving the balance between objective space diversity and decision space diversity to obtain multiple Pareto sets (PSs) while guaranteeing convergence to the Pareto front (PF). However, most of the existing methods for MMOPs face the following two shortages: (i) they put insufficient emphasis on improving decision space diversity, resulting in missing some PSs or PS segments; and (ii) they lack the utilization of promising historical individuals which may help search the PSs. To alleviate these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multi-stage evolutionary algorithm with two improved optimization strategies. Specifically, the proposed method decomposes solving MMOP into two tasks, i.e., the Exploration task and the Exploitation task. The Exploration task first aims to explore the decision space to detect the multiple PSs, then, the Exploitation task aims to enhance the diversities on both objective and decision spaces (i.e., exploiting the PF and PSs). To better search PSs, historical individuals that are well-distributed in the decision space are stored as the evolutionary experience, and then used to generate offspring individuals. Moreover, a new differential evolution is designed to force crowded individuals to move to sparse and undetected regions on the PSs to enhance the diversity of PSs. Extensive experimental studies compare the proposed method with five state-of-the-art methods tailored for MMOPs on two benchmark test suites. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform others in terms of three performance indicators.},

The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been quantitatively and extensively evaluated on large and publicly available datasets, containing English and French multi-stroke words and isolated characters. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing ones in terms of Root Mean Square Error and Dynamic Time Warping distance between the recovered trajectories and the actual ones. Furthermore, an “off-the-shelf” online recognition system provided with the trajectory recovered from offline samples showed an overall reduction of 6.8% with respect to the recognition rate achieved by the system when provided with online data; the reduction, however, drops to 2.4% once preprocessing errors are not taken into account.},

Optical flow estimation networks are usually treated as a black box relying on large amounts of synthetic data for training, therefore the generalization and robustness of the network applying in realities remains a challenge. To overcome these problems, a dual-frequency paradigm is proposed for optical flow estimation. The proposed dual-frequency encoder captures discriminative features with both high-frequency and low-frequency biases. It is experimentally demonstrated that our method achieves better generalization while only pre-trained on FlyingChiars. Furthermore, our method improves the prediction of optical flow in occluded regions by enhancing the perception of high-frequency features that further improve the robustness of the network. Compared to the start-of-the-art RAFT, our approach obtains an improvement of the average end-point error by 10.6% on the Sintel Clean datasets and 11.7% on the challenging Sintel Final dataset.},

Most heuristic search algorithms exclude all invalid solutions from the search space so that all intermediate and final solutions satisfy the constraints. However, some values of intermediate solutions that are sometimes invalid may help in finding the optimal solution. Therefore, such solutions may need to be &quot;tolerated&quot; in the generation process. This paper proposes a tolerance-based memetic algorithm named QSMA that employs quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) as a global searching operator and improved simulated annealing as a local searching operator to balance exploration and exploitation synergistically. Meanwhile, QSMA incorporates a stochastic ranking strategy to address the challenge of setting the penalty coefficient. Besides, a specific penalty function is proposed to deal with constraints, and design guidelines for penalty functions are suggested. In the experiment, the impacts of parameter settings on the performance of QSMA are investigated. Extensive experimental results show that the QSMA algorithm outperforms other methods and tools for both CAG and CCAG problems.},

Based on that, this paper proposes the use of a matrix to evaluate the decision variable correlations and perform adaptive updates, which achieve the highest accuracy of sparse relationship mining. Specifically, the control variable method and Pareto dominance relations generate an original matrix in the initial stage. Then, with reference to the mask distribution of the contemporary nondominated solutions, the matrix is updated in the evolutionary phase by means of the nondominated ordering of a parent and the corresponding offspring for rewards and penalties.

In the evolution process, CMaOEA-AIR adaptively determines the ratio of infeasible solutions to survive into the next generation according to the number and the objective values of the infeasible solutions. The feasible solutions then undergo an exploitation-biased environmental selection based on indicator ranking and diversity maintaining, while the infeasible solutions undergo environmental selection based on adaptive selection criteria, aiming at the enhancement of exploration. In this way, both feasible and infeasible solutions are appropriately used to balance the exploration and exploitation of the search space. The proposed CMaOEA-AIR is compared with the other state-of-the-art constrained many-objective optimization algorithms on three types of CMaOPs of up to 15 objectives.

To efficiently solve the URPP, this paper models it as a discrete optimization problem with constraints and proposes a knowledge learning and random pruning-based memetic algorithm (KLRP-MA), with three main contributions. First, the proposed URPP model is from the perspective of users and is suitable for not only static situations but also dynamic situations, which is novel from existing work that mainly focuses on the perspective of bike companies in a static situation. Second, three novel evolutionary operators named knowledge learning-based crossover, random pruning-based mutation, and two-phase local search are proposed and integrated into the KLRP-MA for dealing with the challenges of the URPP. Third, based on the dynamic URPP model, the KLRP-MA is further extended to a dynamic KLRP-MA (DyKLRP-MA) to quickly search for a reasonable route for users when the availability status of the bike stations changes over time, so as to deal with URPP in dynamic situations. Experimental results on 180 generated instances and 10 real-world instances show that when compared with the traditional and state-of-the-art methods, the KLRP-MA and the DyKLRP-MA can find the best solution in a short time. Moreover, in a dynamic situation, the DyKLRP-MA can quickly respond to changes and re-optimize the current planning route.},

  abstract     = {Modelling the biology behind animal behaviour has attracted great interest in recent years. Nevertheless, neuroscience and artificial intelligence face the challenge of representing and emulating animal behaviour in robots. Consequently, this paper presents a biologically inspired motivational model to control the biological functions of autonomous robots that interact with and emulate human behaviour. The model is intended to produce fully autonomous, natural, and behaviour that can adapt to both familiar and unexpected situations in human–robot interactions. The primary contribution of this paper is to present novel methods for modelling the robot’s internal state to generate deliberative and reactive behaviour, how it perceives and evaluates the stimuli from the environment, and the role of emotional responses. Our architecture emulates essential animal biological functions such as neuroendocrine responses, circadian and ultradian rhythms, motivation, and affection, to generate biologically inspired behaviour in social robots. Neuroendocrinal substances control biological functions such as sleep, wakefulness, and emotion. Deficits in these processes regulate the robot’s motivational and affective states, significantly influencing the robot’s decision-making and, therefore, its behaviour. We evaluated the model by observing the long-term behaviour of the social robot Mini while interacting with people. The experiment assessed how the robot’s behaviour varied and evolved depending on its internal variables and external situations, adapting to different conditions. The outcomes show that an autonomous robot with appropriate decision-making can cope with its internal deficits and unexpected situations, controlling its sleep–wake cycle, social behaviour, affective states, and stress, when acting in human–robot interactions.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved effective results in image denoising tasks. However, CNN architectures for image denoising tasks are mainly designed manually, which not only relies on CNN-related professional knowledge, but also requires adjustment to different datasets for competitive performance. Algorithms for automatically evolving CNN architectures have been proposed, but most of them are designed for solving image classification tasks and consume considerable computational time and resources. To address these issues, an efficient automatically evolving CNN architecture algorithm for image denoising tasks using genetic algorithm is proposed, which is called fast block-based evolutionary denoising CNN (FBE-DnCNN). In FBE-DnCNN, a genetic encoding strategy based on both deep and wide net blocks is designed to effectively represent the image denoising CNNs for automatic architecture design. With the purpose of solving time-consuming and resource-dependent problems, the partial dataset-based technology is used. A novel refined fitness evaluation method with prior knowledge on parameters of CNNs is designed to improve reliability. For better feature extraction of shallow network layers, convolutional operation, prevention of overfitting, and improvement of the representational capacity, the Feature Block, Transition Block, Dropout Block, and SENet module are introduced in FBE-DnCNN to generate problem-specific search space. With block-specific crossover and mutation, a local search near the good solution is implemented to find better solutions. Experiments show that FBE-DnCNN can evolve distinguished image denoising CNNs with deep and wide architectures in a very short time. FBE-DnCNN achieves competitive performance for the image denoising tasks with different noise levels compared to the traditional approaches, state-of-the-art CNN-based algorithms, and NAS-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) use spikes to communicate between neurons, leading to biological plausible implementation. Considering spikes as events, SNNs are inherently suitable for processing address event representation (AER) data. Despite the progress in event-driven methods for AER data, there is little study on the relationship between time-driven and event-driven algorithms, that is required to gain insight into the understanding of SNNs. In this paper, an in-depth analysis of time-driven and event-driven algorithms was given. A same-timestamp problem in event-driven simulation, which may lead to an error spike, is found and solved in a simple efficacious way. An event-driven learning algorithm was proposed, which is efficient and compatible with a multitude of spike-based plasticity mechanisms. Leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with precise spike driven synaptic plasticity was used to demonstrate the property of the proposed event-driven algorithm and conduct experiments on two AER datasets (MNIST-DVS and AER Poker Card) and MNIST dataset. The results show that the event-driven simulation is always faster than the time-driven simulation, and the proposed algorithm achieves similar accuracy to other conventional time-driven methods.},

The hybrid algorithm is thus a bi-module framework, where each module encapsulates a different search logic. Both modules use the Non-Uniform Mutation, although with different flavors: the first one acting on a single variable at a time, the second one acting on multiple variables. Hence, the algorithm is dubbed “compact Single/Multi Non-Uniform Mutation” (in short, cSM). It is designed for being suitable for tackling optimization problems on memory-constrained devices, i.e., devices for which the available memory may be not enough to run population-based metaheuristics. The performance of cSM is evaluated by an extensive comparative analysis including 12 state-of-the-art memory-saving (also called “lightweight”) algorithms on three well-known testbeds, namely the BBOB, the CEC-2014, and CEC-2017 benchmarks, as well as seven real-world optimization problems included in the CEC-2011 benchmark. In the case of the CEC benchmarks, our method is also compared against the top (population-based) algorithms that participated in respective competitions. The numerical results indicate that, compared to all the other lightweight algorithms under study, the proposed algorithm is better at handling most functions at different dimensionalities, especially in the case of non-separable problems.},

Many ensemble surrogates are built by combining a number of models that are trained based on different subsampled data, and these weak models without characteristics lack interpretation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive differential evolution based on a dual-scale surrogate ensemble model, termed DSEDE. The ensemble model consists of a fine scale surrogate model and a global scale surrogate model, which approximates fine landscape information and the overall trend landscape, respectively. Adaptive differential evolution is used to search for the global optimum of the offline surrogate model. Comparing four state-of-the-art offline data-driven optimization algorithms, the results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and effective in solving offline optimization problems.

  abstract     = {Maximum-entropy probability models (MEPMs) have been widely used to reveal the structure of genetic regulatory networks (GRNs). However, owing to the inherent network sparsity and small sample size, most of the existing MEPMs use convex optimization to approximate the inference of GRNs which tend to be trapped in less accurate local optimal solutions. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can help address this issue thanks to their superior global search capability, yet the conventional EA-based methods cannot handle the sparsity of GRNs efficiently. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-objective memetic algorithm in this study to infer the sparse GRNs with MEPMs. Particularly, the target inferring problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem where the maximum entropy and the constraints of the MEPM are formulated as two objectives. We employ Graphical LASSO (Glasso) to generate prior knowledge for population initialization. The genetic operators are adopted to ensure the diversity and sparsity of the inferred GRNs. Local search based on the spatial relations among solutions and different Glasso results in the decision space is incorporated into the algorithm to improve the search efficiency. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world data sets suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art GRN inferring methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

Surrogate-assisted mechanisms and parallel computing techniques are effective approaches to improving the search performance of evolutionary algorithms for these EOPs. However, the search efficiency of existing methods are limited by a combination of synchronization barriers and a failure to use heterogeneous computing resources fully. Therefore, we propose an efficient heterogeneous asynchronous parallel surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (HAS-EA). The proposed HAS-EA incorporates an improved asynchronous parallel evolutionary algorithm module on the CPU, a surrogate module on the GPU, and an improved asynchronous recommendation module on the CPU. By performing these operations in parallel on heterogeneous computing resources, the search performance can be accelerated. Test results of our proposed method with several benchmark problems and a real-world model calibration problem demonstrate that HAS-EA offers better performance than other recently published methods in solving EOPs.},

  abstract     = {Community structures are sets of nodes that are densely linked with each other, reflecting the functional modules of real-world systems. Most classical works for community detection (CD) are based on the optimization of an objective function, namely modularity. However, it has been recently demonstrated that there exists a resolution limit in the modularity optimization based CD methods, i.e., the communities cannot be detected if their scales are smaller than a certain threshold. To overcome this resolution limit, in this paper, we propose a decomposition based multiobjective memetic algorithm (called MDMCD) for multiresolution CD (MCD) in complex networks, aiming to detect communities at multiple resolution levels. MDMCD first models the MCD problem as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) with two contradictory objectives, namely the intra-link ratio and inter-link ratio. Then, it devises a multiobjective memetic optimization framework that combines a decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with a two-level local search to solve the modeled MOP. In this framework, the modeled MOP is first decomposed into a set of single-objective optimization subproblems, each of which corresponds to a CD problem in a certain resolution level. Subsequently, these subproblems are simultaneously optimized by the evolutionary operators and the local search, taking the network-specific knowledge into consideration. Finally, MDMCD returns a population of solutions in a single simulation run, reflecting the community divisions at multiple resolution levels. Experiments on both the simulated and real-world networks show the effectiveness of MDMCD in detecting multiresolution community structures.},

Moreover, the transit domain has a remarkable lack of intelligent systems to monitor and maintain better performance. Consequently, realizing an intelligent transit control system has become a consistent need. The modeling of the system addresses a problem of optimizing performance measures based on key performance indicators. Its objective is to find the optimal control action in disturbance cases. The solution consists in combining all performance measures in a single measure by using fuzzification without neglecting the space and time requirements of the traffic. To model and implement our system we used a multi-agent approach. The experiments performed were based on real network traffic data. The obtained results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed fuzzy approach in our optimization problem and show the advantage of the multi-agent system in the modeling of our control system. We prove that the proposed control system achieves better results than certain existing fuzzy approaches and is able to manage disturbances with a better performance than the existing solutions.},

However, such affine subspace greatly limits the sampling range of trail solutions, which will lead to the rapid loss of population diversity. To address this issue, an improved RM-MEDA with auto-controllable population diversity (RM-MEDA-AcPD) is suggested in this paper. In RM-MEDA-AcPD, the simplex crossover method is employed to extend the representation range of the affine subspace, the main purpose of which is to push solutions forward along the orthogonal direction of the affine subspace. In addition, a random noise model related to the evolution process is designed to replace the original Gaussian noise model, which reduces the risk of rapid loss of population diversity. In experimental studies, we have compared eight regularity property-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with the RM-MEDA-AcPD on benchmark problems with disconnected Pareto fronts. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of RM-MEDA-AcPD significantly outperforms the other nine comparison algorithms in solving these test instances.},

To solve this problem and ensure the effectiveness of knowledge transfer, this paper proposes a multiobjective evolutionary multitasking algorithm based on dual transfer learning with generative filtering model namely EMT–DLGM. Specifically, a dual transfer learning mechanism is proposed to reduce the difference between tasks and improve the efficiency of knowledge transfer through the global and local transfer strategies. Moreover, the generative filtering model is designed to generate promising solutions according to the multiple differential evolution operations and filtering model.
