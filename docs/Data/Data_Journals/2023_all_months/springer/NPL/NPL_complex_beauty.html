  abstract     = {Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR) is a well-known approach of manifold learning to transform the data from high to low dimensional space. After studying various techniques proposed for the NLDR, we find that performance improvement is still required. Therefore, we adopt classical Isomap, which reduces Shortest Path Distance (SPD) and high computational time cost problems. These problems are occurring due to the Dijkstra algorithm. This paper presents the A*-FastIsomap method for SPD issues, which is based on the A* Search Algorithm with the Double Buckets algorithm. We compared the A*-FastIsomap with classical Isomap to verify its better efficiency and results for high dimensional datasets with much higher accuracy. The outcome of our current study demonstrates that as compared to classical Isomap, our proposed A*-FastIsomap is faster and more accurate. Furthermore, our proposed method can reduce the computation time for high and large-dimensional datasets.},

  abstract     = {The fast advancement in machine translation models necessitates the development of accurate evaluation metrics that would allow researchers to track the progress in text languages. The evaluation of machine translation models is crucial since its results are exploited for improvements of translation models. However fully automatically evaluating the machine translation models in itself is a huge challenge for the researchers as human evaluation is very expensive, time-consuming, unreproducible. This paper presents a detailed classification and comprehensive survey on various fully automated evaluation metrics, which are used to assess the performance or quality of machine translated output. Various fully automatic evaluation metrics are classified into five categories that are lexical, character, semantic, syntactic, and semantic &amp; syntactic evaluation metrics for better understanding purpose. Taking account of the challenges posed in the field of machine translation evaluation by Statistical Machine Translation and Neural Machine Translation, along with a discussion on the advantages, disadvantages, and gaps for each fully automatic machine translation evaluation metric has been provided. The presented study will help machine translation researchers in quickly identifying automatic machine translation evaluation metrics that are most appropriate for the improvement or development of their machine translation model, as well as researchers in gaining a general understanding of how automatic machine translation evaluation research evolved.},

Such pilot symbols convey no information and, therefore, system throughput, spectral efficiency and transmit energy consumption are all penalized. In this article, we propose to acquire the CSI combining supervised and unsupervised algorithms. Our strategy avoids the periodical transmission of unnecessary pilots by using a simple decision criterion to determine the time instants when the performance obtained with an unsupervised algorithm degrades or, equivalently, the time instants when pilots are required. We show the performance of this scheme for MIMO systems with Decision Feedback Equalizers (DFE) at the receiver.},

Therefore, we propose a point cloud registration network based on convolution fusion and a new attention mechanism to obtain high-quality point pairs and improve the accuracy of registration. In this work, we first fuse kernel point convolution and adaptive point convolution by cross-attention mechanism as the feature extraction backbone of the network to obtain features. Secondly, we use transformer to exchange information between source and target point clouds, which consists of a new attention mechanism module, named ReSE-Attention. It obtains a global feature view by adding a squeeze extraction module and deep learnable parameters to the normal attention mechanism. And then, a regression decoder is adapted to generate the correct point pairs. Finally, we first introduce Focal Loss on the loss function in point cloud registration to balance the relationship between overlapping and non-overlapping regions. Our approach is evaluated on both the scene dataset 3DMatch and the object dataset ModelNet and achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Hand gesture recognition plays an important role in developing effective human–machine interfaces (HMIs) that enable direct communication between humans and machines. But in real-time scenarios, it is difficult to identify the correct hand gesture to control an application while moving the hands. To address this issue, in this work, a low-cost hand gesture recognition system based human-computer interface (HCI) is presented in real-time scenarios. The system consists of six stages: (1) hand detection, (2) gesture segmentation, (3) feature extraction and gesture classification using five pre-trained convolutional neural network models (CNN) and vision transformer (ViT), (4) building an interactive human–machine interface (HMI), (5) development of a gesture-controlled virtual mouse, (6) smoothing of virtual mouse pointer using of Kalman filter. In our work, five pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, and Inception-V1) and ViT have been employed to classify hand gesture images. Two multi-class datasets (one public and one custom) have been used to validate the models. Considering the model’s performances, it is observed that Inception-V1 has significantly shown a better classification performance compared to the other four CNN models and ViT in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values. We have also expanded this system to control some multimedia applications (such as VLC player, audio player, playing 2D Super-Mario-Bros game, etc.) with different customized gesture commands in real-time scenarios. The average speed of this system has reached 25 fps (frames per second), which meets the requirements for the real-time scenario. Performance of the proposed gesture control system obtained the average response time in milisecond for each control which makes it suitable for real-time. This model (prototype) will benefit physically disabled people interacting with desktops.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation(UDA) methods based on optimal transport have been successfully used to improve cross-domain classification performance. Optimal transport aligns the distribution of source domain and target domain by minimizing the transport cost. However, the existing works based on optimal transport ignore the class-structure prior information of domains and do not adequately reflect the real data distribution. It always leads to be difficult in distinguishing target instances near the decision boundary. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Attention-guided Optimal Transport (AOT) framework to achieve better domain adaptation. Concretely, first we introduce a weighted cost matrix based on the self-attention mechanism to reduce the bias caused by minibatch selection in training. It is realized by relating the prediction results in source and target domains. Meanwhile, a Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) regularization term is exploited to establish the mutual relationship between the feature space and the label space to achieve more reliable transport plan. Second, in order to enhance the discriminability of domain-invariant features using the class-structure prior, we also develop a pairwise metric learning strategy. It defines the positive/negative pairs by labels and enhances the class-structure prior by coupling feature and label similarities. Finally, we compare the proposed methods with ten SOTA approaches on multiple single source benchmarks and a multi-source benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that AOT achieves the best performance for classification tasks.},

Besides, by integrating algebraic inequality technologies, the fuzzy set theory and Lyapunov theory, a new finite/fixed-time theorem can be obtained for the drive-response system. Taking into account more complex Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional involving mode-dependent terms and double integral terms, is more closer to practical applications than those in the existing results.

In order to alleviate unnecessary network congestion in communication channels, the round-robin protocol is introduced to specify which network node has the right to access the network channel at each time step. In particular, the objective is to develop the time-varying state estimation method such that, in the presence of time-delay, randomly occurring sensor nonlinearity and round-robin protocol, the sufficient conditions are given and both the error variance boundedness and the pre-set $$H_{\infty }$$ performance index can be achieved simultaneously.

Moreover, we rigorously and systematically demonstrate the convergence rate of this convex iteration technique, shedding light on its reliability and effectiveness. Furthermore, we adopt a discrete statistical perspective to effectively tackle the challenges arising from the non-compactness of input data and the inherent unknowability of the objective function in practical settings, thereby enhancing the robustness and applicability of our research. To support our conclusions, we introduce two implementation algorithms, namely back propagation and random search. The latter algorithm plays a vital role in preventing the neural network from becoming entrapped in suboptimal local minima during the training process. Finally, we present comprehensive results obtained from a variety of regression problems, which not only serve as empirical evidence of the superior performance of our algorithms but also validate their alignment with our theoretical predictions.

In this study, we propose a black-box transferable adversarial attack method. The goal is to enhance the understanding of the vulnerability of these networks. Meanwhile, it could help develop more robust defenses against such attacks. This attack efficiently generates adversarial examples by manipulating the singular value matrix instead of directly perturbing pixels with complex noise. We utilize soft actor-critic to explore an optimal perturbation strategy. We perform extensive evaluations with VOC 2012, MS Coco 2017 datasets on object detection models, the MNIST dataset on image classification models, as well as the TT-100K dataset on a real-world case study to evaluate the proposed singular value manipulating attack (SVMA). Comparison results demonstrate that SVMA achieves a consistent query efficiency and attack ability on both one-stage detector Yolo and two-stage detector Faster R-CNN. Additionally, our case study demonstrates the adversarial examples of SVMA are effective in real-world scenarios. In the end, we propose a defense against such attacks.},

In addition, the activation function dividing method is utilized to make the result less conservative. Then, using Lyapunov stability theory, several sufficient criteria are obtained to ensure that the synchronization error system can achieve mean-square exponential stability and meet the specified passive performance under DoS attacks. Based on these criteria, the concrete form of controller gain is solved. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the rationality and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained image classification aims to recognize fine-grained objects, e.g., different bird species or plane types. However, most proposed methods rely on large-scale annotated data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, a branch of works propose to learn subtle feature embeddings from webly-annotated images, known as webly-supervised fine-grained recognition. Unfortunately, labels from web are often filled with a large number of noise, which severely hampers the learning of robust neural networks. The most common method at present is to discard high-loss noise samples and select small-loss instances for supervised training, but this selection method still contains a fraction of mislabelled hard samples, which seriously affects the final classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel Co-Training-based Label Correction method (CTLC) to identify noisy samples for robust network learning. Specifically, we train two networks simultaneously to divide images into clean data, in-distribution noisy data, and out-of-distribution data. We regard one’s prediction as the other’s pseudo label for the next step’s training. The out-of-distribution data are discarded and the in-distribution data are relabeled for training. To assure the reliability of re-labeling, a history-assistant in-distribution noise relabeling method is proposed, where cumulative prediction is used to update the labels of the in-distribution noise samples. Extensive experiments on three commonly used noisy fine-grained datasets (i.e., CUB200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, and Cars-196) show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

In order to further improve the sparsity of output weights and the robustness of the model, this paper proposes a sparse and robust ELM based on zero-norm regularization and a non-convex quadratic loss function. The zero-norm regularization obtains sparse hidden nodes automatically, and the introduced non-convex quadratic loss function enhances the robustness by setting constant penalties to outliers. The optimization problem can be formulated as the difference of convex functions (DC) programming. This DC programming is solved by using the DC algorithm (DCA) in this paper.

  abstract     = {In recent years, multivariate time series prediction has attracted extensive research interests. However, the dynamic changes of the spatial topology and the temporal evolution of multivariate variables bring great challenges to the spatio-temporal time series prediction. In this paper, a novel Dirichlet graph convolution module is introduced to automatically learn the spatio-temporal representation, and we combine graph attention (GAT) and neural differential equation (NDE) based on nonlinear state transition to model spatio-temporal state evolution of nonlinear systems. Specifically, the spatial topology is revealed by the cosine similarity of node embeddings. The use of multi-layer Dirichlet graph convolution aims to enhance the representation ability of the model while suppressing the phenomenon of over-smoothing or over-separation. The GCN and LSTM-based network is used as the nonlinear operator to model the evolution law of the dynamic system, and the GAT updates the strength of the connection. In addition, the Euler trapezoidal integral method is used to model the temporal dynamics and makes medium and long-term prediction in latent space from the perspective of nonlinear state transition. The proposed model can adaptively mine spatial correlations and discover spatio-temporal dynamic evolution patterns through the coupled NDE, which makes the modeling process more interpretable. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of spatio-temporal dynamic discovery on predictive performance.},

Secondly, an adaptive adjustment strategy of population division is incorporated to balance the global search and local exploitation capabilities of algorithm. Furthermore, To improve the convergence performance, the sinusoidal function is applied to update the explorer and vigilant. Finally, an adaptive perturbation strategy is proposed to assist the algorithm in escaping local optimal solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed improved strategy, 13 classical test functions and the CEC2017 test suite were selected to validate the performance of MSSSA. the Friedman test and Wilcoxon test results also verify the significance of the results, the effectiveness and convergence of the improved strategy. In addition, the improved algorithm was applied to predict the medium-term electricity load of the microgrid, and the parameters of the gated recurrent unit neural network were optimally predicted on two actual electricity load datasets.

  abstract     = {The precise segmentation of lesions can assist doctors to complete efficient disease diagnosis. Unet is widely used in the field of medical image segmentation due to its excellent feature fusion ability. However, the deep network based on Unet has poor ability to extract lesion features and insufficient segmentation accuracy. This is because the amount of medical image data is generally small, the lesion area is small, and Unet ignores the importance of different information. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a Unet-based attention network for accurate segmentation of liver CT images. Specifically, we first creatively design an attention mechanism module (DASGC) that pays attention to both multi-scale spatial information and inter-channel information at the same time, which can give more weight to important feature information and perform the feature information screening task well. Secondly, based on the advantages of DASGC’s efficient development of limited information, we masterly design an improved Unet network (DASGC-Unet) to solve the problem that the Unet network cannot effectively use less image information to complete accurate segmentation. Finally, on the LiTS2017 public dataset, our method achieves the best results on mIoU, IoU, and Dice coefficient compared to other advanced attention mechanism networks.},

Data heterogeneity is one of the major challenges faced by federated learning, which leading to lagged convergence and decreased accuracy of the global model. Moreover, existing personalized federated learning (PFL) methods suffer from limited personalization capabilities and slow model convergence. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Hypernetwork based layer-wise PFL algorithm, pFedLHN. The Hypernetwork located on the server is collaboratively trained by the clients to generate unique personalized models based on their local data distribution. Unlike previous PFL algorithms that focus on optimizing and personalizing the whole shared model, we implement layer-wise modules with parameter sharing mechanisms in the Hypernetwork. This approach allows the Hypernetwork to generate parameters independently for each layer of the client’s network, enabling the layer-wise modules to focus on learning the different utilities in the network. Consequently, this enhances the model’s personalized ability and training efficiency. We conducted several experiments on various PFL benchmark datasets, demonstrating that pFedLHN outperforms previous methods and has better generalization ability on clients that did not participate in the training phase.},

We propose progressive adversarial learning for solving single-source multi-target domain adaptation. Specifically, the model aligns every pair of source and target domains by self-training, obtains high-confidence pseudo labels, and constructs pseudo source domains accordingly. Next, each pseudo source domain and the remaining target domains subspace are efficiently aligned by combining adversarial and self-training methods to obtain additional structured source knowledge to derive the domain-invariant and discriminative representations.

The images in the area with both a lower intra-class richness and a higher degree of inter-class overlap can provide more image information for the neural network, thus further improve the model performance. Experiments on two public image classification datasets for image classification (CIFAR10 and mini-ImageNet) show that the proposed image information quality assessment method can effectively distinguish high information quality images. Under the same budget, selecting images with higher image information quality can achieve better performances than lower image information quality (Testing accuracy: 1.69% higher on CIFAR10, 2.11% higher on mini-ImageNet).},

This paper attempts to analyze the stability and bifurcation of neural networks with distributed delayed hyper-strong kernels. Firstly, considering the average delay as a bifurcation parameter, the study discusses the characteristic equations of delayed kernels with weak kernel, strong kernel and hyper-strong kernel to provide sufficient conditions for the stability and generation of Hopf bifurcation. Secondly, it applies the normal theory and the center manifold theory to derive the formulas for determining the stability and direction of the bifurcating periodic solution.

We propose a new weighted-dependency with attention-based graph convolutional network (WAGCN), which changed the dependency matrix from a 0–1 matrix to a weighted matrix by weighting each dependency class to enable the dependency matrix to fully express the syntactic dependency information in the sentence. Moreover, we improve the connection structure of the attention mechanism, densely connected network and GCN to extract important information by applying the attention mechanism directly to the text, and compute it in parallel with the dependency matrix GCN module. We conducted experiments on three popular datasets, WAGCN is superior to baseline models, such as C-AGGCN and LST-AGCN, in most experiment metrics.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks are widely used for solving engineering design problems of various disciplines due to its simplicity, efficiency, and adaptability. It predicts promising and accurate results. Artificial neural network solves these problems with weights and biases obtained in the training process. In training, the weights and biases have to be updated such that the difference between predicted and actual values has to be minimized. The artificial neural network uses stochastic gradient steepest descent methods to update the weights and biases for optimizing it. These methods are good at finding the optimum solution. However, they suffer from the drawbacks of vanishing gradient at local minima and critical points and are sensitive to initial weights and biases. As a result, it falls into local minima, the training time becomes high, and accuracy becomes low. One of the best solutions to overcome these problems is to use metaheuristics algorithms instead of stochastic gradient descent methods. Among metaheuristics, the cuckoo search algorithm is widely used in many applications due to its simplicity and efficiency. In this work, we proposed an improved Cuckoo search algorithm by incorporating Voronoi diagram with Cuckoo search to strengthen the weak areas of Cuckoo search and to overcome the addressed problems of the artificial neural network. The proposed Cuckoo search algorithm performance is tested on higher dimensional benchmark functions and on benchmark data sets. Moreover, its performance is compared with variants of Cuckoo search and other metaheuristic algorithms. The proposed algorithm has shown better results in terms of the number of generations, accuracy, cross-entropy, and root mean square error (RMSE).},

We propose a WSSS method based on local superpixel transformation that combines superpixel theory and image local information.

To improve enhancement performance, the Retinex model is incorporated with various prior constraints, which make the optimization process complicated and difficult. In this paper, a method of low-light enhancement with regularized Gaussian Fields (RGF) model is proposed to address this issue. Firstly, we construct an RGF-based optimization model to formulate simultaneous reflectance and illumination estimation as an unconstrained optimization problem. Therefore, Retinex decomposition in RGF model can be solved by gradient descent techniques and has superiority on computational convenience. Then, to suppress noise and preserve detail in the estimated reflectance, the detail-preserving model based on Gaussian total variation (GTV) is established. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons on several public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-arts in terms of enhancement efficiency and quality.},

It is possible to use aerial data to compute traversability maps for large regions and use them to assist in ground robot navigation. In the literature that concerns path planning from aerial images, we found two main approaches to generate traversability maps: terrain classification or heuristics to determine traversability. However, methods based on classification or handcrafted heuristics exhibit limitations with regard to the accuracy and precision of the traversability maps, quality of calculated paths and processing time. This work explores a new method to compute a traversability map from an aerial image in one forward pass through a fully convolutional neural network. The objective is to quickly generate good quality traversability maps for use in the path planning phase of navigation algorithms. We evaluate our proposal in comparison to other approaches available in the literature to demonstrate that it provides valuable information for a planner algorithm to compute safe and cost-efficient paths using only images.},

  abstract     = {Colonic polyps are highly correlated with colorectal cancer. Prevention of colorectal cancer is the detection and removal of polyps in the early stages of the disease. But the detection process relies on the physician’s experience and is prone to missed diagnoses. The drawbacks motivate us to design an algorithm to automatically assist physicians in detection to reduce the rate of missed polyps. However, polyp segmentation encounters challenges due to the variable appearance and blurred borders with the surrounding mucosa. And it is difficult for existing CNN-based polyp segmentation algorithms to learn long-range dependencies. Therefore, we propose a region-enhanced attention transformer network (RT-Net) for polyp segmentation. Unlike existing CNN-based approaches, it employs a pyramid Transformer encoder to promote the learning ability and robustness of the network. In addition, we introduce three modules, including the residual multiscale (RMS) module, the region-enhanced attention (REA) module and the feature aggregation (FA) module. Specifically, the RMS module learns multiscale information from the features of the encoder. The REA module adopts the prediction maps of each decoder layer to guide the network in building target regions and boundary cues to compensate for the missing local fields of view in the encoder. The role of the FA module is to efficiently aggregate the features from REA with those from the decoding layer to achieve better segmentation performance. RT-Net is evaluated on five benchmark polyp datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RT-Net exhibits excellent performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

First, Multiscale Self Attention convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for image inpainting and augmentation to fill missing or damaged areas and generate augmented images for training DL models. Second, Anisotropic Diffusion Filtering is used for speckle noise reduction, and the filter parameters are adapted to local noise characteristics using memory-based speckle statistics. Third, the CNN is trained to estimate local statistics of the speckle noise and adapt filtering parameters accordingly to capture local and global image features. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on a prenatal 5th-month ultrasound scan dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed preprocessing steps significantly improve the quality of ultrasound images and lead to better performance of DL models. The proposed preprocessing pipeline using Multiscale Self Attention CNN for image inpainting and augmentation, followed by Anisotropic Diffusion Filtering and memory-based speckle statistics for speckle noise reduction, can significantly enhance the quality of prenatal ultrasound images and enhance the accuracy of diagnostic models.

Specifically, the self-attention is used to extract image features and text features, the guided-attention is applied to obtain the correlation between each image area and the related question. To obtain the relative position relationship of different objects, position attention is further introduced to realize relationship correlation modeling and enhance the matching ability of multi-modal features. Given an image and a natural language question, the proposed MBGAN learns visual relation inference and question attention networks in parallel to achieve the fine-grained fusion of the visual features and the textual features, then the final answers can be obtained accurately through model stacking. MBGAN achieves 69.41% overall accuracy on the VQA-v1 dataset, 70.79% overall accuracy on the VQA-v2 dataset, and 68.79% overall accuracy on the COCO-QA dataset, which shows that the proposed MBGAN outperforms most of the state-of-the-art models.},

Transformers are the new backbone of computer vision due to their powerful ability to extract global features, which is supported by pre-training on extensive amounts of data. However, it is challenging to collect a large number of high-quality labeled images for the pre-training phase. Therefore, this paper proposes a classification network (CofaNet) that combines CNNs and transformer-based fused attention to address the limitations of transformers without pre-training, such as low accuracy. CofaNet introduces patch sequence dimension attention to capture the relationship among subsequences and incorporates it into self-attention to construct a new attention feature extraction layer. Then, a residual convolution block is used instead of multi-layer perception after the fusion attention layer to compensate for the limited feature extraction of the attention layer on small datasets. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that CofaNet achieves excellent classification accuracy when compared to some transformer-based networks without pre-traning.},

  abstract     = {Amidst of all the tumors, breast tumor is the main source for a high incidence mortality rate among women. In the past decades, this mortality rate has tremendously reduced by early detection and diagnosis of the tumors using different modalities. Mammograms have significantly contributed towards the detection of masses and calcifications which assists radiologists in decision making. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, several breast mass segmentation methods are devised to assists radiologists in detection of tumor masses and lesions. UNet and its variants are widely used deep learning techniques for mass segmentation in mammograms. Although, UNet exhibits an outstanding performance, it has certain limitations, where the extraction of the fine-grained features is still resilient. In this paper, a AU $$^{2}$$ Net is proposed where two UNets are cascaded and are connected through skip connections. The attention mechanism and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) are introduced to learn more contextual based features for an enhanced tumor segmentation. The proposed model is validated on Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM). The images are preprocessed and are augmented using conventional and deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network based approaches. The proposed method achieved a 92.3% dice score and 89.6% Intersection over Union (IoU) on CBIS-DDSM dataset.},

However, existing methods do not make full use of scale-space features, resulting in the restoration of high-resolution image details being blurred. In order to address this issue, the Dense-Gated Network is proposed for SISR, called DGISR, which consists of two essential blocks: Pyramid Multi-scale Extraction Block (PMEB) and Gated Attention Distillation Block (GADB). The proposed PMEB allows capturing and integrating more complex features through pyramid pooling and multi-scale operation to enhance the modeling capability of the network. The proposed GADB can extract key regions of images and reduce data redundancy, while improving the convergence of the model. The proposed DGISR outperforms other methods in visual quality and quantitative metrics on the standard benchmark datasets, as demonstrated by experimental results. Our overall method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is mainly used for detecting and tracking the object on multi-cameras, which is widely applied in intelligent video surveillance and intelligent security. The process of MOT generally involves three import parts: feature extracting, multi-task learning and object matching. Unfortunately, the existed methods still have some drawbacks. Firstly, the feature extracting module cannot effectively fuse the shallow and deep features. What’s more, the multi-task learning module cannot strike a good balance between the detection and re-identification. In addition, the object matching module associates with pedestrian by using a traditional method rather than training a model. For these problems, we propose a method of joint detection and association (JDA) for end-to-end multi-object tracking network, which involves the multi-scale feature extraction and the learnable object association. It first combines a feature extraction backbone based on multi-scale feature fusion and a point-based multi-task object detection branch, to solve the task of feature extraction and object detection. Then, a learnable object motion association module is embedded, which uses the historical frames information to infer the position of the object, and associate the object identity between previous frames and subsequent frames. In addition, the JDA can be end-to-end trained when handling the detection and matching tasks. The proposed JDA is evaluated through a series of experiments on MOT16 and MOT17. The results shows that JDA the existing methods in terms of precision and stability of MOT.},

In this paper, we propose a gated residual and gated convolution network (GRGCN) to deal with super-resolution reconstruction. Gated residual (GR) and gated convolution (GC) are the products of introducing attention mechanism (AM) into deep neural network. Specifically, GR enables the network to focus on more important residual channel information and GC allows the network to pay attention on more important feature extraction regions. Meanwhile, we propose multi-level residual connection, which includes long connection, secondary connection and short connection. Three different levels of residual connection correspond to three scales of feature extraction module, namely residual cluster, residual group and residual block. By fusing the feature information on different scales, the convolution layer can efficiently extract the feature information. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRGCN has better performance and visual effects than state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we propose a method based on spatio-temporal fusion network by combining temporal and spatial information. The method improves the performance of gait recognition under clothing change and view change. Frame difference color energy image (FDCEI) is proposed in this paper to extract the temporal information in the gait sequence, which complements the gait entropy image (GEnI). A two-branch network is used to process the energy image information, in which the temporal branch network processes the temporal information in FDCEI and the spatial branch network processes the spatial information in GEnI. Another contribution is that a Balanced spatio-temporal feature module (BSTFM) has been proposed, which integrates spatio-temporal information. The experimental performances indicate that our proposed methods contribute to increasing the robustness of gait recognition in external environments with view variances and clothes changes.},

Compared with general CDNs, the proposed discrete-time CDNs with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and bit-rate constraints is considered, which is more consistent with the actual digital communication network. First, a complete encoding and decoding step based on the uniform quantizer is introduced. And more importantly, DoS attacks, whose duration and frequency duration are described by average dwell-time constraints, are considered in such steps, which clearly analyzes attacks influence on codeword string. In order to avoid encoding and decoding failure caused by unbounded encoding region, the attack is limited to a certain range, and the sufficient conditions for bounded encoding region are obtained. Second, in order to overcome the uncertainty of errors between encoded data and decoded data, sufficient conditions for decoding error convergence are obtained, which makes it possible to analyze the FNT cluster synchronization of CDNs based on the encoding decoding communication mechanism. Third, by Lyapunov stability theory, the synchronization controller is obtained to ensure that the nodes in the cluster are consistent, and the relationship between the upper bound of decoding error (UBDE) and the available bit rate is revealed. Finally, a simulation example shows that the bit-rate allocation protocol can reduce the UBDE and the time required for synchronization.},

While much attention has been paid to improvements in utility, privacy leakage and social bias are two major concerns arising in trained models. In this paper, we address both privacy protection and gender bias mitigation in classification models simultaneously. We first introduce a selective privacy-preserving method that obscures individuals’ sensitive information by adding noise to word embeddings. Then, we propose a negative multi-task learning framework to mitigate gender bias, which involves a main task and a gender prediction task. The main task employs a positive loss constraint for utility assurance, while the gender prediction task utilizes a negative loss constraint to remove gender-specific features. We have analyzed four existing word embeddings and evaluated them for sentiment analysis and medical text classification tasks within the proposed negative multi-task learning framework. For instances, RoBERTa achieves the best performance with an average accuracy of 95% for both negative and positive sentiment, with 1.1 disparity score and 1.6 disparity score respectively, and GloVe achieves the best average accuracy of 96.42% with a 0.28 disparity score for the medical task.

  abstract     = {Human action recognition based on still images is one of the most challenging computer vision tasks. In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have developed rapidly and achieved good performance in human action recognition tasks based on still images. Due to the absence of the remote perception ability of CNNs, it is challenging to have a global structural understanding of human behavior and the overall relationship between the behavior and the environment. Recently, transformer-based models have been making a splash in computer vision, even reaching SOTA in several vision tasks. We explore the transformer’s capability in human action recognition based on still images and add a simple but effective feature fusion module based on the Swin-Transformer model. More specifically, we propose a new transformer-based model for behavioral feature extraction that uses a pre-trained Swin-Transformer as the backbone network. Swin-Transformer’s distinctive hierarchical structure, combined with the feature fusion module, is used to extract and fuse multi-scale behavioral information. Extensive experiments were conducted on five still image-based human action recognition datasets, including the Li’s action dataset, the Stanford-40 dataset, the PPMI-24 dataset, the AUC-V1 dataset, and the AUC-V2 dataset. Results indicate that our proposed Swin-Fusion model achieves better behavior recognition than previously improved CNN-based models by sharing and reusing feature maps of different scales at multiple stages, without modifying the original backbone training method and with only increasing training resources by 1.6%.

  abstract     = {Due to the scarcity of nighttime semantic segmentation datasets and the high demand for network models, the development of semantic segmentation of nighttime scenes is still very slow. This paper proposes a new network model, ContourNet, which can model multi-level features. In addition, a separate contour network module is designed to accurately predict object contours, improving performance for objects far away, small, or with high contour continuity. A large number of experiments demonstrate that the ContourNet proposed in this paper can significantly improve the semantic segmentation ability of existing models for nighttime images, and can also improve the semantic segmentation accuracy of daytime images to a certain extent, with good generalization abilities. Specifically, after adding the contour module in this article, MIoU has increased by 5.1% on the night dataset Rebecca; MIoU has increased by 2.5% on the daytime dataset CamVid.},

  abstract     = {RGB and Thermal (RGBT) tracking is an important supplement of visual object tracking for its’ unique practical and research value. However, due to the limitations of the RGBT camera, extra interferences are introduced in the data synchronously. Removing or alleviating these interferences is a crucial direction to improve the performance of the RGBT tracking task. For this problem, we propose the multi-stage matching guidance and context integration network (M2GCI) for RGBT tracking. M2GCI reorganizes the feature-encoding pipeline into two context-integrating stages that are responsible for processing primary and senior information respectively. Firstly, the primary features encoded from primary encoders are integrated by the spatially adaptive fusion strategy. Next, the senior encoders cooperating with axial external-attention redistribution strategy further extract senior features which are more reliable for target prediction. Extensive experiments on the RGBT234 and GTOT provide that the proposed M2GCI can achieve more precision and robust tracking under some difficult scenarios compared with the excellent methods.},

Recently, recommender systems using reviews instead of rating matrix enhance the recommendation quality by extracting the user preferences and item characteristics from the reviews. Some deep learning methods such as the attention mechanisms are used in these models to judge the review usefulness. However, these approaches rely on the historical data and do not perform well on the unseen reviews. In addition, the existing models ignore the sequential information embedded in the item reviews. In this work, we propose a deep learning model called review-based recommender with attentive properties (RRAP), which combines the review properties and sequential information to mitigate the problems in the traditional recommender systems. We perform experiments to compare the performance of the proposed recommender system with other recommender systems presented in the literature by using Amazon’s four publicly available datasets. We use mean square error as an evaluation metric. The results show that the proposed RRAP reduces the prediction error and improves the interpretability of the model to a certain extent.},

Most of the existing intent recognition research is limited to simple, direct, and explicit intent recognitions.

Therefore, the implicit intent recognition brings new research challenges in this field. This paper pioneers a Chinese Implicit Intent Dataset (CIID), which covers seven common intents from different fields, and the data is the text containing the user’s implicit intent. Based on this corpus, it is the first-time the prompt learning is employed for implicit intent recognition and by constructing a suitable prompt template so that the model can get “relevant hints” to dig out the true intention of the user. We also evaluate a range of classification models on CIID dataset in this study. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art recognition accuracy.

To address these issues, we propose an image denoising network based on subband information sharing using dual-tree complex wavelet. This network combines the spatial and transform domains through dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) to capture both spatially structured features and time-frequency localized features for enriching the feature space. To strengthen the recovery in hard scenes, such as weak textures and high-frequency details, Subband Information Sharing Unit (SISU) is designed for the interplay of information in the transform domain, establishing the complementarity and correlation among the subbands obtained by DTCWT. Moreover, rectified linear units and exponential linear units are used in the spatial and transform domains, respectively, to match the properties of elements in different domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the powerful recovery capability of the network for both textured and smooth regions, as well as the competitive results of the network in non-blind/blind image denoising.},

  abstract     = {Based on the network structure and training methods of extreme learning machines, extreme learning machine combining hidden-layer feature weighting and batch training (ELM-WB) is proposed to make full use of representation-level features for object images and human action videos classification. To solve the problem of insufficient fusion of multiple representation-level features in most classification methods, a double hidden layer structure in which the input layer and the second hidden layer are directly connected is designed. A loop training method of weighting coefficients and output weights is proposed based on the advantages of this structure. The proposed network structure and training method are combined to construct an extreme learning machine combining hidden-layer feature weighting (ELM-W), which can effectively fuse representation-level features to enhance the classification ability of representation-level features. On this basis, the principle of online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) is introduced to update the loop training formula of the two weights to reduce the memory consumption during the operation of the overall algorithm. ELM-WB is proposed by combining the loop training formula of two weight matrices with batch training. In order to test the feasibility of ELM-WB, experiments are conducted on Caltech 101, MSRC, UCF11 and UCF101 databases. Experimental results prove that the proposed ELM-WB can improve classification accuracy by fusing representation-level features. At the same time, ELM-WB can be used to perform classification tasks on databases of any size in a general-purpose computer without specific hardware.},

Moreover, these variables may also be in direct conflict and can only be resolved by the optimum development of software by using reliable software engineering strategies. In this paper, a novel method based on the integration of the mine blast algorithm (MBA) and the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is used to create input connection weights and biases for a back propagation neural network (BPNN) for the purpose of addressing the software fault prediction problem (SFP). The aim of hybridizing the MBA and SA is to find a way to efficiently explore and manipulate the search space. The proposed MBA-SA was tested on 18 datasets for SFP. The results indicated that the MBA-SA outperformed the MBA on all datasets. These results were subjected to additional statistical validity, boxplot distribution, and convergence analysis. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation of MBA-SA against twenty state-of-the-art methods for various output metrics was performed, and the result indicated that the hybrid MBA-SA outperformed most other state-of-the-art methods in the majority of datasets.},

However, as a primary geometric cue, edge information, which captures the structures of scenes well, is ignored by the existing multi-view stereo networks. To this end, we present an Edge-aware Spatial Propagation Network, named ESPDepth, a novel depth estimation network that utilizes edges to assist in the understanding of scene structures. To be exact, we first generate a coarse initial depth map with a shallow network. Then we design an Edge Information Encoding (EIE) module, to encode edge-aware features from the initial depth. Subsequently, we apply the proposed Edge-Aware spatial Propagation (EAP) module, to guide the iterative propagation on cost volumes. Finally, the edge optimized cost volumes are utilized to obtain the final depth map, serving as a refinement process. By introducing the edge information in the propagation of cost volumes, the proposed method performs well when capturing geometric shapes, thus alleviating the negative effects of the greatly changed depth on edges of real scenes. Experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes datasets demonstrate our method produces precise depth estimation, gaining improvements both on global structures and detailed regions.},

Additionally, the method proposed to extract concept representatives in SENN is ambiguous, and the concepts are not easily distinguishable. By focusing more on interpretability, we improved this model by (i) making the inherent concepts disentangled using the Wasserstein variant of the total correlation so that the concepts are more transparent to users, (ii) introducing new activation functions and regularization to ensure that the inherent concepts and explaining parameters play their roles properly and give validity to the method of choosing representatives, and (iii) experimentally showing that the choice of activation functions is important when training the SENN.},

Keystroke gratitude is one of the branches of biometrics that is considered to support regular passwords which mainly used for continuous authentication scenarios like online examination and military intelligence.

We propose a novel multi-objective swarm optimization algorithm to select optimal features among multiple features of keystrokes. We extract different soft biometric features such as age, color, gender, weight, height and race from the users. We illustrate an optimal Cat induced whale optimization algorithm to fuse the optimal weight features of multiple biometric responses.

However, the performance of this kind of detection is not currently good enough. In the paper, we proposed a novel method, called window-adjusted common spatial pattern (WACSP), for detecting ErrP in P300 BCI. In this method, the coefficient of determination was introduced to measure the difference of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals on a channel at a moment and to guide the search of time windows in which EEG differences are significant, and common spatial pattern (CSP) was further used to capture the stable spatial patterns of EEG differences between correct and incorrect responses in each time window. WACSP and the commonly used methods were tested on the data sets that were built using the EEG signals acquired during the P300 BCI experiments with different feedback. The comparisons of accuracy, area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and F-measure show that WACSP significantly outperforms the commonly used methods. The proposed method can improve ErrP detection based on a single trial.},

The current research has placed more emphasis on learning new categories, while another common but under-explored incremental scenario is the updating and refinement of category labels. In this paper, we present the Hierarchical Task-Incremental Learning (HTIL) problem, which emulates the human cognitive process of progressing from coarse to fine. While the model learns the fine categories, it gains a better understanding of the perception of coarse categories, thereby enhancing its ability to differentiate between previously encountered classes. Inspired by neural collapse, we propose to initialize the coarse class prototypes and update the new fine class using hierarchical relations. We conduct experiments on diverse hierarchical data benchmarks, and the experiment results show our method achieves excellent results.},

Desired output spike trains are often used as supervised signals to control the synaptic strength adjustment of neurons for precise emission. The goal of supervised learning is also to allow spiking neurons to enter the desired running and firing state. The running process of a spiking neuron is a continuous process, but because of absolute refractory periods, it is regarded as several running segments. Based on the segmental characteristic, a new supervised learning strategy for spiking neurons is proposed to expand the action mode of supervised signals in supervised learning. Desired output spikes are used to actively regulate the running segments and make them more efficient in achieving the desired running and firing state. Supervised signals actively regulate the running process of neurons and are more comprehensively involved in the learning process than simply participating in adjusting synaptic weights. Based on two weight adjustment mechanisms of spiking neurons, two new specific supervised learning methods are proposed. The experimental results obtained using various settings indicate that the two learning methods have higher learning performance, which indicates the effectiveness of the new learning strategy.},

The imbalance of data raises the need to effectively distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviour in foreground targets. In the current state of research, the focus of many researchers has been on predictions closer to acquisition, but this need to effectively distinguish between normal and abnormal has received little attention. To address this problem, we propose a spatio-temporal enhancement network, a prediction-based unsupervised learning approach to video anomaly detection. In order to capture similar properties between foreground targets, we design the correlation enhancement module, which aims to quantify the spatial information of normal foreground targets. The temporal information enhancement module is also designed to stabilise the temporal information of normal foreground targets to reduce the effect of background variation and improve the robustness of the network structure. To clarify the boundary between normal and abnormal targets, a poorer substitution is represents the abnormal target feature vector, a superior substitution is represents the normal target feature vector. In this way, to obtain a clear and accurate locus of the abnormal occurrence time. We have extensively test on the UCSD Ped1, UCSD Ped2, and Avenue datasets and obtained desirable average AUC metrics of 82.7, 97.6, and 89.6, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Studies on graph contrastive learning, which is an effective way of self-supervision, have achieved excellent experimental performance. Most existing methods generate two augmented views, and then perform feature learning on the two views through maximizing semantic consistency. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to generate optimal views to facilitate the graph construction that can reveal the essential association relations among nodes by graph contrastive learning. Considering that the extremely high mutual information between views is prone to have a negative effect on model training, a good choice is to add constraints to the graph data augmentation process. This paper proposes two constraint principles, low dissimilarity priority (LDP) and mutual exclusion (ME), to mitigate the mutual information between views and compress redundant parts of mutual information between views. LDP principle aims to reduce the mutual information between views at global scale, and ME principle works to reduce the mutual information at local scale. They are opposite and appropriate in different situations. Without loss of generality, the two proposed principles are applied to two well-performed graph contrastive methods, i.e. GraphCL and GCA, and experimental results on 20 public benchmark datasets show that the models with the aid of the two proposed constraint principles achieve higher recognition accuracy.},

For classification problems, it is typical to utilize fully connected layers as the network head. These dense layers used in such architectures have always remained the same – they use a linear transformation function that is a sum of the product of output vectors with weight vectors, and a trainable linear bias. In this study, we explore a different mechanism for the computation of a neuron’s output. By adding a new feature, involving a product of higher order output vectors with their respective weight vectors, we transform the conventional linear function to higher order functions, involving powers over two. We compare and analyze the results obtained from six different transformation functions in terms of training and validation accuracies, on a custom neural network architecture, and with two benchmark datasets for image classification (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). While the dense layers perform better in all epochs with the new functions, the best performance is observed with a quadratic transformation function. Although the final accuracy achieved by the existing and new models remain the same, initial convergence to higher accuracies is always much faster in the proposed approach, thus significantly reducing the computational time and the computational resources required. This model can improve the performance of every DL architecture that uses a dense layer, with remarkably higher improvement in larger architectures that incorporate a very high number of parameters and output classes.},

Many improved sampling methods have been proposed to address this issue. In our work, we propose an edge-detection guided balanced sampling (EBS) method that introduces edge and contour information from objects to guide the sampling of candidate negative samples and increase the number of hard negative samples to improve sample balance. The EBS method employs a Gaussian filter convolution on the binary image in HSV space to reduce local corner information, and furtherly applies K-means++ clustering to the bounding boxes to reduce redundancy. In the hard negative sample sampling stage of anchor-based detection algorithms, the EBS model selects negative samples with higher IoU values with GT from both the normal candidate negative sample set and the special candidate negative sample set. The latter set contains more hard negative samples, which further improves the sample balance. We conducted comparison experiments using random sampling (RS) and IoU-balanced sampling (IBS) in the RPN network on MSCOCO-2017. Our EBS method achieved a 1.7-point higher higher $$AR_{1000}$$ than PRN. In particular, the proposed algorithm performs better on the small-target dataset, which achieves 2.4-point higher $$AR_{S}$$ than RPN. The inference fps of RPN and EBS are 22.3 and 22.4, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) image segmentation has received more and more attention in recent years. Domain adaptive methods can align the features of data in different domains, so that segmentation models can be migrated to data in other domains without incurring additional labeling costs. The traditional adversarial training uses the global alignment strategy to align the feature space, which may cause some categories to be incorrectly mapped. At the same time, in high-spatial resolution remote sensing images (RSI), the same category from different scenes (such as urban and rural areas) may have completely different distributions, which severely limits the accuracy of UDA. In order to solve these problems, in this paper: (1) a multi-level adversarial network at category-level is proposed, aiming at integrating feature information in different dimensions, studying the joint distribution at category-level, and aligning each category with adaptive adversarial loss in different dimensional spaces. (2) Use covariance regularization to optimize self-training. A method combining self-training with adversarial training is proposed, optimizes the domain adaptation effect, reduces the negative impact of false pseudo-label iteration caused by self-training. We demonstrated the latest performance of semantic segmentation on challenging LoveDA datasets. Experiments on “urban-to-rural” and “rural-to-urban” show that our method has better performance than the most advanced methods.},

  abstract     = {The extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is advantageous to regression modeling owing to its simple structure, fast computation, and good generalization performance. However, the existing ELM algorithm uses an $$l_{2}$$ -norm loss function, which is sensitive to outliers and has low robustness. In addition, some existing robust loss functions are not sufficiently flexible to accurately estimate the relationship between sample points and loss values, resulting in unsatisfactory ELM performance. To address these problems, this study established a robust ELM (ALFELM) algorithm. First, an adaptive loss function with two tunable hyperparameters was introduced; the function can be transformed into several robust loss functions by varying the parameters. It overcomes the limitations of fixed robust loss functions. Then, the Bayesian optimization strategy was used to determine the optimal parameters of the loss function. Furthermore, the classical iterative reweighted least squares method was used to solve for output weights, with a weight function corresponding to the loss function and a regularization parameter to prevent overfitting. Finally, the proposed method was tested using several artificial and benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness was verified for a real engineering case. The results indicated that the proposed ALFELM algorithm is more robust and accurate compared with other methods, especially for a large number of outliers. In addition, the algorithm can be used to establish effective regression models for actual processes.},

The output of the RBFNN is a linear combination of the outputs from the hidden layer. This paper present a Mixed Radial Basis Function Neural Network (MRBFNN) training using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The choice of the type of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) utilized in each hidden layer neuron has a significant impact on convergence, interpolation and performance. In this work, the authors are introducing a new approach to optimizing the choice of radial basis functions, centers, radius and weights of the output layer. We model in terms of mixed-variable optimization problems with linear constraints. To solve this model we will use an approach based on the genetic algorithm, allows us to determine the types of RBF to use in the hidden layer and the optimal weight of the output layer which gives us a good generalization. The results numerically demonstrate the performance of the theoretic results presented in this paper, as well as the benefits of the new modeling.},

Most existing data-free quantization methods cause severe performance degradation due to inaccurate activation clipping range and quantization error. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective data-free quantization method with accurate activation clipping and adaptive batch normalization. Accurate activation clipping (AAC) improves the model accuracy by exploiting accurate activation information from the full-precision model. Adaptive batch normalization (ABN) firstly proposes to address the quantization error from distribution changes by updating the batch normalization layer adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed data-free quantization method can yield surprising performance, achieving 64.33% top-1 accuracy of 4-bit ResNet18 on ImageNet dataset, with 3.7% absolute improvement outperforming the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

By harnessing the power of convolutional neural networks, significant progress has been made in recovering 3D face shapes from single images using the 3D Morphable Model approach. However, training neural networks typically requires a large amount of data, while face images with ground-truth 3D face shapes are scarce. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for accurate 3D face reconstruction from a single image. Our key idea is to process the images generated by a differentiable renderer and leverage the advantages of Generative Adversarial Networks to train a powerful neural renderer that produces highly realistic face images resembling the input image. We then modify traditional fitting methods to exploit the advantages of the neural renderer in finding optimal face parameters for improved 3D face reconstruction. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating more accurate 3D face reconstruction results.},

To address this issue, an improved competitive swarm optimizer with super-particle-leading is proposed in this paper. First, the super particle obtained by the cumulative learning strategy is used to provide a promising evolution direction for the population. Next, the weight-based dynamic omnidirectional strategy is employed to enhance the population exploration ability.

Therefore, how to adopt attention information in CAMs to improve the performance of fully-supervised object detection is an interesting problem. In this paper, we propose CAM R-CNN to deal with object detection, in which the category-aware attention maps provided by CAMs are integrated into the process of object detection. CAM R-CNN follows the common pipeline of the recent query-based object detectors in an end-to-end fashion, while two key CAM modules are embedded into the process. Specifically, E-CAM module provides embedding-level attention via fusing proposal features and attention information in CAMs with a transformer encoder, and S-CAM module supplies spatial-level attention by multiplying feature maps with the top-activated attention map provided by CAMs. In our experiments, CAM R-CNN demonstrates its superiority compared to several strong baselines on the challenging COCO dataset. Furthermore, we show that S-CAM module can be applied to two-stage detectors such as Faster R-CNN and Cascade R-CNN with consistent gains.},

  abstract     = {Segmentation and classification of breast tumors in ultrasound (US) images is an important application to deep neural networks. Unet architecture is recently developed for image segmentation. However, the standard convolution used in the Unet architecture can lead to problems such as loss of information, capturing irrelevant features, and failing to accurately localize the boundary of the segmented parts in an image. Additionally, the model involves a large number of parameters, leading to high computational time. This work proposes a novel deep-learning method called EfficientU-Net for breast tumor segmentation in ultrasound (US) images. The method addresses the above challenges by integrating a modified EfficientNet with an atrous convolution (AC) block in the encoder part of the Unet model. The EfficientNet uses depth-wise separable convolution to minimize training parameters and capture relevant texture features to localize the tumor boundary accurately. The AC block handles the diversity in the shape and size of tumors. The classification network based on the pre-trained CNN architecture and fine-tuned using a custom neural network is developed. The classification network is used to classify the generated masks into benign, malignant, and normal classes. The performance of the proposed method is tested on two publicly available US image datasets, BUSI and dataset-B. The proposed method demonstrates a reduction in the number of parameters, a decrease in computational complexity, and a hike in inference speed while achieving superior performance in terms of segmentation and classification metrics.},

Accuracy is the most important and at the same time is the most challenging feature of modeling and forecasting approaches that considerable efforts have been made in the literature for improving it. However, despite all interminable endeavors done in this regard, improving accuracy is yet often a problematic task. Weighting are among the most fundamental and critical parts of modeling and forecasting approaches, which have a significant impact on the performance and accuracy. Nevertheless, despite of the substantial importance of weighting algorithms, they have not been appropriately/comprehensively investigated in the literature. This fact that there are no such comprehensive review papers in this field is the core literature gap of modelling and forecasting that construct the main contribution of this paper. In this way, the main core objective of this paper is to comprehensively review and classify the most frequently applied weighting algorithms in various modeling and forecasting approaches. Motivated by this goal, in this review paper, different weighting algorithms, commonly used in the modelling and forecasting field, are classified based on the type of their function (i.e., Continuous/Discrete and Static/Dynamic) into four main categories. After that, the most related works done in these categorizes, including (1) discrete and static, (2) discrete and dynamic, (3) continuous and static, and (4) continuous and dynamic, are systematically reviewed to offer practical as well as theoretical guides for researchers. For this purpose, in each category, the most popular weighting algorithms, their potential limitations, and some highlighted advantages/disadvantages of them are briefly discussed. The weighting reviewed works, investigated in this paper, totally contain 350 paper that have been published since 2016 up to 2020. This is the first study that provides a comprehensive overview of the most frequently used weighting approaches employed in modeling and forecasting. The deep analysis and classification represented in this review paper revealed that the modeling and forecasting methods come from a unique unit which is named the weighting approach.},

Traditional heuristic algorithms for source localization that utilize wind information to guide the robots to search for plumes in the airflow environment, substantial potential plume information is not fully considered, reducing the success rate and precision of source localization. To solve this problem, in this study, we propose a novel strategy for plume source localization using information gain. This strategy is inspired by the navigation and foraging behaviors of the salps in the ocean, and the robots use a mutation random salp swarm algorithm to track the plume. This strategy utilizes the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model to color the plume information and achieve a dynamic update of the plume information distribution. Therefore, this developed strategy provides potential source location clues for the robots, dynamically adjusting the robots’ search behaviors and enhancing the source-seeking success rate and efficiency. This strategy is verified by experimental validations. The test results show that with two methods that use wind information, namely, the improved whale optimization algorithm and wind utilization II particle swarm optimization, and two approaches independent of wind information, namely, the fixed-step fruit fly optimization algorithm and improved particle swarm optimization, the proposed strategy improves the source localization success rate by 5% to 33% and accelerates the efficiency by 0.1 to 2.6 times in the obstacle-free scenario, and improves the source localization success rate by 4% to 100% and accelerates the efficiency by 0.4 to 2.2 times in the obstacle environment.},

The objective of this controller is to force the vehicle to track a desired reference, ensuring safe driving conditions in the case of adhesion loss during hazardous maneuvers. To this aim, a nonlinear discrete-time inverse optimal control based on a neural network identification is designed, using a recurrent high order neural network (RHONN) trained by an Extended Kalman Filter. The RHONN ensures stability of the identification error, while the controller ensures the stability of the tracking errors. Moreover, a discrete-time reduced order state observer is utilized to reconstruct the lateral vehicle dynamic not usually available. For the control problem, the references of the lateral velocity and yaw rate are given by a dynamic system mimicking an ideal vehicle having not-decreasing tire lateral characteristics. The proposed approach avoids the identification of the Pacejka’s lateral parameters of the tires, so simplifying the input control determination. Moreover, an optimal control is proposed to optimize the actuator effort and power, usually bounded. Control gains are determined using optimal “nature-inspired&quot; algorithms such as particle swarm optimization. Test maneuvers, performed through the full vehicle simulator CarSim®, have been used to test correctness, quality and performances of the observer, the neural identifier and the inverse optimal controller. Robustness of the reduced order discrete-time state observer is also discussed for different sample times.

The choice of parameters and architecture in reservoir computing, on the other hand, frequently leads to an optimization task. This paper attempts to present an overview of the related work on echo state network (ESN) and deep echo state network (DeepESN) optimization and to collect research papers through a systematic literature review (SLR). This review covers 129 items published from 2004 to 2022 that are concerned with the issue of our focus. The collected papers are selected, analysed and discussed. The results indicate that there are two techniques of parameters optimization (bio-inspired and non-bio-inspired methods) have been extensively used for various reasons. But Different models employ bio-inspired methods for optimizing in a variety of fields. The potential use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) has also been noted. A significant portion of the research done in this field focuses on the study of reservoirs and how they behave in relation to their unique qualities. In order to test reservoirs with varied parameters, topologies, or training techniques, NARMA, the Mackey glass, and Lorenz time-series prediction dataset are the most commonly employed in the literature. This review debate diverse point of view about ESN&#39;s hyper-parameter optimization, metrics, time series benchmarks, real word applications, evaluation measures, and bio-inspired and non-bio-inspired techniques, this paper identifies and explores a number of research gaps.},

Dynamic objects become the most hard problems in inter-frame-supervised depth estimates due to the uncertainty in adjacent frames. Thus, integrating optical flow information with depth estimation is a feasible solution, as the optical flow is an essential motion representation. In this work, we construct a joint inter-frame-supervised depth and optical flow estimation framework, which predicts depths in various motions by minimizing pixel wrap errors in bilateral photometric re-projections and optical vectors. For motion segmentation, we adaptively segment the preliminary estimated optical flow map with large areas of connectivity. In self-supervised depth estimation, different motion regions are predicted independently and then composite into a complete depth. Further, the pose and depth estimations re-synthesize the optical flow maps, serving to compute reconstruction errors with the preliminary predictions. Our proposed joint depth and optical flow estimation outperforms existing depth estimators on the KITTI Depth dataset, both with and without Cityscapes pretraining. Additionally, our optical flow results demonstrate competitive performance on the KITTI Flow 2015 dataset.},

To address the problem that the transformation of different outdoor terrains can affect the gait of walkers, a gait recognition algorithm based on feature fusion with attention mechanism is proposed. First, the acceleration, angular velocity and angle information collected by the inertial measurement unit is used; then the acquired inertial gait data is divided into periods to obtain the period data of each step; then the features are extracted from the data, followed by the visualization of the one-dimensional data into two-dimensional images. A lightweight model is designed to combine convolutional neural network with attention mechanism, and a new attention mechanism-based feature fusion method is proposed in this paper for extracting features from multiple sensors and fusing them for gait recognition. The comparison experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the model proposed in this paper can reach 89 $$\%$$ , and it has good recognition effect on gait under different terrain.},

  abstract     = {Dunhuang murals are the treasures of world culture and art, world-famous and extremely valuable for research. However, this treasure of human art has become extremely fragile due to environmental factors, major natural disasters and human destruction. As a result, the conservation and restoration of Dunhuang murals has become a task of great urgency, in which line drawings of Dunhuang murals occupy most of the time, and subsequent restoration work is guided by line drawings. The line drawings of the Dunhuang murals can be regarded as an image edge detection task, which is one of the most fundamental problem for advanced computer vision tasks. Its aim is to accurately extract object contours and meaningful in-object edges from images. Although many CNN-based edge detection methods have made significant progress on natural images, they still produce thick edges and non-edges when generating line drawings of Dunhuang murals. In this paper, we propose a novel edge detection method for generating line drawings of Dunhuang murals to address these problems. We first propose a novel loss function for edge detection, which effectively suppresses background noise pixels located near edges and enables the network to produce sharp edges. In addition, to take full advantage of the hierarchical features at different scales, we introduce DCM and SAM on the basis of the bottom-up/top-down structure. Finally, the results of experiments conducted on the BIPED dataset and the Dunhuang murals dataset show that the proposed method can generate richer and sharper edge maps.},

In this study, the current COA algorithm is developed and Enhanced COA (ECOA) is proposed. There is an imbalance between the exploitation and exploration capabilities of the COA. To balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of COA in the search space, the algorithm has been improved with two modifications. These modifications are those that preserve population diversity for a longer period of time during local and global searches. Thus, some of the drawbacks of COA in search strategies are eliminated. The achievements of COA and ECOA were tested in four different test groups. COA and ECOA were first compared on twenty-three classic CEC functions in three different dimensions (10, 20, and 30). Later, ECOA was tested on CEC-2017 with twenty-nine functions and on CEC-2020 with ten functions, and its success was demonstrated in different dimensions (5, 10, and 30). Finally, ECOA has been shown to be successful in different cycles (300, 500, and 1000) on Big Data Optimization Problems (BOP), which have high dimensions. Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were performed on the results, and the obtained results were analyzed in detail. According to the results, ECOA outperformed COA in all comparisons performed. In order to prove the success of ECOA, seven newly proposed algorithms (EMA, FHO, SHO, HBA, SMA, SOA, and JAYA) were selected from the literature in the last few years and compared with ECOA and COA. In the classical test functions, ECOA achieved the best results, surpassing all other algorithms when compared. It achieved the second-best results in CEC-2020 test functions and entered the top four in CEC-2017 and BOP test functions. According to the results, ECOA can be used as an alternative algorithm for solving small, medium, and large-scale continuous optimization problems.},

The pose of each projection view is obtained by rendering the 3D model of each object, and then the orientation feature of the object is implicitly represented by the latent space obtained from the RGB image. The 3D rotation of the object is estimated by establishing the codebook based on a template matching architecture. To build the latent space from the RGB images, this paper proposes a network based on a variant Adversarial Autoencoder (Makhzani et al. in Computer Science, 2015). To train the network, we use the dataset without pose annotation, and the encoder and decoder do not have a structural symmetry. The encoder is inspired by the existing model (Yang et al. in proceedings of IJCAI, 2018), (Yang et al. in proceedings 11 of CVPR, 2019) that incorporates the function of feature extraction from two different streams. Based on this network, the latent feature vector that implicitly represents the orientation of the object is obtained from the RGB image. Experimental results show that the method in this paper can realize the 6D pose estimation of the object and the result accuracy is better than the advanced method (Sundermeyer et al. in proceedings of ECCV, 2018).},

This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach of CALNet to recognize insufficient sample underwater acoustic targets. Given this goal, we introduce the CALNet network containing supervised and unsupervised modules. Firstly, we leverage the supervised module to recognize the labeled signals and reduce the dimensional feature extraction of unlabeled samples. Then, the unsupervised network is designed as an auxiliary network to optimize the supervised network, which uses low-dimensional features to restore high-dimensional features of unlabeled samples to enhance the classification ability of the supervised network. We especially introduce ReLU activation function to connect the supervised and unsupervised modules that can help find a balanced relationship between classification and regression tasks for recognizing underwater acoustic signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework showing that the proposed approach achieves the best recognition accuracy compared with the other approaches with few samples. Moreover, the experimental results can demonstrate the optimal combination of variables for the recognition effect of the proposed method under multiple variables.},

However, as the computational cost is too high, making it difficult to apply to resource-constrained devices, a big challenge for existing approaches is to find a balance between the complexity of the CNN model and the quality of the resulting SR. To solve this problem, various lightweight SR networks have been proposed. In this paper, we propose lightweight and efficient residual networks (IRN), which differ from previous lightweight SR networks that aggregate more powerful features by improving feature utilization through complex layer-connection strategies. The main idea is to simplify feature aggregation by using simple and efficient residual modules for feature learning, thus achieving a good trade-off between the computational cost of the model and the quality of the resulting SR. In addition, we revisit the impact of the activation function in the model and observe that different activation functions have an impact on the performance of the model. The experiment results show that IRN outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in benchmark tests while maintaining a relatively low computational cost.

  abstract     = {When applying Artificial Intelligence into the traditional Chinese poker game Doudizhu, it is faced with many challenging issues resulted from the characteristics of Doudizhu. One of these challenging issues is the sparse reward, due to the truth that a valid feedback could be obtained only at the end of a round of the game. Against this, in this paper, a deep neural framework, DQN-IRL, is proposed to address the challenging issue of sparse reward in Doudizhu. The experimental results proves the efficiency of DQN-IRL (Inverse Reinforcement Learning) in terms of winning rate.},

  abstract     = {Neural machine translation (NMT) is a hot field in artificial intelligence which aims at translating a text from a source language into a different target language. Although NMT systems perform quite well in high-resource setup, but their performance for low-resource data is low. One aspect of data scarcity is the lack of diversity in the sentence length of training data. Also, since we usually set a maximum sentence length during training, we observe degeneration in the translation of sentences longer than the max length. In this paper, we propose LenM—a method to model the length of a target (translated) sentence given the source sentence using a deep recurrent neural structure—and apply it to the decoder side of neural machine translation systems to generate translation sentences with appropriate lengths which have a better quality. Our proposed method helps to fix some drawbacks of NMT like output degradation on unseen sentence lengths, and the limitation of using larger beam sizes in the decoding phase of translation. This method can be applied to any NMT model regardless of the structure and does not slow down the translation speed. Moreover, it can be used efficiently in non-autoregressive machine translation systems which need to know the target length before decoding. The final outcome of this paper is improving the output quality of neural machine translation systems when trained on low-resource corpora. Our experiments show the superior performance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art neural machine translation systems when facing target length mismatch in training and inference, with up to 9.82 BLEU points improvement for German-to-English translation and up to 6.28 BLEU points improvement for Arabic-to-English translation.},

  abstract     = {In modern times, next-cart recommendation (NCR) has appeared as an excitable subject of research among researchers and is dominant in e-commerce. In NCR, a customer buys a set of products (termed a cart) in a particular interval of time. The broadly investigated categories like sequential or session-centered recommendation are majorly used to suggest the next product based on a sequence of products and are less complex when compared to NCR. The recommendation and sequential modeling are carried out by NCR by taking into consideration a sequence of carts. It has been observed that to carry out sequential modeling, the recurrent neural network (RNN) has been evidenced to be extremely efficient and thus utilized for NCR. After carrying out an extensive analysis of the actual world datasets, it is observed that personalized product frequency (PPF) information supplies two significant signals for NCR. But it is claimed that in the recommendation scene, RNNs which exist are not capable of capturing information about the frequency of an item in NCR. PPF can be described as the number of times that every product is bought by an individual. However, the concept of PPF has been overlooked in related studies. As a consequence, prevailing approaches are not able to fully explore the significant signals which exist in PPF. Although prevailing approaches like RNN-centered techniques exhibit robust representation ability, the experimental studies demonstrate that these methods are not able to recognize PPF. By keeping in mind this constraint of RNNs, a straightforward product frequency-centered k-nearest neighbors approach is proposed to straightforwardly incorporate these significant signals. The four actual world datasets are used for the assessment of the proposed technique. Apart from the simplicity of the technique, the proposed method performs better than existing NCR techniques and other deep learning techniques which employ RNNs.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of finite-time robust stabilization of inertial delayed neural networks with external disturbances. The finite-time stability research of inertial neural networks can be applied to important fields such as secure communication, so it has great significant research value. However, up to now, there are few previous studies on the finite-time stability of inertial neural networks, thus this paper makes up for this gap. Based on the actual communication networks, we improve the model of inertial neural networks, adding uncertainties and external disturbances. Unlike many previous papers based on scalar sign function, this paper introduces vector sign function, combines the constructed Lyapunov function, some inequality conditions, and related lemmas to design two effective controllers composed of $$U_1(t)$$ and $$U_2(t)$$ , which can handle uncertainties and external disturbances of the neural networks well, and realize finite-time robust stability of the neural networks with external disturbances. In addition, the theoretical part of this paper estimates an upper bound on the settling time for the system to reach stability. Under the conditions of a certain strategy, we further optimize the extremes of the settling time so that the system reaches stability in a shorter time. Our results improve and extend some recent works. Finally, two examples are given to verify the validity and correctness of the designed controllers by numerical simulations using MATLAB tool.},

But, the existing image-edge smoothening methods are developed without being semantically aware and content-aware. Earlier developed denoising methods are efficient in reducing Gaussian noise, yet suffer from maintaining the denoised image quality, and also image edges have been blurred. The main intent of this work is to introduce a new denoising approach of a modified Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to protect image edges. Initially, the noisy image is decomposed and denoised by the Adaptive thresholding functions-based Discrete Wavelet Transform, in which the thresholding functions of the wavelet are optimized by a hybridized optimization algorithm named Dragonfly-Harris Hawks Optimization (D-HHO). It is used for enhancing the image denoising with the MDCNN. Where the constraints of Deep CNN are tuned by the same D-HHO to minimize the multi-objective function in terms of joint loss representing both MSE loss and perpetual loss. Once the images are decomposed, denoising is performed which ensures the preservation of image edges. The experimental results confirm that the suggested network attains enriched performances.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer can be fatal if it is found to be malignant. Modern diagnosis of skin cancer heavily relies on visual inspection through clinical screening, dermoscopy, or histopathological examinations. However, due to similarity among cancer types, it is usually challenging to identify the type of skin cancer, especially at its early stages. Deep learning techniques have been developed over the last few years and have achieved success in helping to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and classification. However, the latest deep learning algorithms still do not provide ideal classification accuracy. To further improve the performance of classification accuracy, this paper presents a novel method of classifying skin cancer in clinical skin images. The method consists of four blocks. First, class rebalancing is applied to the images of seven skin cancer types for better classification performance. Second, an image is preprocessed by being split into patches of the same size and then flattened into a series of tokens. Third, a transformer encoder is used to process the flattened patches. The transformer encoder consists of N identical layers with each layer containing two sublayers. Sublayer one is a multihead self-attention unit, and sublayer two is a fully connected feed-forward network unit. For each of the two sublayers, a normalization operation is applied to its input, and a residual connection of its input and its output is calculated. Finally, a classification block is implemented after the transformer encoder. The block consists of a flattened layer and a dense layer with batch normalization. Transfer learning is implemented to build the whole network, where the ImageNet dataset is used to pretrain the network and the HAM10000 dataset is used to fine-tune the network. Experiments have shown that the method has achieved a classification accuracy of 94.1%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art model IRv2 with soft attention on the same training and testing datasets. On the Edinburgh DERMOFIT dataset also, the method has better performance compared with baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning methods have recently attracted attention in solving various tasks through their learning and determining capability for powerful features. It has been known that the absence of a pooling layer in the deep learning architectures made the network performance deteriorate significantly. Existing pooling methods assume that each value in the small region of the local feature map contributes equally to generate the pooled feature map. However, some values in the pooling region may contribute partially for generating the map. In addition, existing methods usually focused on the spatial dimension and ignored the inter-channel relationship during the pooling process. Besides, most of the pooling methods utilize a static pooling strategy which is designed based on the experts’ knowledge rather than learnt from the data. This study proposes a pooling method that is able to learn from the training data by utilizing a learnable attention mechanism, called Normalized Attention Inter-Channel Pooling (NAIP). The mechanism of the pooling process mainly focuses on the most important feature region for generating the pooled feature map. The proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art works which use graph convolutional neural network and convolutional neural network architectures for skeleton-based human action recognition and image classification tasks. The experiment demonstrates that the NAIP approach outperforms the existing methods under the same circumstances.},

In particular, nested entity recognition receives extensive attention for the widespread existence of the nesting scenario. The latest research migrates the well-established paradigm of set prediction in object detection to cope with entity nesting. However, the manual creation of query vectors, which fail to adapt to the rich semantic information in the context, limits these approaches. An end-to-end entity detection approach with proposer and regressor is presented in this paper to tackle the issues. First, the proposer utilizes the feature pyramid network to generate high-quality entity proposals. Then, the regressor refines the proposals for generating the final prediction. The model adopts encoder-only architecture and thus obtains the advantages of the richness of query semantics, high precision of entity localization, and easiness of model training. Moreover, we introduce the novel spatially modulated attention and progressive refinement for further improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves advanced performance in flat and nested NER, achieving a new state-of-the-art F1 score of 80.74 on the GENIA dataset and 72.38 on the WeiboNER dataset.},

  abstract     = {Total electron content (TEC) is one of the most important parameters of the ionosphere, which reflects the main characteristics of the ionosphere. Its accurate prediction plays an important role in improving the accuracy of GNSS navigation and ensuring the remote communication of radio. In order to solve the problems that the current combination of EMD and LSTM has a large amount of computation and insufficient mining of high-level information in TEC time series. This paper proposes an effective ionospheric TEC predicting approach using EEMD-PE-Kmeans and self-attention LSTM (EPKSL). First, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is used to stabilize the TEC time series, which solve the problem of endpoint effect and mode aliasing caused by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Next, an PE-kmeans algorithm is proposed to cluster and reconstruct the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components generated by EEMD with similar complexity, which not only reduces the calculation amount of the prediction model, but also improves the prediction accuracy. Finally, the reconstructed sub-signals are fed into the model we designed for prediction. The experiments on the ionospheric TEC data of Sanya station show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed model gets 1.23 TEC units (TECUs), the mean absolute error (MAE) obtains 0.93 TECUs, and the R2 achieves 0.982. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model has higher performance in terms of RMSE, MAE and R2 compared with several typical prediction methods, while the prediction time is reduced by 32.8% compared with EMD-LSTM.},

At first, we construct smooth truncated Hε loss function by combining ε-insensitive loss function and Huber loss function. Then, a concave-convex programming (CCCP) is employed to solve the nonconvex optimization problem in the primal space. In addition, the convergence of THε-TSVR is also proved.

  abstract     = {Recently, cross-domain collaborative filtering (CDCF) has been widely used to solve the data sparsity problem in recommendation systems. Therein, dual-target cross-domain recommendation becomes a research hotspot, which aims to improve the recommendation performance of both target and source domains. Most existing approaches tend to use fixed weights or self-attention in a single representation space for the bi-directional inter-domain transfer of the user representation. However, a single representation space leads to limited representation capability, which makes the transfer of the user representation inaccurate. Also, the existing approaches ignore the representation enhancement of items. In this paper, Multi-head Attention and Knowledge Graph Based Dual Target Graph Collaborative Filtering Network (MAKG-DTGCF) is proposed. Based on the graph collaborative filtering model, it uses the multi-head attention based bi-directional transfer module to realize adaptive transfer and fusion of user features in multiple representation subspaces, which can make the transfer of user representation more accurate. Meanwhile, we also enhance the item representation by aligning the item embedding in the user-item heterogeneous graph with the knowledge embedding of the item in the knowledge graph. Experimental results on three real datasets show that the proposed MAKG-DTGCF model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of HR and NDCG.},

  abstract     = {Albeit worryingly underrated in the recent literature on machine learning in general (and, on deep learning in particular), multivariate density estimation is a fundamental task in many applications, at least implicitly, and still an open issue. With a few exceptions, deep neural networks (DNNs) have seldom been applied to density estimation, mostly due to the unsupervised nature of the estimation task, and (especially) due to the need for constrained training algorithms that ended up realizing proper probabilistic models that satisfy Kolmogorov’s axioms. Moreover, in spite of the well-known improvement in terms of modeling capabilities yielded by mixture models over plain single-density statistical estimators, no proper mixtures of multivariate DNN-based component densities have been investigated so far. The paper fills this gap by extending our previous work on neural mixture densities (NMMs) to multivariate DNN mixtures. A maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithm for estimating Deep NMMs (DNMMs) is handed out, which satisfies numerically a combination of hard and soft constraints aimed at ensuring satisfaction of Kolmogorov’s axioms. The class of probability density functions that can be modeled to any degree of precision via DNMMs is formally defined. A procedure for the automatic selection of the DNMM architecture, as well as of the hyperparameters for its ML training algorithm, is presented (exploiting the probabilistic nature of the DNMM). Experimental results on univariate and multivariate data are reported on, corroborating the effectiveness of the approach and its superiority to the most popular statistical estimation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Gene is located inside the nuclease and the genetic data is contained in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). A person’s gene count ranges from 20,000 to 30,000. Even a minor alteration to the DNA sequence can be harmful if it affects the cell’s fundamental functions. As a result, the gene begins to act abnormally. The sorts of genetic abnormalities brought on by mutation include chromosomal disorders, complex disorders, and single-gene disorders. Therefore, a detailed diagnosis method is required. Thus, we proposed an Elephant Herd Optimization-Whale Optimization Algorithm (EHO-WOA) optimized Stacked ResNet-Bidirectional Long Term Short Memory (ResNet-BiLSTM) model for detecting genetic disorders. Here, a hybrid EHO-WOA algorithm is presented to assess the Stacked ResNet-BiLSTM architecture’s fitness. The ResNet-BiLSTM design uses the genotype and gene expression phenotype as input data. Furthermore, the proposed method identifies rare genetic disorders such as Angelman Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and Prader-Willi Syndrome. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed model with greater accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and f1-score. Thus, a wide range of DNA deficiencies including Prader-Willi syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Early Onset Morbid Obesity, Rett syndrome, and Angelman syndrome are predicted accurately.},

  abstract     = {Visual object tracking is among the extremely attractive topics in various vision system applications. The appearance of the target object often drastically changes over time due to complicated attributes such as motion blur and fast motion; accordingly object tracking is a challenging issue. Over the past few years, Siamese architecture has been satisfactorily employed in object tracking because of its great accuracy and robustness. In this paper, a new matching operator for determining the similarity between the template image and search region to locate the state of the object is introduced. The matching operator is a weighted sum of depth-wise cosine similarity and depth-wise cross-correlation. For computing cosine similarity in each block, extracted features from the backbone architecture are divided into column vectors in each channel. The similarity is calculated in corresponding columns. Then, the max-pooling operation is applied to similarity values, and the maximum value is assigned to the center of the block. Finally, the combination of cosine similarity and cross-correlation in each channel is used. The results on OTB-100 demonstrate that the proposed tracker acquires promising prediction performance concerning the state-of-the-art tracking techniques in terms of motion blur, fast motion, and also out-of-view attributes.},

  abstract     = {Identification of Hammerstein systems with polynomial features and mean square error loss has received a lot of attention due to their simplicity in calculation and solid theoretical foundation. However, when the prior information of nonlinear subblock of a Hammerstein system is unknown or some outliers are involved, the performance of related methods may degenerate seriously. The main reason is that the used polynomial just has finite approximation capability to an unknown nonlinear function, and mean square error loss is sensitive to outliers. In this paper, a new identification method based on random Fourier features and kernel risk sensitive loss is therefore proposed. Since the linear combination of random Fourier features can well approximate any continuous nonlinear function, it is expected to be more powerful to characterize the nonlinear behavior of Hammerstein systems. Moreover, since the kernel risk sensitive loss is a similarity measure that is insensitive to outliers, it is expected to have excellent robustness. Based on the mean square convergence analysis, a sufficient condition to ensure the convergence and some theoretical values regarding the steady-state excess mean square error of the proposed method are also provided. Simulation results on the tasks of Hammerstein system identification and electroencephalogram noise removal show that the new method can outperform other popular and competitive methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

It is a great promise to make AI-based systems not only intelligent but also knowledgeable. In this paper, we investigate knowledge graph based visual semantic navigation using deep reinforcement learning, where an agent reasons actions against targets specified by text words in indoor scenes. The agent perceives its surroundings through egocentric RGB views and learns via trial-and-error. The fundamental problem of visual navigation is efficient learning across different targets and scenes. To obtain an empirical model, we propose a spatial attention model with knowledge graphs, DGVN, which combines both semantic information about observed objects and spatial information about their locations. Our spatial attention model is constructed based on interactions between a 3D global graph and local graphs. The two graphs we adopted encode the spatial relationships between objects and are expected to guide policy search effectively. With the knowledge graph and its robust feature representation using graph convolutional networks, we demonstrate that our agent is able to infer a more plausible attention mechanism for decision-making. Under several experimental metrics, our attention model is shown to achieve superior navigation performance in the AI2-THOR environment.},

  abstract     = {Long short-term memory (LSTM) is regarded as one of the most popular methods for regression prediction of time series. In the memory unit of LSTM, since most values of gate structures are usually in the middle state (around 0.5), gate structures cannot effectively retain important information or discard trivial information. Furthermore, the information between two adjacent layers can not be sufficiently transmitted only through the hidden state. To address these issues, we propose a new LSTM structure based on memory cell (MC-LSTM for short) in this paper. First, a new gate stretching mechanism in memory unit is introduced to readjust the distributions of the gates values to push them away from the uncertainty of 0.5. Second, before the memory unit, we establish an interaction gate, in which the input information, the hidden state and the output memory cell of the previous layer interact with each other. By doing so, the information fusion between two adjacent layers can be enhanced and the long-term dependencies can be captured effectively as well. This new method can be used to process time series data, and its goal is to use historical data to predict the value of a future time period. Experimental results on one UCI dataset and eight Kaggle time series datasets validate that the proposed network structure is superior to the most advanced networks.},

  abstract     = {Traditional NAS methods improve performance by sacrificing the landing ability of the architecture and the re-parameterization technology is expected to solve this problem. However, most current Rep methods rely on prior knowledge to select the re-parameterization operations, which limits the architecture performance to the type of operations and prior knowledge. At same time, some re-parameterization operations hinder the optimization of the network. To break these restrictions, in this work, an improved re-parameterization search space is designed, including more type of re-parameterization operations. Concretely, the performance of convolutional networks can be further enhanced by the search space. An automatic re-parameterization enhancement strategy is designed to effectively explore this search space based on neural architecture search (NAS), which can search an excellent re-parameterization architecture. Then, we solved the optimization problem caused by using some re-parameterization operations to enhance ResNet-style network. Besides, we visualize the output features of the architecture to analyze the reasons for the formation of the re-parameterization architecture. On public datasets, we achieve better results. Under the same training conditions as ResNet, we improve the accuracy of ResNet-50 by 1.82% on ImageNet-1k.},

Inspired by this motivation, we adopt audio and visual modalities for DoA estimation, where the video is used as a prominent supplementary modality for sound source localization. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based sound source localization framework. We also use self-attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies in the multi-channel audio signals. The whole model is trained to map an ideal spatial spectrum with likelihood-based output coding. The framework is evaluated on an available multi-speaker sound source localization dataset and compared against state-of-the-art methods in terms of DoA estimation error and localization accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed audio-visual multi-speaker DoA estimation method yields improved performance over the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Different from sentence-level sentiment analysis, the aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task that aims to identify the sentiment polarity towards specific aspect terms in a sentence. However, the lack of fine-grained labeled data and the fact that a sentence may contain multiple aspects or complex implicit sentiment relations make ABSA still face challenges. Specifically, effectively exploiting syntactic dependencies to construct contextual information in a sentence to capture implicit sentiment polarities and constructing the data augmentation paradigm to obtain fine-grained aspect-specific information are the key concerns of this paper. To mitigate the above issues, we propose a Contrastive Learning Framework with Tree-Structured LSTM (CLF-TrLSTM), which applies a concatenated form of Tree-LSTMs and self-attention with window mechanism to utilize dependency tree to capture syntactic and contextual information of the sentence. Meanwhile, to alleviate the data scarcity problem, we use mask generation operation and contrastive learning to generate in-domain high-quality positive and negative samples, then encourage anchor sentences and positive samples to be more similar than negative example pairs, which can achieve alignment of different granularities. Finally, experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance and comprehensive analysis verifies the effectiveness of each component.},

  abstract     = {A variety of saliency detection techniques have been proposed during the last two decades to determine important regions on the surface of 3D shapes in form of triangular meshes. However, most fail in predicting the regions where human eyes naturally fixate when observing and exploring an object. Taking inspiration from biological studies that enumerate a list of object characteristics revealed in human visual processing and the influence of semantic properties in the emergence of neural responses in human brain, in this work, we propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture using gradient-based class activation mapping to detect saliencies on the surface of 3D objects when classifying them based on their different properties. We further argue that using Pearson Correlation Coefficient is not sufficient for the evaluation of saliency values and therefore propose a novel evaluation technique to determine how reliable is the detection performed by saliency detectors to predict eye fixations. More specifically, this evaluation metric measures the distance between the most salient region detected and the respective location of human eye fixation. Evaluating the results based on visual comparison, as well as using the proposed evaluation technique, demonstrates that our model is successful in predicting the locations where human eye fixates. Results are compared with five state-of-the-art saliency detectors, and our experiments suggest that in average the location of the highest saliency detected by our approach is closer to the location of human eye fixation by about 22.55% to 77.76% in comparison with five state-of-the art method” on a public dataset.},

  abstract     = {Automatic person recognition using finger-vein has been extensively investigated in recent years. Mostly the published research on biometrics are based on the hand-crafted feature descriptors to describe the appearance of a finger-vein image, which is prone to be affected by irregular shading, irrelevant background, varying illumination and non-rigid deformation. To improve the recognition performance of hand-crafted feature-based methods, many researchers have contributed substantially in designing enhancement methods for texture descriptors. However, hand-crafted algorithms are highly targeted with weak generalization ability with respect to the emerging data samples. Nowadays, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) is emerging as a powerful technology to extract multi-level feature representation instead of traditionally designed features from raw data. These methods are achieving unprecedented performance in the field of computer vision. In context to biometrics modalities, finger-vein recognition using CNN is still in its primary stage. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective multi-scale arc-fusion approach to optimize the feature embedding discrimination power. An exhaustive comparative experiment is conducted on four publicly available databases: HKPU, FV-USM, SDUMLA and UTFVP, to demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Also, the experimental result shows that the concept is actually scalable and can be migrated to other deep neural network architectures.},

  abstract     = {Least squares estimate that can directly obtain the analytical solution to minimize the mean square error (MSE) is one of the most effective regression tools. It has also been applied to many classification tasks due to its simplicity, clear physical and tractability. However, there is a fundamental contradiction between regression with continuous samples and classification with discrete category labels, i.e., the output metric spaces are different. Considering this contradiction in regression-based classification, this paper presents a new linear classifier, termed penalized least squares classifier (PLSC), which gradually adds the penalty on the distance between misclassified samples and decision boundary to the loss function. Fundamentally, the decision boundary is obtained by minimizing MSE with iterative cost-sensitive learning. Then, an enhanced nonlinear neural network classifier, PLSC-BP is formulated, in which the penalized least squares mechanism is applied to tune the learning strategy of the conventional neural network by adjusting the cost factor for each sample. Extensive experiments on six synthetic datasets and eleven publicly available datasets show that classification, which cannot be realized by traditional least squares, can be conducted using a regression algorithm with iterative cost-sensitive learning. The proposed enhanced algorithm outperforms the traditional neural network classifiers and other classifiers in terms of classification.},

Based on this fact, two novel activation functions (NAF) are proposed to improve the performance of each RNN formula for text classification, dynamic problems solving and dynamic matrix inversion in this work. Firstly, the first NAF ( $$\textrm{NAF}_1$$ ) is applied to the two-layer simple RNN model, long short-term memory RNN model and gated recurrent unit RNN model for text classification. Comparing with the above three RNN models activated by reported activation functions (rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, leak relu (LReLU), exponential linear unit (ELU), scaled ELU], the $$\textrm{NAF}_1$$ -activated RNN models achieve higher accuracy in text classification. In addition, based on the second NAF ( $$\textrm{NAF}_2$$ ), an improved fixed-time convergent recurrent neural network (IFTCRNN) model for time-varying problems solving is constructed. The $$\textrm{NAF}_2$$ -based IFTCRNN model achieves fixed-time convergence and strong robustness to noises in time-varying Sylvester matrix equation solving, dynamic matrix inversion and robot manipulator trajectory tracking.},

Prior techniques mainly rely on machine translation technology to translate the last (incomplete) utterance in the context into a complete utterance. Such a rewriting paradigm contrasts with the main characteristic of the task, that is, the source and target utterances are mostly the same with only a small portion of local edits. Therefore, they rely heavily on large amounts of data to fit the translation model. This paper proposes DuReSE (dialogue utterance rewritten via sequence editing), a neural utterance editor designed for utterance rewriting. DuReSE shapes utterance rewriting as a sentence editing task and then predicts a small set of edit operations for each word in the dialogue context. The model edits the incomplete utterance in two phases where (1) an in-place editor performs word-level editing, and (2) a post-editor then refines the rewritten utterance. Experiments on three benchmark data sets have suggested that DuReSE outperforms baseline models in terms of EM, BLEU, and ROUGE. Specifically, DuReSE outperforms the baselines by up to 14.1% in EM, indicating that it can retrieve more informative and important information, compared with existing techniques.},

In order to have a real-time classifier with low complexity, The LeNet-5 is utilized as the most straightforward deep network with the fewest parameters. For the sake of having a real-time training and test phase, the three fully connected layers are replaced by an extreme learning machine (ELM). However, tuning the ELM’s input layer parameters is challenging; therefore, this paper tries to tune them using the grey wolf optimizer (GWO). Contrary to other research works and considering the sonar problem’s characteristics, we model the problem as a multimodal function. Therefore, comprehensive learning concepts and a novel constraint-handling technique are exerted on the GWO to address the multimodality and the constraints of the sonar image classification task and to have a robust optimizer. Given the vital role of the reliable dataset in deep learning approaches, in the following, an operational underwater sonar test scenario is designed, and an experimental dataset is generated. The designed model is then benchmarked on two benchmark active sonar datasets. The results are investigated by qualified research with classic DCNN, Block-wise Classifier (BWC), and Matched Subspace classifier with Adaptive Dictionaries (MSAD). The investigation outcomes confirm that the designed model, with an average accuracy of 98.69% and computation time equal to 883.44 s, reports the best accuracy and time complexity among other benchmark models.},

To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view spectral clustering method called Incomplete Multi-view Clustering based on Self-representation (IMCS). To accurately represent the relation between data samples, IMCS constructs the adjacent graph of each view by self-representation. To obtain the consistency of multiple views, IMCS fuses the adjacent graphs from different views and utilizes the fused graph to perform spectral clustering. To reduce the negative effect of missing data, IMCS utilizes existing data to reconstruct incomplete data and integrates the reconstruction objective with self-representation based spectral clustering. IMCS is compared with several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering approaches on benchmark multi-view datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of IMCS.},

The algorithm was created by modeling the foraging behavior of jellyfish in the ocean. AJS has been used mostly for the solution of continuous optimization problems in the literature, and studies on its performance on binary problems are limited. While this study aims to contribute to the literature by proposing a binary version of AJS (Bin_AJS) for the solution of knapsack problems, the effects of eight different transfer functions and five different mutation ratios were examined, and the ideal mutation ratio and transfer function were determined for each dataset. It was found that Bin_AJS, which was examined for two different datasets consisting of a total of forty knapsack problems, reached the optimal value in 97.5% of the problems. According to the Friedman test results, Bin_AJS ranked first in Dataset 1 and second in Dataset 2 when compared to other algorithms in the literature. All the comparisons and statistical tests showed that the algorithm is a successful, competitive, and preferable binary algorithm for knapsack problems.},

  abstract     = {Photonic neural networks are among the most promising recently proposed neuromorphic solutions for providing fast and energy efficient Deep Learning (DL) implementations. However, photonic networks need to be first appropriately trained to support the underlying hardware implementation (e.g., activation functions), since it is not possible to directly deploy an already trained DL model into a neuromorphic platform that uses different transfer functions compared to regular networks. The main hypothesis examined in this paper is whether we can employ a neural network distillation approach to transfer the knowledge from a regular DL model into a photonic neural network reducing in this way the accuracy gap between regular and photonic models. Furthermore, we propose a novel fully differentiable formulation of mutual information that can be used for efficiently transferring the knowledge between layers of a regular neural networks and photonic neural networks. In this way, we further increase the effectiveness of distillation by also taking into account the behavior of intermediate layers of DL models. Experiments conducted on two image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, further closing the accuracy gap between photonic and regular DL models.},

And the exclusion for Zeno behavior is verified by contradiction analysis method. Thirdly, a class of functions, which is an extension of the Lipschitz function, is introduced to model the nonlinear dynamics for the considered system. With the aid of fractional Lyapunov functional method, some auxiliary functions and advanced mathematical analysis techniques, the global exponential synchronization conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Currently, deep learning-based methods have further improved the accuracy of named entity recognition, and most methods are based on word-level and character-level embeddings. However, these methods ignore the effectiveness of global context for entity recognition, so this paper proposes to use an attention mechanism to obtain comprehensive information of the same word from different contextual information. Meanwhile, character-level representations affect not only the accuracy of recognizing unseen words, but also the extraction of contextual representations. Considering this issue, we propose to extract character-to-word representations using label attention mechanism. The proposed model uses CNN-LSTM-CRF as the baseline, which is effectively integrated into the above two representation extraction methods, named CNN-CWR-LSTM-GCR-CRF. On the basis of this model, we further integrate the language model BERT. Experiments show that our model achieves the results competitive with the state-of-the-art records on CONLL-2002 Spanish dataset, CONLL-2003 and Ontonotes5.0 English datasets, respectively.},

In our paper, we contribute by a novel analyzing approach build on adversarial examples to investigate the explanatory power of saliency methods exemplified by layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). Based on the hypothesis that distinct decisions, such as an image’s classification and the classification of its corresponding adversarial examples, should yield to dissimilar saliency maps to provide transparent rationales, we break down relevance scores of images and corresponding adversarial examples and analyze them using a comprehensive statistical evaluation. It turns out that different relevance decomposition rules of LRP do not lead to clearly distinguishable saliency maps for images and corresponding adversarial examples, neither in terms of their contour lines, nor in terms of the statistical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a Gravitational Search-based neural weight optimization technique for faster neural synchronization is proposed. To share the key over a public channel, two neural networks are coordinated by mutual learning. The primary problem of neural synchronization in the absence of a weight vector from another party is deciding how to determine the synchronization of two communication parties. The existing synchronization evaluation strategies also have a latency problem that affects the protection and privacy of neural synchronization. A significant technique for evaluating synchronization is introduced in this paper to evaluate the complete coordination of two neural networks more effectively and rapidly. The frequency of the two networks having the same output in previous iterations is used to measure the degree of synchronization. When a certain threshold is reached, the hash is used to decide if both networks are fully synchronized. This proposed methodology uses Gravitational Search optimized weight vectors to achieve total synchronization between two communicating parties. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed solution helps two communication parties to detect complete synchronization faster. The successful geometric probability is decreased as a consequence. As a result, the proposed method strengthens the security of the neural key exchange protocol. Different parametric experiments have been performed on the proposed methodology. In terms of the cited findings in the study, simulations of the procedure indicate efficacy.},

However, in some complex scenarios, using deep convolutional layers alone can not effectively capture powerful representative features. To solve this problem, we propose a Siamese Attention and Deformable features fusion network for visual object Tracking (SiamADT). The proposed SiamADT consists of three modules: a Siamese attention network module for attention feature extraction, a deformable features fusion module, and a classification-regression module for bounding box prediction. Our framework uses ResNet-50 as the backbone for anchor-free tracking. Without tricky anchor hyperparameters tuning and manual intervention, SiamADT is more flexible and versatile. We conduct extensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that SiamADT achieves competitive performance among state-of-the-art methods, with real-time speed—30 frames per second.},

The addition of image prior can effectively alleviate the ill-posed problem in the image restoration model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep image super-resolution (SR) method that based on segmentation driven. Intuitively, clear image has a clearer segmentation boundary. It will drive deep neural networks to obtain higher performance SR image when forcing the restored image to have clear boundary. In order to make energy flow into DIP better, we use the fully convolutional networks-based superpixel method, and we use back propagation to inject the gradient generated by segmentation entropy energy into DIP to obtain lower energy optimization parameters. Experiments show that the image generated by our method has clearer boundary and better performance than that generated by DIP on Set5, Set14 and BSD100.},

  abstract     = {Recently the deep learning has shown its advantage in representation learning and clustering for time series data. Despite the considerable progress, the existing deep time series clustering approaches mostly seek to train the deep neural network by some instance reconstruction based or cluster distribution based objective, which, however, lack the ability to exploit the sample-wise (or augmentation-wise) contrastive information or even the higher-level (e.g., cluster-level) contrastiveness for learning discriminative and clustering-friendly representations. In light of this, this paper presents a deep temporal contrastive clustering (DTCC) approach, which for the first time, to our knowledge, incorporates the contrastive learning paradigm into the deep time series clustering research. Specifically, with two parallel views generated from the original time series and their augmentations, we utilize two identical auto-encoders to learn the corresponding representations, and in the meantime perform the cluster distribution learning by incorporating a k-means objective. Further, two levels of contrastive learning are simultaneously enforced to capture the instance-level and cluster-level contrastive information, respectively. With the reconstruction loss of the auto-encoder, the cluster distribution loss, and the two levels of contrastive losses jointly optimized, the network architecture is trained in a self-supervised manner and the clustering result can thereby be obtained. Experiments on a variety of time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DTCC approach over the state-of-the-art. The code is available at https://github.com/07zy/DTCC .},

This survey paper discusses the various techniques applicable which have tried to remove the noise from medical images. A complete overview of the problem hypothesis is stated in the paper, with an in-depth discussion on types and sources of noise and the evaluation metrics deployed, followed by the discussion and implementation of various filtering and image enhancement techniques. The section is succeeded by a comprehensive literature review conducted on leading and state-of-the-art methods in broadly four domains—frequency domain, filtering, CNN-based, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-based and Transformer-based approaches.

A critical model for studying biological neurons&#39; behavior is the Hodgkin–Huxley neuron model (HH for short), presented in 1952. In this paper, the model is realized and verified using only one multiplier with some simplification. By comparing the original and simplified HH models, the RMSE and NRMSE are 1.83 and 0.016 for neuron membrane output potential, respectively, at the injected current of 20 uA.

  abstract     = {Although Pre-trained language models are widely used in dialogue state tracking, there exists little work on pre-training tasks that are designed for dialogue state tracking. In this perspective, we propose simple and effective pre-training tasks of language models that are specifically designed for dialogue state tracking. The first is modified slot prediction, which is a pre-training task that makes a binary prediction for detecting slots that change their value from the previous turn in the current turn of the dialogue. The second is next dialogue prediction, which is also a binary prediction pre-training task of finding whether a part of a given recent dialogue context is replaced with excerpts from other dialogues or not. Experimental results suggest that combing our pre-training tasks achieves a significant improvement of 4.51% point over a model trained without additional pre-training. This is impressive in that additional data is not used for the pre-training. In addition, ablation studies show how each pre-training task affects the performance. Specifically, our pre-training tasks works best when it is used in the pre-training phase rather than in the fine-tuning phase. Also, longer pre-training helps fine-tuning performance.},

  abstract     = {Label propagation (LP) is a popular graph-based semi-supervised learning framework. Its effectiveness is limited by the distribution of prior labels. If there are no objects with prior labels in parts of classes, label propagation has very poor performance. To address this issue, we propose a label propagation based on bipartite graph (LPBBG) algorithm. This approach try to learn a bipartite graph as exemplar constraints that reflect the relations between objects and exemplars to guide the learning process instead of label constraints in the traditional label propagation. In this paper, we provide a method for producing high-quality exemplars from two channels to represent the known classes (where some objects have prior labels) and the missing classes (where all the objects have no prior labels). Given generated exemplars, exemplar constraints can be learned using relationships in the known classes to evaluate that in the missing classes. Our experimental results show that the LPBBG algorithm outperforms existing LP methods in overcoming the label missing problem in some classes.},

A handful of research articles published in the literature have described how NLG can produce understandable texts in various languages. The use of sequence-to-sequence modeling powered by deep learning techniques such as Long Term Short Term Memory, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Gated Recurrent Units has received much popularity as text generators. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of text generations and their related techniques, such as statistical, traditional, and neural network-based techniques. Generating text using the sequence-to-sequence model is not a simple task as it needs to handle continuous data, such as images, and discrete information, such as text. Therefore, in this study, we have identified some crucial areas for further research on text generation, such as incorporating a large text dataset, identifying and resolving grammatical errors, and generating extensive sentences or paragraphs. This work has also presented a detailed overview of the activation functions used in deep learning-based models and the evaluation metrics used for text generation.},

The key of Chinese cybersecurity NER is to obtain meaningful word representations and to delicately model the inter-word relations. However, Chinese is a language of compound words and lacks morphological inflections. Moreover, the role and meaning of a word depends on the context in a complicated way. In this paper, we present an NER model named Star-HGCN, short for Star-Transformer with Hybrid embeddings and Graph Convolutional Network. To make full use of the intra-word information, we set a hybrid embedding layer at the very beginning, which enriches word representations with character-level information and part-of-speech features. More importantly, we further enhance the hybrid embeddings by modeling inter-word implicit local and long-range semantic associations using the efficient Star-Transformer architecture, and modeling the explicit syntactic dependencies between words in the dependency tree using the graph convolutional network. Experiments on the Chinese cybersecurity dataset show that our model is superior to other neural network methods for NER, and achieves a significant relative improvement of 36.59% for the class of software entities. Experiments on other public datasets also validate the effectiveness of the model on other general and specific domains.},

The alternating direction method of multipliers is used to simplify the spatial–temporal regularized term in the objective function, obtain the optimal solution of the filter and auxiliary factor, reduce the algorithm’s complexity, and realize the adaptability of time and space. The target weight response model is obtained through the target point finding weight, the target motion information is extracted, the target motion state and motion trajectory are predicted, and the interference information such as the algorithm’s ability to identify the target and the ability to distinguish the target is enhanced. With the help of the weighted least squares method, the maximum response value of the weight is obtained, and the target position is determined. Experiments show that, compared with other mainstream correlation filtering algorithms, the proposed algorithm has higher tracking accuracy and stronger robustness under complex conditions.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning aims to discriminate images from novel categories using only a few available training examples. While existing few-shot methods can adapt quickly and precisely to new categories, they often struggle to retain knowledge of base categories that were used in the training phase. To address this challenge and support lifelong learning, generalized few-shot learning has been introduced to enable few-shot models to classify both base and novel categories. However, as the number of categories increases, few-shot models can lose efficiency due to the limited amount of visual information available for each category. To address this limitation, we propose the knowledge-augmented weight generation (KAWG) method, which incorporates semantic information in addition to visual features. Specifically, KAWG combines textual descriptions and entity relationships extracted from knowledge graphs and visual features to generate more robust classifiers for generalized few-shot learning tasks. Through our meta-training strategy, KAWG can retain the knowledge learned from base categories to the greatest extent when transferring to novel classes. Experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on some generalized few-shot benchmarks.},

We argue that the core of personalized recommendation locates interaction rather than embeddings. Distinct from the sparse pairwise interactions, there are a large amount of inherent non-pairwise signals hidden among neighbors, which are promising for interaction learning. In this work, we explore the active effect of non-pairwise neighbors on the target user-item pair and propose a non-pairwise collaborative filtering (NPCF) model. For a target user-item pair, NPCF mines target-aware CF signals of neighbors by aggregating both pairwise and non-pairwise CF signals of the target for a target-specific interaction embedding. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that NPCF outperforms the state-of-the-art models for personalized recommendation. It implies NPCF is capable of learning interactions with non-pairwise neighbors.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural network (SNN) based on sparse trigger and event-driven information processing has the advantages of ultra-low power consumption and hardware friendliness. As a new generation of neural networks, SNN is widely concerned. At present, the most effective way to realize deep SNN is through artificial neural network (ANN) conversion. Compared with the original ANN, the converted SNN suffers from performance loss. This paper adjusts the spike firing rate of spiking neurons to minimize the performance loss of SNN in the conversion process. We map the ANN weights to the corresponding SNN after continuous normalization, which ensures that the spike firing rate of the neuron is in the normal range. We propose a certainty interval reset mechanism (CIRM), which effectively reduces the loss of membrane potential and avoids the problem of neuronal over-activation. In the experiment, we added a modulation factor to the CIRM to further adjust the spike firing rate of neurons. The accuracy of the converted SNN on CIFAR-10 is 1.026% higher than that of the original ANN. The algorithm not only achieves the lossless conversion of ANN, but also reduces the network energy consumption. Our algorithm also effectively improves the accuracy of SNN (VGG-15) on CIFAR-100 and decreases the network delay.

With global context and positional information, FCTR can produce more accurate correspondences for ambiguous areas. Using position-embedded feature allows the removal of the context network; the positional information can be aggregated within ambiguous motion boundaries, and the number of model parameters can be reduced. To speed up network convergence and strengthen robustness, we introduce a smooth L1 loss with exponential weights in the pre-training step. At the time of submission, our method achieves competitive performance with all published optical flow methods on both the KITTI-2015 and MPI-Sintel benchmarks.

To model the talking face’s complicated and critical features (identity, background, mouth shape, head posture, etc.), we construct SATFace by taking encoder-decoder as the primary network architecture. Then, we design a long short-time feature learning network to better reference the global and local information in audio for generating reasonable head movement. Besides, a modular training process is proposed to improve explicit and implicit features’ learning effects and efficiency. The experimental comparison results show that SATFace improves by at least about 9.8% in cumulative probability of blur detection and 8.2% in synchronization confidence compared with the mainstream methods. The mean opinion scores show that SATFace has advantages in terms of lip sync quality, head movement naturalness, and video realness.},

In this work, we improve the current state-of-the-art detection algorithm YOLOv7 as a basis and propose a lightweight traffic sign detection algorithm. First, we highlight the weights of salient features through a weighted attention module to make the network more focused on the target features. Then, we propose a lightweight convolution-based spatial pyramidal pooling fusion module (DW-SPPF) and replace the conventional convolution of the detection head with a lightweight depth-separable convolution to reduce the complexity of the model while maintaining detection accuracy. Finally, for the bounding box regression, we consider the directional relationship between the groundtruth and predicted boxes and improve the regression loss function to enhance the convergence speed of the loss. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the model in this paper is improved by 6.7% compared to the base network, and the detection speed is accelerated by about 51 frames/s through model refinement, which basically satisfies the real-time accurate detection of traffic signs.},

  abstract     = {In video action recognition, the existing methods mostly utilize global average pooling at the end of the network to aggregate spatio-temporal features of the video to generate global video representations, which are insufficient in modeling complex spatio-temporal feature distributions and capturing spatio-temporal dynamic information. To address the issue, we propose a novel group second-order aggregation network (GSoANet), the core of which is to integrate the group second-order aggregation module (GSoAM) at the end of the network to aggregate video spatio-temporal features. GSoAM first adopts the grouping strategy to decompose input features into a group of relatively low-dimensional vectors, and then aggregates video spatio-temporal features in the low-dimensional space. Then the subspaces represented by codewords are introduced, where in each subspace, differences between spatio-temporal features and codewords are aggregated with soft assignment refecting their proximity. Finally, the nonlinear geometric structure of the fused subspaces is modeled by using the iterative matrix square root normalized covariance. In addition, GSoANet also introduces a high-performance convolutional network ConvNeXt as a backbone to improve network accuracy at a lower computational cost. Extensive experimental results on four challenging video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in aggregating spatio-temporal features as well as its competitive results.},

The two key characteristics of the proposed FH-LS-SVM are that it assigns fuzzy membership degrees to every data vector according to the importance and the parameters for the hyperplane, such as the elements of normal vector and the bias term, are fuzzified variables. The proposed fuzzy hyperplane efficiently captures the ambiguous nature of real-world classification tasks by representing vagueness in the observed data set using fuzzy variables. The fuzzy hyperplane for the proposed FH-LS-SVM model significantly decreases the effect of noise. Noise increases the ambiguity (spread) of the fuzzy hyperplane but the center of a fuzzy hyperplane is not affected by noise. The experimental results for benchmark data sets and real-world classification tasks show that the proposed FH-LS-SVM model retains the advantages of a LS-SVM which is a simple, fast and highly generalized model, and increases fault tolerance and robustness by using fuzzy set theory.},

Instead, we formulate the FinNER task as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem and propose a new model termed FinBERT–MRC. This formulation introduces significant prior information by utilizing well-designed queries, and extracts the start index and end index of the target entities without decoding modules such as conditional random fields (CRFs).

In this paper, we propose a geometrically preserved dual projections learning of both label and feature spaces for multi-label classification. Different from traditional multi-label classification algorithms which learn appropriate feature dimensions directly from feature space, our proposed method learns dual label and feature space projections from both input feature and output label spaces simultaneously. Thus, achieving dimension reduction in both label and feature spaces. Furthermore, since labels and features are sampled from label and feature manifolds, respectively, we learn their geometric structures by constructing label and feature graphs. By geometrically preserving dual projections, better low rank structures in label and feature spaces are obtained, which further improves the performance of multi-label classification. Experimental results on several data sets such as cal500, enron, languagelog and rcv1s1, demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods, such as MIFS, RAKEL, PLST, CPLST, GroPLE, CSSP, FaIE in LSDR and STOA.},

And geographic factors in check-ins easily make model training ineffective in FL. For example, geographical cultural differences will aggravate the Non-IID nature of data. To cope with the problems, we propose a new framework FedSR for POI-RS based on sequential information. In the FedSR, we construct a multi-task framework through Contrastive Learning (CL). In this multi-task, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) optimization is used for the recommendation task, and a data augmentation method is applied to CL based on geographical correlations between POIs. In addition, to effectively train the multi-task model, we adopt a personalized federation method, which includes similar user grouping based on Locality Sensitive Hashing. The way consumes less computational resources as well as does not expose any private information. We validate the effectiveness of FedSR on two real datasets. Further analysis reveals the performance improvement by FedSR.},

In this paper, we propose an error graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (EGNMF) to perform the manifold learning.

  abstract     = {Deep learning models such as deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) image classifiers have achieved outstanding performance over the last decade. However, these models are mostly trained with high-quality images drawn from publicly available datasets such as ImageNet. Recently, many researchers have evaluated the impact of low-quality image degradations on the performance of different neural network-based image classifiers. But, most of these studies generate low-quality images by synthetic modification of the high-quality images. Besides, most of the studies employed various image processing techniques to remove the image degradations and trained the DCNNs again to achieve better performance. But it has since been discovered that such methods could not improve the classification accuracy of DCNNs. The robustness of DCNNs based image classifiers trained on low-quality images resulting from natural factors common in autonomous driving and other intelligent system settings was rarely studied over the recent years. In this paper, we proposed a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based fusion of camera and radar features for improving the performance of DCNNs image classifiers trained on natural adverse weather data. CCA is a statistical approach that creates a highly discriminative feature vector by measuring the linear relationship between the camera and radar features. A spatial attention network was designed to re-weight the camera features before associating them with radar features in the CCA-feature fusion block. Our findings based on experimental evaluations have proven that, indeed, the performance of the DCNN models (i.e., Alex-Net and VGG-16-Net) is heavily affected by degradations arising from natural factors. Specifically, the DCNN models are more affected by the degradations arising from rainfall, foggy and nighttime conditions using Radiate and Carrada datasets. However, the proposed fusion frameworks have improved the performance of the individual sensing modalities significantly. The radar data has helped substantially in enhancing the fusion performance, mainly using rainfall data where the camera data is heavily affected.},

Specifically, we first propose semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorization for multi-view to learn the low-rank representation of each view. Then, a 3-order tensor is constructed and further decomposed into a low-rank tensor and a sparse tensor. Finally, we perform spectral clustering on the low-rank tensor to obtain the final clustering result.

Prompt learning devotes to resolving the data deficiency by reformulating downstream tasks with the help of prompt. The model performance of this method depends on the quality of the prompt. This paper proposes an adaptive prompting (AP) construction strategy using seq2seq-attention structure to acquire the semantic information of the input sequence. Our method of dynamically constructing adaptive prompts can not only improve the quality of prompt, but also can effectively generalize to other fields by constructing a pre-trained prompt with existing public labeled data.

  abstract     = {Recognition of Arabic-like scripts such as Persian and Urdu is more challenging than Latin-based scripts. This is due to the presence of a two-dimensional structure, context-dependent character shapes, spaces and overlaps, and placement of diacritics. We present an attention based encoder-decoder model that learns to read handwritten text in context. A novel localization penalty is introduced to encourage the model to attend only one location at a time when recognizing the next character. In addition, we comprehensively refine the only complete and publicly available handwritten Urdu dataset in terms of ground-truth annotations. We evaluate the model on both Urdu and Arabic datasets. For Urdu, contextual attention localization achieves $$82.06\%$$ character recognition rate and $$51.97\%$$ word recognition rate which represent more than $$2\times $$ improvement over existing bi-directional LSTM models. For Arabic, the model outperforms multi-directional LSTM models with $$77.47\%$$ character recognition rate and $$37.66\%$$ word recognition rate without performing any slant or skew correction.

Feature selection effectively solves high-dimensional minor sample problems by removing many irrelevant and redundant features and improving the algorithm&#39;s accuracy. In some information-theoretic-based feature selection algorithms, the problem is that choosing different parameters means choosing different feature selection algorithms. How to dynamically circumvent the pre-determined a priori parameters become an urgent problem to be solved. The paper proposes a dynamic weighted conditional relevance dispersion and redundancy analysis (WRRFS) algorithm for feature selection. Firstly, the algorithm uses mutual information to calculate feature correlations and redundancy between features. Secondly, calculate the mean of the feature correlation terms, and the parameter weights of the conditional feature correlation terms are dynamically adjusted using the standard deviation. Finally, WRRFS is validated against other feature selection algorithms on three classifiers using 12 different datasets with classification accuracy metrics (f1_macro,f1_micro, and f1_weighted). The experimental results show that the WRRFS algorithm can improve the quality of feature subsets and increase classification accuracy.},

Recently, the SNNs have been developed in hardware circuits to emulate the time encoding and information-processing aspects of the human brain in real-time. However, the hardware SNN systems are suffering from large hardware resource consumption due to the high complexity of computational units. In this paper, a novel hardware SNN system based on stochastic computing is proposed to address this problem. Pair-based spiking-timing-dependent plasticity, coupled with integrate-and-fire neurons are employed to design the SNN. Stochastic computing can simplify the computational components of multipliers, adders, and subtractors in conventional hardware SNNs, hence reduce the hardware resource cost. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches the proposed SNN system reduces the resource consumption by 58.0% (especially registers by $$\ge $$ 65.6%). In the meantime, the maximum normalized root mean square error between the proposed hardware and others is only 0.0097, which can maintain the behaviours of SNN. This work provides a beneficial alternative to the large-scale hardware SNN implementations.},

In this paper, we aimed to provide an accurate system for classifying epileptic EEG signals using an information fusion-based approach. To this effect, an innovative feature-level fusion methodology was presented. First, utilizing the theory of information, the EEG signals were characterized by two similarity indicators, including correntropy and Cauchy–Schwarz divergence. Then, different combining modes, including, stacking, adding, weighted sum, and maximum rules were used to combine the information of both similarity measures. Concurrently, a novel algorithm was also proposed to define the weights of each feature based on the information gain ratio (IGR). Finally, the probabilistic neural network and the k-nearest neighbor were implemented to detect the epileptic conditions. The EEGs of the Bonn database were used to appraise the framework. Promising classification rates were obtained for epilepsy detection. The results revealed the potent ability of the fusion approach based on maximum IGR in the improvement of the classifier performances.},

As one of the mainstream methods in the current recommendation system, the recommendation algorithm based on graph neural network can not only learn the cooperation signal between nodes, but also detect the nonlinear high-order information in node interaction. However, like the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm, the collaborative filtering method based on graph neural network only depends on the interaction information of existing users and projects, and the recommendation effect is poor in the scenario of sparse data. Although incorporating item attributes as auxiliary information into the recommendation algorithm can alleviate this problem to a certain extent, directly using the item attributes that users browse to construct user embedded vectors cannot contain users’ implicit preferences. Therefore, this paper constructs a user–user network based on the interaction information between users and projects, analyzes it by using community detection, divides user groups with common interests, mines the potential attributes of users, and designs a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on community detection and graph neural network. The research on two large real data sets shows that our method is superior to the standard recommendation method and the latest collaborative filtering recommendation method based on graph neural network.},

  abstract     = {Image retrieval has drawn growing attention due to the rapid emergence of images on the Internet. Due to the high storage and computation efficiency, hashing methods are widely employed in approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval. Existing deep supervised hashing methods mainly utilize the labels to analyze the semantic similarity and preserve it in hash codes, but the collected label information may be incomplete or unreliable in real-world. Meanwhile, the features extracted by a single convolutional neural network (CNN) from complex images are difficult to express the latent information, or potential to miss certain semantic information. Thus, this work further exploits existing knowledge from the pre-trained semantic features of higher quality, and proposes mixture of experts residual learning for Hamming hashing (MoE-hash), which brings in the experts for image hashing in Hamming space. Specifically, we separately extract the basic visual features by a CNN, and different semantic features by existing expert models. To better preserve the semantic information in compact hash codes, we learn the hash codes by the mixture of experts (MoE) residual learning block with max-margin t-distribution-based loss. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that our model can achieve clear improvement in retrieval performance, and validate the role of mixture of experts residual learning in image hashing task.},

Unlike the conventional multiple kernel learning techniques which utilizes a common similarity measure over the entire input space, with the aim of solely learning their models via linear combination of basis kernels in single Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our proposed model seeks to concurrently find multiple solutions in corresponding Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. To achieve this objective, we first derive our proposed model directly from the classical SVM model. Then, leveraging on the concept of multi- view data processing, we consider the original data as a multi - view data controlled by different sub models in our proposed model. The multi-view representations of the original data are subsequently transformed into ensemble kernel models where the linear classifiers are parameterized in multiple kernel spaces. This enables each model to co-optimize the learning of its optimal parameter via the minimization of a cumulative ensemble loss in multiple RKHSs. With this, there is an overall improvement in the accuracy of the classification task as well as the robustness of our proposed ensemble model. Since UCI machine learning data repository provides publicly available benchmark datasets, we evaluated our model by conducting experiments on several UCI classification and image datasets. The results of our proposed model were compared with other state-of-the-art MKL methods, such as SimpleMKL, EasyMKL, MRMKL, RMKL and PWMK.

However, the basic ELM still has some drawbacks, such as the tendency to over-fitting and the susceptibility to noisy data. By adding a regularization term to the basic ELM, the regularized extreme learning machine (R-ELM) can dramatically improve its generalization and stability. In the R-ELM, choosing an appropriate regularization parameter is critical since it can regulate the fitting and generalization capabilities of the model. In this paper, we propose the regularized functional extreme learning machine (RF-ELM), which employs the regularization functional instead of a preset regularization parameter for adaptively choosing appropriate regularization parameters. The regularization functional is defined according to output weights, and the successive approximation iterative algorithm is utilized to solve the output weights so that we can get their values simultaneously at each iteration step. We also developed a parallel version of RF-ELM (PRF-ELM) to deal with big data tasks. Furthermore, the analysis of convexity and convergence ensures the validity of the model training. Finally, the experiments on the function approximation and the UCI repository with or without noise data demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of our proposed models.},

  abstract     = {The application of classification and prediction algorithms in healthcare can facilitate the detection of specific vital signs, which can be used to treat or prevent disease. In this study, a new framework based on deep learning architectures is introduced for the human activity recognition. Our proposed framework uses biosensors, electrocardiography (ECG) sensors, inertial sensors, and small single-board computers to collect and analyse sensory information. ECG and inertial sensory information is converted to images, and novel preprocessing techniques are used effectively. We use convolutional neural networks (CNN) along with sensor fusion, random forest, and long short-term memory (LSTM) with gated recurrent unit (GRU). The evaluation of the proposed approaches is carried out by considering well-known models such as transfer learning with MobileNet, CNN+MobileNet combined, and support vector machine in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the effects of the Null class, which are commonly seen in popular health-related datasets, are also investigated. The results show that LSTM with GRU, RandomForest and CNN with sensor fusion provided the highest accuracies with 99%, 98% and 98%, respectively. Since edge computing using sensors with relatively limited processing power and capacities has recently become quite common, a comparison is also provided to show the efficiency and edge computability of the architectures proposed in this study. The number of parameters used, the size of the models, and the training times as well as the testing times are evaluated and compared. The random forest algorithm provides the best training and testing time results, while models of LSTM with GRU have the smallest model size.},

The point representation of point clouds can encode refined features, and the voxel representation provides an efficient processing framework, so we take advantage of both point representation and voxel representation of the point cloud in this paper. In the first stage, we add point density to the voxel feature encoding and extract voxel features by a 3D sparse convolutional network. In the second stage, the features of the raw point cloud are extracted and fused with the voxel features. To achieve the fast aggregation of voxel-to-point features, we design a neighbor voxels query method named NV-Query to find neighbor voxels directly through the voxel spatial coordinates of the points. The results on the KITTI and ONCE datasets show that NV2P-RCNN achieves higher detection precision compared with other existing methods.},

In this paper, a novel cascade attentive dropout strategy is proposed to alleviate the part domination problem, together with an improved global context module. We purposely discard attentive elements in both channel and space dimensions, and capture the inter-pixel and inter-channel dependencies to induce the model to better understand the global context.

  abstract     = {Recent deep learning-based person re-identification (RE-ID) approaches mainly adopt supervised learning, by which the network is trained with labels and tested in the same dataset. It has drawn increasingly great amount of attentions and achieved significantly competitive results. However, supervised RE-ID requires a large amount of manual and unaffordable labels in the specific domain, retarding the large-scale applications. To solve this problem and make RE-ID more practical in the real-world scenarios, we propose a novel unsupervised RE-ID method named unified domanial learning (UDL). UDL is trained with data from a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain, and then tested in the target domain, which resembles real-world application requirements. Two main components of UDL are: (1) Inter domain transfer learning (IDTL) is proposed based on generative adversarial network (GAN). IDTL can align the data distributions of different datasets to alleviate the huge domain gap by transferring the source domain images into the style of the target domain. (2) Intra domain trait mining (IDTM) is put forward which further excavates the potential information in the unlabeled target dataset, i.e., camera information and appearance information. IDTM is composed of camera invariance learning (CIL) and appearance similarity learning (ASL). CIL is utilized to extract camera style information using GAN technique and ASL is put forward to learn the appearance information by optimizing feature distances. Extensive experimental results on several widely-used datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 effectively demonstrate that UDL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a little margin.},

To alleviate these issues, in this article, we proposed a novel Scale-Aware Multi-Branch Region Collective Feature Enhancement Network (SARCF-NET) to optimize the network from three aspects to improve the overall performance of scene object detection: detection framework, feature extraction, and bounding box regression. SARCF-NET uses multi-branch and the sale-aware training scheme to adapt multi-scale objects. Meanwhile, regional collective feature units are added to each branch to utilize both senior and junior features sufficiently. Besides, a novel Regression-Sensitive Loss function is proposed to adjust the bounding box coordinates automatically without extra computation.

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised temporal action detection uses the extracted appearance and motion features to localize the action segments in untrimmed videos with only action category labels. Most previous methods detect action segments based on temporally local features, and employ the early fusion or the late fusion machine to combine the knowledge of two feature modalities. However, the temporally local features generally lead to incomplete detection results, and the above-mentioned fusion machines cannot fully use the complementary information between different modalities. In this paper, we propose the separately guided context-aware network to exploit the global contexts and sufficiently leverage different modality information to detect action segments. Specifically, we propose to construct graphs by modeling the co-occurrence relations between frames to gather the global contexts. To fully combine the complementary information of two modalities, the separately guided scheme is proposed, which utilizes two graphs for each feature modality to integrate the contexts revealed by the intra-modality and the cross-modality information respectively. This scheme sufficiently enhances frame representations based on two modalities and facilitates the detection of action frames. And we also present the co-occurrence relation learning strategy under weak supervision to better guide graphs in gathering contexts. Extensive experiments on the THUMOS14 dataset and the ActivityNet dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Particularly, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of 39.1% and 42.0% on the THUMOS14 and the ActivityNet dataset respectively under the IoU threshold 0.5.},

One common limitation in popular production function techniques is the requirement that all inputs and outputs must be positive numbers. There is a need to develop a production function analysis technique that is less restrictive in the assumptions it makes, and inputs it can process. This paper proposes such a general technique by linking fields of neural networks and econometrics. Specifically, two radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are proposed for stochastic production and cost frontier analyses. The functional forms of production and cost functions are considered unknown except that they are multivariate. Using simulated and real-world datasets, experiments are performed, and results are provided. The results illustrate that the proposed technique has broad applicability and performs equal to or better than the traditional stochastic frontier analysis technique.},

In order to improve the clustering performance, the previous work tries to explore the consistency and specificity between different views by making the common representation matrix as close to the representation matrix learned in each view as possible. However, the values of the elements corresponding to a similar degree of the strong or weak relationship often have different magnitude levels in the representation matrix learned in each view. In this situation, the above strategy will make the information of some views ignored or magnified. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering method in this paper. Because our proposed method can normalize the degree of the strong or weak relationship in each view to the unified measure standard by scaling the representation matrix learned in each view, the consistency and specificity between different views will be mined more effectively. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence and computation complexity of our numerical algorithm. The experimental results on several benchmark data sets indicate that our proposed method is not only effective but also efficient for the problem of multi-view subspace clustering.},

Statistics-based learning algorithms of ASPM, represented by adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN), conduct instance normalization and then perform an affine transformation on target features. These algorithms are computationally efficient and easy to embed in convolutional neural networks. Consequently, they are widely used in image synthesis tasks to control the style of the resulting images. However, the style of stylized images may be a combination of content and stylized images, which suggests that these methods do not transform styles accurately. In this work, we rethink the function of AdaIN in controlling style. We show that the role of AdaIN is to (1) give each input content image a specific optimization target, (2) dynamically set cross-channel correlations, and (3) act as a feature selector after combining it with an activation function. Accordingly, we propose adaptive style modulation (AdaSM), which fully leverages the three roles mentioned above and thereby enables more precise control of global style. Experimental results show that AdaSM provides superior style controllability, alleviates the style blending problem, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in artistic style transfer tasks.},

For multichannel 2D (M2D) data, a multichannel OMRAE (OMMRAE) is proposed by training the output weights to rebuild each channel of inputs respectively. In this way, the structural information of each channel and the interaction between channels are explored. Then, a double-side structure using 2 OMMRAEs to simultaneously extracts the row and column structure information of M2D is developed. At last, a novel hierarchical matrix randomized neural networks is constructed for one-class classification where each layer passes information by bilinear mapping derived from DMMRAE. Experiments are conducted on 2 benchmark datasets for the effectiveness demonstration. Comparisons to several state-of-the-art AEs reveal that the proposed OMMRAE/DMMRAE can obtain better performance with a compact network size.

However, the increased performance of deep learning models is often accompanied by an increase in their depth and width, which conflicts with the storage, energy consumption, and computational power of edge devices. Knowledge distillation, as an effective model compression method, can transfer knowledge from complex teacher models to student models. Self-distillation is a special type of knowledge distillation, which does not to require a pre-trained teacher model. However, existing self-distillation methods rarely consider how to effectively use the early features of the model. Furthermore, most self-distillation methods use features from the deepest layers of the network to guide the training of the branches of the network, which we find is not the optimal choice. In this paper, we found that the feature maps obtained by early feature fusion do not serve as a good teacher to guide their own training. Based on this, we propose a selective feature fusion module and further obtain a new self-distillation method, knowledge fusion distillation. Extensive experiments on three datasets have demonstrated that our method has comparable performance to state-of-the-art distillation methods.

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks’ application in automatic image annotation is becoming more mature. However, there are still several problems. First, the feature data of the original image obtained by the feature extraction algorithm, such as color features and gradient features, all have the problem of slight intra-class variance and significant inter-class variance. Second, merely utilize the graph convolution neural networks to construct samples or labeled graphs, limiting multimodality’s fusion and expansion. This paper uses a parallel graph convolution network based on feature fusion for automatic image annotation. By fusing the sample features, the inherent defects of the features extracted by a single model are reduced, and the annotation performance under the condition of semi-supervised learning is improved. Experiments on three benchmark image annotation datasets show that this method is superior to the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Facial expression recognition (FER) plays an important role in human-computer interaction and has been introduced in fatigue detection, human-computer interactive games, social robot, teaching effect analysis, and so on. However, not all the features extracted from facial images are suitable for FER. Moreover, individual spatial features or temporal features have certain limitations in characterizing facial expressions. Therefore, it is necessary to extract effective features suitable for facial expression recognition and to leverage effective fusion method to improve the accuracy of FER. In this paper, we propose a facial expression recognition method based on spatial-temporal fusion with attention mechanism(STAFER) which is composed of the spatial feature extractor (SFE), the temporal feature extractor (TFE), and spatial-temporal fusion (STF). Firstly, a 10 layers neural network of pretrained VGG16 is applied to the backbone of SFE to extract the spatial features of facial expression. To filter out the features that are irrelevant of facial expression, the attention mechanism is applied to the first three convolutional blocks. Secondly, TFE is constructed with convolutional blocks and LSTM. Facial expression sequences are fed to the convolutional modules to extract low-level features, and then these features are fed into the LSTM to obtain temporal features. Finally, a decision-level fusion strategy is utilized to fuse spatial and temporal features. The experiemntal results demonstrated that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.05% on CK+ and 88.34% on Oulu-CASIA, which is competitive in comparison with some state-of-art methods.},

Firstly, to make the constructed model fit the practice better, the dynamic of each agent is represented by a two-time-scale system and the transition rate matrix of the Markov chain is assumed to be partially unknown. Then, a secure consensus protocol is designed to deal with the hybrid cyber-attacks and guarantee the average consensus can be achieved with a prescribed $$H_{\infty }$$ performance. Based on the stochastic analysis approach and Lyapunov stability method, some sufficient conditions are given in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, the desired secure consensus protocol gains can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Finally, an illustrative example is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, some prior knowledge hidden in multi-view data cannot be fully exploited in existing matrix factorization based multi-view learning approaches. In this paper, we present a robust dual-graph regularized deep matrix factorization (RDDMF) approach for multi-view clustering. Specifically, it integrates the dual-graph regularizers and the sparse constraints into the deep matrix factorization framework. Therefore, the proposed RDDMF approach discovers the geometric structures of both the data and the feature space by adding the dual graph regularization term into deep matrix factorization in each layer. Meanwhile, the sparse constraints are imposed on the coefficient matrix of each layer to improve the robustness of our model. Besides, we design an efficient optimization strategy of the proposed model and give its convergence rate. Numerous experiments on four well-known datasets show our proposed RDDMF approach is superior to several state-of-the-art approaches in multi-view clustering.},

Aiming at problems that the existing transfer learning algorithms only utilize the data in source domain to assist the learning tasks of target domain without considering the effect of target data to source domain, the selectivity bias of knowledge and scarce labeled samples, this paper proposed a collaboration mutual transfer learning algorithm based on support vector machine -CMATLSVM.CMATLSVM realizes multiple mutual learnings between source and target domains through the collaborative mutual assistance. In collaborative mutual assistance, in order to further improve the classification effect of target domain task, a similarity measure is introduced, which restricts negative transfer in constraints of objective function. At the same time representative dataset in source domain are obtained to reduce the size of training data and improve training efficiency.

Firstly, features with the same size of source images are extracted by the first layer of pre-trained VGG16 respectively. Then, based on the extracted features, cross attention is calculated to distinguish the differences between infrared and visible-light image, and the spatial attention is computed to reflect the characteristics of infrared and visible-light image. After that, weight maps are gained through modulating the cross attention and spatial attention, based on which the source images are pre-fused. Finally, Gaussian blur-based details injection is performed to further enhance the details of the pre-fused image. Experiment results show that, compared with the traditional multi-scale and state-of-the-art deep learning-based fusion methods, our approach can achieve better performance both in subjective and objective evaluations.},

In this survey, we aim to provide a review of micro-expression recognition based on LBP, optical flow, and deep learning. We first introduce the current commonly used micro-expression datasets. Then the three mainstream classical methods, LBP, optical flow, and deep learning, are described and summarized respectively. The existing methods in the last 5 years are discussed in regard to datasets, pre-processing, evaluation metrics and accuracy. Finally, we explain the shortcomings and challenges of micro-expression recognition and propose the future directions. This can help researchers to more quickly understand the current status of research, problems and future development directions, and provide a reference point for further research.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the deep neural network has been introduced as an effective learning method in many natural language processing (NLP) applications. One of these applications is named entity recognition (NER), which is considered a vital role in the NLP systems (e.g., question/answering systems and translators). Since extracting entities traditionally requires massive computations to identify features manually (e.g., specific dictionaries), deep neural network methods have been introduced to overcome this challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture that combines two different models of deep learning, namely convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM), to extract more efficient properties from an input sentence. The CNN extracts the local features of the individual words, and the LSTM network formulates the contextual information of the input sentence. In addition, thanks to an attention layer in our architecture, the performance has been improved. We implemented our experiments on two public datasets, CoNLL03 and ACE05. Evaluations demonstrate that employing the components of word-level CNN to capture local information of the input sentence and attention mechanism to focus on more relevant words leads to an enhancement in the performance of the NER system and establishes state-of-the-art results. Our architecture achieves F-score 92.00 and 86.34 on the two datasets CoNLL03 and ACE05, respectively. Comparing the previous works that utilize manually feature extraction computations or employ fewer components in their systems, the superiority of the proposed architecture in terms of accuracy is proven.},

Most previous methods mine the intra-modal interactions and inter-modal interactions independently, which may lead to a fragmented understanding of the visual-linguistic modalities. Different from them, in this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a unified multi-modal Co-Occurrence transformer Reasoning Network, dubbed as COREN, to comprehensively discover the semantic correlations of the two modalities. Specifically, we resort to a unified multi-modal transformer encoder to decompose the intra-modal and inter-modal co-occurrence relationships reasoning into a two-stage learning architecture. In the first learning stage, we utilize the multi-modal transformer as a shared siamese encoder for both visual and textual branch to reason the intra-modal co-occurrence relationships. In this way, we obtain modality-specific contextualized representations for each input image and text instance, and the model is equipped with the representation and reasoning ability of both visual and textual entities. In the second learning stage, we stack the visual and textual features together and jointly feed them into the same multi-modal transformer encoder to reason the inter-modal co-occurrence relationships between the two modalities. Additionally, we propose a novel Adaptive Similarity Aggregation (ASA) module to achieve a more accurate cross-modal similarity measurement based on the generated contextualized representations. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.},

First of all, to facilitate the analysis of the second-order derivative caused by the inertial term, two intermediate variables are introduced to transfer complex-valued inertial delayed neural networks (CVIDNNs) into the first-order differential equation form. Next, CVIDNNs are developed using T–S fuzzy rules. By using the Lyapunov stability theory, inequality scaling skills and adjustable algebraic criteria for T–S fuzzy CVIDNNs as well as the upper bound of the settling time for synchronization, are derived. Finally, one numerical example with simulations is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

It aims to obtain the aspect term, the associated opinion term and sentiment polarity, so called the triplet in reviews. Most existing studies can only learn the word-level context information and capture the superficial interactions between aspect and opinion terms. In contrast, our proposed span-based aspect sentiment triplet extraction model incorporates abundant syntax information, namely the span-level part-of-speech, constituent syntax, and dependency syntax information. Therefore, our model can learn both the connections between multiple words within the span and the interactions between aspect and opinion terms, and thus improve the performance on triplet extraction. Extensive experimental results show that our model outperforms previous models on four benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

We aim to identify a specific cancer experimental model (Walker-256 tumor) in the Enteric Nervous System (ENS) cells. The ENS image database used in our experimental evaluation comprises 1248 images taken from thirteen rats distributed in two classes: control/healthy or sick. The images were created with three distinct contrast settings targeting different ENS cells: ENC, EGC, or both. We extracted handcrafted and non-handcrafted features to provide a comprehensive classification approach using SVM as the core classifier. We also applied Late Fusion techniques to evaluate the complementarity between feature sets obtained in different scenarios. In the best case, we achieved an F1-score of 0.9903 by combining classifiers built from different image types (ENC and EGC), using Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) features.},

Therefore, the forecasting model selection of time series has become a new research hotspot in the data analysis field. However, most of the existing meta learning forecasting model selection methods rely on manual selection of features, which leads to low efficiency and lack of objectivity. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved meta learning framework for deep learning time series forecasting model selection. Inspired by computer vision, we transform one -dimensional time series into two-dimensional images, and use convolution neural network to train and classify time series images (model selection). Moreover, in order to deal with the over fitting problem caused by small sample datasets, the sliding window data augmentation method is used to improve the accuracy of small datasets model selection. The large-scale empirical study on M3 data sets shows that the framework has better model selection accuracy and smaller forecasting error than the recurrent neural network (RNN), back propagation neural network and traditional time series image algorithms. In addition, compared with the traditional time series image method, RNN and BP, the classification rate (model selection accuracy) of this algorithm is improved by 6.5%, 4.4% and 3.2%, respectively.},

However, most recent works mainly focus on high-level semantics, ignoring the lower level features, which affects the generality of representations. Moreover, many methods do not take into account the adverse information in the features, which limits the performance of learned representations. Considering these issues, this paper proposes a novel multi-level self-supervised representation learning framework (MLSRL) via triple-way attention fusion and local similarity optimization to improve the generalization and quality of the learned representations. Concretely, multi-level features obtained from self-supervised learning are fused effectively by the triple-way attention fusion module, which captures the importance of features channel-by-channel and fuses the weighted features to make the learned representations more abundant and general. Furthermore, we consider the influence of redundant or irrelevant information on feature quality, and design a novel local similarity optimization strategy based on mutual information for optimizing the fused features, and thus improving the quality of representations. Experiments on public Cifar10, Cifar100, Stl10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in image representation learning.},

The new idea or new consideration which have not been proposed in any other literature is that the proposed grey prediction criterion has been combined with the artificial control schemes for the real-world application in mechanical systems. This mode permits the forecasting approximation to be learned by a training process which contains a new whitening equation. It is needed to prepare the structure and time series, compared with other models, according to the regularity of actual specimens in advance, therefore this model of NODGM can provide comprehensive applications as well as learning the properties of distinct data specimens.

In this paper, we thoroughly study the degradation mechanism of low-light images and design a pre-denoising 3D multi-scale fusion attention network (P3DMFE) with Retinex decomposition theory. This work is divided into three modules, firstly, The proposed three-branch decomposition module decouples the original space into three sub-spaces: reflection decomposition, illumination decomposition and noise decomposition, where the noise decomposition allows us to obtain the higher-quality reflection map and illumination map. Secondly, the 3D multi-scale fusion improvement module removes the noise map and performs image reshaping, structure restoration and detail restoration on the combined reflection map and illumination map. Thirdly, the Illumination improvement module provides a suitable illumination map. The experimental results show that the proposed P3DMFE can not only enrich the details and improve the brightness and contrast of low-light images, but also have a good denoising effect. Specifically, the proposed method can achieve 22.04 PSNR, 0.84 SSIM, 1250.4 LOE and 5.03 NIQE on LOL dataset, which are the best performance compared with some state-of-the-art methods. The experiments on common low-light datasets such as NPE, VV, MIT5K, MEF, LIME, and DICM also verify the good generalization ability and superiority of the proposed method.},

Thus, it needs an algorithm to understand the visual content of a given image and translates it into a sequence of output words. In this paper, a local relation network is designed over the objects and image regions which not only discovers the relationship between the object and the image regions but also generates significant context-based features corresponding to every region in the image. Inspired by transformer model, we have employed a multilevel attention comprising of self-attention and guided attention to focus on a given image region and its related image regions, thus enhancing the image representation capability of the proposed method. Finally, a variant of traditional long-short term memory, which uses an attention mechanism, is employed which focuses on relevant contextual information, spatial locations, and deep visual features. With these measures, the proposed model encodes an image in an improved way, which gives the model significant cues and thus leads to improved caption generation. Extensive experiments have been performed on three benchmark datasets: Flickr30k, MSCOCO, and Nocaps. On Flickr30k, the obtained evaluation scores are 31.2 BLEU@4, 23.5 METEOR, 51.5 ROUGE, 65.6 CIDEr and 17.2 SPICE. On MSCOCO, the proposed model has attained 42.4 BLEU@4, 29.4 METEOR, 59.7 ROUGE, 125.7 CIDEr and 23.2 SPICE. The overall CIDEr score on Nocaps dataset achieved by the proposed model is 114.3.

We leverage Discrete Fourier Transform to convert the variation of the post’s number related to a specific social event to the frequency domain to obtain the temporal feature of the rumor, and we apply the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm to reduce the amount of calculation. Then we build a rumor interactive graph based on the reply and repost relationships and we use multiple independent Graph Attention Network modules to extract interactive features.

The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm expands the recognition range of existing types of channel codes, and for the first time completes the blind recognition of five types of channel codes.

In this study, we introduce the Co-Membership-based Generic Anomalous Communities Detection Algorithm (referred as to CMMAC), a novel and generic method that utilizes the information of vertices co-membership in multiple communities. CMMAC is domain-free and almost unaffected by communities’ sizes and densities. Specifically, we train a classifier to predict the probability of each vertex in a community being a member of the community. We then rank the communities by the aggregated membership probabilities of each community’s vertices. The lowest-ranked communities are considered to be anomalous. Furthermore, we present an algorithm for generating a community-structured random network enabling the infusion of anomalous communities to facilitate research in the field. We utilized it to generate two datasets, composed of thousands of labeled anomaly-infused networks, and published them. We experimented extensively on thousands of simulated, and real-world networks, infused with artificial anomalies. CMMAC outperformed other existing methods in a range of settings. Additionally, we demonstrated that CMMAC can identify abnormal communities in real-world unlabeled networks in different domains, such as Reddit and Wikipedia.},

We, next, verify our model’s performance on NCBI disease, BC5CDR disease, and BC5CDR chemical databases, which are widely used named entity normalization datasets in the bioinformatics field. We also tested our model with our own financial named entity normalization dataset to validate the efficacy for more general applications. Using the constructed dataset, we differentiate named entity pairs. Our model achieved the highest named entity normalization performances in terms of various evaluation metrics. Our proposed model when tested on four different datasets achieved state-of-the-art results.},

Extracting the case elements in the news text has great significance for downstream case field natural language processing tasks. In view of the case field relevance and intrinsic relevance of the case elements, this paper proposes a joint case element extraction method based on case domain correlation and graph convolutional network: modeling sentence contextual information by bi-directional long short-term memory networks, then using it to predict the case field correlation for guarantying the elements’ relevance of cases by joint learning; and modeling the dependency relationship of candidate elements by graph convolutional network to capture its intrinsic relevance.

A plethora of methods and different approaches have targeted image denoising problem. In this manuscript, we propose a novel method which brings dense and residual blocks together with dilated convolutions in image denoising applications. The proposed method introduces new strategies for proper combination of dense residual blocks and dilated convolution layers. The resulting approach is called as Densely connected Dilated Residual Network (DDR-Net). The proposed DDR-Net extracts multi-scale information by employing dilated convolutions. Use of dilated convolutions leads to improved receptive field performance while keeping the complexity of the network in check. Residual and dense connections on the other hand prevent loss of information along the DDR-Net pipeline. Simulations are performed in both color and grayscale image denoising settings. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that the proposed network architecture leads to improved results when compared to multiple high performance convolutional denoising networks from the recent literature.},

  abstract     = {Ramsey’s theory (RAM) from combinatorics and network theory goes looking for regularities and repeated patterns inside structures equipped with nodes and edges. RAM represents the outcome of a dual methodological commitment: by one side a top-down approach evaluates the possible arrangement of specific subgraphs when the number of graph’s vertices is already known, by another side a bottom-up approach calculates the possible number of graph’s vertices when the arrangement of specific subgraphs is already known. Since natural neural networks are often represented in terms of graphs, we propose to use RAM for the analytical and computational assessment of the human brain connectome, i.e., the distinctive anatomical/functional structure provided with vertices and edges at different coarse-grained scales. We retrospectively examined the literature regarding graph theory in neuroscience, looking for hints that might be related to the RAM framework. At first, we establish that the peculiar network required by RAM, i.e., a graph characterized by every vertex connected with all the others, does exist inside the human brain connectome. Then, we argue that the RAM approach to nervous networks might be able to trace unexpected functional interactions and unexplored motifs shared between different cortical and subcortical subareas. Furthermore, we describe how remarkable RAM outcomes, such as the Ramsey’s theorem and the Ramsey’s number, might contribute to quantify novel properties of neuronal networks and uncover still unknown anatomical connexions.},

Secondly, with the aid of proper Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), some sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of synchronization error system are derived and the gain of the controller is obtained by using linear matrix inequality (LMI) and proper integral term estimation methods. Finally, we use Euler–Maruyama numerical mechanism to simulate the drive-response systems and the error system, which shows the good convergence performance of our synchronization model.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an estimate-based updating method of the target network for deep reinforcement learning, which improves the policy learning performance by adaptively adjusting the update rates of the target network.The traditional update rule of the target network is to follow the main network at a fixed update rate. However, due to the randomness and inconsistent objective function of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent in the main network, the traditional technique has the problem of discarding a certain policy learning speed or stability. Although the recent method enhances the robustness of parameter updating locally, the selection of its designed value still has a trade-off similar to the traditional way.A new update rule is derived to enable policy learning to maintain stability with low learning latency, which dynamically adjusts the update rates based on moment estimates of the difference between the main and target networks. The adaptive update removes the limitation of the designed value on the update rates of the target network, preventing the target network from lagging and keeping it stable.We conduct an outlier suppression analysis to illustrate the proposed method’s ability to repress outliers by adjusting the update rate. Furthermore, we consider a saturation function to boost its reliability and numerically demonstrate its ability to adjust the update rate. Finally, the simulation experiments verify its superiority. Our method outperforms the commonly used traditional method by $$18.05\%$$ on the comprehensive evaluation.},

Firstly, using the comparison principle for FO systems with multi-order, the stability of FO nonlinear systems with multi-order is treated similarly to the stability of incommensurate FO linear systems. Then, adopting the stability results of incommensurate FO linear systems, an asymptotic stability criterion for FONN is established. The proposed method is valid for investigating the stability and synchronization of uncertain FONN and FOMNN with multi-order.

  abstract     = {Recently, graph neural networks have achieved good performance in graph representation learning. However, most graph neural networks only utilize node low-frequency signals and destroy node similarity when aggregating graph structure and node features, which limits their ability to represent graph-structured data. Therefore, we propose a node similarity preserving graph convolutional network based on full-frequency information (FSP-GCN). It extracts relevant information to the greatest extent from graph structure and node features while preserving node similarity for aggregation. Precisely, to better capture full-frequency information, we propose an improved aggregation component called MFGCN that adopts a multi-head attention mechanism to integrate signals in different frequency domains adaptively. Then we design a node similarity aggregation method to aggregate a k-nearest neighbor(kNN) graph constructed from the original graph with the feature graph learned from the MFGCN aggregation component to preserve node similarity. Finally, we employ contrastive learning to preserve node similarity further. We also compare the performance of the FSP-GCN model with that of ten real-world networks, using well-known assortative and disassortative datasets. The results demonstrate that FSP-GCN offers significant performance improvement compared to representative baselines. In addition, extensive comparative experiments are conducted on the robustness of the model and alleviating the over-smoothing problem. The results show that the FSP-GCN model can effectively alleviate the over-smoothing problem and resist the adversarial attack of the graph structure.},

Tuning the deep network with a large number of hyperparameters to maximize performance would be an excruciating task that requires lots of time and engineering efforts. To construct that high-performance architecture, experts should go through a lot of trial and error. Neural Architecture Search is a way to automatically fabricate an accurate network architecture. An evolutionary algorithm called Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) with a new crossover operation based on the multiple Sequence Alignment algorithm is proposed in this paper to construct an appropriate neural network without the burden of building manually. This new method has a remarkable improvement over a standard CGP only by adding a crossover operator. The datasets for training on the proposed method were CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results show that it achieves a good balance between accuracy and the number of trainable parameters compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.},

Therefore, this paper presents a novel CNN to detect moving objects called Two-Frame CNN, 2FraCNN. Unlike best-ranked algorithms in CDnet14, 2FraCNN is a non-transfer learning model and employs temporal information to estimate the motion of moving objects. The architecture of 2FraCNN is inspired by how the optical flow helps to estimate motion, and its core is the FlowNet architecture. 2FraCNN processes temporal information through the concatenation of two consecutive frames and an Encoder-Decoder architecture. 2FraCNN includes a novel training scheme to deal with unbalanced pixel classes background/foreground. 2FraCNN was evaluated using three different schemes: the CDnet14 benchmark for a state-of-the-art comparison; against human performance metric intervals for a realistic evaluation; and for practical purposes with the performance instrument PVADN that considers the quantitative criteria of performance, speed, auto-adaptability, documentation, and novelty. Findings show that 2FraCNN has a performance comparable to the top ten algorithms in CDnet14 and is one of the best twelve in the PVADN evaluation. Also, 2FraCNN demonstrated that can solve many video challenges categories with human-like performance, such as dynamic backgrounds, jittering, shadow, bad weather, and thermal cameras, among others. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that 2FraCNN is a robust algorithm solving different video conditions with competent performance regarding state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The map is defined in an efficient way by assigning the proper output value to each square (or pixel) in the 2D map. The experiments show that the maps defined by both methods: (1) allow to understand visually the data distribution of a classification or regression problem; (2) their performances are very near to the state-of-the-art support vector classification and regression, including wrappers; and (3) they are very fast, between 1 and 5 orders of magnitude faster than the other approaches, spending less than 1 min to classify datasets with 5 million patterns.

To provide personal recommendations and improve the performance of the recommender system, it is necessary to integrate side information along with user-item interactions. The integration of context is a key success factor in recommendation systems because it allows catering for user preferences and opinions, especially when this pertains to the circumstances surrounding the interaction between users and items. In this paper, we propose a context-aware Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion which captures structural information and integrates the user’s opinion on items along with the surrounding context on edges and static features of user and item nodes. Our graph encoder produces user and item representations with respect to context, features and opinion. The decoder takes the aggregated embeddings to predict the user-item score considering the surrounding context. We have evaluated the performance of our model on 14 five publicly available datasets and compared it with state-of-the-art algorithms. Throughout this we show how it can effectively integrate user opinion along with surrounding context to produce a final node representation which is aware of the favourite circumstances of the particular node.},

  abstract     = {Within the design of a machine learning-based solution for classification or regression problems, variable selection techniques are often applied to identify the input variables, which mainly affect the considered target. The selection of such variables provides very interesting advantages, such as lower complexity of the model and of the learning algorithm, reduction of computational time and improvement of performances. Moreover, variable selection is useful to gain a profound knowledge of the considered problem. High correlation in variables often produces multiple subsets of equally optimal variables, which makes the traditional method of variable selection unstable, leading to instability and reducing the confidence of selected variables. Stability identifies the reproducibility power of the variable selection method. Therefore, having a high stability is as important as the high precision of the developed model. The paper presents an automatic procedure for variable selection in classification (binary and multi-class) and regression tasks, which provides an optimal stability index without requiring any a priori information on data. The proposed approach has been tested on different small datasets, which are unstable by nature, and has achieved satisfactory results.},

  abstract     = {Automatic classification tasks on structured data have been revolutionized by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but the focus has been on binary and nominal classification tasks. Only recently, ordinal classification (where class labels present a natural ordering) has been tackled through the framework of CNNs. Also, ordinal classification datasets commonly present a high imbalance in the number of samples of each class, making it an even harder problem. Focus should be shifted from classic classification metrics towards per-class metrics (like AUC or Sensitivity) and rank agreement metrics (like Cohen’s Kappa or Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient). We present a new CNN architecture based on the Ordinal Binary Decomposition (OBD) technique using Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC). We aim to show experimentally, using four different CNN architectures and two ordinal classification datasets, that the OBD+ECOC methodology significantly improves the mean results on the relevant ordinal and class-balancing metrics. The proposed method is able to outperform a nominal approach as well as already existing ordinal approaches, achieving a mean performance of $${{\,\mathrm{\textit{RMSE}}\,}}= 1.0797$$ for the Retinopathy dataset and $${{\,\mathrm{\textit{RMSE}}\,}}= 1.1237$$ for the Adience dataset averaged over 4 different architectures.},

  abstract     = {Many of today’s decision making systems deployed in the real world are not static—they are changing and adapting over time, a phenomenon known as model adaptation takes place. Because of their wide reaching influence and potentially serious consequences, the need for transparency and interpretability of AI-based decision making systems is widely accepted and thus have been worked on extensively—e.g. a very prominent class of explanations are contrasting explanations which try to mimic human explanations. However, usually, explanation methods assume a static system that has to be explained. Explaining non-static systems is still an open research question, which poses the challenge how to explain model differences, adaptations and changes. In this contribution, we propose and (empirically) evaluate a general framework for explaining model adaptations and differences by contrasting explanations. We also propose a method for automatically finding regions in data space that are affected by a given model adaptation—i.e. regions where the internal reasoning of the other (e.g. adapted) model changed—and thus should be explained. Finally, we also propose a regularization for model adaptations to ensure that the internal reasoning of the adapted model does not change in an unwanted way.},

  abstract     = {Subspace clustering (SC) exploits the potential capacity of self-expressive modeling of unsupervised learning frameworks, representing each data point as a linear combination of the other related data points. Advanced self-expressive approaches construct an affinity matrix from the representation coefficients by imposing an additional regularization, reflecting the prior data distribution. An affine constraint is widely used for regularization in subspace clustering studies according on the grounds that, in real-world applications, data points usually lie in a union of multiple affine subspaces rather than linear subspaces. However, a strict affine constraint is not flexible enough to handle the real-world cases, as the observed data points are always corrupted by noise and outliers. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of scalable affine constraint to the SC formulation. Specifically, each coefficient vector is constrained to sum up to a soft scalar s rather than 1. The proposed method can estimate the most appropriate value of scalar s in the optimization stage, adaptively enhancing the clustering performance. Besides, as clustering benefits from multiple representations, we extend the scalable affine constraint to a multi-view clustering framework designed to achieve collaboration among the different representations adopted. An efficient optimization approach based on ADMM is developed to minimize the proposed objective functions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering approach constrained by scalable affine regularisation, with superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Filter pruning is one of the main methods of neural network model compression. Existing filter pruning methods rely more on experience based on manual techniques and are less efficient, while local optimal solutions are prone to appear based on greedy or heuristic algorithms. Some researchers use reinforcement learning to determine the compression strategy automatically but lack the guidance of network characteristics and prior knowledge, and the pruning efficiency needs to be improved. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning pruning method based on prior knowledge to address these issues. Firstly, we rank the filters globally and obtain the position variables α, k, and the rank scaling factor r. Then, the relevant variables of the filter are passed into the deep deterministic policy gradient agent as prior knowledge through the concept of defined importance filters. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based automated pruning method is used to iteratively perform filter selection and parameter optimization. We verify the effectiveness of this method through extensive experiments. The experiments use three mainstream neural network models, including VGG, ResNet, and MobileNet, to compare the performance of our method with others on the CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets. On the ImageNet dataset, when the accuracy of MobileNetV2 is only reduced by 0.82%, there are only 59.62% of the original FLOPs and 48.4% of the parameters.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning has dramatically improved state of the art in many practical applications. However, this utility is highly dependent on fine-tuning of hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, and network initialization. Although many first-order adaptive gradient algorithms (e.g., Adam, AdaGrad) have been proposed to adjust the learning rate, they are vulnerable to the initial learning rate and network structure in the training over-parameterized models, especially in the dynamic online setting. Therefore, the main challenge of using deep learning in practice is how to reduce the cost of tuning hyperparameters. To address this problem, we integrate the adaptive strategy of Radhakrishnan et al. and the acceleration strategy of Ghadimi et al. to propose a fast adaptive online gradient algorithm, FAOGD. The adaptive strategy we adopt only adjusts the learning rate according to the historical gradient and training loss value, while the acceleration strategy is the heavy-ball momentum used to accelerate the training of deep models. The proposed FAOGD enjoys merit that there is no need to tune hyperparameters related to the learning rate, which thus saves much unnecessary computational overhead. It is also shown that FAOGD can obtain the regret bound of $$O\left( {\sqrt{T} } \right) $$ , matching the Adam and AdaGrad using the empirical learning rate. Simulation results in the over-parameterized neural networks clearly show that FAOGD outperforms existing algorithms. Furthermore, FAOGD is also robust to network structures and batch size.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has shown remarkable advantages in many fields. Although the image recognition capabilities and deep neural network (DNN) have developed rapidly in recent years, relevant studies have confirmed that DNN will be attacked by well-crafted images, resulting in model recognition errors. The adversarial examples generated by the traditional black-box attack are not smooth enough and have poor transferability. We note that the interpretive method of neural network may help us find the focus of neural networks. Therefore, in this paper, in order to reduce the distortion of the adversarial examples and improve the transferability. We take advantage of softmax gradient layer-wise relevance propagation (SGLRP) in distinguishing which pixels have made important contributions in classification to guide the neural network to focus on the wrong regions by providing relevance scores, and perform experiments on a series of classical deep neural networks. The results demonstrate that by minimizing the loss function composed of the SGLRP objective function based on cosine similarity, we can effectively generate transferable adversarial examples with high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR, 33.0554dB) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM, 0.9617), achieving an average fooling rate of more than 87.53% on several DNNs. Compared with traditional attack methods, the proposed attack schema focus more on the common semantic features of DNNs, shows good transferability and the ability of generating high-quality adversarial examples.},

  abstract     = {The learning process and hyper-parameter optimization of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning (DL) architectures is considered one of the most challenging machine learning problems. Several past studies have used gradient-based back propagation methods to train DL architectures. However, gradient-based methods have major drawbacks such as stucking at local minimums in multi-objective cost functions, expensive execution time due to calculating gradient information with thousands of iterations and needing the cost functions to be continuous. Since training the ANNs and DLs is an NP-hard optimization problem, their structure and parameters optimization using the meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms has been considerably raised. MH algorithms can accurately formulate the optimal estimation of DL components (such as hyper-parameter, weights, number of layers, number of neurons, learning rate, etc.). This paper provides a comprehensive review of the optimization of ANNs and DLs using MH algorithms. In this paper, we have reviewed the latest developments in the use of MH algorithms in the DL and ANN methods, presented their disadvantages and advantages, and pointed out some research directions to fill the gaps between MHs and DL methods. Moreover, it has been explained that the evolutionary hybrid architecture still has limited applicability in the literature. Also, this paper classifies the latest MH algorithms in the literature to demonstrate their effectiveness in DL and ANN training for various applications. Most researchers tend to extend novel hybrid algorithms by combining MHs to optimize the hyper-parameters of DLs and ANNs. The development of hybrid MHs helps improving algorithms performance and capable of solving complex optimization problems. In general, the optimal performance of the MHs should be able to achieve a suitable trade-off between exploration and exploitation features. Hence, this paper tries to summarize various MH algorithms in terms of the convergence trend, exploration, exploitation, and the ability to avoid local minima. The integration of MH with DLs is expected to accelerate the training process in the coming few years. However, relevant publications in this way are still rare.},

  abstract     = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is crucial research direction for the recommendation, with the goal of predicting the probability that users will click on candidate items. There are studies indicates that users’ next click behavior is influenced by their last few clicks; therefore, effective modeling of user behavior sequences to extract user interest representations is an important research topic in CTR prediction. Various networks such as RNN, and transformer, have been applied to implicitly extract user interest in the sequence. However, these studies focus on designing complex network structures for better user behavior modeling, while ignoring the fact that the training methods used in current CTR prediction models may limit the model performance. Specifically, owing to the single training objective of the CTR prediction model, the sequence interest extractor component in the model will not be fully trained due to overemphasis on the final prediction effect during the training process. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a recommendation model based on self-supervised learning to pretrain the transformer (SSPT4Rec), which divides the training into two phases: pretraining and fine-tuning. The transformer is trained by a four-classification pretext task in the pretraining phase, and the weights obtained from the pretraining are used to initialize the transformer in the fine-tuning phase and to fine-tune it in the recommendation task. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets reveal that the SSPT4Rec method improves the feature extraction capability of transformer as an interest extractor and outperforms the existing model.},

  abstract     = {Early diagnosis plays a key role in prevention and treatment of skin cancer. Several machine learning techniques for accurate detection of skin cancer from medical images have been reported. Many of these techniques are based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which enable training the models based on limited amounts of training data. However, the classification accuracy of these models still tends to be severely limited by the scarcity of representative images from malignant tumours. We propose a novel ensemble-based convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture where multiple CNN models, some of which are pre-trained and some are trained only on the data at hand, along with auxiliary data in the form of metadata associated with the input images, are combined using a meta-learner. The proposed approach improves the model’s ability to handle limited and imbalanced data. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed technique using a dataset with 33,126 dermoscopic images from 2056 patients. We evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in terms of the F1-measure, area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), and area under the PR-curve (AUC-PR), and compare it with that of seven different benchmark methods, including two recent CNN-based techniques. The proposed technique compares favourably in terms of all the evaluation metrics.},

Our method is conducive to extracting multi-scale strip objects that often appear in segmentation scenes, and using strip dilated convolution to further extract contextual dependencies in other directions. First, we propose a multi-scale strip pooling module that enables the backbone network to effectively obtain multi-scale contexts; Then, we introduce a strip dilated convolution module, which supplements the vertical contexts of the strip pooling by using strip dilated convolution; Finally, we construct a novel network integrating the proposed two modules. The method explicitly takes horizontal and vertical contexts of multi-scale strip objects into consideration, so that scene understanding could benefit from long-range dependencies.

In recent years, deep neural networks have led to exciting breakthroughs in speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the multi-granularity deep matching model has yielded few positive results. Existing deep IR models use the granularity of words to match the query and document. According to the human inquiry process, matching should be done at multiple granularities of words, phrases, and even sentences. MatchACNN, a new deep learning architecture for simulating the aforementioned human assessment process, is presented in this study. To solve the aforementioned problems, our model treats text matching as image recognition, extracts features from different dimensions, and employs a two-dimensional convolution neural network and an attention mechanism in image recognition. Experiments on Wiki QA Corpus, NFCorpus, and TREC QA show that MatchACNN can significantly outperform existing deep learning methods.},

This paper presents a new intuitionistic RVFL classifier (IFRVFLC) for binary classification with the goals of improving the overall classification capability of the RVFL network and increasing its classification efficiency on noisy data sets. In IFRVFLC, each training sample is associated with an intuitionistic fuzzy number which consists of membership or non-membership frames. The membership degree of a pattern considers the distance from the respective class centre. The degree of non-membership, on the other hand, is determined by the ratio of the heterogeneous point number to the total number of neighbouring points. To check the efficiency of the proposed IFRVFLC model, its classification performance is compared with the support vector machine (SVM), twin SVM, kernel ridge regression, extreme learning machine , intuitionistic fuzzy SVM, intuitionistic fuzzy twin SVM and RVFL networks.

  abstract     = {Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to detect the temporal boundaries of action instances in untrimmed videos only by relying on video-level action labels. The main challenge of the research is to accurately segment the action from the background in the absence of frame-level labels. Previous methods consider the action-related context in the background as the main factor restricting the segmentation performance. Most of them take action labels as pseudo-labels for context and suppress context frames in class activation sequences using the attention mechanism. However, this only applies to fixed shots or videos with a single theme. For videos with frequent scene switching and complicated themes, such as casual shots of unexpected events and secret shots, the strong randomness and weak continuity of the action cause the assumption not to be valid. In addition, the wrong pseudo-labels will enhance the weight of context frames, which will affect the segmentation performance. To address above issues, in this paper, we define a new video frame division standard (action instance, action-related context, no-action background), propose an Action-aware Network with Upper and Lower loss AUL-Net, which limits the activation of context to a reasonable range through a two-branch weight-sharing framework with a three-branch attention mechanism, so that the model has wider applicability while accurately suppressing context and background. We conducted extensive experiments on the self-built food safety video dataset FS-VA, and the results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art model.},

  abstract     = {The environmental sound classification has great research significance in the fields of intelligent audio monitoring and other fields. A novel multi-frequency resolution (MFR) feature is proposed in this paper to solve the problem that the existing single frequency resolution time–frequency features of sound cannot effectively express the characteristics of multiple types of sound. The MFR feature is composed of three features with different frequency resolutions, which are compressed in varying degrees at the time dimension. This method not only has the effect of data augmentation but also can obtain more context information during the feature extraction. And the MFR features of Log-Mel Spectrogram, Cochleagram, and Constant Q-Transform are combined to form a multi-channel MFR feature. Also, a network named SacNet is built, which can effectively solve the problem that the time–frequency feature map of sound contains more invalid information. The basic structural unit of the SacNet consists of two parallel branches, one using depthwise separable convolution as the main feature extractor, and the other using spatial attention module to extract more effective information. Experiment results have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.5%, 93.1%, and 95.3% on three benchmark datasets of ESC10, ESC50, and UrbanSound8K respectively, which are increased by 3.3%, 0.5%, and 2.3% respectively compared with the previous advanced methods.},

  abstract     = {Dense optical flow estimation is challenging when there are large displacements in a scene with heterogeneous motion dynamics, occlusion, and scene homogeneity. Traditional approaches to handle these challenges include hierarchical and multiresolution processing methods. Learning-based optical flow methods typically use a multiresolution approach with image warping when a broad range of flow velocities and heterogeneous motion is present. Accuracy of such coarse-to-fine methods is affected by the ghosting artifacts when images are warped across multiple resolutions and by the vanishing problem in smaller scene extents with higher motion contrast. Previously, we devised strategies for building compact dense prediction networks guided by the effective receptive field (ERF) characteristics of the network (DDCNet). The DDCNet design was intentionally simple and compact allowing it to be used as a building block for designing more complex yet compact networks. In this work, we extend the DDCNet strategies to handle heterogeneous motion dynamics by cascading DDCNet based sub-nets with decreasing extents of their ERF. Our DDCNet with multiresolution capability (DDCNet-Multires) is compact without any specialized network layers. We evaluate the performance of the DDCNet-Multires network using standard optical flow benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that DDCNet-Multires improves over the DDCNet-B0 and -B1 and provides optical flow estimates with accuracy comparable to similar lightweight learning-based methods.},

To meet the need for multi-variable modeling of financial sequences, we present an application of multi-variable LSTM (MV-LSTM) network for stock market prediction in this paper. The network consists of two serial modules: the first module is a recurrent layer with MV-LSTM as its recurrent unit, which is able to encode information from each variable exclusively; the second module employs a variable attention mechanism by introducing a latent variable and enables the model to measure the importance of each variable to the target. With these two modules, the model can deal with multi-variable financial sequences more effectively. Moreover, a statistical arbitrage investment strategy is constructed based on the prediction model. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Chinese stock data show that the MV-LSTM network has a higher prediction accuracy and provides a better statistical arbitrage investment strategy than other methods.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, traffic flow prediction has been extensively explored in Intelligent Transportation Systems, which is beneficial for reducing traffic jams and accidents as well as optimizing traffic network resources. Most of the previous methods divide cities into equal-sized grids and predict flows within one grid. However, we believe that each area is not independent, and there are interactions between areas. And the interaction between areas belonging to different attributes is more regular. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Attribute Graph Convolutional Network (MAGCN) for regional traffic flow prediction. Based on the attributes to which the areas belong, we divide cities into unequal-sized grids, and then a matrix is constructed using the flow of Functional area-based Origin-Destination pairs. GCN and dilated causal convolution allow the model to capture the spatial correlation and temporal dependence between functional regions while overcoming the under-fitting of local peaks. Extensive experimental results and evaluation metrics on two real-world datasets show that the MAGCN outperforms the baselines and has a higher accuracy for traffic flow prediction.},

  abstract     = {The Hopfield network is an example of an artificial neural network used to implement associative memories. A binary digit represents the neuron’s state of a traditional Hopfield neural network. Inspired by the human brain’s ability to cope simultaneously with multiple sensorial inputs, this paper presents three multi-modal Hopfield-type neural networks that treat multi-dimensional data as a single entity. In the first model, called the vector-valued Hopfield neural network, the neuron’s state is a vector of binary digits. Synaptic weights are modeled as finite impulse response (FIR) filters in the second model, yielding the so-called convolutional associative memory. Finally, the synaptic weights are modeled by linear time-varying (LTV) filters in the third model. Besides their potential applications for multi-modal intelligence, the new associative memories may also be used for signal and image processing and solve optimization and classification tasks.},

Firstly, in order to improve the efficiency of global information acquisition, the basic graph structure is obtained by K-means clustering method, and the training set is re-selected with wider influencing scope according to the obtained structure. Secondly, the relation influential features are designed to represent the influence between node groups, and added to the node feature to improve the global expression ability of nodes.

To this end, we propose a step-by-step gradient penalty model with similarity calculation (S2SGP). Firstly, the step-by-step gradient penalty is applied to the summary generation model, effectively reducing the training time without sacrificing accuracy. Secondly, the similarity score between reference and candidate summary is calculated as disturbance factor. To show the performance of our proposed solution, we conduct experiments on four summary generation datasets, among which the EDUSum dataset is newly produced by us. Experimental results show that S2SGP effectively reduces training time, and the disturbance factors do not rely on repeated trials.

This needs to fully exploit the effective features in the low resolution image and give play to the complementary advantages of different convolution kernels by fusing different features. Therefore, a multi-scale fusion single image super-resolution reconstruction method Be-MRN is proposed following the eagle vision system. Inspired by the eagle eyes to recognize objects from three directions, we design an eagle-eye feature extraction module using three ways in parallel to extract feature. It uses the principle of cross-field of left and right eyes to fuse information in three channels, and uses dilated convolutions to mine effective features. The feedback module receives effective features, uses the attention mechanism to capture cross channel interactive information and eliminates redundant information, and then completes deep feature extraction through four layers of iteration to ensure the complementary interaction and deep mining between different features. The multi-scale reconstruction module uses different convolutions to extract complementary information of deep features, and uses multi-branch in parallel to complete image reconstruction. Experiments show that, for Urban100 with scale factor × 4, when compared to MSICF, Be-MRN increases the PSNR and SSIM values by 1.8% and 2.1% respectively. For the four datasets with × 2, × 3 and × 4 scale factors, Be-MRN obtains the highest objective index, which can highlight the edge and texture information of the image.},

The actuator faults are contains both the loss of effectiveness factor of the actuator and a time-varying bias signal. MTN is used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, while unmodeled dynamics and dynamical disturbances are handled with the help of dynamical signal functions. A systemically backstepping-based fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed based on Lyapunov stability theory and MTN approximation ability. The suggested technique ensures that all closed-loop system signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) and the tracking error converges to a small region around the origin.

  abstract     = {Image deblurring is a widely researched topic in low-level vision. Over the last few years, many researchers try to deblur by stacking multi-scale pyramid structures, which inevitably increases the computational complexity. In addition, most of the existing deblurring methods do not adequately model long-range contextual information, making the structure of blurred objects not well restored. To address the above issues, we propose a novel context-aware multi-scale convolutional neural network (CDMC-Net) for image deblurring. We progressively restore latent sharp images in two stages, and a cross-stage feature aggregation (CSFA) strategy is introduced to enhance the information flow interaction between the two stages. The key design of CDMC-Net to reduce the complexity is the use of a multi-input multi-output encoder-decoder at each stage, which can process multi-scale blurry images in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, to effectively capture long-range context information in different scenarios, we propose a multi-strip feature extraction module (MSFM). Its strip pooling with different kernel sizes allows the network to aggregate rich global and local contextual information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDMC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art motion deblurring methods on both synthetic benchmark datasets and real blurred images. We also use CDMC-Net as a pre-processing step for object detection to further verify the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method in downstream vision tasks.},

However, in segmentation- based methods, complex post-processing decreases the detection speed. In this paper, we propose a high-speed scene text detection method which adopts attention mechanism and multi-scale label generation. It performs well on both detection speed and detection accuracy. Due to the adoption of pyramid attention network, position attention module, multi-scale label generation method, and trainable binarization, our method achieves high detection accuracy.

Specifically, IMLCGC develops a learning framework for incomplete multi-view data, which contains three components, i.e., consensus low-dimensional representation, graph regularization, and consensus graph completion. Furthermore, a generalization error bound of the model is established based on Rademacher’s complexity. It shows the theory that learning with incomplete multi-view data is difficult.

  abstract     = {The allocation of boundary points and low-density clusters has become an essential part of clustering research. Most of the recent improved methods that focused on identifing allocation of points have not addressed the issue of specific data point assignment in terms of the data’s distribution feature. In this article, a rolling iteration clustering model (ROCM) was proposed for assigning the specific data point by extracting the feature of data points. In this model, data points were transformed into multiple units with different distribution structures, and then each unit’s dispersion used to discover representative groups was analyzed. Sparse data were clustered based on the proposed self-expansion principle to effectively capture boundary points and assign points at joint. Furthermore, the rolling iteration module avoided the over-partitioning and chaining effect and discovered clusters with diverse shapes and densities. Experimental results of twenty-two datasets proved the effectiveness of the proposed method. ROCM has better performance than other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-viewpoint image stitching aims to stitch images taken from different viewpoints into pictures with a broader field of view. The stitched images are subject to artifacts, geometric distortion, and blur distortion due to the mismatch of feature points, inaccurate homography estimation, and improper fusion of the unstitched images. Deep learning has recently been increasingly applied to multi-viewpoint image stitching to overcome these problems. However, there has thus far been little related research to summarize the different deep learning techniques used for multi-viewpoint image stitching. Therefore, this review aims to explore the application of deep learning to multi-viewpoint image stitching. To better illustrate this topic, we first summarize the acquisition methods for multi-viewpoint images and the main challenges of image stitching. After which, deep learning techniques for multi-view image stitching with a single camera are sorted out. Subsequently, deep learning techniques for multi-view image stitching with camera arrays, including parallel-view multi-view image stitching and cross-view multi-view image stitching, are presented. Next, we summarize image stitching datasets, evaluation metrics, and experimental data of several leading stitching algorithms on public datasets. Finally, we discuss potential issues and future work on image stitching with multi-viewpoint images.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain is the new disruptive technology which is gaining momentum in several domains of real-world applications such as Bitcoin—the most well-known example, and primarily in the financial sector. Distributed ledger system which is the main feature of blockchain technology protected across harmful updates using cryptographic techniques, e.g. hashing and digital signatures, is spread over the network so that no one is the owner of the ledger. This poses a significant challenge in the areas of performance, security, and privacy using this emerging technology. We propose an algorithm to provide a secure mechanism for performing transactions on the Blockchain network by adopting quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum teleportation phenomenon of quantum computing. The proposed algorithm uses key pairs to generate private keys and corresponding public keys; the quantum digital signatures are used to sign the message which are then distributed over the blockchain network using the teleportation phenomenon. The security of the keys is dependent on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that doesn’t allow forging. The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) pair of particles is used to communicate the quantum information via a quantum channel for teleportation, which is generated by operating Bell measurements with corresponding EPR pairs. The original state of the particle (sender) is destroyed once the information is transported to the other particle (receiver) and the QDS scheme also validates the qubits received. The twofold validation process thereby provides high-level security in the transactions.},

In each cognitive space the spread spectrum optimization to the entire user is much more needed for enjoying the fruits of cognitive Radio. To achieve this, an effective mechanism is needed for the effective utilization of spectrum in cognitive radio system. Even though there are many substantial innovations in the area of cognitive radio none of the prevailing articles have focused on providing solutions to the problems which are related to efficient allocation of spectrum for each subordinate user with less power utilization and interference. In this article, the framework has been analyzed in both presence and absence of prime users with maximizing the capacity and data rate of the network. Further, the proposed model is solved by integrating a hybrid optimization algorithm with effective decision-making mechanism.

Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm that can generate an unbiased global model based on collecting updates from local models trained by client’s data while keeping the local data private. This study aims to address the centralized data collection issue through the application of FL on brain tumor identification from MRI images. At first, several CNN models were trained using the MRI data and the best three performing CNN models were selected to form different variants of ensemble classifiers. Afterward, the FL model was constructed using the ensemble architecture. It was trained using model weights from the local model without sharing the client’s data (MRI images) using the FL approach. Experimental results show only a slight decline in the performance of the FL approach as it achieved 91.05% accuracy compared to the 96.68% accuracy of the base ensemble model. Additionally, same approach was taken for another slightly larger dataset to prove the scalability of the method. This study shows that the FL approach can achieve privacy-protected tumor classification from MRI images without compromising much accuracy compared to the traditional deep learning approach.},

  abstract     = {Cancer has been considered one of the major threats to the lives and health of people. The substantial clinical practices show that earlier diagnosis and detection of cancer can provide adaptable treatment methods, increase survivability, and enhance life quality. Moreover, rapid advancements in science, technology, and Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems also provide additional information for robust analysis and examination of medical images. Image processing and machine learning presented promising low-cost approaches for classifying and detecting different cancerous diseases. However, these traditional techniques need extensive pre-processing and laborious manual features extraction methods. Thus, in this paper, we presented a Convolutional Neural Network based method for the classification and detection of metastatic cancer in histopathologic images of lymph node sections. A diagnostic method of cancer in histopathologic images is time consuming and tedious for pathologists because a large tissue area has been examined, and tiny metastasis can be easily ignored. Thus the developed deep learning method can help pathologists in examining the histopathologic scans and assist in decision-making to analyze the disease and cancer staging, which will give consequential opinions in clinical diagnosis. We performed the necessary pre-processing and data augmentation steps to enhance the results and avoid overfitting. The method utilizes low dimensional representations and performs automated, categorical feature extraction and classification, which attain high accuracy for diagnosis of cancer. The method is applied to PatchCamelyon (PCam) data set. Experimental results show good performance with an accuracy rate of 0.94 for the medical image classification and detection task.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the most effective non-invasive technique to help diagnose brain tumor diseases. Recently, computer-aided diagnostic models based on deep convolutional neural networks have provided efficient assistance for brain disease detection from MRIs. However, the performance of these supervised models relies heavily on labeled data. And data annotation work is error-prone in practical clinic applications because it requires expert domain knowledge and significant time investment. Self-supervised models hold great promise in training unlabeled data except for the weaknesses such as an unfriendly computing budget and inferior performance. Thus, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for the unsupervised classification of brain MRIs. Firstly, we build an interleaved structure for contrastive learning, aiming to facilitate the backbone network to seek a better representation with a low computational cost. Then we apply a dynamic weighting mechanism to prevent collapsed solutions and pursuit a perfect trade-off between convergence speed and high performance. Moreover, we introduce a jigsaw puzzle solver as an additional augmentation tool, aiming to collect more valuable clues for correct classes by expanding the attention to local spatial information. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed model through qualitative and quantitative evaluation.},

Children and teenagers are mostly affected by Osteosarcoma, which weakens the strength of their bones and sometimes may even result in death. It is important to develop an intelligent classifier that detect osteosarcoma accurately so that proper treatment can be given to the patient timely. In this paper, we propose an intelligent classifier that classifies osteosarcoma whole slide images (WSIs) into Viable Tumor, Non-Viable Tumor and Non-Tumor. To extract the region of interest (ROI) from WSIs, a Multi-Feature Non-Seed-based Region Growing algorithm (MFNSRG) based on intra-region homogeneity and inter-region heterogeneity maximization is used. We use textural heterogeneity along with color heterogeneity as the matching criteria during region growing. Finally, the background is eliminated using thresholding based on the size of a region and the ROI is obtained. The performance of MFNSRG is further improved by using Marine Predators, a recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm, which is used to obtain optimal value of segmentation parameters. Here, we use handcrafted methods to extract relevant features from the segmented image which are given as input to the classifier. The results of experimentation prove the superiority of the proposed approach as compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The model is mainly composed of two branches. In the first branch, we divide each PCG signal into three equal-length sub-signals, using Gramian Angular Fields to encode them from audio modality to two-dimensional image modality, and then Res2Net is applied to extract the image view features. In the second branch, we propose MobileNet-LSTM to extract the features of another view from preprocessed PCG signals. Finally, the features from these two views are fused and fed into the classifier for classification.

  abstract     = {Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can assist doctors with clinical diagnosis and improve diagnosis accuracy and efficiency further. It is significative and valuable for cancer detection by using machine learning. In this paper, a hybrid model based on optimization algorithm and machine learning with feature weighting is carried out to detect breast cancer. Firstly, to surmount the limitation of nonlinear and imbalanced data distribution, we apply feature weighting (FW) based on K-Means to make benign and malignant samples more separate. Then Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to enhance searching ability of Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO). Moreover, the HHO optimized by PSO (PHHO) is employed to optimize Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Finally, in order to verify the availability of our proposed FW-PHHO-ELM model, experiments are implemented on Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer (WDBC) data set. The results indicate that the proposed model can achieve 98.76%, 97.37% and 99.46% on accuracy, sensitivity and specificity respectively. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed model outperformed reported benchmark models and existing models on accuracy and sensitivity. Besides, the proposed model could also balance sensitivity and specificity well.},

  abstract     = {The financial distress detection of listed companies is very important because it can prevent investors, managers and regulators from suffering huge losses and adverse effects. In this paper, ’special treatment(ST)’ is regard as the financial distress due to the special circumstance of Chinese stock market. In the research of financial distress detection, there is not only a very large imbalance ratio between ’ST’ companies and ’non-ST’ companies, but there is also the problem of overlap, which is a more important factor affecting classification performance. However, for the financial distress detection method based on machine learning, most attention is focused on class imbalance rather than overlap. In order to take the overlap problem into account, firstly, this paper proposes the ESMOTE(Extreme SMOTE) method to select the minority classes close to the classification boundary for oversampling, which is more conducive to discover better and more correct decision boundary. Then a new Synchronous Sampling Learning Method (SSLM) is proposed in this paper. The point is to simultaneously delete the majority class and minority class instances that exceed the learned boundary, where this boundary (the margin’s threshold) is obtained by optimizing the $$F1\text {-}Score$$ of the final classifier. A large number of experiments on 14 real data sets and the financial data set show that our method is significantly better than the most advanced methods in terms of $$F1\text {-}Score$$ and AUC, whether using Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the final classifier.},

The system model is estimated at every time step since it is utilized in computing the system Jacobian, hence controller design involves an inherent system identification problem. In the proposed architecture, LSTM is employed for both system model estimation and for updating the parameters of the PID controller. Namely, the $$K_P$$ , $$K_I$$ and $$K_D$$ gains are computed at every time step by LSTM, so that a cost function which is obtained from tracking error is minimized. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on two different nonlinear systems by extensive simulations. Simulation results justify the success of the introduced control architecture.},

However, data quality issues (e.g., historical check-in POI missing, data sparsity) always limit the effectiveness of existing LBSN-oriented studies, e.g., next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation or prediction. In contrast to previous efforts in the above study, we focus on identifying missing POIs that the user has visited at a past specific time and develop a category-aware multigraph embedding (CAME) model. Specifically, CAME jointly captures temporal cyclic effect, user preference, and sequential transition pattern in a unified way by embedding five relational information graphs into a shared dimensional space from both POI- and category-instance levels. The proposed model also incorporates region-level spatial proximity to explore the geographical influence and derives the ranking score list of candidates for missing POI identification. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods are conducted on two real datasets, and the experimental results show its superiority over other competitors. Significantly, the proposed model can be naturally extended to next POI recommendation and prediction tasks with competitive performances.},

Specifically, a Medium Modality Network (MMN) is proposed to extract fused features of RGB and grayscale images, and we combine the fused features with infrared features for constraint. In addition, we also propose a loss function termed Domain Alignment and ID Consistency Loss (DAIC), which constrains the differences between the medium modality and the infrared modality as well as within single-modality in terms of instance level. Finally, in the high-level semantic stage, we also propose a Spatial Barycenter Margin Loss (SBM) based on each identity barycenter to constrain the feature space with different identities. The proposed method is validated on two large-scale datasets SYSU-MM01 and RegDB for cross-modality person re-identification, the results show that it achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Meanwhile, the coupling structure of all systems is controlled by continuous-time homogeneous Markov chains. To realize the synchronization of the systems, state feedback controllers are employed and these obtained synchronization principles are correlated to the multi-weights and the intensity of the noise.

Illegal uses of steganography such as fraud, gambling, criminal communications, hacking, electronic payments, harassment, offenses on intellectual property and viruses pose a great threat to society. Such illicit steganographers communicate with each other through stego files to exchange their plan without getting noticed by law enforcement. This paper presents a novel Deep Clustering Network for Steganographer Detection (DCNSD) based on convolutional autoencoders and a clustering model for identifying such steganographers since plenty of digital images are transferred over the internet that could carry hidden secret messages. Mostly the existing techniques involving deep learning networks for steganographer detection involves supervised learning approach which makes them unsuitable for real-world deployment. The foremost characteristic of this proposed network lies in its ability to segregate images transmitted from a steganographer from those innocent users’ images in an unsupervised approach. Thereby making the proposed DCNSD system plausible for real-world deployment. Based on the experimental results, it is shown that the proposed DCNSD framework excels in detecting steganographers who use content-adaptive steganography to embed secrets with 100% accuracy.},

Specifically, an anchor-free pedestrian detection framework with MobileNetV2 backbone is firstly utilized to reduce the computational complexity, achieving significant speedup for model inference. Secondly, our method makes use of DMAF module to enhance complementary information between RGB and Thermal image features. Finally, the quality of feature fusion is greatly improved with local and global attention mechanisms, thus enhancing the detection accuracy.

However, given a large text corpus, representing all the words is not efficient in terms of vocabulary size. In the literature, many tokenization algorithms have emerged to tackle this problem by creating subwords, which in turn limits the vocabulary size in a given text corpus. Most tokenization techniques are language-agnostic, i.e., they do not incorporate the linguistic features of a given language. Not to mention the difficulty of evaluating such techniques in practice. In this paper, we introduce three new tokenization algorithms for Arabic and compare them to other three popular tokenizers using unsupervised evaluations. In addition, we compare all the six tokenizers by evaluating them on three supervised classification tasks: sentiment analysis, news classification and poem-meter classification, using six publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that none of the tokenization techniques is the best choice overall and that the performance of a given tokenization algorithm depends on many factors including the size of the dataset, nature of the task, and the morphology richness of the dataset. However, some tokenization techniques are better overall as compared to others on various text classification tasks.},

In this structure, the number of tunable parameters for the PWORNN only depends on the number of hidden neurons and it is independent of the number of external inputs. The proposed structure of the PWORNN aims to reduce the number of tunable parameters, which reflects on the reduction of the computation time of the proposed algorithm. To guarantee the stability, the optimization, and speed up the convergence of the tunable parameters, i.e., output weights, the proposed network is trained using Lyapunov stability criterion based on an adaptive learning rate. Moreover, by applying the proposed scheme to a nonlinear mathematical system and the heat exchanger system, the robustness of the proposed APID-PWORNN controller has been investigated in this paper and proven its superiority to deal with the nonlinear dynamical systems considering the system parameters uncertainties, disturbances, set-point change, and sensor measurement uncertainty.},

The processed sEMG signal is subjected to nonlinear mapping to gain the muscle activation which is applied as an input of the prediction model, and the output is the actual motion angle measured by the sensor. Compared with the standard SVM algorithm, the advantage of LS-SVM lies in the alteration of constraint conditions, which transforms the original quadratic programming (QP) problem into solving a set of linear equations. ZNN can be exploited to settle the converted equations and increase the calculation rate. In practice, it is difficult to avoid the interference of measurement noise on the recognition process, so a noise-suppressing zeroing neural network (NSZNN) is established and analyzed. Finally, the corresponding experiments show that the proposed method is able to accurately identify the joint angle, and when considering the noise in the solution process, it can eliminate the effect of noise on the estimation result to a certain extent. The numerical results reveal the method raised in this paper provides valuable reference for lower limb joint movement of patients.},

  abstract     = {Reliability of spare parts inventory in the company is one of the most significant challenges in the field of maintenance and repairs, but on the other hand, the liquidity crisis resulting from the purchase of surplus spare parts is another challenge facing the organizational financial field. Accordingly, accurate forecasting of future consumption is one of the most important solutions for inventory control systems. But because of the impact of so many variables on spare part consumption, most real-world data is chaotic. This leads to the use of classical methods to predict future demand, with high error and low reliability. In this research, a novel and reliable hybrid model based on the support vector machine (SVM), and two single algorithms (STL Decomposed ARIMA and three-layer feed-forward neural network) has been presented to predict the future consumption of spare parts. The proposed model (SVM-ARIMA-3LFFNN hybrid model) also experiments on several chaotic time series in the rapid miner repositories. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed hybrid model attains superior performance compared with a single model and can adapt to chaotic time series. Performance criteria considered in this study are MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and sMAPE. The results indicate that the proposed model can improve the RMSE, MAPE, and sMAPE (up to 30% improvement).},

In this work, our task of interest is graph classification. Several GNN models have been proposed and shown great accuracy in this task. However, the question is whether usual training methods fully realize the capacity of the GNN models. In this work, we propose a two-stage training framework based on triplet loss. In the first stage, GNN is trained to map each graph to a Euclidean-space vector so that graphs of the same class are close while those of different classes are mapped far apart. Once graphs are well-separated based on labels, a classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes. This method is generic in the sense that it is compatible with any GNN model. By adapting five GNN models to our method, we demonstrate the consistent improvement in accuracy and utilization of each GNN’s allocated capacity over the original training method of each model up to $$5.4\%$$ points in 12 datasets.},

Channel pruning can compress the model and effectively reduce the resource demand to solve this problem. However, most channel pruning methods evaluate channels one-sidedly and sometimes remove important channels incorrectly. Thus, we propose a new multi-collaboration channel pruning (MCCP) method by analyzing the input and output of the batch normalization (BN) layer. The importance of the channel is evaluated by combining the weights of the convolution layer and the two learnable parameters of the BN layer to achieve more reasonable pruning. Besides, we impose polarization regularization on the scaling factors of neurons to make them easier to distinguish between important and unimportant channels to minimize the performance loss of the model after pruning. We confirm the effect of our method. MCCP reduces the number of parameters of the YOLOv3 model by 95.9%, improves the inference speed by 3.8 times, compresses the model volume to 9.6MB, and has comparable recognition accuracy.},

Adding some negligible perturbation to the image will cause the DNN to give wrong results with high confidence, while the human eye can hardly see the difference. However, studies show that attack an object detector is much more difficult than attack a classifier. We proposed a new attack algorithm for DNN based object detector by simultaneously learning perturbations and locations (SLPL). The proposed algorithm attacks an object detector by iterative fast gradient sign method (I-FGSM). Unlike most gradient based algorithms that only learning perturbations, it simultaneously learning perturbations and attack locations. While learning perturbations by backward gradient, it gradually focuses on the most efficient attack locations in an image based accumulated absolute gradient. In addition, we study the stability and transferability of adversarial examples in object detection. Experimental results on Pascal VOC dataset show that, the proposed SLPL gives higher attack succeed ratio and lower perturbation when attacking popular object detectors such as Faster-RCNN and YOLOv4. Nevertheless, the stability and transferability of existing attack algorithms for object detection is far from expected.},

We also collect a large number of images obtained from the front-end cameras and create a self-built dataset of engineering vehicles. In this paper, we test our method on the COCO dataset and the self-built engineering vehicle dataset.

  abstract     = {Recently, great progress has been made in promoting image captioning by improving Transformer structure. As a key component, dot product self-attention can update the representation of each feature vector in the visual encoder and guide the caption decoding process. However, the pairwise interaction in dot product self-attention enables attention weights to be learned at the instance or local level, making it difficult for attention module to obtain global feature representations. Furthermore, self-attention is always implemented in a multi-head fashion, where the calculation of each attention head is independent. It makes the model unable to exploit the complementary information contained in different heads. In this paper, we propose a Hadamard Product Perceptron Attention (HPPA) for image captioning, which introduces a more global feature interaction and incorporates interaction among attention heads to calculate attention results. Feature interaction method based on Hadamard product can integrate multimodal features more effectively than dot product and provide rich feature representation. Therefore, HPPA first utilizes Hadamard product to fuse the input features. Then, it generates a set of attention memory vectors containing global interaction features. The final attention weights are calculated via these vectors dynamically. When the multi-head mechanism is incorporated, the complementary information between different heads can be utilized by HPPA. We further integrate HPPA into Transformer encoder and propose a Hadamard Product Perceptron Transformer (HPPT) as a feature enhancement encoder. Moreover, HPPA and HPPT can be easily applied to existing attention or Transformer based models. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.},

However, the color changes in the facial video are not obvious, and the noise introduced by factors such as head movement and illumination changes is also not conducive to the extraction of rPPG signals. To address these challenges, we construct an end-to-end multi-task model called rPPGTR, which is based on the multi-head self-attention mechanism. rPPGTR captures local features and global dependencies by combining the convolution block and divided space-time attention, and fuses these two kinds of information. This paper takes the face sequences as the input of rPPGTR. rPPGTR first uses the convolution blocks to extract local features and process the face images into sequences of image patches. Then, the divided space-time attention is used to assign corresponding weights to image patches in different spatiotemporal positions and capture their long-range dependencies. The captured global dependencies will be fused with local features to enrich the extracted rPPG features. Finally, the features are decoded into rPPG signals and average heart rate values, and their relationship is used for multi-task learning. The experimental results on four public datasets show that the prediction accuracy of rPPGTR is better than the comparison methods.},

In this paper, we propose an efficient model compression framework based on knowledge distillation to train a compact student network by a large teacher network. Our key point is to introduce a positive-unlabeled (PU) classifier to promote the compressed student network to learn the features of the prominent teacher network as much as possible. During the training, the PU classifier is to discriminate the features of the teacher network as high-quality and discriminate the features of the student network as low-quality. Simultaneously, the student network learns knowledge from the teacher network through the soft-targets and attention features. Extensive experimental evaluations on four benchmark image classification datasets show that our method outperforms the prior works with a large margin at the same parameters and calculations cost. When selecting the VGGNet19 as the teacher network to train on the CIFAR dataset, the student network VGGNet13 achieves 94.47% and 75.73% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, which improved 1.02% and 2.44%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a tremendously growing field, wherein users can design their sensor-based applications, depending on the application requirement. Most practical challenges in WSNs involve several potentially conflicting objectives that must be met. Satisfying one objective leads to degradation in other objective’s performance( for example, if we focus on increasing network lifetime, latency may also increase, which is not desirable). Thus, it is very challenging to find trade-off amongst these conflicting optimization criterion. An updated overview of the research efforts have been undertaken to solve this challenge using Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) methods, particularly nature-inspired meta-heuristic MOO algorithms. This paper presents a systematic review of MOO techniques in WSNs. Besides, a study of applications of MOO is presented in diverse application domains, specifically in the area of WSNs. Furthermore, the integration of WSNs with MOO is studied to guide the researchers in future.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, big data has become an essential concern with the rapid increase of digitalization. The problems that find solutions to the problems of finding and evaluating the features of big data are called optimization problems. In this paper, data sets containing EEG signals have been studied. The goal is to detect actual EEG signals while eliminating additional brain activity patterns in the collected data, resulting in more accurate interpretation. In the study, to handle big data optimization (BigOpt) difficulties, a novel swarm intelligence-based technique is developed. A Developed PSO-Q was proposed by updating the random walking phase of the Particle Swarm Optimization on the combined quantum behaved method (PSO-Q) for BigOpt problems. PSO-Q&#39;s local search capability has been improved. The success of PSO-Q and IPSO-Q has been thoroughly tested in various cycles (maximum iterations) (300, 400, 500, and 1000) and population sizes (10, 25, and 50) on six data sets. The outcomes of the PSO-Q and IPSO-Q were statistically evaluated with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. PSO-Q and IPSO-Q have been compared with newly developed swarm-based algorithms (BA, Jaya, AOA, etc.) in the literature in recent years. The success of IPSO-Q has been shown by evaluating the results obtained. The results showed that IPSO-Q can be used as an alternative algorithm in BigOpt problems.},

As a validation of the RP-LVQ, we report the speed and power performance of several LVQ network architectures’ implementation on a Xilinx zynq-7000 FPGA.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant contributions to natural and remote sensing imaging since the development of deep learning. Scene-level image classification is a challenge that affects both the natural and remote sensing domains and has numerous applications. The number of possible scene entities in the image content that could match the dataset images is the main focus. Scene-level classification is significant and fascinating because of open problems like intraclass heterogeneity, interclass homogeneity, background cluttering, high spatial resolution, and different imaging conditions. Additionally, the multi-label scene dataset’s imbalance, lack of preservation of complex semantic relations, and higher label-to-label correlation are all apparent. The article discusses a meta-analysis of the state-of-the-art scene classification literature practices. We discuss CNNs, attention mechanisms, capsule networks, and generative adversarial networks. The article also delivers an overview of the various activations, losses, optimization techniques, and regularization schemes pertinent to the scene domain. The standard benchmark datasets based on single- and multi-label themes are collated. The performance metrics for scene classification are explained as well. The implementation of the multi-label scene classification utilizing several CNN models on the UC Merced multi-label dataset is also covered in the paper. The proposed MobileNet-based model performs better than the recognized cutting-edge methodologies.},

Even by collecting lots of data hardly, shift in data distribution might emerge because of differences in source and target domains. The shift would make the model to face with problems in test step. Therefore, the necessity of using domain adaptation emerges. There are three techniques in the field of domain adaptation namely discrepancy based, adversarial based and reconstruction based methods. For domain adaptation, adversarial learning approaches showed state-of-the-art performance. Although there are some comprehensive surveys about domain adaptation, we technically focus on adversarial based domain adaptation methods. We examine each proposed method in detail with respect to their structures and objective functions. The common aspect of proposed methods besides domain adaptation is considering the target labels are predicted as accurately as possible. It can be represented by some methods such as metric learning and multi-adversarial discriminators as are used in some of the papers. Also, we address the negative transfer issue for dissimilar distributions and propose the addition of clustering heuristics to the underlying structures for future research.},

In this paper, we propose a novel Trained Output-based Transfer Learning (TOTL) approach for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays. We start by preprocessing the Chest X-rays of the patients with techniques like denoising, contrasting, segmentation. These processed images are then fed to several pre-trained transfer learning models like InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, VGG16, and VGG19. We fine-tune these models on the processed chest X-rays. Then we further train the outputs of these models using a deep neural network architecture to achieve enhanced performance and aggregate the capabilities of each of them. The proposed model has been tested on four recent COVID-19 chest X-rays datasets by computing several popular evaluation metrics. The performance of our model has also been compared with various deep transfer learning models and several contemporary COVID-19 detection methods. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed model.},

In clinical examination, radiologists usually focus on the most salient and distinctive regions to diagnose. However, in many state-of-the-art CNN based methods, the conventional convolution operation extracts the features equally importantly, which leads to an excessive feature learning process on the uninterested regions. To address this challenge, we propose a saliency transfer learning network that allows the model to focus on the salient and influential regions automatically. Moreover, a pyramid central-crop pooling scheme is employed to extract the multi-scale, centric-visual, and salient features from different layers. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, extensive experiments are conducted on prostate cancer and non-cancer MRI dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model could gain competitive performance (Accuracy 94.9%, Sensitivity 96.7%, Specificity 93.5%, AUC 0.989) on this classification task.},

In this paper, we focus on the prevention and control of epidemic using the relevant technologies in the field of artificial intelligence and signal analysis. With the unknown principle of epidemic transmission, we first smooth out the complex and variable epidemic data through the empirical mode decomposition model to obtain the change trends of epidemic data at different time scales. On this basis, the change trends under different time scales are trained using an extreme learning machine to obtain the corresponding prediction values, and finally the epidemic prediction results are obtained by fitting through Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System. The experimental results show that the algorithm has good learning ability, especially in the prediction of time-series sequences can guarantee the accuracy rate while having low time complexity. Therefore, this paper not only plays a theoretical support for epidemic prevention and control, but also plays an important role in the construction of public emergency health system in the long run.},

Transfer learning, a new subfield of machine learning has acquired fame due to its ability to exploit the information/learning gained from a previous process to improve generalization for the next.

  abstract     = {As a discriminative biometric modality, palmprint accommodates two attributes of soft biometrics, namely chirality and gender. Our study reveals that the false matching of a pair of palmprint templates from two identities could be possible if their representations are mirror-insensitive or gender-insensitive, despite the palmprint images have significant distinctive appearances. This could seriously impair the accuracy performance of the palmprint recognition systems. As a remedy, the useful knowledge learned from the classification of soft palmprint attributes, namely chirality and gender, is transferred to palmprint recognition, which improves the accuracy of palmprint-based identity recognition. To be specific, this paper pre-trains a shared-weight multi-task network with soft palmprint attributes under transfer learning paradigm. The pre-trained network is then transferred to the down-stream identity recognition task. Several shared-weight architectures are explored and examined to determine the suitable model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively avoid the false matching between the templates of different chiralities / genders. The proposed method can be applied to other biometric modalities, where their associated soft biometrics can be exploited for performance gain.

To solve the limitation, we consider the approximately unidirectional influences from temperature to confirmed cases and then propose a transfer one-step-ahead learning (Tr-OSH) method to establish their association. The Tr-OSH method first extract the unidirectional representation from temperature observations, and subsequently transfer the obtained representation for HFMD cases prediction. Moreover, we notice the independent correlation of each time step and period, and generate the independent representation by the relevance to upcoming values. Intensive experiments on real-world HFMD datasets demonstrate that our Tr-OSH method much efficaciously improves prediction accuracy.},

Its size and characteristics against presentation attacks make it suitable for various commercial and governmental applications. As with other biometric traits, the majority of finger-vein recognition methods employ hand-crafted feature for image classification. Lately, there are some convolutional neural network (CNN) models are designed for finger-vein identification and verification. Whereas, the CNN-based approaches tend to set up increasing layers and more parameters, which incur equipment memory issue and algorithm execution speed issue. Besides, many researchers have made great efforts to enhance hand-crafted feature-based method by using image enhancement algorithms. Hence, it is significant to explore high-performance finger-vein recognition without image enhancement in deep learning world. In this work, two different dimension issues are investigated: lightweight CNN model, the effect of image enhancement on finger-vein biometrics in deep feature space. Transfer learning plays an important role in extracting informative and representative features by information transfer from the pre-trained network to a novice via fine-tuning. The experimental results on four benchmark databases HKPU, FV-USM, SDUMLA and UTFVP demonstrate the proposed lightweight model ‘LightFVN’ outperforms the existing published competition winners. Furthermore, image enhancement turns out not to be essential for CNN-based finger-vein biometrics.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 is a novel virus that presents challenges due to a lack of consistent and in-depth research. The news of the COVID-19 spreads across the globe, resulting in a flood of posts on social media sites. Apart from health, social, and economic disturbances brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, another important consequence involves public mental health crises which is of greater concern. Data related to COVID-19 is a valuable asset for researchers in understanding people&#39;s feelings related to the pandemic. It is thus important to extract the early information evolving public sentiments on social platforms during the outbreak of COVID-19. The objective of this study is to look at people&#39;s perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic who interact with each other and share tweets on the Twitter platform. COVIDSenti, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 90,000 COVID-19 tweets collected from February to March 2020, during the initial phases of the outbreak served as the foundation for our experiments. A pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model is fine-tuned and embeddings generated are combined with two long short-term memory networks to propose the residual encoder transformation network model. The proposed model is used for multiclass text classification on a large dataset labeled as positive, negative, and neutral. The experimental outcomes validate that: (1) the proposed model is the best performing model, with 98% accuracy and 96% F1-score; (2) It also outperforms conventional machine learning algorithms and different variants of BERT, and (3) the approach achieves better results as compared to state-of-the-art on different benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, Sentiment analysis has attracted significant researcher attention. Despite a huge number of studies in this field, Sentiment analysis of authors’ books (classical Arabic) with extracting the embedding features has not yet been done. The recent feature extraction of Arabic text depends on the frequency of the words within the corpus without extracting the relation between these words. This paper aims to create a new classical Arabic dataset CASAD from many art books by collecting sentences from several stories with human-expert labeling. Additionally, the feature extraction of those datasets is created by word embedding techniques equivalent to Word2vec that are able to extract the deep relation which means features of the formal Arabic language. These features are evaluated by several types of machine learning for classical Arabic, for example, support vector machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Classification And Regression Trees (CART). Moreover, statistical methods such as validation and reliability are applied to evaluate this dataset’s label. Finally, our experiments evaluated the classification rate of the feature-extraction matrices in two and three classes using six machine-learning algorithms for tenfold cross-validation that showed that the Logistic Regression with Word2Vec approach is the most accurate in predicting topic-polarity occurrence.},

Retrieval of image of interest from internet or huge repository of image data set is still challenging and an open problem. Thus, content based image retrieval (CBIR) systems are developed. Success of CBIR system mainly depends on the image features which used for indexing and similarity measurement. CBIR system developed in deep learning framework has recently demonstrated promising results. In this paper, we present a modified-VGG16 (M-VGG16), deep convolution neural network (DCNN), for image feature extraction. These features are used for image indexing and retrieval in the CBIR system. In M-VGG16, we added $$1\times 1$$ and $$3\times 3$$ convolution kernels into input layer, followed by depth concatenation of the output of both convolution kernels. We apply principal component analysis (PCA) on the features obtained from M-VGG16 for getting robust features with reduced dimension, this leads to the compact image indexing and better retrieval performance. The performance M-VGG16 and M-VGG16 with PCA (M-VGG16 + PCA) is evaluated on benchmark datasets Corel-1k, Corel-10k, Coil-10k, and KADID-10k. Our proposed M-VGG16 + PCA model shows better results in terms of performance metric: precision, recall, and F1-score, when compared to state-of-art model AlexNet , VGG16, and other model proposed using DCNN and hand-crafted feature together. Moreover, in M-VGG16 + PCA the dimension of feature vector is 88% lesser than the M-VGG16 model.},

  abstract     = {Medical ultrasound imaging technology is currently the preferred method for early diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Radiologists’ analysis of ultrasound images is highly dependent on their clinical experience and is susceptible to intra- and inter-observer variability. Although end-to-end deep learning technique can address these limitations, the difficulty of acquiring annotated medical image makes it very challenging. Transfer learning can alleviate the problems, but the large gap between source and target domain will lead to negative transfer. In this paper, a novel transfer learning method with distant domain high-level feature fusion (DHFF) model is proposed. It reduces the distribution distance between the source domain and the target domain while maintaining the characteristics of respective domains, which can avoid excessive feature fusion while enabling the model to learn more valuable transfer knowledge. The DHFF is validated by multiple public source and private target datasets in experiments. The results show that the classification accuracy of DHFF is up to 88.92% with thyroid ultrasound auxiliary source domains, which is up to 8% higher than existing transfer and distant transfer algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, single tasks such as face frontalization, image inpainting, and glasses removal have improved face de-occlusion. However, there is little work on joint learning of multiple de-occlusion tasks. To achieve multi-task learning, we propose an unoccluded face synthesis (UFS) framework for multi-tasks such as face frontalization, image inpainting, and glasses removal, which can remove glasses, face self-occlusion, and external occlude. Our UFS framework consists of an encoder, an image reconstruction module, a decoder, and an image discriminator. First, Gaussian random noise extracts high-dimensional features from images in the encoder module. Next, the image reconstruction module includes multi-scale feature fusion, residual hole block, and self-attention network. As a result, it can strengthen the learning of multi-level fine-grained features and achieve better results in face restoration and face frontalization tasks. Then, we synthesize unoccluded face textures from multi-level fine-grained elements in the decoder. Finally, the image discriminator learns the global information structure of the synthesized image, preventing problems such as distortion and blurring of the picture. Experiments show that our UFS framework can achieve better results on single tasks such as face frontalization, image inpainting, and glasses removal. It also can obtain acceptable results on multiple tasks such as face frontalization and glasses removal simultaneously.},

Our MPC protocols do not require the end-users to reveal their sensitive data in an unencrypted manner, nor do they require the application developer to disclose their trained model parameters or any other sensitive or proprietary information with anyone in plaintext.

  abstract     = {Compared with single-modal content, multimodal content conveys user’s sentiments and feelings more vividly. Thus, multimodal sentiment analysis has become a research hotspot. Due to the flawed data-hungry of deep learning-based methods, transfer learning is extensively utilized. However, most transfer learning-based approaches transfer the model pre-trained on source domain to target domain by simply considering it as feature extractor (i.e., parameters are frozen) or applying global fine-tuning strategy (i.e., parameters are trainable) on it. This results in the loss of advantages of both source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel Context Guided Adaptive Fine-tuning Transformer (CGAFT) that investigates the strengths of both source and target domains adaptively to achieve image–text sentiment analysis. In CGAFT, a Context Guided Policy Network is first introduced to make optimal weights for each image–text instance. These weights indicate how much image sentiment information is necessary to be absorbed from each layer of the image model pre-trained on source domain and the parallel model fine-tuned on target domain. Then, image–text instance and its weights are fed into Sentiment Analysis Network to extract contextual image sentiment representations that are absorbed from both source and target domains to enhance the performance of image–text sentiment analysis. Besides, we observe that no publicly available image–text dataset is in Chinese. To fill this gap, we build an image–Chinese text dataset Flickr-ICT that contains 13,874 image–Chinese text pairs. The experiments conducted on three image–text datasets demonstrate that CGAFT outperforms strong baselines.},

  abstract     = {Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is an essential task in practical applications, such as data monitoring and network security detection. A common approach for anomaly detection is to use sequential models. As an effective sequence model, Transformer can capture the long-term dependence of the time series and is expected to better complete anomaly detection tasks. However, there are still problems to be addressed when using Transformer for anomaly detection. (1) Failing to adapt to concept drift: The vanilla Transformer assumes that the training and test data come from the same distribution. However, practical situations may often violate this assumption due to the time-varying nature of time-series data that may lead to concept drift problems. (2) High computational complexity: The time complexity of vanilla Transformer in the inference stage increase quadratically with the sequence length L. To solve the first problem, we propose the concept drift adaptation method (CDAM), a kind of distribution adaptation method, to dynamic tuning the learning rate of Transformer. CDAM aims to fully utilize the old concept data to optimize a new model on the new concept data through an online learning strategy. To address the second problem, we propose the root square sparse self-attention, which requires only $$O(L\sqrt{L})$$ time complexity. Experimental results on several anomaly detection benchmarks show that our model outperforms many anomaly detection methods, especially in time series with concept drift.},

However, most of these graph-based domain adaptation approaches cannot work in an end-to-end manner, leading to the limited scalable. To address this issue, we propose a learning method named Mini-batch Dynamic Geometric Embedding (MDGE), which seeks to find the relationship between batches source and target samples to learn discriminative representations. Specifically, to build a better graph representing sample relationship, we propose a class-specific sampling strategy to pick up samples which are then used as input of MDGE. Since the samples are effectively selected, we develop a method to dynamically build a subgraph that in turn supports the relationship update and helps the network backbone to extract more discriminative features. Comprehensive experiments on real-world visual datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MDGE algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is a common data analysis method, but the clustering effect of this algorithm is easily affected by the initial clustering centers. Currently, scholars often use the multiple population genetic algorithm (MPGA) to optimize the clustering centers, but the MPGA has insufficient global search ability and lacks self-adaptability, is prone to premature convergence, and has poor initial clustering centers. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive FCM clustering algorithm DMGA-FCM based on a derivative multiple population genetic algorithm (DMGA). In DMGA-FCM algorithm, firstly, the derivative operator, which is proposed for the first time in this paper, performs derivative operations on initialized populations to improve the algorithm&#39;s searchability and deal with the lack of inter-population search ability. Secondly, the adaptive probability fuzzy control operator is used to dynamically adjust the genetic probability to improve the adaptability of the algorithm, which in turn enhances the global merit-seeking ability of the DMGA algorithm and avoids premature convergence. Finally, the initial clustering center of FCM algorithm is optimized with DMGA to enhance the clustering effect of the algorithm. The analysis of simulation experiments and MRI brain map application results show that the DMGA-FCM algorithm can obtain a better clustering effect of medical data and image clustering segmentation effect compared with other related FCM algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Traditional domain adaptation (DA) research generally assume that the source and target domains have the same label set. However, in many real-world applications, there exists a more general and practical situation where target label set is just a subset of source label set, which is formulated as partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem. Compared with DA, PDA is more vulnerable to negative transfer due to the mismatch of label sets. In this paper, we propose a novel PDA method based on Progressive sample Learning of Shared Classes (PLSC), which contains two main parts: shared classes identification and progressive target sample learning. The shared classes identification component aims to exclude source-private classes and merely allow source samples within shared classes to participate in the progress of knowledge transfer. To achieve this goal, following the separation and alignment assumptions in DA, we minimize the sum of the distances from both source and target samples to their corresponding source class centers, and then design an adaptive threshold to determine the shared classes. Furthermore, considering the misleading of target samples that deviate from the source class centers, we propose to progressively include target samples for subspace learning by introducing self-paced learning mechanism. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of our method against the existing counterparts.},

  abstract     = {One of the mosquito-borne pandemic viral infections is Dengue which is mostly transmitted to humans by the Aedes agypti or female Aedes albopictis mosquitoes. The dengue disease expansion is mainly due to the different factors such as climate change, socioeconomic factors, viral evolution, globalization, etc. The unavailability of certain antiviral therapy and specific vaccine increases the risk of the dengue disease spreading even further. This arises the need for a novel technique that overcomes the complexities associated with dengue disease prediction such as low reporting level, misclassification, and incompatible disease monitoring framework. This paper mainly overcomes the above-mentioned problems by integrating the Internet of Things (IoT), fog-cloud, and deep learning techniques for efficient dengue monitoring. A compatible disease monitoring framework is formed via the IoT devices and the reports are effectively created and transferred to the healthcare facilities via the fog-cloud model. The misdiagnosis error is overcome in this paper using the novel Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Tanh Long and Short Term Memory (TLSTM) based Adaptive Teaching Learning Based Optimization (ATLBO) algorithm. The ATLBO optimized CNN-TLSTM architecture mainly analyzes the dengue-related parameters such as Soft Bleeding, Muscle Pain, Joint Pain, Skin rash, Fever, Water Site, Carbon Dioxide, Water Site Humidity, Water Site Temperature, etc. for an efficient clinical decision making and timely disease diagnosis. The experimental results are conducted using a real-time dataset and its performance is validated using various performance metrics. When compared in terms of different statistical parameters such as accuracy, f-measure, mean square error, and reliability, the proposed method offers superior results in the case of dengue disease detection than other existing methods. The ATLBO optimized hybrid CNN-TLSTM shows an accuracy of 96.9%, a precision of 95.7%, recall of 96.8%, and F-measure of 96.2% which is relatively high when compared to the existing techniques. The proposed model is capable of identifying the patients in a certain geographical region and preventing the disease emergency via immediate disease diagnosis and alerting the healthcare officials to offer the stipulated services.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks suffer from the overconfidence issue in the open world, meaning that classifiers could yield confident, incorrect predictions for out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. It is an urgent and challenging task to detect these samples drawn far away from training distribution based on the security considerations of artificial intelligence. Many existing methods based on neural networks mainly rely on complex processing strategies, such as temperature scaling and input preprocessing, to obtain satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose an effective algorithm for detecting out-of-distribution examples utilizing PEDCC-Loss. We mathematically analyze the nature of the confidence score output by the PEDCC (Predefined Evenly-Distribution Class Centroids) classifier and then construct a more effective scoring function to distinguish in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution samples. In this method, there is no need to preprocess the input samples and the computational burden of the algorithm is reduced. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve better OOD detection performance than Softmax-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Dictionary learning has drawn increasing attention for its impressive performance in obtaining the high-fidelity representations of data and extracting semantics. However, when there exists distribution divergence between source and target data, the representations of target data based on the learned dictionary from source data fail to reveal the intrinsic nature of target tasks, which consequently degrades the target performance severely. To tackle this problem, we propose a Shared Dictionary Learning (SDL) method in this paper. SDL learns a shared dictionary by implementing both geometric and statistical adaptations. SDL utilizes the Nyström method to exploit the geometric relationships between domains. Specifically, SDL uses the Nyström method to construct a variable source graph based on the target graph eigensystem and employs the Nyström approximation error to measure the distance between the variable source graph and the ground truth source graph to formalize the geometric divergence. Thus, a domain-invariant graph can be constructed by minimizing the approximation error and can be used to bridge two domains geometrically. Simultaneously, SDL captures the latent statistical commonality underlying two domains via minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance between domains. Finally, SDL achieves a shared dictionary and a set of corresponding new representations to handle cross-distribution data classification. Extensive experimental results on several popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of SDL.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable performance in time series classification tasks. However, the DNNs rely on a mass of data, which may not accumulate in real scenarios. As such, researchers investigate data augmentation methods to solve the scarcity of labeled data. Some of them, such as the rotation, that borrowed from the computer vision are not applicable due to the unique property of time series data. Besides, existing frequency-based methods applied for audio and speech recognition generate new samples by changing original frequency information, which may introduce unreasonable variation. In this paper, we propose a novel time series data augmentation method called Stratified Fourier Coefficients Combination (SFCC). SFCC retains and combines the original Fourier coefficients to augment the time series datasets. First, we transform data into the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). To maintain the initial data distribution, we stratify the coefficients into several groups and then randomly select the groups to concatenate the coefficients. Finally, a new sample is generated through inverse DFT. The experiments demonstrate that the augmentation by SFCC can effectively improve the performance of the DNNs and achieve state-of-the-art results compared with the other 12 benchmarking methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the tracking control problem for a category of discrete-time nonlinear networked control systems (NCSs) with unknown state, parameter uncertainty, data packet dropout and time delay. Our aim is to construct a dynamic tracking feedback controller with a novel event-triggered (ET) scheme to guarantee the system output can track the reference output signal within an allowable error range. With the purpose of reducing the utilization of network resources, an improved adaptive ET communication scheme is designed at first, which can save more network resources. Secondly, the uncertainties can be easily expressed by using the interval type-2 (IT2) T-S fuzzy model to describe the nonlinear systems. Next, a dynamic feedback controller with asynchronous premise variables is designed, and the sufficient conditions for less conservative stability of the system and the design method of the controller are obtained by applying slack matrices. Finally, numerical examples are provided to further illustrate the validity of the strategy proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {The accurate automated brain tumor segmentation is important for disease analysis and control and increases the likelihood of survival. However, it faces significant challenges due to the low contrast of the tissue boundary and the small size of the tumor. Convolutional Neural Networks are a common automated image evaluation technique that has greatly improved current state-of-the-art precision in the task of segmenting brain tumors. This paper presents an advanced Encoder–Decoder algorithm with Depthwise Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling Network (EDD-Net). Firstly, Dilated–ResNet block with Squeeze-and Excitation is introduced in the Encoder and decoder module to derive image features adaptively and focuses on the relevant characteristics of the brain segmentation task with fewer parameters. Then, the Depthwise atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling(DSPP) technique is used as the transition and output layers of the network, to achieve the multi-scale extraction of the feature image and preserves more spatial information. Furthermore, to speed up learning we propose a down-sampling module, while the up-sampling module can more efficiently aggregate low- and high-level feature information. The proposed method is evaluated on the Brats 19 dataset. Experiments demonstrate that the EDD-Net provides high accuracy and robustness in small tumor segmentation. On the online validation set, the suggested ensemble achieved dice scores of 0.813, 0.873, and 0.866 for tumor enhancement, whole tumor enhancement, and tumor core enhancement, respectively, performing favorably compared with existing state-of-the-art architectures.},

We regard the layers preceding the final hidden layer as producing different representations of the input data which are then fed to the two-layer model. We show that these representations improve both optimization and generalization. In particular, we investigate three kernel representations when fed to the final hidden layer: the Gaussian kernel and its approximation by random Fourier features, kernels designed to imitate representations produced by neural networks and finally an optimal kernel designed to align the data with target labels. The approximated representations induced by these kernels are fed to the neural network and the optimization and generalization properties of the final model are evaluated and compared.},

  abstract     = {Many applications of light field (LF) imaging have been limited by the spatial-angular resolution problem, hence the need for efficient super-resolution techniques. Recently, learning-based solutions have achieved remarkably better performances than traditional super-resolution (SR) techniques. Unfortunately, the learning or training process relies heavily on the training dataset, which could be limited for most LF imaging applications. In this paper, we propose a novel LF spatial-angular SR algorithm based on zero-shot learning. We suggest learning cross-scale reusable features in the epipolar plane image (EPI) space, and avoiding explicitly modeling scene priors or implicitly learning that from a large number of LFs. Most importantly, without using any external LFs, the proposed algorithm can simultaneously super-resolve a LF in both spatial and angular domains. Moreover, the proposed solution is free of depth or disparity estimation, which is usually employed by existing LF spatial and angular SR. By using a simple 8-layers fully convolutional network, we show that the proposed algorithm can generate comparable results to the state-of-the-art spatial SR. Our algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of angular SR on multiple groups of public LF datasets. The experiment results indicate that the cross-scale features can be well learned and be reused for LF SR in the EPI space.},

  abstract     = {Recently, energy storage systems are transformed into an emerging field that gains considerable interest in renewable energy mitigation and integration of intermittencies. Numerous research works have been carried out to attain precise and accurate forecasting of solar and wind power. Due to overloading, achieving accurate forecasting in both solar and wind power is considered as a challenging task. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel ensemble empirical mode decomposition-long short term memory (EEMDLSTM) based hybrid chaotic atom search optimization (HCASO) technique to attain enhanced forecasting accuracy. The fluctuations based on time series data using decomposition of EEMD are comparatively simple thereby developing favourable conditions to construct the prediction model with high precision. Hence, this paper integrated EEMD and LSTM to obtain a new forecasting technique. The significant objective of the proposed methodology involves enhancing the rate of forecasting accuracy for both solar and wind power. In addition, this paper provides a brief analysis with respect to three different forecasting analyses that include daily basis forecasting, monthly basis forecasting as well as yearly basis forecasting. In order to perform the efficiency of the proposed method, three performance metrics such as Mean absolute error, root mean square error and coefficient of variation are evaluated.Finally, the comparative analysis is carried out for the proposed and existing methods to ensure the accuracy of the forecasting model. The values of Mean absolute error, root mean square error and coefficient of variation for the proposed method in solar power forecasting are 0.65, 1.29 and 10.58% respectively.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence has captivated the healthcare industry as these techniques are efficient and accurate in medical image analysis. In recent years, several deep learning models have been proposed for the task of 2D or 3D bio-medical image segmentation. Liver tumour segmentation in Computed Tomography (CT) images remains an arduous problem due to the tumour&#39;s shape variance, its occurrence in multiple regions and the granular noise of the CT images. In this paper, a novel Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Residual Neural Network (CEDRNN) is proposed for automatic liver tumour segmentation from CT images. The feature accumulation using additive skip connections in the proposed model assures better learning of the model and faster convergence during training. A public dataset (3DIRCADb) was used to train and test the proposed model. The 3DIRCADb dataset is considered challenging to use because it contains a greater variety and complexity of livers and tumours. The CT slices were subjected to pre-processing steps such as Hounsfield windowing and Gaussian filtering. The proposed model has resulted in an average DICE score of 95.2% for liver tumour segmentation. The task of tumour segmentation is done precisely without the need for prior liver segmentation in the CT image. Despite having 85 layers in its architecture, CEDRNN outperforms comparable models with only 0.6 million network parameters. The experimental results proved that the proposed model is more efficient for liver tumour segmentation as compared to the related existing approaches. The automatic segmentation of the tumour is essential for the clinical interpretation and diagnosis of liver-related problems.},

In order to realize the automatic scoring of experimental operation, a method to infer the experimental operation process by detecting the state changes of the experimental equipment is proposed. In addition, simultaneously detecting all the experimental equipment and accurately identifying different states of each experimental equipment is a vital but challenging task. To solve the two issues mentioned above, YOLOv5 and ResNeXt cascade networks are proposed, which are compared with other models on the self-made data set, and a good matching result is obtained. Based on the cascade networks, the method of continuous state maintenance is added to reduce missed detection. Finally, 8 groups of circuit states are designed as automatic scoring points for the experiment of &quot;Measuring the resistance of small bulb by voltammetry&quot;. On 10 videos of students doing experiments and obtaining different evaluation grades, the scoring results of the proposed method are compared with those of six experimental teachers. The results show that although there is a gap between the automatic scoring and the teacher’s scoring due to different evaluation methods, the evaluation grade of automatic scoring is consistent with the teacher’s evaluation grade, which can reflect the students’ experimental operation level. We hope this report can provide useful experience for a reference for automatic scoring in experimental teaching.},

  abstract     = {Object tracking has made remarkable progress in the past few years. But most advanced trackers are becoming more expensive, which limits their deployment in mobile devices with limited resources. In addition, the current popular tracker realizes similarity learning through the feature correlation between multiple branches. Some of these cross-correlation methods lost a lot of face information, and some introduced a lot of unfavorable background information. Based on this motivation, this paper is committed to reducing the number of algorithm parameters and enhancing the ability of feature extraction. Heterogeneous convolution is introduced into the backbone network to reduce the convolution kernel parameters. Add a search box mechanism to dynamically adjust the network receiving domain to generate more feature maps with cheap operations. Furthermore, we also integrate the split-attention mechanism into the backbone network to standardize the arrangement of heterogeneous convolution. To evaluate the model, we conducted experiments on challenging VTB datasets and actual shooting datasets, which contain 82,351 facial features. Experimental results show that our method distance precision (DP) and overlap success precision (OP) are 93.5% and 67.5% respectively, which are comparable with the state-of-the-art object tracking methods and reduce about one-third of the parameters. Meanwhile, the feature mapping of each convolution module is explored, and the interpretation of lightweight convolution is given.},

  abstract     = {Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as LSTM and GRU have been highly effective in handling sequential time series data in recent years. Although Gated RNNs have an inherent ability to learn complex temporal dynamics, there is potential for further enhancement by enabling these deep learning networks to directly use time information to recognise time-dependent patterns in data and identify important segments of time. Synonymous with time series data in real-world applications are missing values, which often reduce a model’s ability to perform predictive tasks. Historically, missing values have been handled by simple or complex imputation techniques as well as machine learning models, which manage the missing values in the prediction layers. However, these methods do not attempt to identify the significance of data segments and therefore are susceptible to poor imputation values or model degradation from high missing value rates. This paper develops Cyclic Gate enhanced recurrent neural networks with learnt waveform parameters to automatically identify important data segments within a time series and neglect unimportant segments. By using the proposed networks, the negative impact of missing data on model performance is mitigated through the addition of customised cyclic opening and closing gate operations. Cyclic Gate Recurrent Neural Networks are tested on several sequential time series datasets for classification performance. For long sequence datasets with high rates of missing values, Cyclic Gate enhanced RNN models achieve higher performance metrics than standard gated recurrent neural network models, conventional non-neural network machine learning algorithms and current state of the art RNN cell variants.},

  abstract     = {The Real-time wearable Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device is a perfect choice for assisting in detecting cardiovascular disease. A novel ECG beat classification algorithm is presented for continuous heart monitoring on low-processing-capacity wearable devices. We discuss the different wearable wristwatch monitoring system, which allows for continuous 24-h heart rate monitoring. This paper introduces a novel method for classifying arrhythmias based on deep learning. The method relies on QRS/PT detection, Sigma-Delta Modulation (SDM), One-Dimensional Convolution Neural Networks (1D-CNN) algorithms. The QRS/PT wave detection system is based on the 1D-CNN and SDM framework with local minimum and local maximum point algorithms. We proposed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network with a blend classifier. The classifier combines two small LSTM networks’ predictions using two different features directly extracted from 1D-CNN and SDM bitstreams. The proposed model is evaluated by detecting QRS/PT waves and classifying arrhythmias using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Five different classifications are performed and evaluated by the AAMI standard: N, F, Q, S, and V. The values for accuracy, positive predictivity, sensitivity, and F1-score are 99.56%, 96.5%, 93.87%, and 95.18%, respectively. The proposed algorithm detects QRS/PT in approximately 2050 ms and classifies each heartbeat in approximately 40–60 ms with wearable devices, and it consumes $$1.5\,\upmu \mathrm{w}$$ total power. The results indicate that our proposed system outperforms previous research in accuracy and meets both computation time and low power consumption requirements.},

However, ViT relies on costly pre-training on large external datasets and is strict in data and calculations, making it an obstacle to running on common equipment. To address this challenge, we propose a simple and efficient Transformer namely SRT tailored for the image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction task. It is trained on a single GPU card without large-scale pre-training. At the beginning of the whole model, we introduce a convolutional stem module instead of straightforward tokenization of raw input images for low-level feature extraction and steady training. In the main Transformer learning phase, we exploit an additional head-convolution to make up for the lack of information interaction in multi-head self-attention (MHSA). Then further to strengthen the spatial correlation of neighboring tokens in MLP, a locally-enhanced feed-forward layer is thus employed to promote local dependencies. In terms of the inefficiency of Transformer, a channel reduction strategy is presented in MHSA, which dramatically reduces the complexity and space resources. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed Transformer model can rival the current state-of-the-art methods with a single GPU card.},

  abstract     = {As an important part of intelligent surveillance systems, person re-identification (re-ID) has a wide range of application prospects in smart cities. However, due to occlusion, viewpoint variation, and background shift, the misalignment problem always decreases the re-ID systems’ effects. To solve this problem, a pose alignment network with information interaction (PAII) is proposed. This approach consists of three cascaded modules. First, guided by a pretrained pose estimator, the backbone with a dual attention block is used to obtain local features corresponding to different pose keypoints along with the global feature. Then, a pose alignment module is constructed to group these local features into different parts and fuse them with a hyperparameter $$\lambda $$ , which provides the possibility to achieve semantic alignment. Finally, since different semantic features are extracted, an information interaction module consisting of graph attention layers is made to conduct message passing between different semantic features. All semantic features and the global feature are used to calculate the loss functions. Our approach considers multi-scale representations and information interaction of semantic features, which makes it more robust to misalignment problems. Thus, the proposed PAII method achieves better performance than most existing methods on multiple popular re-ID datasets.},

Previous studies show that the exploration of local features may help for capturing more robust feature representations. However, part-level characteristics are demonstrated useful but easily confused with comparable attributes in corresponding locations. For this problem, we propose an effective relation-aware multi-granularity hierarchical network (RMHNet) to explore the value of correlation between part-level and global features. In this paper, with a concise structure, RMHNet conducts a uniform partitioning strategy to relocate images into horizontal and vertical stripes. We incorporate the relationship between part-level semantic representation with the entire image to mine structural relationship information of the probe image for potential critical identification clues.

There exist multi-label learning algorithms that handle the datasets’ class imbalance issue by assigning favorable weights for positive labels to compensate for their scarce occurrence. The weight assignment assumes full label information and doesn’t provision for the uncertainty introduced by unobserved or missing labels. Therefore, to deal with the class imbalance problem in multi-label learning with missing labels, we propose Class Imbalance aware Missing labels Multi-label Learning, CIMML. Our proposed method handles class imbalance issue by constructing a label weight matrix with weight estimation guided by how frequently a label is present, absent, and unobserved. Utilizing the class imbalance sensitive weights and auxiliary label correlations, we introduce a weighted squared loss function with discriminatory label weights which guides the missing label completion and learns the multi-label classifier efficiently. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of proposed classifier against state-of-the-art multi-label learning approaches for missing labels underlining the significance of handling label imbalance for multi-label learning for missing labels.},

It requires harnessing the inter-relationship of multiple variables and various ranges of temporal dependencies to assign the correct classification label of the time series. Multivariate time series may come from a wide range of sources and be used in various scenarios, bringing the classifier challenge of temporal representation learning. We propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture called Attentional Gated Res2Net for multivariate time series classification. Our model uses hierarchical residual-like connections to achieve multi-scale receptive fields and capture multi-granular temporal information. The gating mechanism enables the model to consider the relations between the feature maps extracted by receptive fields of multiple sizes for information fusion. Further, we propose two types of attention modules, channel-wise attention and block-wise attention, to better leverage the multi-granular temporal patterns. Our experimental results on 14 benchmark multivariate time-series datasets show that our model outperforms several baselines and state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our model outperforms the SOTA by a large margin, the classification accuracy of our model is 10.16% better than the SOTA model. Besides, we demonstrate that our model improves the performance of existing models when used as a plugin. Further, based on our experiments and analysis, we provide practical advice on applying our model to a new problem.},

First, a suitable time-dependent functional is constructed in view of the features of intermittent control, which fully utilizes the state information on the working intervals. The main merit of the designed time-dependent functional lies in that the ‘jump’ behavior, at every switching point, between two Lyapunov functionals vanishes. It does not increase at the beginning of working intervals. Meanwhile, two sufficient linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)-based stability criteria are established in combination with some estimation techniques and Lyapunov stability theorem. On this basis, the work period, feedback control gain, and decay rate, can be jointly designed to achieve the exponential stabilization of networks by utilizing aperiodically intermittent controller. Finally, two simulation examples are developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results.},

This paper presents a spike-based system to adapt audio information from low-power pulse-density modulation (PDM) microelectromechanical systems microphones into rate coded spike frequencies. These spikes could be directly used by the neuromorphic auditory sensor (NAS) for frequency decomposition in different bands, avoiding the analog or digital conversion to spike streams. This improves the time response of the NAS, allowing its use in more time restrictive applications. This adaptation was conducted in VHDL as an interface for PDM microphones, converting their pulses into temporal distributed spikes following a pulse-frequency modulation scheme with an accurate inter-spike-interval, known as PDM to spikes interface (PSI). We introduce a new architecture of spike-based band-pass filter to reject DC components and distribute spikes in time. This was tested in two scenarios, first as a stand-alone circuit for its characterization, and then integrated with a NAS for verification. The PSI achieves a total harmonic distortion of $$-$$ 46.18 dB and a signal-to-noise ratio of 63.47 dB, demands less than 1% of the resources of a Spartan-6 FPGA and its power consumption is around 7 mW.},

The major highlight of this work is to design and develop a new solar irradiance forecasting using a hybridized deep structured architecture method. Initially, the benchmark data is gathered that incorporates the “numerical weather forecasting data” like “temperature, dew point, humidity, visibility, wind speed, and other descriptive information”. After collecting the data, the feature extraction is performed by ICA, PCA, and LDA. Moreover, the optimal feature selection is performed for selecting the important features. The features are used for the solar irradiance forecasting using the hybridized deep structured arhitectures. The suggested deep learning model consists of Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The training algorithm of both DNN and RNN is modified by the Slow Rider-based Rider Optimization Algorithm (S-ROA) so known as Weight Optimized Deep Recurrent Neural Network.

It is a key technology to further extract entity relationships and mine other potential information in natural language processing. At present, the methods based on machine learning and deep learning have been widely used in the research of named entity recognition, but most learning models use feature extraction based on word and character level. The word preprocessing of this kind of model often ignores the context semantic information of the target word and can not realize polysemy. In addition, the loss of semantic information and limited training data greatly limit the improvement of model performance and generalization ability. In order to solve the above problems and improve the efficiency of named entity recognition technology in Chinese text, this paper constructs a multi-task BERT-BiLSTM-AM-CRF intelligent processing model, uses Bert to extract the dynamic word vector combined with context information, and inputs the results into CRF layer for decoding after further training through BiLSTM module. After attention mechanism network, the model can learn together on two Chinese datasets, Finally, CRF classifies and extracts the observation annotation sequence to get the final result. Compared with many previous single task models, the F1 score of this multi-task model in MASR and people’s daily datasets has been significantly improved (0.55% and 3.41%), which demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-task learning for Chinese named entity recognition.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a learning-based algorithm to imitate the head-on obstacle avoidance behavior of humans by the mobile robot. Head-on collision avoidance is the most complex behavior where someone comes directly towards the robot and the robot only gets a limited time to avoid a collision. The robot avoids the dynamic obstacles and leads towards the goal using raw 2D laser sensor readings and goal information respectively. These two behaviors of robots depend on the long-term and short-term memory of the algorithm. To properly address this behavior, we propose a novel architecture of LSTM unit named Navigation LSTM (N-LSTM) that is equipped with greedy gates. Obstacles traveling at different speeds need a different steering mechanism, with larger obstacle speed signifying an urgent steering based on the short-term memory alone. This can be hard to model by a LSTM that takes a spatial information as a raw LiDAR data. The proposed N-LSTM further models unique gates that balance between the short-term behavior of obstacle avoidance and the long-term behavior of goal-seeking based on the relative goal position. The N-LSTM experimentally performs better than different variants of LSTM and two classical approaches of navigation namely dynamic window approach and timed elastic band.},

  abstract     = {To deal with the insufficient feedbacks and dynamics of individual arrival and item popularity in online recommender, collaborative multi-armed bandit (MAB) schemes intentionally utilize the explicitly known or implicitly inferred social relationships among individuals to collaboratively recommend. Especially, without assuming the social relationships among individuals given, the dynamic cluster of bandits simultaneously infers the relationships, and recommends items through using the inferred relationships in multi-round interactive steps. However, the existed clustering bandit algorithms have two weakpoints: first they either fix the number of clusters in advance, or assign two individuals into the same cluster if there exists a path between two users in graph structure, which may lead to the wrongly cluster users. Second, they usually exploit only the cluster’s accumulated parameters of cluster as the inferred preference of individual in the cluster, which can’t fully accurately learn individual’s latent preference. To address issues above, we propose new clustering MAB based online recommendation methods, ADCB and ADCB+, based on adaptively splitting and merging clusters, which incrementally enforce both user-level re-assignment and cluster-level re-adjustment in recommendation rounds to efficiently and effectively learn the individuals’ preferences and their clustering structure. Especially, the proposed ADCB+ method further exploits both the accumulated cluster preference parameters and each individual’s personalized feature through the adaptively weighting of the two influences according to the number of user interactions. The experiments on three real online rating datasets (i.e., MovieLens-2k, Delicious-2k, LastFM-2k) consistently show that, in terms of the cumulative reward over recommendation rounds, and the average Click-Through-Rate, our proposed ADCB and ADCB+ schemes outperform than some existing dynamic clustering based online recommendation methods.},

To further boost robustness, the scatter loss of the class of vectors is minimized using $$L_{1}$$ -norm. As an equivalent problem in simple form, a pair of quadratic programming problems (QPPs) is constructed (L1-Pin-TBSVM) with m variables where m is the number of training vectors. Unlike TBSVM, the proposed L1-Pin-TBSVM is free from inverse kernel matrix and the non-linear problem can be obtained directly from its linear formulation by applying the kernel trick. The efficacy and robustness of L1-Pin-TBSVM has been demonstrated by experiments performed on synthetic and UCI datasets in the presence of noise.},

  abstract     = {Classification in hyperspectral remote sensing images (HRSIs) is a challenging process in image analysis and one of the most popular topics. In recent years, many methods have been proposed to solve the HRSIs classification problem. Compared to traditional machine learning methods, deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is commonly used in the classification of HRSIs. Deep learning-based methods based on CNNs show remarkable performance in HRSIs classification and greatly support the development of classification technology. In this study, a method in which the Hybrid 3D/2D Complete Inception module and the Hybrid 3D/2D CNN method are used together has been proposed to solve the HRSIs classification problem. In the proposed method, multi-level feature extraction is performed by using multiple convolution layers with the Inception module. This improves the performance of the network. Conventional CNN-based methods use 2D CNN for feature extraction. However, only spatial features are extracted with 2D CNN. 3D CNN is used to extract spatial-spectral features. However, 3D CNN is computationally complex. Therefore, in the proposed method, a hybrid approach is used by first using 3D CNN and then 2D CNN. This reduces computational complexity and extracts more spatial features. In addition, PCA is used as a preprocessing step for optimum spectral band extraction in the proposed method. The proposed method has been tested using Indian pines, Salinas, University of Pavia, HyRANK-Loukia and Houston datasets, which are frequently used in studies for HRSIs classification. The overall accuracy of the proposed method in these five datasets are 99.83%, 100%, 100%, 90.47% and 98.93%, respectively. These results reveal that the proposed method provides higher classification performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Channel pruning is one of the main methods of model compression for the deep neural network. Some of the existing pruning methods manually set parameters based on experience, which is very time-consuming, and pruning channels by greedy algorithms or heuristic algorithms will bring local optimal solutions. Some methods prune channels by automated methods, but the lack of theoretical guidance on network characteristics makes the pruning efficiency extremely low. In this article, we propose a new automated channel pruning method: by introducing additional losses into the network, to obtain the channel’s ability to discriminate information and adopt an automated pruning method based on reinforcement learning to iteratively perform channel selection and parameter optimization and prune the filtered channels. A large number of experiments have proved the effectiveness of our method. For example, for ResNet-110, on CIFAR-10, our method reduces FLOPs by 63.1%, the parameters are reduced by 62.7%, and there is almost no loss in accuracy, only 0.01% lower than the baseline model. On ImageNet, FLOPs are reduced by 50.3%, The parameters are reduced by 55.2%, and the accuracy is only lost by 0.22%.},

The current generation of radial basis function neural network is equipped with multiple kernels which provide significant performance benefits compared to the previous generation using only a single kernel. In existing multi-kernel RBF algorithms, multi-kernel is formed by the convex combination of the base/primary kernels. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-kernel RBFNN in which every base kernel has its own (local) weight. This novel flexibility in the network provides better performance such as faster convergence rate, better local minima and resilience against stucking in poor local minima. These performance gains are achieved at a competitive computational complexity compared to the contemporary multi-kernel RBF algorithms. The proposed algorithm is thoroughly analysed for performance gain using mathematical and graphical illustrations and also evaluated on three different types of problems namely: (i) pattern classification, (ii) system identification and (iii) function approximation. Empirical results clearly show the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the existing state-of-the-art multi-kernel approaches.},

Recently, with the successful application of the Region Proposal Network (RPN) in object detection, siamese networks combined with RPN have achieved good performance in visual tracking tasks. However, RPN requires the selection of the number, aspect ratio and size of the anchor boxes and these anchor-related parameters more often than not, need manual intervention and tuning. In this work, we first add a channel-aware module in the siamese network to obtain the more discriminative features. Thereafter, we propose an anchor-free strategy to replace the RPN module. The proposed framework consists of two networks, namely, the Siamese network and the Centerness Prediction network (CPN). We call the proposed method SiamCPN. In the Siamese network, Resnet50 is used as the backbone. SiamCPN is simple and relatively efficient due to the fact that it avoids the need for complicated hyper-parameters of the anchor boxes. Extensive experimental results on four visual tracking benchmark datasets, OTB100, VOT2016, UAV123 and LaSOT show that the proposed framework has achieved highly competitive and better performance compared with the state-of-the-art trackers. SiamCPN can run at 60 frames per second (FPS) on an AMD processor with 2 RTX3090.},

To improve recognition performance between similar daily activities, this paper presents a novel daily activity recognition method based on sensor sequence similarity and a global similarity calculation method based on random sampling. Firstly, the sensor similarity between source domain and target domain will be calculated to generate the sensor mapping matrix. Secondly, the features are extracted from all the samples of daily activities to calculate the similarities. Thirdly, the sensor similarity matrix is employed to calculate the sensor sequence similarity between the samples. Finally, the source domain samples with high similarity are chosen as similar samples to calculate global similarities with a random sampling method. The best matching source sample will be selected and the label is sent to the target sample. To evaluate our method, we use four public datasets to prove the validity of our method.

Early stage diagnosis of AD is critical for improving clinical outcomes and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collection can be used to monitor the progress of each patient. However, missing data is a common problem in longitudinal AD studies. The main factors come from subject dropouts and failed scans. This hinders the acquisition of longitudinal sequences that consist of multi-time-point magnetic resonance (MR) images at relatively uniform intervals. In this paper, we present a generative adversarial convolutional network to predict missing structural MRI data. In particular, we include multiple MRI scans as a temporal sequence collected at different times and determine the spatio-temporal relationship between the different scans in the proposed network. We adopt residual bottlenecks in the generator to decrease parameter values and deepen the network. In order to make full use of the longitudinal information, our discriminator classifies not only real MR images from generated MR images, but also fake sequences from real sequences in which the longitudinal MR images for all time points come from the dataset, only the last MR image comes from the generator. Results of our experiment show that our method performs more accurately for the longitudinal structural MRI data prediction of a brain afflicted with AD.},

We reuse the decoder of the Adversarial Autoencoders to generate data for the specified category, which expands the training space of the samples. In order to capture the features of the generated data, we also reuse the encoder to generate the corresponding latent label variables and train them in a supervised manner. To maintain and improve the generative power of the decoder, we impose conditional adversarial training on the generated data. Finally, we use the encoder with latent feature extraction capability to complete the classification by transfer learning. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we validate on a real Gastric Cancer dataset and five widely used UCI public datasets. Extensive experiments show that EAAE improves significantly in classification accuracy on small-scale datasets and performs better on large-scale datasets compared to popular classification methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the time cost of EAAE and conduct ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the various modules of EAAE.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to restore a clear image at high resolution from a low-resolution and motion-blurred image. To this end, we propose an end-to-end neural network named P2GAN containing deblurring and super-resolution modules with pixel-level and perceptual-level regularization terms. In the deblurring module, we propose an Asymmetric Residual Encoder-Decoder architecture, which enlarges the receptive field by stacking the Residual In Residual (RIR) structure with different numbers of convolutional filters to address different sizes of motion blur kernels. In particular, we extend RIR with a Channel Attention Block (CAB) to reweight the deblurring channel features. Similarly, CAB is integrated into the Residual In Residual Dense (RIRD) structure, denoted as RIRD-CA, to reweight channelwise features from input images and the deblurring module in the super-resolution module. RIRD-CA establishes a continuous-memory mechanism that preserves the features extracted from earlier layers along with the network. In particular, pixelwise loss, adversarial loss, and contextual loss have been incorporated into P2GAN from pixel-level and perceptual-level perspectives. Adversarial loss is used to generate rich textures and high-frequency details, while contextual loss eliminates unrealistic textures. Extensive experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed model which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation of large unstructured 3D point clouds is important problem for 3D object recognition which in turn is essential to solving more complex tasks such as scene understanding. The problem is highly challenging owing to large scale of data, varying point density and localization errors of 3D points. Nevertheless, with recent successes of deep neural network architectures to solve complex 2D perceptual problems, several researchers have shown interest to translate the developed 2D networks to 3D point cloud segmentation by a prior voxelization step for an explicit neighborhood representation. However, such a 3D grid representation loses the fine details and inherent structure due to quantization artifacts. For this purpose, this paper proposes an approach to performing semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds by exploiting the idea of super-point based graph construction. The proposed architecture is composed of two cascaded modules including a light-weight representation learning module which uses unsupervised geometric grouping to partition the large-scale unstructured 3D point cloud and a deep context aware sequential network based on long short memory units and graph convolutions with embedding residual learning for semantic segmentation. The proposed model is evaluated on two standard benchmark datasets and achieves competitive performance with the existing state-of-the-art datasets.

  abstract     = {The extreme learning machine (ELM), a new learning algorithm for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN), has drawn interest of a large number of researchers, especially due to its training speed and good generalization performances compared to known machine learning methods. The ELM model generates a solution to a linear optimization problem for the hidden layer output weights by randomly generating input weights and biases, instead of iteratively adjusting the network parameters (weights and biases) such as the backpropagation neural network model using the backpropagation algorithm and gradient descent learning. However, random determination of input weights and hidden layer bias can result in non-optimal parameters that have an adverse impact on the final results or require a higher number of hidden nodes for the neural network. In this study, a new hybrid method is proposed to overcome the drawbacks caused by non-optimal input weights and hidden biases. This hybrid method, which is called CPN-ELM algorithm, uses the counter propagation network (CPN) model to systematically optimize input weights, hidden layer neurons and hidden biases. The performance of CPN-ELM compared to traditional ELM method was examined on three benchmark regression datasets and we observed that the model produced higher accuracy values for each datasets.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) has led to rapid progress on structured exploration and solving challenging tasks. In HRL, planning with skills instead of actions, which effectively shortens the task’s length and decreases the complexity of the problems. Most works on skill discovery focus on finding diverse skills. However, existing methods fail to increase the diversity of the visited states when the agent performs skills. In this paper, &quot;Variational Diversity Maximization&quot; (VIM) is proposed to address this problem. VIM encourages the agent to maximize an information theoretic objective: The entropy of states conditioned on skills. Hence the agent explores more about the environment when performing skills, increasing the possibility of finding the optimal policy. Maximizing the proposed conditional entropy is not a trivial problem. VIM approximates it through the reconstruction error of conditional variational autoencoders, hence this problem is solved elegantly. Besides this entropy, the mutual information between states and skills is also maximized to discover diverse skills, as other methods. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed to measure the diversity of skills efficiently. Experimental results suggest that VIM allows the agent to learn exploratory skills in an unsupervised way, and the agent achieves strong performance on the challenging tasks with these learned skills. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily combined with other planning algorithms to solve complicated tasks.},

To amend convergent property during real-time synchronization of chaotic system, this paper proposes a novel definable-convergence-time (DCT) neurodynamic approach for designing the associated neural network, called DCT-Net. Quite differing from the conventional zeroing neurodynamic (CZN) approach showing undefinable convergent time, the DCT-Net distinctively illustrates superiority of DCT property making synchronization of chaotic system faster and higher precision. In addition, theorems about globally stable in addition to convergent property are rigorously proved in detail. Moreover, different simulative examples substantiate the validity of DCT-Net for real-time synchronization of chaotic system. Comprehensive comparisons with other existing nets further verify advantages. At last, different tests detailedly discover the influence on convergent property by selecting various user-defined parameters as well as initial state.},

  abstract     = {The research in pedestrian detection has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, robust pedestrian detection in crowded scenes remains a considerable challenge. Many methods resort to additional annotations (visible body or head) of a dataset or develop attention mechanisms to alleviate the difficulties posed by occlusions. However, these methods rarely use contextual information to strengthen the features extracted by a backbone network. The main aim of this paper is to extract more effective and discriminative features of pedestrians for robust pedestrian detection with heavy occlusions. To this end, we propose a Global Context-Aware module to exploit contextual information for pedestrian detection. Fusing global context with the information derived from the visible part of occluded pedestrians enhances feature representations. The experimental results obtained on two challenging benchmarks, CrowdHuman and CityPersons, demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task mainly detects the sentiment polarities of aspect terms, or achieves the aspect-opinion co-extraction. Existing ABSA methods usually divide the task into two independent sub-tasks to execute separately, which will result in getting many meaningless pairs due to the following two reasons: the aspect-sentiment pairs extraction task has no reference opinion terms for the interaction, and the aspect-opinion co-extraction task has no reference to their corresponding sentiment dependencies. In recent years, the triplet extraction task is based on above problems with ABSA task to extract aspect terms, opinion terms and sentiment. However, existing triplet extraction methods still have insufficient interaction among the three sub-tasks and serious error propagation problems. Besides, actual sentences often have overlapping aspect words and opinion words. In this paper, we formulate the ABSA as an opinion triplet extraction (OTE) task under the multi-task learning framework. Meanwhile, a method of sharing sentence vectors for opinion triplet extraction (OTE-SSV) is proposed to enhance the extraction ability of text semantic representation and strengthen the interaction among the elements of triplet extraction. Unlike the existing OTE approaches that rely on a pipeline manner for multiple tasks, OTE-SSV uses a concurrent way to extract multiple sub-tasks, which greatly reduces the errors presenting in the previous subtask propagate into the next subtask extraction task. It is experimentally verified that OTE-SSV can also correctly and efficiently extract triplet in sentences with overlapping aspect words and opinion words. Experimental results on four ABSA semeval benchmarks show that F1 measures of OTE-SSV are 1% to 2% obviously superiorer to series of state-of-the-art technologies.},

Irrelevant data points are regarded as data redundancy which are mainly eliminated from the data samples to achieve relevant ones for onward processing. Several researches have made significant effort to detect and eliminate redundant sensing data points with the support of dimensionality reduction techniques. These techniques mainly remove redundant data records by similarity comparison between the features of a given sensed dataset without considering the data records or points. However, there is a technique called Perceptually Important Point (PIP) deployed to eliminate data redundancy that considers the sensed data records but proved ineffective as it eliminates relevant sensed data alongside with redundant ones due to missing data. Therefore, K-means imputation clustering with the combination of Cosine and Manhattan Weighted Distance Measure technique is proposed in this research. Thus, for the recovery of missing data in order to improve the performance of the PIP technique. Simulations are conducted on five benchmark datasets for the elimination of redundant sensed data records. Experimental results shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing PIP technique with up to 99.967 and 99.614% accuracy with the execution time of 1234 s, before and after the elimination of redundant sensed data records on a given datasets.},

Despite the promising results provided by these studies, only few have considered the temporal information of this dataset, wherein the results were not very satisfactory. Moreover, there is very sparse existing literature that applies active learning to this type of blockchain dataset. In this paper, we develop a classification model that combines long-short-term memory with GCN—referred to as temporal-GCN—that classifies the illicit transactions of Elliptic data using its transaction’s features only. Subsequently, we present an active learning framework applied to the large-scale Bitcoin transaction graph dataset, unlike previous studies on this dataset. Uncertainties for active learning are obtained using Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) and Monte-Carlo based adversarial attack (MC-AA) which are Bayesian approximations. Active learning frameworks with these methods are compared using various acquisition functions that appeared in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, MC-AA method is the first time to be examined in the context of active learning.

  abstract     = {The diversified and huge applicability of sensor networks has attracted the researchers in this field. The nodes in the sensor networks are distinguished by the scarce resources; hence energy conservation approaches are of great significance. The node scheduling approaches aims to schedule the nodes in a number of set covers, which can be activated periodically to monitor the given points of interest with the desired confidence level along with the objective of maximizing coverage and network lifetime. The determination of set covers is considered as a NP hard problem and is dependent on different network parameters such as node contribution, trust values and coverage probability.. The main motivation of the proposed approach is to reduce this complexity by employing the prediction technique based on learning through neural network. The paper presents the neural network based prediction model to determine the activation status of the nodes in the set cover. In this scheme, the node has to monitor the neighboring node parameters at regular intervals, which incurs a huge number of communications and overhead. The data prediction technique can reduce this overhead by autonomously determining the node activation status. The paper proposes a neural network-based prediction technique for sensor networks in combination with the node scheduling strategy. The different node parameters are provided as input to train the network for prediction of node status. The performance of the different prediction models have been evaluated in terms of precision, recall, f1 score and accuracy for the training and test datasets. The binary cross entropy-based loss function is analyzed in training the neural networks. The accuracy of the model is evaluated for the validation split size as 20%. The simulation results show that the accuracy in the prediction of the node status is maximum for the NAdam based optimizer i.e. 87% and 76% for the training and the testing dataset respectively.},

  abstract     = {Object detection and semantic segmentation are the basic tasks of computer vision. Recently, the combination of object detection and semantic segmentation has made great progress. With the box-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation(WSSS) method, we predict segmentation based on feature maps extracted from object detector. Existing methods require both box-level and pixel-level annotations to train the shared backbone network simultaneously to get the bounding boxes and segmentation. However, in the absence of pixel-level annotations and without changing the parameters of network framework, object detectors can’t predict semantic segmentation. We design a compact and plug-and-play object detection to semantic segmentation(O2S) module to enable object detectors to predict semantic masks, making full utilization of the training set and intermediate feature maps of object detection. We also propose a box-level weakly supervised probabilistic gap adaptive(PGA) method, which enables O2S to learn semantic masks from the training set of object detection. We evaluate the proposed approach on Pascal VOC 2007 and Pascal VOC 2012 and show its feasibility. With only 3.5 million parameters, the results of O2S trained with PGA are very close to the results of the whole networks trained with the WSSS methods. Our work has important implications for exploring the commonality of multiple visual tasks.},

Recent advancements in combinatorial optimization improve the branch-and-bound solving process by replacing the time-consuming heuristics with machine learning models. In this paper, by taking advantage of the heavy-head maximum depth distribution of the branch-and-bound solution trees, a heavy-head sampling strategy is proposed for the imitation learning on the combinatorial auction problems. Experimental results show that, under the small-dataset fast-training scheme and using the heavy-head sampling strategy, the final evaluation results of the trained policy on the combinatorial auction problems are improved significantly (in the sense of statistical testing), compared to using the uniform sampling strategy in previous studies.},

Panoptic segmentation using ChaInNet accurately extracts the contour of instance objects and improves the accuracy of instance segmentation, thus reducing the adverse effects of segmentation competition on the quality of the outcome. ChaInNet is a general instance segmentation architecture that can be widely used in various object recognition tasks.

WhatsApp is one of the popular social messaging applications used in India. Identification of demographic features of authors in social media is known as author profiling. Author profiling is helpful for many applications such as forensics, security and marketing. Author profiling helps to identify fake profiles in social media. By analysing their WhatsApp messages in code-mixed Tamil, this paper focuses on identifying the socio-demographic appearance of author traits or features such as gender, age-group, marital and education status. Even though many studies have been conducted on Author Profiling in English and other resources-rich languages, the research on the Indian language is still nascent. This study is the first Author Profiling task for code-mixed Tamil on WhatsApp. As a part of this study, we have created the benchmark WhatsApp dataset in code-mixed Tamil language to develop the author profiling system. We propose a stacked Convolutional Network (CNN) combined with k-max pooling and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) to enhance the classification performance of CNN. Multiple experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, including the comparison against existing models with diverse parameter settings. We have also incorporated Focal loss and context embedding based data augmentation to handle the data imbalance.

The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model helps us to find the key topic of the e-book. The major flaw of this LDA is that it can’t capture the semantic knowledge in the documents. As a result, it fails to find the semantically cohesive, and meaningful topics. To address this issue, we propose a novel sBERT-LDA model, which augments the e-books with recommended question-answers and videos. We construct SiameseBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) network which provides the semantically relevant phrase embeddings. The model identifies the key topics of the e-book, after which sBERT is used to assess the similarity between the question-answers. This effort also provides advanced video indexing methods for each recommended video, allowing videos with “Table of Contents” and “Phrase Cloud” features to make videos more consumable. Experiments were carried out on question-answers datasets (Quora (QQP), TREC QA, and Yahoo Answers) as well as e-books on various subjects and across different grades.The model outperforms previous research by a large margin.},

Although impressive results have been achieved, existing methods pay less attention to the preservation of outline and putting constraint on it when training, which makes generated images suffering from different degrees of distortion. To address this issue, we propose a dual attention mechanism based outline loss to enhance the restriction of outline consistency by incorporating an outline detection module and a dual attention module. Specifically, an outline detection module is used to detect outlines of the source image and the stylized image, which are further compared and enforced to be consistent with each other by a carefully-elaborated outline loss. Additionally, the dual attention module first guides the model to focus on regions of the source image whose style has the biggest difference from the target image during stylization based on the style attention feature map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Then, an outline attention map is predicted to highlight regions where the outlines are prone to distort during stylization, which further facilitates the outline loss to execute stronger constraint on these regions. Experimental results show the superiority of our method compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods},

  abstract     = {Human intelligence is measured using the Intelligent Quotient (IQ) score which is derived from a range of tests. Due to a lack of a large dataset, IQ was estimated utilizing consistent scanning approaches. Multiple datasets scanned from various locations are integrated using different scanning factors and procedures. As a result, there was a lot of diversity among the datasets. To overcome the aforementioned problems, this work presented a novel technique for IQ assessment based on data from Magnetic Resonance Imaging dataset. The pre-processing step focuses on regions like cerebrospinal fluid, white matter (WM), tissue segmentation, cerebellum removal, and skull stripping. Based on Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix features, we have extracted energy, entropy, contrast, homogeneity, correlation, shade, and prominence features. The Principal Component Analysis based Discriminant Analysis with Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA-based DP-LDA) selects the optimal feature selection score values. The Adaboost Support Vector Machine (Adaboost SVM)-based Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) technique is used to estimate IQ values. The HHO algorithm is used to optimize the number of iterations, error threshold, and weighting factors in AdaBoost SVM, resulting in the estimation of optimal IQ values. Because memory and cognitive abilities are commonly tested in IQ testing, changes in Grey Matter/White Matter (GM/WM) tissues in these ROIs may have an influence on measuring human intelligence. Experimental results show a substantial connection between cortical thickness, laminary difference, and hierarchical position estimation for visual and auditory hierarchies and somatosensory hierarchies. The proposed Adaboost-SVM with the HHO method offers the lowest Root Mean square error value of 8.521 when compared with the existing techniques and gives a classification accuracy of 98% when evaluated with tenfold cross-validation.},

To address this problem, this article draws up a new type of convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism, namely, convolutional shrinkage neural networks (CSNNs), using the characteristics of negligible noise to obtain a good optimization parameter model. Moreover, soft thresholding is inserted into the network architectures as nonlinear transformation layers to eliminate nonessential features. In addition, considering that it is difficult to set appropriate values for the thresholds, the developed convolutional shrinkage neural networks integrates some specialized neural networks into trainable modules to automatically set the thresholds. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the model-agnostic meta-learning method is considered for testing. The results show that the improved method can significantly improve the accuracy of few-shot images classification and enhance the generalization performance.},

The network optimized structural design and it establishes the idea of cluster within wireless cellular message. Then, the Fuzzy Clustering Means (FCM) is used to cluster the underwater sensor nodes thereby providing information communication topology amongst underwater sensor nodes thus the whole power utilization method is able to decreased along with trouble of power utilizing stability of underwater sensor nodes be able to resolve wherever the information gathered through every cluster head is broadcast toward the bottom getting terminal equipment, with more over stability as well as consume the energy of the network. The result revealed that our proposed performance execute better results than existing optimization algorithms like GWO with GA intended for energy consumption along within formation delivery ratio, because Cluster-Based CSA is able to provide extensively less empower utilization of network thereby developing better data transmission of nodes.},

Because of the diversity, large-scale, and high real-time characteristics of Internet data, manual feature interaction is almost impossible. Although existing models can learn feature interactions without manual feature engineering, few studies attempt to learn both explicit and implicit high-order feature interactions simultaneously. In order to effectively capture explicit and implicit high-order feature interactions, and automatically identify important feature interactions in a larger feature interaction space, we construct a parallel model that integrates a multi-head self-attention network and a Bilinear-DNN module (HoINT), which can learn high-order feature interactions automatically in both explicit and implicit ways. Sufficient experiments on four real-world datasets indicate that the HoINT model proposed is better than the most typical and advanced models, and the relative contributions of different components of the model are assessed.},

In view of this fact, this paper proposes a single-channel multi-speaker speech separation method based on the similarity between the speaker feature center and the mixture feature in the deep embedding space. In particular, the isolated speech segments extracted from the observed signal are converted to deep embedding vectors, and then a speaker feature center will be created. The similarity between this center and the deep embedding feature of mixture is constructed as a mask of the corresponding speaker, which is used to separate the speaker’s speech. A residual-based deep embedding network with stacked 2-D convolutional blocks instead of bi-directional long short-term memory is proposed for faster speed and better feature extraction. In addition, an isolated speech segment extraction method based on Chimera++ has been proposed, because the previous experiments showed that Chimera++ algorithm owns good separation performance for segments from only one speaker. The evaluation results on the general datasets show that the proposed method substantially outperforms competing algorithms up to 0.94 dB in Signal-to-Distortion Ratio.},

  abstract     = {Deep modal can provide supplementary features for RGB images, which deeply improves the performance of salient object detection (SOD). However, depth images are disturbed by external factors during the acquisition process, resulting in low-quality acquisitions. Moreover, there are differences between the RGB and depth modals, so simply fusing the two modals cannot fully complement the depth information into the RGB modal. To enhance the quality of the depth image and integrate the cross-modal information effectively, we propose a depth enhanced cross-modal cascaded network (DCCNet) for RGB-D SOD. The entire cascaded network includes a depth cascaded branch, a RGB cascaded branch and a cross-modal fusion strategy. In the depth cascaded branch, we design a depth preprocessing algorithm to enhance the quality of the depth image. And in the process of depth feature extraction, we adopt four cascaded cross-modal guided modules to guide the RGB feature extraction process. In the RGB cascaded branch, we design five cascaded residual adaptive selection modules to output the RGB image feature extraction in each stage. In the cross-modal fusion strategy, a cross-modal channel-wise refinement is adopted to fuse the top-level features of the different modal feature branches. Finally, the multiscale loss is adopted to optimize the network training. Experimental results on six common RGB-D SOD datasets show that the performance of the proposed DCCNet is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods.},

However, the existing deep neural networks often generate the predictions with high confidence risks, which are prone to mislead practitioners and limit the deploying of deep neural networks in high-risk decision-making fields. In order to solve this issue, this paper proposes a confidence calibration method for deep neural networks by designing one novel knowledge reverse distillation strategy. Traditional knowledge distillation strategy takes the accuracy as the knowledge, and transfers it from the teacher network (usually one complex deep network) to the student network (usually one simple network). Different from this traditional distillation strategy, the proposed knowledge reverse distillation strategy regards the confidence as the knowledge, and constructs one reverse knowledge transfer pathway by applying the confidence knowledge in the simple network to calibrate the complex deep network. Experimental results on three benchmark image datasets show that the knowledge reverse distillation strategy can effectively improve the calibration capability of complex networks so that the complex deep neural network captures the high confidence along with the high prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The neural mechanisms involved in pain perception consist of a pathway which carry signals from the periphery to the cerebral cortex. First-order pain neurons transduce the potentially damaging stimuli detected by the sensorial extremes into long-ranging electrical signals that are transmitted to higher order neurons where the organisation is more heterarchical, especially in the cerebral cortex. However, the first order neurones, as their name states, have a degree of branching which clearly identifies them as hierarchical elements in the arrangement of pain pathway. This research aims to develop an artificial neural pain pathway that mimics this biological process, in particular the first order neurones. First, the research proposes the periodogram method on the condition monitoring data with a minor malfunction and operational damage. As the pain is associated with actual or potential tissue damage, using such data from a machinery system can provide insights which can be used to improve the computational effectiveness. Then, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network model is introduced to represent the second and third orders of the pain pathway. The research findings found clear support for studying the similarities between the major components of biological information processing of tissue damage and statistical signal processing for damage estimation.},

A physiotherapist uses many techniques to restore movements needs in daily life including nerve re-education, task training, muscle strengthening and uses various assistive techniques. But, a physiotherapist guiding the physiotherapy exercises to a patient is a time-consuming, tedious and costly affair. In the paper, a novel automated system is designed for detecting and recognizing upper limb exercises using an RGB-Depth camera that could guide the patients to perform real-time physiotherapy exercises without human intervention. Hybrid deep learning (HDL) approaches are exploited for the highly accurate and robust system for recognizing physiotherapy exercises of the upper limb for PSR. As a baseline, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed that automatically extracts features from the pre-processed data and classifies the performed physiotherapy exercise. As the exercise is being performed, to extract and utilize temporal dependencies, architectures of recurrent neural network (RNN) are used. In the CNN-LSTM model, CNN derives useful features that are provided to LSTM thus increasing the accuracy of recognized exercises. To train faster, another hybrid deep learning model, CNN-GRU is implemented where a novel focal loss criterion is used to overcome the drawbacks of standard cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation is done using RGB-D data obtained from Microsoft Kinect v2 sensors. Dataset comprising of 10 different physiotherapy exercises were created. Experimental results have shown significant activity recognition accuracy with 98% and 99% for CNN and CNN-LSTM model respectively. CNN-GRU model is the best suitable architecture with 100% accuracy.},

In this regard, the use of machine learning methods to diagnose the causes of hypertension diseases has increased in recent years. In this article, we have improved the prediction of hypertension detection using Mahalanobis distance-based multivariate outlier removing of Korean national health data named by the KNHANES database. The study identified a variety of risk factors associated with chronic hypertension. Chronic disease is often caused by many factors, not just one. Therefore, it is necessary to study the detection of the disease taking into account complex factors. The paper is divided into two modules. Initially, the data preprocessing step that uses a tree classifier-based feature selection, and to remove multivariate outlier using Mahalanobis distance from KNHANES data. The next module applies the predictive analysis step to detect and prediction of hypertension. In this study, we compare the accuracy, mean standard error (MSE), F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for each classification model. The test results show that the proposed RF-MAH algorithm has an accuracy, F1-score, MSE and AUC outcomes of 99.48%, 99.62%, 0.0025 and 99.61%, respectively. Following these, the second-best outcomes of an accuracy rate of 99.51%, MSE of 0.0028, F1-score of 99.58%, and AUC of 99.65% were achieved by XGBoost with the MAH model. The proposed method can be used not only for hypertension but also for the detection of various diseases, such as stroke and cardiovascular disease.

The industrial structural health and control system based on discrete sensors possesses insufficient spatial coverage of sensing information, while the distributed condition monitoring has been mainly studied at the sensor level, relatively few studies have been conducted at the artificial intelligence level. This paper presents an innovative method for distributed structural health and control systems based on artificial intelligence. The structural condition was divided into regional and local features, the feature extraction and characterization are performed separately. Structural abnormality recognition and risk factor calculation method were proposed by considering the response values and the distribution patterns of both the regional and the local structural behaviours. The test results show that the method can effectively identify the full-scale and local damage of the structure, respectively. Subsequently, structural safety assessment method for long-span structures at kilometres level in view of fully length strain distributions measured by distributed fiber optic sensors were developed. A series of load tests on the long-span structure were carried out. Finite element (FE) model was developed using finite element code, ABAQUS, and an extensive parametric study was conduct to explore the effect of load cases on the structural responses. The differences in the structural response results among load test, structural safety assessment and FE simulation were investigated. It is shown that AI-based self-learning system could offer suitable speed in deployment, reliability in solution and flexibility to adjust in distributed structural health monitoring and control.},

  abstract     = {The unavailability of appropriate mechanisms for timely detection of diseases and successive treatment causes the death of a large number of people around the globe. The timely diagnosis of grave diseases like different forms of cancer and other life-threatening diseases can save a valuable life or at least extend the life span of an afflicted individual. The advancement of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled healthcare technologies can provide effective medical facilities to the population and contribute greatly towards the recuperation of patients. The usage of IoMT in the diagnosis and study of histopathological images can enable real-time identification of diseases and corresponding remedial actions can be taken to save an affected individual. This can be achieved by the use of imaging apparatus with the capacity of auto-analysis of captured images. However, most deep learning-based image classifying models are bulk in size and are inappropriate for use in IoT based imaging devices. The objective of this research work is to design a deep learning-based lightweight model suitable for histopathological image analysis with appreciable accuracy. This paper presents a novel lightweight deep learning-based model &quot;ReducedFireNet&quot;, for auto-classification of histopathological images. The proposed method attained a mean accuracy of 96.88% and an F1 score of 0.968 on evaluating an actual histopathological image data set. The results are encouraging, considering the complexity of histopathological images. In addition to the high accuracy the lightweight design (size in few KBs) of the ReducedFireNet model, makes it suitable for IoMT imaging equipment. The simulation results show the proposed model has computational requirement of 0.201 GFLOPS and has a mere size of only 0.391 MB.},

  abstract     = {Estrogen is primarily an endocrine hormone produced by the ovaries and, to a lesser degree, glands of the adrenal cortex&#39;s zona reticularis layer. However, it can be synthesized from other tissues and can possess both autocrine and paracrine activities of the target tissue or organ. Its activities, only possible through ligand(estrogen)-receptor interaction, range from reproduction health to skeletal development. These activities can, however, be modulated by using an antagonist. An antagonist is anything that binds to the receptors to prevent the action of a particular hormone, neurotransmitter, or enzyme.The antagonist can specifically bind to the pituitary GnRH receptor, thus blocking the effect of GnRH on the pituitary and reducing the secretion of pituitary GN.Notwithstanding its numerous physiological activities, estrogen is also implicated in some cancers&#39; pathophysiology, specifically estrogen (E2)-induced growth factor-related breast cancers. Androgen receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is encoded by a full-length 90 kb gene from the long arm of X chromosome 11.2–12, which contains 7 introns and 7 exons. There are two isomers of messenger RNA encoding 920 and 388 amino acid residues, respectively.This is because estrogen acts as a mediator for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERk) activation, facilitating cell proliferation, which can progress autonomously. This research investigates the effects of boletus poisoning on estrogen receptors and neurotransmitters in rats based on the ERk 1/2 pathway. A prospective study was conducted for which two sets of experimental studies were performed using albino rats. The first experiment was to determine the toxic dose. This is the dosage for which the saturation point will be reached and the existing estrogen on the receptors displaced. The second set of the experiment was to determine the pathophysiology of this poisoning on the albino rats. A 200 mg/100 kg b.wt oral administration of boletus spp juice and 250 mg/100 kg b.wt of alcohol extracts were administered using an oral gavage to the test specimens. The toxic effects were then recorded for the next 24 h of administration. The results indicated low levels of breast cancer markers in test specimens than those of control specimens. This is because the BoletusBoletus acted as an antagonist blocking the action of E2 on estrogen receptors (ERs).},

There is a need of an efficient decision making tool to improve awareness about the spread of COVID-19 infections among the common public. An accurate and reliable neural network based tool for predicting confirmed, recovered and death cases of COVID-19 can be very helpful to the health consultants for taking appropriate actions to control the outbreak. This paper proposes a novel Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) Neural Network Time Series (NAR-NNTS) model for forecasting COVID-19 cases. This NAR-NNTS model is trained with Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), Levenberg Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian Regularization (BR) training algorithms. The performance of the proposed model has been compared by using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and correlation co-efficient i.e. R-value. The results show that NAR-NNTS model trained with LM training algorithm performs better than other models for COVID-19 epidemiological data prediction.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence is a future and valuable tool for early disease recognition and support in patient condition monitoring. It can increase the reliability of the cure and decision making by developing useful systems and algorithms. Healthcare workers, especially nurses and physicians, are overworked due to a massive and unexpected increase in the number of patients during the coronavirus pandemic. In such situations, artificial intelligence techniques could be used to diagnose a patient with life-threatening illnesses. In particular, diseases that increase the risk of hospitalization and death in coronavirus patients, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes, should be diagnosed at an early stage. This article focuses on diagnosing a diabetic patient through data mining techniques. If we are able to diagnose diabetes in the early stages of the disease, we can force patients to stay home and care for their health, so the risk of being infected with the coronavirus would be reduced. The proposed method has three steps: preprocessing, feature selection and classification. Several combinations of Harmony search algorithm, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm are examined with K-means for feature selection. The combinations have not examined before for diabetes diagnosis applications. K-nearest neighbor is used for classification of the diabetes dataset. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy have been measured to evaluate the results. The results achieved indicate that the proposed method with an accuracy of 91.65% outperformed the results of the earlier methods examined in this article.},

It includes numerous limitations and challenges such as variation in the contrast, texture variation, color and complexity in the background etc. To overcome these challenges, several computer-aided methods are proposed by the researchers. But there exist different limitations in these methods. In this work, a new method is proposed for computer-aided diagnosis of stomach disease classification. This hybrid approach is based on the amassed texture and deep CNN features. Initially, the contrast of image is improved by using power-law transformation. Texture features are extracted from the enhanced dataset by using LBP and SFTA features. Extracted texture features are then fused to obtain strong feature vectors. At the same time, two pre-trained deep learning models are utilized for CNN feature extraction namely VGG16 and InceptionV3. Extracted deep features are fused serially along with the obtained handcrafted feature vector to obtain an ensemble deep feature vector. A unique feature vector is obtained by serial fusion of both fused vectors to get an advantage of accumulated texture and CNN features. This feature vector is supplied to various classifiers and evaluated with existing methods. The promising recognition proficiency portrays the strength of proposed approach.},

With the advancement in machine learning approaches, identification of insulin resistance can be carried out without clinical processes. In this work, insulin resistance is identified for individuals with triglycerides and HDL-c ratio using non-invasive techniques employing machine learning approaches. Eighteen parameters are used for identification purposes like age, sex, waist size, height, etc., and combinations of these parameters. Experiments are conducted over the CALERIE dataset. Each output of the attribute selection system is modeled over distinct calculations like logistic regression, CARTs, SVM, LDA, KNN, extra trees classifier. The proposed work is validated with a stratified cross-validation test. Results show that KNN and CatBoost show the best results with an accuracy of 74% and 73% respectively and 1% variance compared to 66% with Bernardini et al. and Stawiski et al. and 83% with Farran et al.

Managing the massiveness of this data is required while extracting knowledge for decision making is the main concern of today. For this task researchers are doing explorations in big data analytics, deep learning (advanced form of machine learning known as deep neural nets), predictive analytics and various other algorithms to bring innovation in healthcare. Through all these innovations happening it is not wrong to establish that disease prediction with anticipation of its cure is no longer unrealistic. First, Dengue Fever (DF) and then Covid-19 likewise are new outbreak in infectious lethal diseases and diagnosing at all stages is crucial to decrease mortality rate. In case of Diabetes, clinicians and experts are finding challenging the timely diagnosis and analyzing the chances of developing underlying diseases. In this paper, Louvain Mani-Hierarchical Fold Learning healthcare analytics, a hybrid deep learning technique is proposed for medical diagnostics and is tested and validated using real-time dataset of 104 instances of patients with dengue fever made available by Holy Family Hospital, Pakistan and 810 instances found for infectious diseases including prognosis of; Covid-19, SARS, ARDS, Pneumocystis, Streptococcus, Chlamydophila, Klebsiella, Legionella, Lipoid, etc. on GitHub. Louvain Mani-Hierarchical Fold Learning healthcare analytics showed maximum 0.952 correlations between two clusters with Spearman when applied on 240 instances extracted from comorbidities diagnostic data model derived from 15696 endocrine records of multiple visits of 100 patients identified by a unique ID. Accuracy for induced rules is evaluated by Laplace (Fig. 8) as 0.727, 0.701 and 0.203 for 41, 18 and 24 rules, respectively.

  abstract     = {Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is a trendy for a clinical picture area. The modem tools for the acquisition of pixel has a DICOM interface, which lets in interoperability between gear and the storage in documents of the equal format. However, it is applicable that the pictures and its associated statistics be built-in to the Hospital Information System. The image captured through the capturing devices contains features with higher dimension which increases the time complexity in classification. As the classification performance greatly impacts on the diagnosis of different diseases and supporting the medical practitioner, it is necessary to reduce the features size or dimensionality. Also, by reducing the dimensionality of features, the decisive support system would provide more accurate result to the medical practitioner in making different decisions. The existing techniques suffer to identify the exact features by segmenting the features according to different features. The computerization of a hospital, in a built-in manner, is now not a convenient task. Developing statistics structures that can combine scientific photo records in to the different hospital’s information, except growing interfaces, which can compromise the system’s performance, is critical to add such traits in the facts device itself. Rand index of the image, Global Consistency Error, Variation of Information and PSNR are major scalable parameters in the various segmentation methods. The mentioned parameters are needed to enhance significantly for the better detection of an image through segmentation process. Hence, principle component analysis method and expectancy maximisation based segmentation methods are proposed in this effort.},
