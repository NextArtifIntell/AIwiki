We investigate the Lipschitz-like property of such systems with an explicit set constraint under full perturbations (including the matrix perturbation) and derive some sufficient and necessary conditions for this property. We also make use of some other approaches like outer-subdifferentials and error bounds to characterize such a property. We later apply the obtained results to linear portfolio selection problems with different settings and obtain some sufficient conditions for the parametric feasible set mapping to enjoy the Lipschitz-like property with various stock selection constraints.},

The fracture irreversibility constraint is formulated on the time-continuous level and is regularized by means of penalization. The optimization scheme is formulated in terms of the reduced approach and then solved with a Newton method. To this end, the state, adjoint, tangent, and adjoint Hessian equations are derived. The key focus is on the design of appropriate function spaces and the rigorous justification of all Fréchet derivatives that require fourth-order regularizations. Therein, a second-order time derivative on the phase-field variable appears, which is reformulated as a mixed first-order-in-time system. These derivations are carefully established for all four equations. Finally, the corresponding time-stepping schemes are derived by employing a dG( $$r$$ ) discretization in time.},

First, we show that the model has a unique non-negative solution, which has a separable form. Then, some continuity results are established, which are important for the purpose of optimal control. In order to make the final size of vermin as small as possible or as close as possible to the ideal distribution under the condition of the lowest control cost, we consider the least cost-size problem and the least cost-deviation problem. For each of the control problems, the optimality conditions are obtained via the adjoint system and tangent-normal cones. For the first problem, we show the existence of the optimal strategy by compactness and extremal sequence. However, for the second problem, we derive the existence of an optimal control via Ekeland’s variational principle. Some numerical simulations have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the obtained theoretical results. Numerical results also suggest that decreasing the reproductive rate instead of increasing the mortality is an effective way of managing the impact of vermin.},

Particularly, the information structure is asymmetric where the leader can obtain the follower’s measurement information and its historical control inputs, while the follower can only obtain its own measurement information and historical inputs, which have led to major challenge since the 1970s. It is well known that the closed-loop Stackelberg optimal control in general is a hard problem and no explicit solution can be derived. Instead, this paper aims to present a linear closed-loop solution to the problem. However, how to give a rational definition for the linear closed-loop Stackelberg controller is a difficulty. By using innovation, this paper defines the linear closed-loop Stackelberg controller with specified given gain matrices. Then the analytical solutions for the leader and the follower are given, respectively, which are the feedback form of the Kalman filtering and the optimal gain matrices for the leader and follower are obtained by decoupled solving two Riccati equations. Finally, by using the forward iteration algorithm, the coupled forward and backward Riccati equations are solved in infinite horizon, which overcomes the obstacles that the separation principle becomes invalid.},

We establish the global convergence of this nested scheme to critical points of non-convex and non-smooth optimization problems. In addition, we propose a hybrid framework that allows to implement FISTA when applicable, while still maintaining the global convergence result.

Different from the classical control problems, both dynamic process control and static initial-terminal perturbations are considered. Moreover, all control/perturbation components are subject to input constraint in terms of closed convex sets and partial information in terms of some sub-filtration for randomness evolution. We first study the nonlinear case of aforementioned FBSDE optimal control by deriving stochastic maximum principle. Next, we consider the linear quadratic case with explicit representation of the optimal admissible controls. More specifically, a new Hamiltonian system involving three projection operators and conditional expectation is derived. Finally, we apply obtained maximum principle to study a general class of large-population system and provide a unified framework to analyze related mean-field game (MFG).

In recent literature, by approximating the max operator in the Bellman equation by a smooth function, an interesting second-order iterative method was discussed to solve the new Bellman equation. During the numerical simulation, it was observed that this second-order method is computationally expensive for a reasonable size of state and action. This second-order iterative method also faces difficulty in numerical implementation due to the calculation of an exponential function for larger values. In this manuscript, a few first-order iterative schemes have been derived from the second-order method to overcome the above practical problems. All the proposed iterative schemes possess the global convergence property. The proposed iterative schemes take less time to converge to the solution of the Bellman equation than the second-order method in many cases. These algorithms are efficient and easy to implement. An interesting theoretical comparison is provided between the algorithms. Numerical simulation supports our theoretical results.},

We present and analyse two Bregman modifications to GRAAL: the first uses a fixed step size and converges under global Lipschitz assumptions, and the second uses an adaptive step-size rule. Numerical performance of the former method is demonstrated on a bimatrix game arising in network communication, and of the latter on two problems, namely, power allocation in Gaussian communication channels and N-person Cournot completion games. In all of these applications, an appropriately chosen Bregman distance simplifies the projection steps computed as part of the algorithm.},

We explore the problem’s applicability in diverse contexts, discuss its connections to certain existing problems, and analyze its computational complexity and theoretical foundations. Given the inherent computational challenges, we propose three heuristics to solve the problem. The first heuristic employs a reformulation–linearization technique (RLT) to obtain an outer approximation of the range of the outcome function. We also present two algorithms—a gradient-restoration-based approach (GI) and a bases inspection method (BI)—for computing an inner approximation of the range. Computational experiments illustrate the competitive advantage of our proposed approaches versus off-the-shelf solvers. The GI and BI methods present promising results in finding a cheap but tight inner approximation, while the performance of the RLT technique decreases as problem size and uncertainty increase.},

Moreover, we obtain the semicontinuity of E-optimal point mapping, weak E-optimal point mapping, E-quasi-optimal point mapping, E-Benson proper optimal point mapping, E-super optimal point mapping and E-strictly optimal point mapping. Finally, we make a new attempt to establish Lipschitz continuity of these E-optimal point mappings under some suitable conditions.},

The main result of this paper roughly says that if a sequence $$\{x_n\}$$ constructed by the method from a random initial point $$x_0$$ converges, then the limit point is a critical point and not a saddle point, and the convergence rate is the same as that of Newton’s method. A subsequent work has recently been successful incorporating Backtracking line search to New Q-Newton’s method, thus resolving the global convergence issue observed for some (non-smooth) functions. An application to quickly find zeros of a univariate meromorphic function is discussed, accompanied with an illustration on basins of attraction.},

In a two-stage low-carbon product supply chain consisting of a single supplier and a single manufacturer, we construct an uncertain differential equation by taking the emission reduction efforts of the supplier and manufacturer as decision variables and product emission reduction as a state variable. Based on the uncertain differential game, we obtain the supply chain’s dynamic equilibrium strategy, emission reduction, and revenue trajectory under non-cooperative and cooperative situations. By comparison, cooperation leads to more effort on both sides of the supply chain, more carbon emission reduction, and higher profits than non-cooperative ones. To further illustrate the supply chain game in the cooperative situation, we give different income situations under the two distribution methods of Nash bargaining solution and Shapley value, respectively.},

More precisely, our aim is to minimize the number of simplices in the triangulation underlying the interpolation, while respecting a prescribed approximation error. First, we show how to construct optimal triangulations consisting of up to five simplices. Using these as building blocks, we construct a triangulation scheme called crossing swords that requires at most - times the number of simplices in any optimal triangulation. In other words, we derive an approximation algorithm for the optimal triangulation problem. We also show that crossing swords yields optimal triangulations in the case that each simplex has at least one axis-parallel edge. Furthermore, we present approximation guarantees for other well-known triangulation schemes, namely for the red refinement and longest-edge bisection strategies as well as for a generalized version of K1-triangulations. Thereby, we are able to show that our novel approach dominates previous triangulation schemes from the literature, which is underlined by illustrative numerical examples.},

Instead, we rely only on convexity of the loss function. Our unified analysis applies to a host of existing algorithms such as proximal SGD, variance reduced methods, quantization and some coordinate descent-type methods. For the variance reduced methods, we recover the best known convergence rates as special cases. For proximal SGD, the quantization and coordinate-type methods, we uncover new state-of-the-art convergence rates. Our analysis also includes any form of sampling or minibatching. As such, we are able to determine the minibatch size that optimizes the total complexity of variance reduced methods. We showcase this by obtaining a simple formula for the optimal minibatch size of two variance reduced methods (L-SVRG and SAGA). This optimal minibatch size not only improves the theoretical total complexity of the methods but also improves their convergence in practice, as we show in several experiments.},

  abstract     = {Two approaches are applied to the set-valued optimization problem. The following problems have been examined by Corley, Luc and their colleagues: Take the union of all objective values and then search for (weakly, properly, etc.) minimal points in this union with respect to the vector ordering. This approach is called the vector approach to set optimization. The concept shifted when the set relations were popularized by Kuroiwa–Tanaka–Ha at the end of the twentieth century. They introduced six types of set relations on the power set of topological vector space using a convex ordering cone C with nonempty interior. Therefore, this approach is called the set relation approach to set optimization. For a given vector optimization problem, several approaches are applied to construct a dual problem. A difficulty lies in the fact that the minimal point in vector optimization problem is not necessarily a singleton, though it becomes a subset of the image space in general. In this paper, we first present new definitions of set-valued conjugate map based on comparison of sets (the set relation approach) followed by introducing some types of weak duality theorems. We also show convexity and continuity properties of conjugate relations. Lastly, we present some types of strong duality theorems using nonlinear scalarizing technique for set that is generalizations of Gerstewitz’s scalarizing function for the vector-valued case.},

On the other hand, there does not exist a special algorithm for solving the multistage pseudomonotone SVIs so far, so we propose some sufficient conditions on the elicitability of multistage pseudomonotone SVIs, which opens the door for applying Rockafellar’s elicited progressive hedging algorithm to solve such SVIs.

The model not only makes good use of the low-rank structure of tensors, but also takes into account the spatio-temporal characteristics of the data.

It is worth highlighting that this approximate solution can be highly close to the exact solution by adjusting weighted matrices in the cost function of the LQOC problem. Since the conditional expectation of the state is involved in the cost function, the LQOC problem is an optimization control with an additional measurability restriction, which is very involved. The orthogonal decomposition technique is used to deal with this measurability restriction. The solvability condition and the optimal decision are given by developing generalized Riccati-type equations.

It is also shown that there are a borrowing boundary and a saving boundary which divide the entire trading area into a borrowing-money region, an all-in-stock region, and a saving-money region in ascending order. The optimal trading strategy turns out to be a mixture of continuous-time strategy (as suggested by most continuous-time models) and discontinuous-time strategy (as suggested by models with transaction costs): one should put all the wealth in the stock in the middle all-in-stock region and continuously trade it in the other two regions in a feedback form of wealth and time. It is never optimal to short sale the stock. Numerical examples are also presented to verify the theoretical results and to give more financial insights beyond them.},

  abstract     = {The paper is devoted to the question of existence of continuous implicit functions for non-smooth equations. The equation $$f(x,\sigma )=0$$ is studied with the unknown x and the parameter $$\sigma $$ . We assume that the mapping which defines the equation is locally Lipschitzian in the unknown variable, the parameter belongs to a topological space, and both the unknown variable and the value of the mapping belong to finite-dimensional spaces. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a continuous implicit function in a neighbourhood of a given value of the parameter and conditions for the existence of a continuous implicit function on a given subset of the parameter space are obtained in terms of the Clarke generalized Jacobian. The key tool of this development is the smoothing of the initial equation and application of recent results on solvability of smooth nonlinear equations and a priori solution estimates. Applications to control and optimization are discussed.},

Moreover, we demonstrate that the Guignard constraint qualification (in short, GCQ) is satisfied for MPVC-HM under certain mild restrictions. We introduce several (MPVC-HM)-tailored constraint qualifications in the framework of Hadamard manifolds that ensure satisfaction of GCQ. Moreover, we refine our analysis and present some modified sufficient conditions which guarantee that GCQ is satisfied.

The search direction with a restart procedure satisfies sufficient descent condition and the trust region property at each iteration, independent of the choice of line search. We also investigate the theoretical properties, such as the global convergence and linear convergence rate, of the inertial projection method under normal assumptions.

In particular, we do not assume that the nonlinear constraints are explicitly given but that we can only evaluate them and that we know their global Lipschitz constants. The algorithm is a successive linear relaxation method in which we alternate between solving a master problem, which is a mixed-integer linear relaxation of the original problem, and a subproblem, which is designed to tighten the linear relaxation of the next master problem by using the Lipschitz information about the respective functions. By doing so, we follow the ideas of Schmidt, Sirvent, and Wollner (Math Program 178(1):449–483 (2019) and Optim Lett 16(5):1355-1372 (2022)) and improve the tackling of multivariate constraints. Although multivariate nonlinearities obviously increase modeling capabilities, their incorporation also significantly increases the computational burden of the proposed algorithm. We prove the correctness of our method and also derive a worst-case iteration bound. Finally, we show the generality of the addressed problem class and the proposed method by illustrating that both bilevel optimization problems with nonconvex and quadratic lower levels as well as nonlinear and mixed-integer models of gas transport can be tackled by our method. We provide the necessary theory for both applications and briefly illustrate the outcomes of the new method when applied to these two problems.},

Both players have a constant speed and a limited turn radius. The goal of the first player (pursuer) is to ensure that the second player (evader) enters the capture circle as quickly as possible. The goal of the evader is to avoid or delay capturing for as long as possible. The kinematics of both players are described using the same equations. Thus, the game has only one free parameter: capture radius. This study aims to provide an exhaustive analytical description of the barrier surface for all values of capture radius. Previously, Merz analytically investigated the barrier in a game of two identical cars. In this work, it was found that there is a certain critical value of the capture radius, above which the barrier is qualitatively different from Merz’s example. In addition, we obtained an explicit analytical description of the optimal feedback controls for the barrier.},

  abstract     = {Tokamaks are the most promising devices to prove the feasibility of energy production using nuclear fusion on Earth which is foreseen as a possible source of energy for the next centuries. In large tokamaks with superconducting poloidal field (PF) coils, the problem of avoiding saturation of the currents is of paramount importance, especially for a reactor such as the European demonstration fusion power plant DEMO. Indeed, reaching the current limits during plasma operation may cause a loss of control of the plasma shape and/or current, leading to a major disruption. Therefore, a current limit avoidance (CLA) system is essential to assure safe operation. Three different algorithms to be implemented within a CLA system are proposed in this paper: two are based on online solutions of constrained optimization problems, while the third one relies on dynamic allocation. The performance assessment for all the proposed solutions is carried out by considering challenging operation scenarios for the DEMO reactor, such as the case where more than one PF current simultaneously saturates during the discharge. An evaluation of the computational burden needed to solve the allocation problem for the various proposed alternatives is also presented, which shows the compliance of the optimization-based approaches with the envisaged deadlines for real-time implementation of the DEMO plasma magnetic control system.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be powerful tools for processing unstructured data. However, for high-dimensional data, like images, they are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Small almost invisible perturbations added to the input can be used to fool DNNs. Various attacks, hardening methods and detection methods have been introduced in recent years. Notoriously, Carlini–Wagner (CW)-type attacks computed by iterative minimization belong to those that are most difficult to detect. In this work we outline a mathematical proof that the CW attack can be used as a detector itself. That is, under certain assumptions and in the limit of attack iterations this detector provides asymptotically optimal separation of original and attacked images. In numerical experiments, we experimentally validate this statement and furthermore obtain AUROC values up to $$99.73\%$$ on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. This is in the upper part of the spectrum of current state-of-the-art detection rates for CW attacks.},

The convergence of such hybrid methods to global minimizers hinges on the discretization error induced by restricting the discrete global optimization to the graph, with corresponding implications on choosing an appropriate graph density. A prime example is flight planning, i.e., the computation of optimal routes in view of flight time and fuel consumption under given weather conditions. Highly efficient discrete shortest path algorithms exist and can be used directly for computing starting points for locally convergent optimal control methods. We derive a priori and localized error bounds for the flight time of discrete paths relative to the optimal continuous trajectory, in terms of the graph density and the given wind field. These bounds allow designing graphs with an optimal local connectivity structure. The properties of the bounds are illustrated on a set of benchmark problems. It turns out that localization improves the error bound by four orders of magnitude, but still leaves ample opportunities for tighter error bounds by a posteriori estimators.},

Appropriate dynamic modeling of each of these components can have far-reaching implications for the whole system&#39;s performance improvement in terms of transparency, the analogy to the real environment, and stability. In this paper, we developed a virtual-based haptic training simulator for Endoscopic Sinus Surgery by doing a dynamic characterization of the phenomenological sinus tissue fracture in the virtual environment, using an input-constrained linear parametric variable model. A parallel robot manipulator equipped with a calibrated force sensor is employed as a haptic interface. A lumped five-parameter single-degree-of-freedom mass-stiffness-damping impedance model is assigned to the operator’s arm dynamic. A robust online output feedback quasi-min–max model predictive control framework is proposed to stabilize the system during the switching between the piecewise linear dynamics of the virtual environment. The simulations and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm in terms of robustness and convergence to the desired impedance quantities.},

In the proposed non-penalized SEMDOT algorithm, the material penalization scheme is eliminated. The efficiency, effectiveness, and general applicability of the proposed non-penalized algorithm are demonstrated in three case studies containing compliance minimization, compliant mechanism design, and heat conduction problems, as well as thorough comparisons with the penalized algorithm. In addition, the length scale control approach is used to solve the discontinuous boundary issue observed in thin and long structural features. The numerical results show that the convergency of the newly proposed non-penalization algorithm is stronger than the penalization algorithm, and improved results can be obtained by the non-penalized algorithm.},

Though Lagrangians of some special structure hypergraphs, such as complete uniform hypergraphs or three order uniform hypergraphs, have closed-form solutions, it is a challenging problem to compute the Lagrangian of a general large scale hypergraph. In this paper, we exploit a fast computational scheme involving the adjacency tensor of a hypergraph. Furthermore, we propose to utilize the gradient projection method on a simplex from nonlinear optimization for solving the Lagrangian of a large-scale hypergraph iteratively. Using the Łojasiewicz gradient inequality, we analyze the global and local convergence of the gradient projection method. Numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed numerical method could compute Lagrangians of large-scale hypergraphs efficiently.},

We perform convergence and complexity analyses of the method by viewing it as a special instance of an inexact proximal point method proposed by Solodov and Svaiter in 2001, for which pointwise and ergodic complexity results have been studied recently by Sicre. Also, for this latter method, we establish convergence rates and complexity bounds for strongly monotone inclusions, from where we obtain linear convergence for our projective splitting method under strong monotonicity and cocoercivity assumptions. We apply the proposed projective splitting scheme to composite convex optimization problems and establish pointwise and ergodic function value convergence rates, extending a recent work of Johnstone and Eckstein.},

  abstract     = {We study the gradient method under the assumption that an additively inexact gradient is available for, generally speaking, non-convex problems. The non-convexity of the objective function, as well as the use of an inexactness specified gradient at iterations, can lead to various problems. For example, the trajectory of the gradient method may be far enough away from the starting point. On the other hand, the unbounded removal of the trajectory of the gradient method in the presence of noise can lead to the removal of the trajectory of the method from the desired global solution. The results of investigating the behavior of the trajectory of the gradient method are obtained under the assumption of the inexactness of the gradient and the condition of gradient dominance. It is well known that such a condition is valid for many important non-convex problems. Moreover, it leads to good complexity guarantees for the gradient method. A rule of early stopping of the gradient method is proposed. Firstly, it guarantees achieving an acceptable quality of the exit point of the method in terms of the function. Secondly, the stopping rule ensures a fairly moderate distance of this point from the chosen initial position. In addition to the gradient method with a constant step, its variant with adaptive step size is also investigated in detail, which makes it possible to apply the developed technique in the case of an unknown Lipschitz constant for the gradient. Some computational experiments have been carried out which demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed stopping rule for the investigated gradient methods.},

Then, and more importantly, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability under positivity constraints on the control and the state. The obtained results are applied to the controllability of transportation and heat conduction networks. In particular, provided that the underlying graph is strongly connected, the controllability under positivity constraints on the control/state of transport network systems is fully characterized by a Kalman-type rank condition. For a system of heat equations with Robin boundary conditions on a path-like network, we establish approximate controllability under positivity state constraint with a single positive input through the starting node. However, we prove the lack of controllability under unilateral control constraint.},

In this paper, we highlight a further computational difficulty when it comes to solving bilevel problems with continuous but nonconvex lower levels. Even if the lower-level problem is solved to $$\varepsilon $$ -feasibility regarding its nonlinear constraints for an arbitrarily small but positive $$\varepsilon $$ , the obtained bilevel solution as well as its objective value may be arbitrarily far away from the actual bilevel solution and its actual objective value. This result even holds for bilevel problems for which the nonconvex lower level is uniquely solvable, for which the strict complementarity condition holds, for which the feasible set is convex, and for which Slater’s constraint qualification is satisfied for all feasible upper-level decisions. Since the consideration of $$\varepsilon $$ -feasibility cannot be avoided when solving nonconvex problems to global optimality, our result shows that computational bilevel optimization with continuous and nonconvex lower levels needs to be done with great care. Finally, we illustrate that the nonlinearities in the lower level are the key reason for the observed bad behavior by showing that linear bilevel problems behave much better at least on the level of feasible solutions.},

Moreover, the inertial parameters in our algorithm can take negative values too. We also treat the case when the non-smooth function is convex, and we show that in this case a better step size can be allowed. Further, we show that our numerical schemes can successfully be used in DC-programming. We prove some abstract convergence results which applied to our numerical schemes allow us to show that the generated sequences converge to a critical point of the objective function, provided a regularization of the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property. Further, we obtain a general result that applied to our numerical schemes ensures convergence rates for the generated sequences and for the objective function values formulated in terms of the KL exponent of a regularization of the objective function.

Precisely, we seek to reach asymptotically the zeros of a maximally monotone operator which is the sum of a potential operator (the gradient of a continuously differentiable convex function) and of a monotone and cocoercive nonpotential operator. As an original feature, in addition to the viscous friction, the dynamic involves implicit Newton-type damping. This contrasts with the authors’ previous study where explicit Newton-type damping was considered, which, for the potential term corresponds to Hessian-driven damping. We show the weak convergence, as time tends to infinity, of the generated trajectories toward the zeros of the sum of the potential and nonpotential operators. Our results are based on Lyapunov analysis and appropriate setting of the damping parameters. The introduction of geometric dampings allows to control and attenuate the oscillations known for the viscous damping of inertial methods. Rewriting the second-order evolution equation as a system involving only first-order derivative in time and space allows us to extend the convergence analysis to nonsmooth convex potentials. The main part of our study concerns the autonomous case with positive fixed parameters. We complete it with some first results concerning the nonautonomous case, and which are based on a recent acceleration method using time scaling and averaging. These results open the door to the design of new first-order accelerated algorithms in optimization taking into account the specific properties of potential and nonpotential terms. The proofs and techniques are original due to the presence of the nonpotential term.},

As a direct implication of this result, it is also shown that f is harmonically concave if $$\gamma \le -1$$ or $$\gamma \ge 0$$ , concave if $$0\le \gamma \le 1$$ and logconcave if $$\gamma \ge 0$$ . Some relevant applications to economic theory are given. For example, it is shown that a quasiconcave and homogeneous production function is concave if it displays nonincreasing returns to scale and logconcave if it displays increasing returns to scale.},

Such algorithms consist of applying a certain number of steps of gradient or subgradient descent on each single objective at each iteration. In this paper, we show that stochastic alternating algorithms achieve a sublinear convergence rate of $${\mathcal {O}}(1/T)$$ , under strong convexity, for the determination of a minimizer of a weighted-sum of the two functions, parameterized by the number of steps applied on each of them. An extension to the convex case is presented for which the rate weakens to $${\mathcal {O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$$ . These rates are valid also in the non-smooth case. Importantly, by varying the proportion of steps applied to each function, one can determine an approximation to the Pareto front.},

Using these formulas, we derive Riemannian optimization frameworks on quotients of Stiefel manifolds, including flag manifolds, and a new family of complete quotient metrics on the manifold of positive-semidefinite matrices of fixed rank, considered as a quotient of a product of Stiefel and positive-definite matrix manifold with affine-invariant metrics. The method is procedural, and in many instances, the Riemannian gradient and Hessian formulas could be derived by symbolic calculus.

We also consider a quadratic cost related to the rate at which a change in the state happens: changing opinion may be a costly operation. Depending on the parameters of the model, the game may have more than one Nash equilibrium, even though the corresponding N-player game does not. Moreover, it exhibits a very rich phase diagram, where polarized/unpolarized, coherent/incoherent equilibria may coexist, except for T small, where the equilibrium is always unique. We fully describe such phase diagram in closed form and provide a detailed numerical analysis of the N-player counterpart of the mean field game. In this finite dimensional setting, the equilibrium selected by the population of players is always coherent (favoring the subpopulation whose type is aligned with the initial condition), but it does not necessarily minimize the cost functional. Rather, it seems that, among the coherent ones, the equilibrium prevailing is the one that most benefits the underdog subpopulation forced to change opinion.},

The novelty in this work is the appearance of the spatial derivative of the solution instead of considering only the solution in the quasilinear term (nonlinearity), here lies the difficulty of approaching said equation. We use Stackelberg–Nash strategies. As usual, we consider one control called leader and two controls called followers. To each leader, we associate a Nash equilibrium corresponding to a bi-objective optimal control problem; then, we look for a leader that solves null and trajectory controllability problems. First, we study the linear problem and then, we use the results obtained in the linear case to conclude the nonlinear problem by applying the Right Inverse Function Theorem.

Since the drift coefficient is not smooth, the representation is given in terms of the local time of the state process. Then we construct a sequence of optimal control problems with smooth coefficients by an approximation argument.

  abstract     = {In this work we propose a high-quality decomposition approach for qubit routing by swap insertion. This optimization problem arises in the context of compiling quantum algorithms formulated in the circuit model of computation onto specific quantum hardware. Our approach decomposes the routing problem into an allocation subproblem and a set of token swapping problems. This allows us to tackle the allocation part and the token swapping part separately. Extracting the allocation part from the qubit routing model of Nannicini et al. (Optimal qubit assignment and routing via integer programming, 2021, http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06446 ), we formulate the allocation subproblem as a binary linear program. Herein, we employ a cost function that is a lower bound on the overall routing problem objective. We strengthen the linear relaxation by novel valid inequalities. For the token swapping part we develop an exact branch-and-bound algorithm. In this context, we improve upon known lower bounds on the token swapping problem. Furthermore, we enhance an existing approximation algorithm which runs much faster than the exact approach and typically is able to determine solutions close to the optimum. We present numerical results for the fully integrated allocation and token swapping problem. Obtained solutions may not be globally optimal due to the decomposition and the usage of an approximation algorithm. However, the solutions are obtained fast and are typically close to optimal. In addition, there is a significant reduction in the number of artificial gates and output circuit depth when compared to various state-of-the-art heuristics. Reducing these figures is crucial for minimizing noise when running quantum algorithms on near-term hardware. As a consequence, using the novel decomposition approach leads to compiled algorithms with improved quality. Indeed, when compiled with the novel routing procedure and executed on real hardware, our experimental results for quantum approximate optimization algorithms show an significant increase in solution quality in comparison to standard routing methods.},

Such a network may contain Steiner points—nodes appearing in the solution that are neither in A nor B. We show that for any finite point sets A, B in the plane, there exists a minimum (A, B)-network that is constructible by straightedge and compass (this was claimed in a paper by Maxwell and Swanepoel, but their argument is incorrect). We use this property to formulate an algorithmic framework for exactly finding minimum (A, B)-networks in the Euclidean plane. We also present several new structural and geometric properties of minimum (A, B)-networks. In particular, we resolve a conjecture of Alfaro by proving that, for any terminal set A, adding an appropriate orientation to the edges of a minimum 2-edge-connected Steiner network on A yields a minimum (A, A)-network.},

  abstract     = {In this work, in the context of Linear and convex Quadratic Programming, we consider Primal Dual Regularized Interior Point Methods (PDR-IPMs) in the framework of the Proximal Point Method. The resulting Proximal Stabilized IPM (PS-IPM) is strongly supported by theoretical results concerning convergence and the rate of convergence, and can handle degenerate problems. Moreover, in the second part of this work, we analyse the interactions between the regularization parameters and the computational footprint of the linear algebra routines used to solve the Newton linear systems. In particular, when these systems are solved using an iterative Krylov method, we are able to show—using a new rearrangement of the Schur complement which exploits regularization—that general purposes preconditioners remain attractive for a series of subsequent IPM iterations. Indeed, if on the one hand a series of theoretical results underpin the fact that the approach here presented allows a better re-use of such computed preconditioners, on the other, we show experimentally that such (re)computations are needed only in a fraction of the total IPM iterations. The resulting regularized second order methods, for which low-frequency-update of the preconditioners are allowed, pave the path for an alternative class of second order methods characterized by reduced computational effort.},

A mean-field stochastic bounded real lemma is first established, characterizing the equivalence between $$H_{\infty }$$ robust stability and the solvability of two indefinite differential Riccati equations. Based on this extremely useful result, an equivalent condition for the existence of $$H_{2}/H_{\infty }$$ controller is proposed by utilizing the solution of two sets of cross-coupled indefinite Riccati equations.

It is assumed that the evaders use the same control. The pursuers use counterstrategies based on information about the initial positions and the prehistory of the control of the evaders. The set of admissible controls is a strictly convex compact with a smooth boundary, and the goal sets are the origin of coordinates. The goal of the group of pursuers is the capture of at least one evader by two pursuers or the capture of two evaders. In terms of the initial positions and parameters of the game, a sufficient condition for capture is obtained. This study is based on the method of resolving functions, which makes it possible to obtain sufficient conditions for solvability of the problem of pursuit in some guaranteed time.},

The existence of solution and the strong convergence of the sequences generated by our proposed iterative algorithm to the solution of our considered problem are verified.

Under the analyticity of the feasible set description, and resting upon a desingularization result, the new conditions are proved to be equivalent to the CAKKT conditions. The WCAKKT conditions capture the algebraic elements of the desingularization result needed to characterize CAKKT sequences using a weighted complementarity condition that asymptotically sums zero.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on the acceleration of doubly stochastic gradient descent method for computing the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition of tensors. This optimization problem has N blocks, where N is the order of the tensor. Under the doubly stochastic framework, each block subproblem is solved by the vanilla stochastic gradient method. However, the convergence analysis requires that the variance converges to zero, which is hard to check in practice and may not hold in some implementations. In this paper, we propose accelerating the stochastic gradient method by the momentum acceleration and the variance reduction technique, denoted as DS-MVR. Theoretically, the convergence of DS-MVR only requires the variance to be bounded. Under mild conditions, we show DS-MVR converges to a stochastic $$\varepsilon $$ -stationary solution in $$\tilde{\mathcal {O}}(N^{3/2}\varepsilon ^{-3})$$ iterations with varying stepsizes and in $$\mathcal {O}(N^{3/2}\varepsilon ^{-3})$$ iterations with constant stepsizes, respectively. Numerical experiments on four real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithm can get better results compared with the baselines.},

  abstract     = {We consider iterative methods for unconstrained optimization on Riemannian manifolds. Though memoryless quasi-Newton methods are effective for large-scale unconstrained optimization in the Euclidean space, they have not been studied over Riemannian manifolds. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a memoryless quasi-Newton method in Riemannian manifolds. The proposed method is based on the spectral-scaling Broyden family with additional modifications to ensure the sufficient descent condition. We present an algorithm for the proposed method that uses the Wolfe line search conditions and show that this algorithm guarantees global convergence. We emphasize that global convergence is guaranteed without any assumptions regarding the convexity of the objective function or the isometric property of the vector transport. In addition, we derive appropriate selections for the parameter vector contained in the proposed method. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the proposed method with conventional conjugate gradient methods using typical test problems. The results show that the proposed method is superior to the tested conjugate gradient methods.},

We first study how the chordal sparsity pattern affects the hardness of a max-cut problem. To do this, we derive a polyhedral relaxation based on the clique decomposition of the chordal sparsity patterns and prove some sufficient conditions for the tightness of this polyhedral relaxation. The theoretical results show that the max-cut problem is easy to solve when the sparsity pattern embedded in the problem has a small treewidth and the number of vertices in the intersection of maximal cliques is small. Based on the theoretical results, we propose a new branching rule called hierarchy branching rule, which utilizes the tree decomposition of the sparsity patterns. We also analyze how the proposed branching rule affects the chordal sparsity patterns embedded in the problem, and explain why it can be effective. The numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm is superior to those known algorithms using classical branching rules and the state-of-the-art solver BiqCrunch on most instances with sparsity patterns arisen in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {We develop an exact cutting plane solution algorithm for a special class of bilevel programming models utilized for optimal price-bidding of energy producers in day-ahead electricity markets. The proposed methodology utilizes a suitable reformulation in which a key prerequisite for global optimality, termed bilevel feasibility, is relaxed. Solving the problem to global optimality involves finding the price-offers of the strategic producer (upper-level decision variables) which maximize his self-profit upon clearing of the market and identification of the optimal energy quantity distribution (lower-level decision variables). To exclude from consideration the encountered bilevel infeasible solutions, the algorithm employs a special type of valid cuts drawn from the theory of integer parametric programming. The generation of these cuts involves finding the truly optimal lower-level solution using the strategic price-offers at the bilevel infeasible solution subject to exclusion and devising range intervals for these offers such that the optimality of this solution is retained when each of them lies in its corresponding interval. Each cut imposes a suitable part of this solution, under the condition that each price-offer belongs to its associated interval, which renders the bilevel infeasible solution invalid. We establish the theoretical framework for the development of the proposed algorithm, we illustrate its application on a small case study, and we present extensive computational results demonstrating its behavior and performance on random problem instances. These results indicate that the algorithm is capable of solving to global optimality considerably larger problems than those that a previous elementary version of the same algorithm could solve. This constitutes significant research contribution, considering the lack of generic optimization software for bilevel programming, as well as the fact that the applicability of specialized algorithms on problems of realistic size is rather limited.},

The updating rule of smoothing parameter $$\mu _k$$ is a smart scheme and guarantees the global convergence rate of $$o(\ln ^{\sigma }k/k)$$ with $$\sigma \in (\frac{1}{2},1]$$ on the objective function values. Moreover, we prove that the iterates sequence is convergent to an optimal solution of the problem. We then introduce an error term in the SAPG algorithm to get the inexact smoothing accelerated proximal gradient algorithm.

The fluid registration is introduced to avoid misregistration errors, while the second-order regularization resolved by the Bregman iteration is employed to reduce the image artifacts.

Unfortunately, this challenge usually decreases KEP performance in the real world. To face this challenge, we develop an efficient approach, consisting of scheduling methodology and recourse actions, to recover failing pairs and improve the number of successful transplants in KEPs. The developed policy can be implemented in two different schemes. The first scheme receives an optimal matching as an input and determines recourse actions and the sequence of disjoint cycles and chains for the given optimal matching. However, the second scheme does not need optimal matching. This scheme simultaneously receives the compatibility graph as input and specifies the optimal matching, cycles and chains’ schedule, and corresponding recourse actions. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the developed approach under various circumstances to validate its positive impact on KEP performance. The results demonstrate that this approach increases the number of successful transplants in KEPs and decreases the number of remaining highly sensitive and O blood type patients in the pool.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider an ambiguity-averse multistage network game between a user and an attacker. The arc costs are assumed to be random variables that satisfy prescribed first-order moment constraints for some subsets of arcs and individual probability constraints for some particular arcs. The user aims at minimizing its cumulative expected loss by traversing between two fixed nodes in the network, while the attacker’s objective is to maximize the user’s expected loss by selecting a distribution of arc costs from the family of admissible distributions. In contrast to most of the related studies, both the user and the attacker can dynamically adjust their decisions at particular nodes of the user’s path. By observing the user’s decisions, the attacker may reveal some additional distributional information associated with the arcs emanated from the current user’s position. It is shown that the resulting multistage distributionally robust shortest path problem (DRSPP) admits a linear mixed-integer programming reformulation (MIP). In particular, we distinguish between acyclic and general graphs by introducing different forms of non-anticipativity constraints. Finally, we perform a numerical study, where the quality of adaptive decisions and computational tractability of the proposed MIP reformulation are explored with respect to several classes of synthetic network instances.},

  abstract     = {Deterministic nonconvex optimization solvers generate convex relaxations of nonconvex functions by making use of underlying factorable representations. One approach introduces auxiliary variables assigned to each factor that lifts the problem into a higher-dimensional decision space. In contrast, a generalized McCormick relaxation approach offers the significant advantage of constructing relaxations in the lower dimensionality space of the original problem without introducing auxiliary variables, often referred to as a “reduced-space” approach. Recent contributions illustrated how additional nontrivial inequality constraints may be used in factorable programming to tighten relaxations of the ubiquitous bilinear term. In this work, we exploit an analogous representation of McCormick relaxations and factorable programming to formulate tighter relaxations in the original decision space. We develop the underlying theory to generate necessarily tighter reduced-space McCormick relaxations when a priori convex/concave relaxations are known for intermediate bilinear terms. We then show how these rules can be generalized within a McCormick relaxation scheme via three different approaches: the use of a McCormick relaxations coupled to affine arithmetic, the propagation of affine relaxations implied by subgradients, and an enumerative approach that directly uses relaxations of each factor. The developed approaches are benchmarked on a library of optimization problems using the EAGO.jl optimizer. Two case studies are also considered to demonstrate the developments: an application in advanced manufacturing to optimize supply chain quality metrics and a global dynamic optimization application for rigorous model validation of a kinetic mechanism. The presented subgradient method leads to an improvement in CPU time required to solve the considered problems to $$\epsilon $$ -global optimality.},

  abstract     = {We introduce two desirable properties concerning the allocative efficiency term in the decomposition of economic efficiency. Since Farrell, economic efficiency, defined in terms of the cost, revenue, profitability, or profit functions, is decomposed into a technical efficiency measure and allocative efficiency. Resorting to duality theory, allocative efficiency is calculated as a residual. In this framework, we show that this residual is numerically inconsistent for several economic efficiency decompositions: those based on the Russell Efficiency Measures, the Slack-Based Measure and the Weighted Additive Measures. It should be expected that a technical inefficient firm, if projected to the optimal economic benchmark, e.g., that maximizing profit, should be allocative efficient, yet we show that the above decompositions may signal that it is allocative inefficient. Our first property, called ‘essential,’ demands that economic efficiency decompositions satisfy the above criterion. We also extend this property by requiring that the allocative efficiency of a technically inefficient firm, evaluated at the projected benchmark on the production frontier, coincides with the allocative efficiency of the benchmark itself. Regarding this extension of the property, we show that, besides the measures mentioned above, the Directional Distance Function and the Hölder Distance Function fail in general to comply with it. However, we also prove that, thanks to the flexibility of these two approaches in choosing a common directional vector for all the assessed firms or a specific Hölder norm, these measures may satisfy the extended essential property. We conclude that unless both properties are fulfilled, the (residual) allocative component of many previously published decompositions cannot be correctly interpreted as price inefficiency.},

The phenomenological model contains a set of second-order partial differential equations, which are approximated by a collocation on finite element method. This CFE method prevents mathematical stability limitations due to stiffness problems, resulting in an algebraic equation system added as an optimization set of constraints. This is a significant and innovating approach as there are only a handful of similar studies in the literature that integrate phenomenological models as mathematical constraints in the optimization problem. However, these works do not solve the model using long-term production planning coupled with a simultaneous strategy. Also, formulation applied to two study cases allowed solving the optimization problem within an adequate time without requiring a high-performance computing platform. Results show the economic impact of simultaneously considering the constraints and the state variables evolution throughout the reservoir’s life span to obtain the optimal long-term production planning.},

We give meta-theorems for deriving general convergence rates from those assuming a growth lower bound. Applying this simple but conceptually powerful tool to the proximal point, subgradient, bundle, dual averaging, gradient descent, Frank–Wolfe and universal accelerated methods immediately recovers their known convergence rates for general convex optimization problems from their specialized rates. New convergence results follow for bundle methods, dual averaging and Frank–Wolfe. Our results can lift any rate based on Hölder continuous gradients and Hölder growth bounds. Moreover, our theory provides simple proofs of optimal convergence lower bounds under Hölder growth from textbook examples without growth bounds.},

Under the assumption of convexity, we first establish the convergence of the algorithm in terms of dual variables, primal variables and constraint violations.

  abstract     = {The popularity of air transportation, both for personal and commercial uses, has been growing in recent years. As a result, the traffic volume in the airspace is constantly increasing, which leads to the higher chances of conflicts among aircraft. In air traffic management, conflict detection and resolution are challenging and stressful tasks due to the highly dynamic nature of aircraft flight plans as well as the interdependency among pilots’ decisions. Therefore, reliable and comprehensive decision-making techniques are necessary to deal with such conflicts in the airspace in a timely manner. In this regard, innovative technological developments are essential to assist decision-makers. In this paper, we propose a semi-decentralized, three-stage algorithm based on game theory to resolve potential conflicts among multiple aircraft traveling in a 3D shared airspace. The result from the algorithm shows that deviation costs are highly sensitive to the level of congestion in the airspace. The proposed algorithm provides useful information for air traffic control and pilots to enhance their coordination and facilitate decision-making procedures in scenarios with single and multiple conflicts during both nominal and deviated-from-nominal situations.},

  abstract     = {Method-of-lines discretizations are demanding test problems for stiff integration methods. However, for PDE problems with known analytic solution, the presence of space discretization errors or the need to use codes to compute reference solutions may limit the validity of numerical test results. To overcome these drawbacks, we present in this short note a simple test problem with boundary control, a situation where one-step methods may suffer from order reduction. We derive exact formulas for the solution of an optimal boundary control problem governed by a one-dimensional discrete heat equation and an objective function that measures the distance of the final state from the target and the control costs. This analytical setting is used to compare the numerically observed convergence orders for selected implicit Runge–Kutta and Peer two-step methods of classical order four, which are suitable for optimal control problems.},

In the twice differentiable case, these issues have received some attention in the existing literature. Moreover, a few results in this direction are known in the case when the first derivative is merely B-differentiable. Here, we further elaborate on a similar setting, but the main attention is paid to the case of piecewise smooth equations. Specifically, we study the effect of singularity of a solution for some active smooth selection on the overall stability properties, and we provide sufficient conditions ensuring the needed stability properties in the cases when such smooth selections may exist.

  abstract     = {In deep learning, asynchronous parallel stochastic gradient descent (APSGD) is a broadly used algorithm to speed up the training process. In asynchronous system, the time delay of stale gradients in asynchronous algorithms is generally proportional to the total number of workers. When the number of workers is too large, the time delay will bring additional deviation from the accurate gradient due to delayed gradients and may cause a negative influence on the convergence speed of the algorithm. One may ask: How many workers can be used at most to achieve both the convergence and the speedup? In this paper, we consider the asynchronous training problem with the non-convex case. We theoretically study this problem to find an approximating second-order stationary point using asynchronous algorithms in non-convex optimization and investigate the behaviors of APSGD near-saddle points. This work gives the first theoretical guarantee to find an approximating second-order stationary point in asynchronous algorithms and a provable upper bound for the time delay. The techniques we provide can be generalized to analyze other types of asynchronous algorithms to understand the behaviors of asynchronous algorithms in distributed asynchronous parallel training.},

The cryptic life cycle of CBB inside coffee berries makes their control extremely difficult. To tackle this problem, we use a dynamical model describing the plant–pest interactions during a cropping season, which includes a berry age structure to account for CBB preference for mature berries. We introduce two environmentally friendly control methods, consisting in applying a bio-insecticide to reduce berry infestation and in trapping the colonising CBB. Our objective is to maximise the profit generated by the harvest of healthy coffee berries, while minimising the CBB population for the next cropping season. The existence of an optimal control strategy is provided, and necessary optimality conditions are established. Finally, the optimal control problem is solved numerically and simulations are provided. They show that combining the two control methods is a cost-effective strategy to protect coffee berries from CBB infestation.},

The nature idea behind the Katyusha momentum is to use a convex combination framework instead of extrapolation framework used in Nesterov’s momentum. In this paper, we design a Katyusha-like momentum step, i.e., a negative momentum framework, and incorporate it into the classical variance reduction stochastic gradient algorithm. Based on the built negative momentum-based framework, we proposed an accelerated stochastic algorithm, namely negative momentum-based stochastic variance reduction gradient (NMSVRG) algorithm for minimizing a class of convex finite-sum problems. There is only one extra parameter needed to turn in NMSVRG algorithm, which is obviously more friendly in parameter turning than the original Katyusha momentum-based algorithm. We provided a rigorous theoretical analysis and shown that the proposed NMSVRG algorithm is superior to the SVRG algorithm and is comparable to the best one in the existing literature in convergence rate. Finally, experimental results verify our analysis and show again that our proposed algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art-related stochastic algorithms.},

In this case, the multiplier associated with mixed constraints is an element of the dual space of the Banach space-valued essentially bounded functions. Exploiting the combination of the Ioffe-Levin decomposition theorem for this dual and a Lagrange multiplier theorem obtained for an abstract multi-criteria optimization framework, we set up Fritz-John necessary optimality conditions, in the presence of integrable functions and singular measures as multipliers, for local weak Pareto solutions of the problems under investigation.

  abstract     = {Intrinsic noise in objective function and derivatives evaluations may cause premature termination of optimization algorithms. Evaluation complexity bounds taking this situation into account are presented in the framework of a deterministic trust-region method. The results show that the presence of intrinsic noise may dominate these bounds, in contrast with what is known for methods in which the inexactness in function and derivatives’ evaluations is fully controllable. Moreover, the new analysis provides estimates of the optimality level achievable, should noise cause early termination. Numerical experiments are reported that support the theory. The analysis finally sheds some light on the impact of inexact computer arithmetic on evaluation complexity.},

Under the framework of anisotropic Musielak–Orlicz Sobolev spaces, we establish the nonemptiness, boundedness and closedness of the solution set of such problems by applying a surjectivity theorem for multivalued pseudomonotone operators and the variational characterization of the first eigenvalue of the Steklov eigenvalue problem for the p-Laplacian. In the second part, we consider a nonlinear inverse problem which is formulated by a regularized optimal control problem to identify the discontinuous parameters for the variable exponent double-phase obstacle problem. We then introduce the parameter-to-solution map, study a continuous result of Kuratowski type and prove the solvability of the inverse problem.},

  abstract     = {Smoothing Newton methods, which usually inherit local quadratic convergence rate, have been successfully applied to solve various mathematical programming problems. In this paper, we propose an accelerated smoothing Newton method (ASNM) for solving the weighted complementarity problem (wCP) by reformulating it as a system of nonlinear equations using a smoothing function. In spirit, when the iterates are close to the solution set of the nonlinear system, an additional approximate Newton step is computed by solving one of two possible linear systems formed by using previously calculated Jacobian information. When a Lipschitz continuous condition holds on the gradient of the smoothing function at two checking points, this additional approximate Newton step can be obtained with a much reduced computational cost. Hence, ASNM enjoys local cubic convergence rate but with computational cost only comparable to standard Newton’s method at most iterations. Furthermore, a second-order nonmonotone line search is designed in ASNM to ensure global convergence. Our numerical experiments verify the local cubic convergence rate of ASNM and show that the acceleration techniques employed in ASNM can significantly improve the computational efficiency compared with some well-known benchmark smoothing Newton method.},

Existence of affine reverse Stackelberg strategy for multilevel differential games is proved, and a method to obtain such set of strategies is also presented. The structure of this game can be adopted to many application areas, in particular in decentralized continuous decision making situations such as marketing system, taxation and budget allocation.

To analyze the impact of market power, we formulate the mixed complementarity problems to identify the Nash equilibrium and use a directional distance function to estimate the efficiency by the directional vector toward the Nash equilibrium. We investigate two cases of market power in the energy market: wholesalers as leaders, or bilateral bargaining power between manufacturers and wholesalers. The numerical study of a power generation market is conducted and the results show that the Nash equilibriums in the two cases provide the insights to drive the productivity and support environmental policies.

  abstract     = {We study the problems of maximizing a monotone non-submodular function subject to two types of constraints, either an independent system constraint or a p-matroid constraint. These problems often occur in the context of combinatorial optimization, operations research, economics and especially, machine learning and data science. Using the generalized curvature $$\alpha $$ and the submodularity ratio $$\gamma $$ or the diminishing returns ratio $$\xi $$ , we analyze the performances of the widely used greedy algorithm, which yields theoretical approximation guarantees of $$\frac{1}{\alpha }[1-(1-\frac{\alpha \gamma }{K})^k]$$ and $$\frac{\xi }{p + \alpha \xi }$$ for the two types of constraints, respectively, where k, K are, respectively, the minimum and maximum cardinalities of a maximal independent set in the independent system, and p is the minimum number of matroids such that the independent system can be expressed as the intersection of p matroids. When the constraint is a cardinality one, our result maintains the same approximation ratio as that in Bian et al. (Proceedings of the 34th international conference on machine learning, pp 498–507, 2017); however, the proof is much simpler owning to the new definition of the greedy curvature. In the case of a single matroid constraint, our result is competitive compared with the existing ones in Chen et al. (Proceedings of the 35th international conference on machine learning, pp 804–813, 2018) and Gatmiry and Rodriguez (Non-submodular function maximization subject to a matroid constraint, with applications, 2018. arXiv:1811.07863v4 ). In addition, we bound the generalized curvature, the submodularity ratio and the diminishing returns ratio for several important real-world applications. Computational experiments are also provided supporting our analyses.},

This problem has important applications in real situations, either itself or as subproblems. In order to solve GMFWP efficiently, we reformulate it as a separable minimization problem and then two customized alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMMs) based on augmented Lagrangian function are contributed to solving the resulted separable problem. Specifically, for unconstrained GMFWP, a convergent ADMM for two-block problem is presented. For constrained GMFWP, the direct application of ADMM for multi-block problem has no convergence guarantee. As one of main contributions, this paper proposes a new ADMM for the general multi-block separable problem, and its global convergence is established under mild assumptions. We then apply the new convergent ADMM to solve constrained GMFWP. Some satisfactory numerical results for numerous GMFWPs are reported, which verify the efficiency of proposed ADMM algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We propose a stochastic variance-reduced cubic regularized Newton algorithm to optimize the finite-sum problem over a Riemannian submanifold of the Euclidean space. The proposed algorithm requires a full gradient and Hessian update at the beginning of each epoch while it performs stochastic variance-reduced updates in the iterations within each epoch. The iteration complexity of $$O(\epsilon ^{-3/2})$$ to obtain an $$(\epsilon ,\sqrt{\epsilon })$$ -second-order stationary point, i.e., a point with the Riemannian gradient norm upper bounded by $$\epsilon $$ and minimum eigenvalue of Riemannian Hessian lower bounded by $$-\sqrt{\epsilon }$$ , is established when the manifold is embedded in the Euclidean space. Furthermore, the paper proposes a computationally more appealing modification of the algorithm which only requires an inexact solution of the cubic regularized Newton subproblem with the same iteration complexity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with three other Riemannian second-order methods over two numerical studies on estimating the inverse scale matrix of the multivariate t-distribution on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices and estimating the parameter of a linear classifier on the sphere manifold.},

Under a technical assumption, convergence of iterates using the method on the problem is proved when either A or B is single-valued, and the fixed relaxation parameter $$\theta $$ lies in the interval $$(2 + \beta , 2 + \beta + \min \{ \beta , 1/\beta \})$$ . With this convergence result, we address an open problem that is not settled in Monteiro et al.

Pointwise convergence rate results and R-linear convergence rate results when $$\theta $$ lies in the interval $$[2 + \beta , 2 + \beta + \min \{\beta , 1/\beta \})$$ are also provided in the paper.

  abstract     = {Stochastic gradient methods (SGMs) have been extensively used for solving stochastic problems or large-scale machine learning problems. Recent works employ various techniques to improve the convergence rate of SGMs for both convex and nonconvex cases. Most of them require a large number of samples in some or all iterations of the improved SGMs. In this paper, we propose a new SGM, named PStorm, for solving nonconvex nonsmooth stochastic problems. With a momentum-based variance reduction technique, PStorm can achieve the optimal complexity result $$O(\varepsilon ^{-3})$$ to produce a stochastic $$\varepsilon $$ -stationary solution, if a mean-squared smoothness condition holds. Different from existing optimal methods, PStorm can achieve the $${O}(\varepsilon ^{-3})$$ result by using only one or O(1) samples in every update. With this property, PStorm can be applied to online learning problems that favor real-time decisions based on one or O(1) new observations. In addition, for large-scale machine learning problems, PStorm can generalize better by small-batch training than other optimal methods that require large-batch training and the vanilla SGM, as we demonstrate on training a sparse fully-connected neural network and a sparse convolutional neural network.},

Our analysis reveals that network externality does not monotonously influence optimal prices, while it always improves the project quality. In addition, we prove that although network externality increases the creator’s profit, it increases the price discrimination level and may hurt consumers, thus reducing social welfare. In extensions, we investigate the effects of demand uncertainty, external financing, and word-of-mouth effect on the optimal decisions. Our work not only provides managerial implications for crowdfunding activities, but also reveals the potential negative effects of network externality for platforms.},

This model is very useful in nonlinear combinatorial optimization, where there is a fixed cost c for operating an activity at level x in the operating range $$[\ell ,u]$$ , and then, there is a further (convex) variable cost f(x). So the overall cost is $$cz+f(x)$$ . In applied situations, there can be N 4-tuples $$(f,\ell ,u,c)$$ , and associated (x, y, z), and so, the combinatorial nature of the problem is that for any of the $$2^N$$ choices of the binary z-variables, the non-convexity associated with each of the $$(f,\ell ,u)$$ goes away. We study relaxations related to the perspective transformation of a natural piecewise-linear under-estimator of f, obtained by choosing linearization points for f. Using 3-d volume (in (x, y, z)) as a measure of the tightness of a convex relaxation, we investigate relaxation quality as a function of f, $$\ell $$ , u, and the linearization points chosen. We make a detailed investigation for convex power functions $$f(x):=x^p$$ , $$p&gt;1$$ .},
