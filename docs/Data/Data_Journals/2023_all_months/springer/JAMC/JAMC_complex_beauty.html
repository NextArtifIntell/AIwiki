  abstract     = {Intraguild predation, the most fundamental mechanism in food webs with three species, is a mix of competition and predation in which two species that are participating in a predator–prey relationship are also competing for a common resource. We investigate an intraguild predation model by considering three population, namely shared resource, IG-prey and IG-predator by using a coupled system of ordinary differential equations and use Holling type II functional response between IG-prey and IG-predator. The dynamic properties of the proposed model are analyzed, including positivity, boundedness, uniform persistent, the existence and stability of the equilibria and Hopf bifurcation. We derive the sufficient conditions for the persistence and extinction of all feasible scenarios for the proposed model by providing a comprehensive view of their global stability. Our results reveal that the attacking rate and decay rate of the intraguild-predator can promote the formation of the stability of the model by transforming it from an unstable state to a stable state. The region of stability around interior equilibrium and around IG-predator free equilibrium has been obtained in terms of the attacking rate and decay rate of the intraguild-predator. The parameters interval for the coexistence of the three species has been determined. Our theoretical analysis and numerical illustrations demonstrate that intraguild predation model is prone to have coexistence of all the three populations.},

Furthermore, some numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of $$\theta $$ -difference FEM scheme. It’s worth noting that the numerical precision of C-Bézier basis is improved 3–5 orders of magnitude comparing with classical Lagrange basis and it also has higher numerical accuracy than CN finite difference method(FDM) and backward FDM.},

The resistance distance of two vertices i and j is given by the expression: $$r_{ij}=l^\dagger _{ii}+ l^\dagger _{jj}-2\,l^\dagger _{ij},~i,j=1,2,3,\cdots ,n$$ , where $$L^\dagger =(l^\dagger _{ij})_{n\times n}$$ represents the Moore–Penrose inverse of matrix L. The resistance matrix of the graph G is defined by $$\mathcal {R} = (r_{ij})_{n \times n}$$ . Prior research in the literature has extensively explored determinants and inverses of the resistance matrix. This article extends the concept of a resistance matrix to incorporate matrix weights, particularly when dealing with symmetric matrix edge weights. It is demonstrated that the resistance matrix may lose its non-singularity property under this setup. The conditions for singularity of the resistance matrix $$\mathcal {R}$$ are established as necessary and sufficient. In cases where the resistance matrix becomes singular, the potential ranks of matrix $$\mathcal {R}$$ are characterized. An explicit equation is formulated to calculate the inverse and determinant of the resistance matrix in cases where it is not singular. Furthermore, for a specific scenario, the Moore–Penrose inverse of a singular resistance matrix is provided.},

Within this model, we incorporate a general incidence function and meticulously analyze how the adoption of mask-wearing and adherence to physical distancing protocols intricately shape the dynamics of susceptible and infected individuals. Our exploration commences by establishing the existence and uniqueness of a positively bounded solution for the model, employing powerful Banach’s fixed point theorem. Moreover, we showcase that this solution demonstrates distinctive global mild attributes. Subsequently, we elucidate the two equilibrium points inherent in the system: the disease-free and endemic points. Employing the LaSalle–Lyapunov theorem, we establish that the global stability of these equilibrium points is predominantly contingent upon the basic reproduction number of the system. This stability assertion holds true across various values of the non-integer order derivative. Lastly, we substantiate our findings with a series of numerical simulations that provide tangible support for the preceding analytical results.},

The convergent rates of the error with respect to the mesh size h in the energy norm and $$L^2$$ norm are optimal theoretically and numerically. The suboptimal rates of the error with respect to the polynomial degree p in energy norm by half an order of p is proven theoretically.

As an effective metric, subsystem-based reliability is defined to be the probability that at least one of the fault-free subsystems of a given size remains available in the event of node failure. In this work, we propose two distinct strategies to measure the subsystem reliability of complete-transposition network $$CT_n$$ and investigate the robustness of its reliability bounds. Specifically, by virtue of the probability fault model, we establish the upper and lower bounds of subsystem reliability for $$CT_n$$ in terms of at most four subgraphs intersecting. Subsequently, the approximation of subsystem reliability for $$CT_n$$ is derived by ignoring the intersection among subgraphs. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of subsystem reliability bounds for $$CT_n$$ and determine the critical time point such that the bounds are valid. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the established analytic inference, which shows that the approximation of subsystem reliability is sufficient to characterize the exact value of subsystem reliability.},

A fitting factor is introduced in the highest order derivative term of the singularly perturbed differential equation first, and then, a cubic spline difference scheme is employed for approximating the required solution numerically. The value of fitting factor is obtained through the use of the theory of singular perturbations and Taylor series expansion procedure. The resulting tri-diagonal system is solved with the help of the Thomas algorithm. Convergence of the suggested technique are investigated. Applicability and the computational efficiency of the scheme is demonstrated by solving three example problems. The maximum absolute error of the suggested technique are computed and the computational results are compared with the results obtained by other methods. The effect of shifts on the solutions is investigated by depicting the figures.},

  abstract     = {This research paper presents an eco-epidemiological model that investigates the intricate dynamics of a predator–prey system, considering the impact of fear-induced stress, hunting cooperation, global warming, and memory effects on species interactions. The model employs fractional-order derivatives to account for temporal dependencies and memory in ecological processes. By incorporating these factors, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the stability and behavior of ecological systems. Mathematically we investigate system’s existence, equilibria and their stability. Moreover, global stability and hopf bifurcation also analyzed in this study. Numerical simulations have been performed to validate the analytical results. We find that the coexistence equilibrium is stable under specific conditions, along with the predator equilibrium and the disease-free equilibrium. Bifurcation analyses demonstrate the intricate behavior of species densities in response to changes in model parameters. Fear and global warming are found to stabilize the system, while cooperation and additional food for predators lead to destabilization. Additionally, the influence of species memory has been explored. We observe that memory tends to stabilize the system as species memory levels increase.},

The splitting schemes consist of two sub-stages in each time step, each of which requires solving a number of 1D discrete sub-problems. The Crank–Nicolson approach is used to solve each sub-problem’s time discretization. Both splitting methods satisfy the energy decay and are unconditionally stable. The convergence result of the SS-MD scheme is shown to be of first order in time and of second order in space based on the energy technique, whereas the SM-MD scheme is of second order in both time and space. We also analyze numerical dispersion analysis to obtain two identities of the discrete numerical dispersion relations of both splitting schemes.

  abstract     = {The traveling salesman problem is a classic combinatorial optimization challenge with profound implications for various industries. While significant progress has been made in solving traveling salesman problem instances, real-world applications often involve uncertainties that challenge the accuracy and robustness of traditional approaches. Pythagorean fuzzy uncertain variables combine the strengths of fuzzy logic with the principles of uncertainty theory, allowing for a more balanced and comprehensive representation of uncertainty. This paper defines the theoretical foundations of normal, lognormal, and empirical Pythagorean fuzzy uncertainty distributions, including their mathematical formulation and operational laws. Moreover, it presents a novel hybrid optimization approach that leverages the strengths of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms while incorporating Pythagorean fuzzy uncertain variables to address the traveling salesman problem under uncertain conditions. The synergy of these two techniques enables effective exploration and exploitation of solution candidates, leading to improved traveling salesman problem solutions. The detailed steps of the algorithm are demonstrated through a numerical example. A case study of a decision support system for optimizing a beverage logistics vehicle routing problem is discussed to find out the best possible route in the distribution zones. The incorporation of Pythagorean fuzzy uncertain variables enhances the algorithm’s robustness in uncertain environments, resulting in higher-quality solutions and improved adaptability to different levels of uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {In natural systems, the change of ecological environment can indirectly affect some key biological parameters of species and their activity patterns, among which the imprecision of biological parameters and prey refuge behavior are two more obvious embodiments. The aim of this work is to investigate the triple effects of imprecision of biological parameters, prey refuge behavior and fishing activities on the dynamics of the system. Firstly, a novel Ivlev’s type fishery model incorporating with variable prey refuge and imprecise parameters is proposed. The dynamic properties of the fishery model under continuous fishing mode are analyzed, and the effects of variable prey refuge, imprecise index and fishing effort on the existence and stability of equilibrium are given. Moreover, the bionomic equilibrium and optimal fishing strategy are obtained. Secondly, from the perspective of reasonable exploitation of fishery resources, the weighted fishing strategy is introduced into the system, and the relevant weights and thresholds can be adjusted according to the actual demand, which is conducive to the sustainable development of fishery resources. The dynamic behavior of the fishery model under weighted fishing model is discussed, including the existence and stability of predator-extinction periodic solution and co-existence order-1 periodic solution under different fishing thresholds and weights, which not only provides a possibility to fishing species according to the period, but also ensures a certain robustness of the fishing strategy. Finally, to illustrate the theoretical results, numerical verifications for two harvesting models are presented to demonstrate the impact of variable prey refugia, imprecise biological parameters and fishing efforts on the behaviors of the system. The results of this study provide a reference for the scientific and reasonable exploitation and utilization of fishery resources in an imprecise environment.},

Meanwhile the stability of the disease-free equilibrium is proved. Furthermore, we deduce the existence of multiple endemic equilibria and the occurrence of bifurcation. And then, using the partial ranking correlation coefficient (PRCC), it is found that the control reproduction number is most correlated with the parameter $$\rho $$ (incineration or burial rate of dead bodies). Additionally, based on the data of the Ebola epidemic in Uganda in 2022, the fitted curve of accumulated infectious cases stabilizes at 143, which is eventually consistent with the actual data. Finally, numerical simulation results indicate that the peak value of infectious individuals decreases by 52.3\% when the maximum treatment recovery rate changes from 20\% to 40\%. And while the hospital bed-population ratio increases by 10\%, the peak value of the infectious decreases by 29.1\%. Simultaneously, when the rate of immune loss decreasing from 60\% to 20\%, the peak value of the infectious decreases by 13.2\%. While enhancing the tracking and quarantining of susceptible individuals have significant impact on the prevention and control of Ebola.},

Different with the existing non-collocated controllers, the proposed methodology constructs a more general Lyapunov function with segmented spatial regions to guarantee the piecewise stabilization of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with multi-spatiotemporal states. The sufficient linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) condition is first derived by combining the improved Lyapunov direct method, Lipschitz condition, mean value theorem of integrals and a variant of Wirtinger’s inequality to obtain the local gain matrices of collocated control. Further, a nonlinear PDEs observer-based piecewise controller is proposed to overcome the non-collocated distribution between finite piecewise actuators and sensors. Finally, a comparison simulation for the FitzHugh–Nagumo (FHN) system is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed non-collocated piecewise controller.},

Furthermore, the characteristic equations are investigated, and the time delays are applied as the bifurcation parameter. Eventually, the presence of Hopf bifurcation is demonstrated. The Lyapunov functional is constructed, and the system is shown to have uniform persistence. The consistent persistent domain of the system is obtained by constructing a persistent function.

Then, taking the average state of the corresponding subset of nodes in the first layer as the target, an event-triggered control protocol based on the sampled information is designed to synchronize the second layer to the first layer. By applying the time-delay system method and the event-triggered control principle, the sufficient condition for cluster synchronization of the second layer is obtained.

Firstly, the definition of the Moore–Penrose inverse of quaternion tensors under the QT-product is presented. The expression of Moore–Penrose inverse of quaternion tensors via the QT-product is proposed based on the singular value decomposition and illustrated by an example. Finally, the perturbation analysis of the Moore–Penrose inverse of quaternion tensors via the QT-product are described under the conditions of one-sided, two-sided and rank-preserving. Moreover, examples of perturbation bounds in each case are given.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider additive convex optimization problems in which the objective function is the sum of a large number of convex nondifferentiable cost functions. We assume that each cost function is specifically written as the sum of two convex nondifferentiable functions in which one function is appropriate for the subgradient method, and another one is not. To this end, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the subgradient and proximal methods. The proposed method is also governed by an asynchronous feature that allows time-varying delays when computing the subgradients. We prove the convergences of function values of iterates to the optimal value. To demonstrate the efficiency of the presented theoretical result, we investigate the binary classification problem via support vector machine learning.},

When the immigration is not considered the model has a disease-free equilibrium point, endemic equilibrium and basic reproductive number which are globally asymptotically stable depending on the magnitude of this threshold.

The system is investigated for the model’s stability analysis, existence, and uniqueness. The impact of a fractional differential equation on the analysis of the described model is examined by utilizing Caputo Fractional operator. Stability analysis is discussed under three categories: without any therapy, with chemotherapy, and with chemo-radiotherapy treatment. However, numerical simulations have been utilized to investigate the model on fractional order derivative. The graphs have been displayed for the three treatments using various values for the fractional order. This analysis suggests that combination therapy could lead to tremendous success in treating gliomas.},

Further, the robustness of the proposed scheme is tested over the problems having a large time lag as well. At first, the semilinearity is treated with the help of Newton’s linearization technique. Then, a first-order global accurate scheme is employed combining the implicit Euler scheme in time direction over a uniform mesh and the upwind scheme in spatial direction over two-layer rectifying meshes namely, the Shishkin mesh and the Bakhvalov-Shishkin mesh. The use of Bakhvalov-Shishkin mesh overrides the drawback of order deduction because of the logarithmic term in Shishkin mesh. Thomas algorithm is employed for calculation which computationally is more robust than the usual matrix inversion methods. The stability and consistency are discussed thoroughly. The truncation error and barrier function approach is used for the evaluation of error bounds. The analytical claims are proved through numerical simulations.},

Generally speaking, solving the primal and dual subproblems dominates the main computational cost of those primal-dual type methods. In this paper, we propose a partially inexact generalized primal-dual hybrid gradient method for saddle point problems with bilinear couplings, where the dual subproblem is solved approximately with a relative error strategy. Our proposed algorithm consists of two stages, where the first stage yields a predictor by solving the primal and dual subproblems, and the second procedure makes a correction on the predictor via a simple scheme. It is noteworthy that the underlying extrapolation parameter can be relaxed in a larger range, which allows us to have more choices than a fixed setting. Theoretically, we establish some convergence properties of the proposed algorithm, including the global convergence, the sub-linear convergence rate and the Q-linear convergence rate. Finally, some preliminary computational results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm works well on the fused Lasso problem with synthetic datasets and a pixel-constrained image restoration model.},

Since the Jacobian matrix is computationally difficult to compute and sometimes not available specifically when dealing with non-smooth monotone systems, quasi-Newton methods with superlinear convergence are preferred for solving nonlinear system of equations. This paper provides a new version of the derivative-free David–Fletcher–Powell (DFP) approach for dealing with nonlinear monotone system of equations with convex constraints. The optimal value of the scaling parameter is found by minimizing the condition number of the DFP matrix. Under certain assumptions, the proposed method has global convergence, required minimal storage and is derivative-free. When compared to standard methods, the proposed method requires less iteration, function evaluations, and CPU time. The image restoration test problems demonstrate the method’s reliability and efficiency.},

To study the influence of multiple contact mechanism and incentive effect on rumor spreading, we propose a rumor propagation dynamics model with multiple contact mechanism, which is based on the traditional SIR rumor propagation model and has divided the susceptible people into n $$S_1S_2...S_n$$ categories. Firstly, in the system, without considering the population movement, we calculate the threshold and the final rumors spread scale of the system. Secondly, we consider population immigration and emigration in the new system. The existence of the equilibrium of the system is analyzed, and the basic reproduction number is obtained based on the next generation matrix method. The local asymptotic stability of the rumor free equilibrium is proved by the Hurwitz criterion, and the global asymptotic stability is proved according to LaSalle’s Invariance Principle. Finally, numerical simulation verifies the theoretical results, and the research shows that the multiple contact mechanism and incentive effect proposed in this paper are more similar to the rumor propagation law of social networks in the new era.},

To solve numerically, we establish a finite difference scheme on the Shishkin mesh using a composite trapezoidal formulae for the integral part and interpolating quadrature rules and the linear exponential basis functions for the differential part. We establish that the numerical scheme and rate of convergence are both second-order and converge uniformly with reference to the small $$\varepsilon $$ -parameter. The efficacy of the approach is supported by testing the numerical scheme’s performance.},

Employing the Anderson mixing to speed up the convergence of double-step scale splitting (DSS) iteration, we establish a modified DSS (MDSS) iteration method for solving linear system with complex symmetric matrix. We propose the Picard-MDSS method based on the separability of linear and nonlinear terms by combining modified DSS (MDSS) methods of linear systems. We explore convergence theorems for the MDSS and Picard-MDSS methods under proper conditions. Furthermore, we conclude that our new methods are more efficient in comparison to several known methods through numerical experiments.

On a layer adapted Shishkin mesh, the problem is solved using finite difference schemes. Initially, after linearizing the kernel function, a first order accurate difference scheme is used for the approximation of the model problem using the upwind schemes for the derivative components and composite rectangular rule for the integral part. An extensive theoretical analysis is presented, which establishes that the method is stable. Further, to enhance the convergence rate from first order to second order, a post-processing method is applied. The technique improves the rate of convergence but takes a lot of computational time. To get rid of this issue, a hybrid scheme is used to obtain the solution of the model problem which directly gives second order accuracy. For both the proposed schemes, parameter uniform error estimates are demonstrated. Theoretical results are validated through two numerical tests.},

We prove a GPM formula for the Euclidean dual $$\mathcal {C}^\perp $$ using the identical equation of the Hermite normal form of $$\textbf{G}$$ . Next, we aim to replace the Euclidean dual with the Galois dual. The Galois inner product is an asymmetric form, so we distinguish between the right and left Galois duals. We show that the right and left Galois duals of a MT code are MT as well but with possibly different shift constants. Some interconnected identities for the right and left Galois duals of a linear code are established and we also introduce the two-sided Galois dual. We use a condition that makes the two-sided Galois dual of a MT code MT, then we describe its GPM. Two special cases are also studied, one when the right and left Galois duals trivially intersect and the other when they coincide. A necessary and sufficient condition is established for the equality of the right and left Galois duals of any linear code.},

This study aims to identify the importance of treatment function and then control the complications of various individuals. We present a mathematical model of diabetes (type-2 diabetes) based on insulin therapy as a controlling factor. With fractional-order delay differential equations, four parts of the population control the dynamic system. The well-posedness (positivity, boundedness) of the model is examined to show that it is biologically and mathematically relevant. According to the characteristics equations for the model, certain sufficient conditions must be met for diabetic-free, endemic equilibrium points to be stable locally. To assess the imbalanced glucose level and treatment over a finite time period, we construct an optimal control problem based on treatment control and awareness program control as time-dependent control parameters. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is examined. In order to determine the most cost-effective treatment strategy with limited resources, we assessed the effectiveness and costs of treatments. The theoretical findings are verified by numerical simulations.},

The restriction of flow direction in directed fuzzy incidence graphs enables the modeling of physical problems, such as unauthorized flow through one-way traffic networks and white noise in communication networks, that the fuzzy incidence graph cannot portray adequately. In this article, the idea of trees in directed fuzzy incidence graphs are described and the structure of a legal fuzzy incidence tree is explained using directed incidence connectivity and legal incidence strength. The relationships of legal fuzzy incidence trees to other connectivity ideas, such as fuzzy incidence tournaments, legal flow reduction links, and legal cycles are examined. It is shown that a legal cycle cannot be a legal fuzzy incidence tree and a legal fuzzy incidence tree cannot be a fuzzy incidence tournament. Moreover, the arcs of directed fuzzy incidence graphs are categorized into three, legal $$\alpha $$ -strong arcs, legal $$\beta $$ -strong arcs, and legal $$\delta $$ -arcs. It is proved that an arc in a directed fuzzy incidence graph is legal strong if and only if its legal flow equals the directed incidence connectivity between end nodes. The characterization of legal flow reduction links using legal $$\alpha $$ -strong arcs is obtained. An arc is a legal flow reduction link if and only if it is legal $$\alpha $$ -strong. The relation of legal fuzzy incidence trees, and fuzzy incidence tournaments with legal $$\beta $$ -arcs is also identified. As an application, the notion of legal fuzzy incidence trees is applied to a natural model to solve the problem of placing a tollbooth in a suitable location of a one-way traffic system to provide maximum income for the government.},

The obtained scheme remains stable in the sense that the solution respects its physical ranges and enables the energy estimates. The existence of discrete solutions is also valid. The numerical section highlights the accuracy, the robustness and the efficiency of the novel scheme compared to the standard CVFE methodology. An application of the developed weakly monotone finite volume scheme to the simulation of mass transfer in hygroscopic media is conducted, with a specific focus on mass diffusion within wood.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a mutualistic model with advection and a free boundary in one dimensional space and heterogeneous environment. The main goal is to understand how the evolution of the two species is affected by the advection coefficients and the heterogeneous environment. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of the global solution of the system. Then, we prove a spreading-vanishing dichotomy for this model, namely the two species either successfully spread to infinity and survive in the environment, or they fail to establish and die out in the long run. Furthermore, criteria of spreading and vanishing are established, and some rough estimates of the asymptotic spreading speed are given when spreading happens.},

Harmonic incidence mean-type aims to drive exposed and infected populations towards extinction in a finite time frame. The reproduction number is calculated based on the next-generation matrix. A disease-free equilibrium point can be achieved globally using the Castillo-Chavez approach. Using the additive compound matrix approach, the global stability of endemic equilibrium can be demonstrated. Utilizing Pontryagin’s maximum principle, we introduce three control variables to obtain the optimal control strategies. Laplace transform allows simulating the fractional-order derivatives analytically. Analysis of the graphical results led to a better understanding of the transmission dynamics.},

We obtain results related to the presented approaches by varying the range of parameters. These results give an overview of the relationships between (weakly, properly) Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP and optimal solutions of the presented scalarized problems. We remark that all the provided theorems do not require any convexity assumption for objective functions. The main advantage of the generalized Tchebycheff norm approach is that, unlike most scalarization approaches, there is no gap between necessary and sufficient conditions for (weak, proper) Pareto optimality. Moreover, this approach, in different results, shows necessary and sufficient conditions for Pareto optimality.},

In a brief span of time, the Zagreb connection indices have garnered a lot of attention. The ultimate goal of the present report is to reveal the chemical significance of this variants of Zagreb index and to demonstrate their fascinating mathematical attributes. The chemical connection of the indices is examined by investigating their potential in structure–property modelling. To illustrate mathematical features, some crucial upper bounds for connection indices are computed with characterizing maximal structures. The maximal graphs for the class of connected, tree, bipartite and chain graphs are identified by means of connection indices in terms of graph order. Such characterization is quite useful in regulating molecular properties that the connection indices can predict.},

We reformulate the stochastic tensor complementarity problem as an expected residual minimization problem which aims to minimize an expected residual function defined by the restricted nonlinear complementarity function. Combined with the projected gradient method which has simple structure and low computational cost, we propose a new smoothing projected Hesteness-Stiefel (HS) method to solve the stochastic tensor complementarity problem. We establish the global convergence of the proposed method. Relevant numerical results compared with the traditional projected gradient method are also given to show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

The latter belongs to the newly introduced hyperbolic type (Guerdouh et al. in An efficient primal-dual interior point algorithm for linear optimization problems based on a novel parameterized kernel function with a hyperbolic barrier term, 2021; Touil and Chikouche in Acta Math Appl Sin Engl Ser 38:44–67, 2022; Touil and Chikouche in Filomat 34:3957–3969, 2020). Unlike feasible IPAs, our algorithm doesn’t require a feasible starting point. In each iteration, the new feasibility search directions are computed using the newly introduced hyperbolic KF whereas the centering search directions are obtained using the classical KF. A simple analysis for the primal-dual infeasible interior-point method (IIPM) based on the new KF shows that the iteration bound of the algorithm matches the currently best iteration bound for IIPMs. We consolidate these theoretical results by performing some numerical experiments in which we compare our algorithm with the famous SeDuMi solver. To our knowledge, this is the first full-Newton step IIPM based on a KF with a hyperbolic barrier term.},

In this paper, a multi-objective linear fractional programming problem is studied in an environment of fuzzy numbers and a solution methodology is proposed to generate an efficient solution. This solution approach first transforms the objective functions in fuzzy valued forms. Subsequently, the deterministic values of the fuzzy constraints are obtained using the centroids of fuzzy numbers. A new technique is proposed to linearize the fuzzy valued fractional functions. Fuzzy aspiration levels of the objective functions are ascertained using variable transformation method. Finally, fuzzy goal programming is used to derive the efficient solution where ranking function is implemented to defuzzify the linear fuzzy valued objective function of the final model. To demonstrate the proposed method, existing two numerical examples and one practical problem are solved and the results obtained are comparatively analysed with the existing methods which justifies its feasibility and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we introduce the notion of interval-valued picture (S, T)-fuzzy graphs (IVP-(S, T)-fuzzy graphs) which is the interplay between (S, T)-norms and picture fuzzy graphs. Interval-valued picture (S, T)-fuzzy graphs (IVP-(S, T)-fuzzy graphs) is also the extension of the picture fuzzy graphs. Since interval-valued picture fuzzy sets (IVPFSs) is the most extended form of the fuzzy sets to deal uncertainties, interval-valued picture (S, T)-fuzzy graphs (IVP-(S, T)-fuzzy graphs) would be more efficient to deal with the problems containing vagueness. For the sake of investigation, firstly we introduce and apply various operations like union, join, cartesian product, direct product, lexicographic product, ring sum, complement etc to interval-valued picture (S, T)-fuzzy graphs. Then, we study the structural properties of interval-valued picture (S, T)-fuzzy graphs (IVP-(S, T)-fuzzy graphs) through homomorphism, co-weak homomorphism, isomorphism etc. Afterwards, we initiate different types of interval-valued picture (S, T)-fuzzy graphs such as regular, total regular, constant etc. Moreover, we also explore some relationships among different types of interval-valued picture (S, T)-fuzzy graphs. Finally, we provide an application of interval-valued picture (S, T)-fuzzy graphs (IVP-(S, T)-fuzzy graphs) towards multiple attribute decision-making (MADM).},

Graphs, hypergraphs and other algebraic structures can be discussed more precisely when upper and lower approximate relations of objects are to be dealt with soft set theory. In this article, the notion of rough approximations is integrated with other algebraic structures under soft environment. Certain types of rough soft relations, rough soft graphs, rough soft (RS) hypergraphs are introduced with significant properties and results. The properties reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and their negation for RS relations are discussed in detail. RS relations are described as the Cartesian product of single and two different approximation spaces with same and distinct parametric sets. Different types of RS graphs and RS digraphs are defined using RS relations. The algebraic connectivity of certain operations of RS graphs is computed with upper and lower bounds. The notion of RS relations on sets of more than two elements is illustrated to define the structure of soft hypergraphs and RS hypergraphs. The concepts of linearity, duality, connectedness, 2-section and their relations in RS hypergraphs is demonstrated with with isomorphism properties. The importance of RS information is described with a group decision making problem for matching a list of authors to different fields.

We first define the basic reproduction number that determines disease prevalence and analyze the existence and local stability of the equilibria. Subsequently, we analyze the global dynamics of the model, excluding periodic solutions and heteroclinic orbits, using the compound matrix approach. The analysis implies that the model can undergo forward and backward bifurcations depending on critical parameters. In the former scenario, the disease persists when the basic reproduction number under resource constraints exceeds one. In the latter scenario, the backward bifurcation creates bistability dynamics in which the disease may persist or become extinct depending on the initial level of infected individuals and the resource abundance.},

The weighted adjacency matrix $$A_{f}(G)$$ of a graph G is a square matrix, where the (i, j)-entry is equal to $$\displaystyle f(d_{i}, d_{j})$$ if the vertices $$v_{i}$$ and $$v_{j}$$ are adjacent and 0 otherwise. Li and Wang (Linear Algebra Appl 620:61–75, 2021) tried to unify methods to study spectral radius of the weighted adjacency matrices of graphs weighted by various topological indices. If $$\displaystyle f&#39;_{x}(x, y)\ge 0$$ and $$\displaystyle f&#39;&#39;_{x}(x, y)\ge 0$$ , then $$\displaystyle f(x, y)$$ is said to be increasing and convex in variable x, respectively. They obtained the tree with the largest spectral radius of $$A_{f}(G)$$ is a star or a double star when f(x, y) is increasing and convex in variable x. If for any $$x_{1}+y_{1}=x_{2}+y_{2}$$ and $$\mid x_{1}-y_{1}\mid &gt;\mid x_{2}-y_{2}\mid $$ , $$f(x_{1},y_{1})&gt;f(x_{2},y_{2})$$ , then $$\displaystyle f(x, y)$$ is said to have the property P.

It contains the weighted adjacency matrices weighted by first Zagreb index, first hyper-Zagreb index, general sum-connectivity index, forgotten index, Somber index, p-Sombor index and so on. We obtain the extremal trees with the smallest and largest spectral radii, and the extremal unicyclic graphs with the smallest and first three maximum spectral radii of $$A_{f}(G)$$ .

First, we put forward a method of computing various irregularity indices of graphs by means of their main eigenvalues. This presents applications of spectral graph theory in chemistry. We find parametric conditions for which the generalized friendship graphs, the join of two regular graphs, the corona of two regular graphs and the vertex-deleted subgraph of a strongly regular graph have exactly two distinct main eigenvalues. By computing the two main eigenvalues for these classes of graphs, we determine their certain irregularity indices. Our results generalize most of the results of Réti (Appl Math Comput 344–345:107–115, 2019), in which the author studied these irregularity indices for the complete bipartite graphs, friendship graphs and complete split graphs. More importantly, we prove a conjecture proposed in Réti (Appl Math Comput 344–345:107–115, 2019) stating that the complete split-like graphs have exactly two distinct main eigenvalues. At last, we provide the QSPR analysis with regression modeling for irregularity indices with significant predictive potential.},

Secondly, the positivity, boundedness and existence of the solutions of the model are analyzed. Then, the local asymptotic stability of the rumor free equilibrium and the boundary equilibriums is proved, and the global asymptotic stability of the equilibriums is proved by constructing Lyapunov function when the time delay is zero. Besides, the prevention and control effects of the media report on rumor spreading and the effect of time delay are analyzed. The shorter time delay in media report and the greater the impact of the media report, the more effective the suppression of rumors will be. Finally, the accuracy of the theoretical results as well as the effects of different parameters of the model have been verified through numerical simulations, and the effectiveness of the SEIMR model has been verified via comparative experiments.},

The spatial derivatives are approached with a monotone hybrid finite difference scheme comprising the central difference scheme and the mid-point upwind scheme with variable weights on a layer-resolving mesh namely, the Shishkin mesh that provides a second-order accurate result upto a logarithmic factor. To overcome the obstacle of order reduction, the entire scheme is again solved on the Bakhvalov–Shishkin mesh. Thomas algorithm is used for computation.

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to introduce a two-dimensional discrete-time prey–predator, identify its fixed points, as well as investigate one- and two-parameter bifurcations. Numerical normal forms are used in bifurcation analysis. For this model, the Neimark-Sacker, period doubling and strong resonance bifurcations are observed. Based on the critical coefficients, the bifurcation scenarios can be identified. Based on numerical continuation methods, we use the MATLAB package MatContM to verify the analytical results and observe complex dynamics up to 16- iterate.},

We propose a scenario decomposition framework which incorporates subgradient computation and the incremental constraint projection steps. The decomposition of the algorithm is based on the scenario-wise separability of these computations. We analyze the convergence and local rate of convergence of the proposed method under mild conditions. This method is further applied to a class of distributionally robust two-stage stochastic programs.

  abstract     = {Spectral graph theory has been widely used in many fields, including network science, chemistry, physics, biology and sociology. Spectral extremal graph theory aims to minimize or maximize some graph invariants over a class of graphs based on graph matrix. The arithmetic–geometric matrix of a graph G, denoted by AG(G), is a square matrix whose (i, j)-entry is $$\frac{d_i+d_j}{2\sqrt{d_id_j}}$$ if $$v_i$$ and $$v_j$$ are adjacent in G, and 0 otherwise, where $$d_i$$ is the degree of vertex $$v_i$$ . The largest arithmetic–geometric eigenvalue is the AG spectral radius of G, denoted as $$\theta _1(G)$$ . In this work, we investigate the extremal values on arithmetic–geometric spectral radius of n-vertex unicyclic graphs and characterize the unicyclic graphs that achieve the extremes. We show that, for n-vertex unicyclic graph G, $$2=\theta _1(C_n)\le \theta _1(G)\le \theta _1(S_3^+),$$ where the lower bound is achieved by $$C_n$$ and the upper bound is achieved by $$S_3^+$$ which is obtained by attaching $$n-3$$ pendant vertices to some fixed vertex of $$C_3$$ .},

The partial differential equation associated with the problem is discretized using the finite difference scheme on each subdomain, while the Robin boundary conditions associated with the problem are approximated using a special finite difference scheme to maintain the accuracy. Then, an iterative algorithm is introduced, where the transmission of information to the neighbours is done using a piecewise linear interpolation. It is proved that the resulting numerical approximations are parameter-uniform and, more interestingly, that the convergence of the iterates is optimal for small values of the perturbation parameters.

Furthermore, the vaccinated population is divided into three subpopulations, each one representing a different stage. For the proposed model, we prove the mathematical and biological well-posedness. That is, the existence of a unique global almost surely positive solution. Moreover, we establish conditions under which the disease vanishes or persists. Furthermore, based on stochastic stability theory and by constructing a suitable new Lyapunov function, we provide a condition under which the model admits a non-trivial periodic solution.

  abstract     = {Nonlocal prey competition, which describes that intra-prey competition is not only dependent on a location in space but also related to entire space, is introduced to a prey–predator model involving fear effect and digest delay. In the nonlocal prey competition model, the critical delay threshold increases with the increasing of the fear level or the intra-prey competition coefficient. In addition, in the case that the intra-prey competition coefficient is less than the threshold, local and nonlocal prey competition models admit the same critical delay threshold. However, in the case that the intra-prey competition coefficient is beyond the threshold, the critical delay threshold for nonlocal prey competition is less than local prey competition. Moreover, nonlocal prey competition term can drive Hopf bifurcation for spatially inhomogeneous form, and the spatially inhomogeneous periodic solution emerges. It is worth noting that in the absence of delay, nonlocal prey competition model can undergo spatially inhomogeneous Hopf bifurcation and Turing instability by diffusion, but local prey competition can not occur. Numerical simulations verify the theoretical analysis. Also, under the influence of nonlocal effect, the amplitude of the spatially homogeneous periodic solution becomes larger. Meanwhile, nonlocal effect may increase the risk of extinction for two species to a certain extent.},

Firstly, the relevant properties of solutions for the model are studied. Then, we present sufficient conditions for extinction, persistence, and stationary distribution. Especially, the density function near positive equilibrium of model without white noise is established. Finally, based on the results of numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, it is revealed that fear effect, hunting cooperation, and white noise have indispensable influence on the dynamical behaviors of this model.},

We first present some preliminaries needed for later proof. Then, we demonstrate several theorems and their proofs. The existence of the global positive solution of the model is proved by using stochastic Lyapunov function. Furthermore, the solutions of model are stochastically ultimately bounded and permanent are also obtained and the sufficient condition for the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution is established by using Khasminskii’s theorem. Finally, the theoretical results are applied to study the target population of 24- to 65-year-old adult residents in the region of Valencia, Spain, and the influence of relevant parameters on the proportion of the three populations is further analyzed and the control strategy is explored.},

Time discretization of the equation is performed by $${L_1}$$ method. The convergence theorem for a-polynomials has been proved in this article. In three examples, four types of measurement errors have been used to confirm the accuracy of the present method and compare the results with other methods. The stability of the present method has been investigated in all examples when the input data is contaminated with noise. Considering that in each example, the optimum value of parameter a is obtained, the results are stable in noise mode.

This paper considers both the initial and boundary value problems simultaneously. The transformation of first kind to second kind is done using Leibniz rule. Fixed point theory is used to establish the existence and uniqueness of the considered equation in its second kind. Furthermore, the Adomian decomposition method is used to determine the solution to the proposed problem. We provide some examples to back up the approach. The numerical and graphical representations of the symmetry between lower and upper cut representations of the fuzzy solutions are shown using MATLAB. A graphical representation is supported to critically examine how such methods work.},

Firstly, the non-negativity and boundedness of the solutions in the system and the stability of all feasible equilibrium points of the system are strictly discussed. Hopf bifurcation induced by the disease transmission rate from the vectors to the healthy cassava is studied for the proposed system. Secondly, a novel periodic pulse feedback controller is proposed to suppress the bifurcation phenomenon. The expression of the bifurcation point of the controlled system is given with the help of the linearized average system. It is shown that the stability performance is extremely excellent with the help of the proposed controller and that the control effect is independent of pulse width. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical results.},

Such boundary value problems are ubiquitous in control theory, namely, the processing of metal sheets and the first exist time problems in modelling of activation of neuronal variability. The methods presented here are based upon the size of the shift parameter. When the shift parameters are smaller to the perturbation parameter, the shift terms are approximated by their Taylor series expansions, while for the shift parameters larger to the perturbation parameter, a special type of mesh is constructed so that the shifts lie on the nodal points after discretization. The proposed methods are checked for convergence. Also two test problems are solved with the proposed methods to demonstrate the applicability. Graphs are plotted to illustrate the effect of the shifts on the solution of the problems.},

The first iterative method is shown to always converge weakly to an element in the solution set of the Hammerstein equation if this solution set is nonempty. The second iterative method is a modification of the first method to upgrade weak convergence to strong convergence. Convergence results are obtained without requiring the maps to be bounded. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the convergence of one of these methods. Comparisons with some existing methods show that the method is cost effective in terms of the number of iterations required to obtain a solution and the computational time.},

The proposed regularization term offers an ideal compromise between feature preservation, avoidance of staircasing and the loss of image contrasts. This model can outperform the high order regularization models and also the total fractional-order variation model. Also, we rigorously analyse the theoretical properties of the fractional derivative and show the existence and uniqueness of the proposed minimization problem in a suitable functional framework. In addition, to solve the variational problem, we consider the primal-dual projected gradient algorithm.

  abstract     = {This paper considers a class of difference-of-convex (DC) optimization problems, whose objective function is the sum of a convex smooth function and a possibly nonsmooth DC function. We first propose a new extrapolated proximal difference-of-convex algorithm, which incorporates a more general setting of the extrapolation parameters $${\beta _k}$$ . Then we prove the subsequential convergence of the proposed method to a stationary point of the DC problem. Based on the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz inequality, the global convergence and convergence rate of the whole sequence generated by our method have been established. Finally, some numerical experiments on the DC regularized least squares problems have been performed to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a study of singularly perturbed parabolic convection–diffusion problems with delay. The solution of the problem exhibits a weak interior layer and a strong boundary layer. In these layers, the physical variable changes rapidly over small domains in space and in a short time interval. The solution reveals a multiscale character, which adds stiffness to the problem. We present a second-order accurate difference approximation based on the defect correction method to capture this multiscale phenomenon. The problem is discretized by an implicit Euler scheme in time variable on a uniform mesh and a defect correction method consisting of the upwind scheme and the central difference scheme in space variable on a layer-adapted mesh in such a way that it captures the interior as well as the boundary layers. The proposed method is not only free from directional bias but unconditionally stable and converges uniformly. Test examples and numerical results verify the theoretical predictions and illustrate the efficiency of the method.},

The enhanced hypercube $$Q_{n,k}$$ is an important variant of the hypercube $$Q_n$$ that retains many desirable properties of the hypercube. In order to study its fault tolerance, we consider the problem of embedding internally disjoint paths in an enhanced hypercube when part of the network is faulty.

In this paper, we propose a dual-primal version of the newly developed balanced ALM, which updates the new iterate via a conversely dual-primal iterative order formally. The new algorithm inherits all advantages of the prototype balanced ALM, and it can be extended to more general separable convex programming problems with both linear equality and inequality constraints. The convergence analysis of the proposed method can be well conducted in the context of variational inequalities. In particular, by some application problems, we numerically validate that these balanced ALM type methods can outperform existing algorithms of the same kind significantly.},

The fourth order method uses the composition technique by combining Newton–Steffensen method and Zhou method while the three-step eighth order method uses the Newton–Steffensen–Zhou method with weight functions. The two main theorems fully discuss the convergence criteria of the proposed methods. Numerical experiments are carried out extensively to demonstrate the good performance and effectiveness of our proposed methods by comparing with some existing methods on some test functions.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop and analyze a hybrid Riemannian conjugate gradient (CG) method to the problem of minimizing a smooth objective function on a Riemannian manifold, based on a Riemannian generalization of the hybrid formula created by Jian et al. (Appl. Math. Model. 39: 1281-1290, 2015) in Euclidean space. This method can produce descent directions independent of any stepsize strategy on Riemannian manifolds. Moreover, under the Riemannian Wolfe conditions, the proposed method is proved to be globally convergent without assuming the objective function to be convex. Finally, the new method is compared numerically with the existing methods for solving some large-scale optimization problems on different manifolds. Numerical experiments and their performance profiles are reported, which show that the proposed methods are efficient.},

  abstract     = {Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers among women globally, with more than three quarters of its global burden occurring in developing countries and one of the most common cancer among Indian women. Cervical cancer cases (more than 95\%) are linked to infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV). HPV is mostly transmitted through sexual contact, and majority become infected with HPV shortly after sexual activity begins. This paper develops a mathematical model for HPV transmission and its impact on cervical cancer. The basic properties of the system are discussed in detail. Using the next-generation matrix method, we obtain the basic reproduction number and prove that the disease-free and endemic equilibrium are globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. Numerical solutions of the proposed model are carried out using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method to demonstrate our theoretical results.The developed model is applied to reported data of women HPV transmission from 2016 to 2020 obtained from the HPV Information center and Indian Council of Medical Research. From the data, we estimate parameter values and identify the key parameters that influence transmission via sensitivity analysis for this model. The simulation results match the HPV epidemic data in India approximately.},

The first order fractional convolution quadrature scheme and backward Euler (BE) alternating direction implicit (ADI) method, are proposed to approximate and discretize the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) fractional integral term and temporal derivative, respectively. In order to obtain a fully discrete method, the standard central finite difference approximation is used to discretize the second-order spatial derivative. By using ADI scheme for the three-dimensional problem, the overall computational cost is reduced significantly. Two new approaches are adopted for theoretical stability analysis. The convergence behaviour of the proposed method is provided and the error bounds are proved. In addition, two test problems illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the methods.

It is shown that the system can undergo fold bifurcation and flip bifurcation by using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the feasibility of the main results and the influence of Allee effect on the stability of the system. Our study indicates that other food resources for the predator can enrich the dynamical behaviours of the system, including cascades of period-doubling bifurcation in orbits of period-2, 4, 8, and chaotic sets.},

Their fast convergence and exceptional precision distinguish the quasi-Newton methods. We propose a modified secant relation based on a quadratic model to better approximate the objective function’s second curvature. We then provide a new BFGS method for resolving unconstrained optimization problems based on this modified secant relationship. The proposed method uses both gradient and function values, while the usual Secant relation uses only gradient values. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the proposed method is globally convergent without needing any convexity assumption on the objective function. Comparative results show the computational efficiency of the proposed method from the iteration count and function/gradient evaluations perspective.},

The first attempt is about the qualitative study of the considered problem along with the existing result and the derivation of the unique solution by the application of the fixed point theory. Secondly, for the semi-analytical solution of the smoking model, a very famous technique of the Generalized Adams–Bashforth Moulton method is used. Numerical simulation for different integer and non-integer order laying between (0, 1) has been drawn using Matlab. For different initial data, the result of simulation depicts the solution of the considered model is stable and shows the convergence of a single point.

The national rail network comprised 126,366 km of track over a route of 67,368 km and 7,325 stations. It is the fourth-largest national railway network globally after the United States, Russia and China. But with the passage, they pose a threat to the general public while travelling, being the instances of crimes rising fourfold in rails. The ongoing railway crime has become a cause of concern for the common passenger now. In this article, F-index for fuzzy graphs is used to analyze the railway crimes in India and compared with three other topological indices. F-index for fuzzy graphs and the first Zagreb index for fuzzy graphs provide similar results whereas F-index for fuzzy graphs provides better realistic results than F-index for crisp graphs and first Zagreb index for crisp graphs to detect the crime in Indian railway. Also, this index is studied for several operations such as Cartesian product, composition, union and join of two fuzzy graphs. Some interesting relations of F-index are established during fuzzy graph transformations. Using those transformation, it is shown that n-vertex star has maximum F-index among the n-vertex trees. Also, maximal n-vertex unicyclic fuzzy graph having r cycle is determined with respect to F-index.},

Primarily, we define information system for a Pythagorean fuzzy soft set and its transformation to the information system of another Pythagorean fuzzy soft set. Additionally, we obtain Pythagorean fuzzy soft information system for a Pythagorean fuzzy soft graph which is a parameterized family of Pythagorean fuzzy information systems. The concepts of reduct, core, extended core and discernibility matrix are investigated on the basis of Pythagorean fuzzy soft indiscernibility relation. These notions are illustrated in detail through examples and results. The method for the construction of Pythagorean fuzzy soft granules in a soft graph is elaborated with the help of an example.

In this approach, first using the Laplace transform, fractional-order Lagrange polynomials operational matrices of fractional integration have been derived. Then using these operational matrices, the continuous problem has been reduced into a system of algebraic equations. The error analysis also has been carried out and an upper error bound estimate for the approximate solution has been given in $$L^2$$ -norm. It is also shown that as the number of fractional-order Lagrange polynomials increases, the approximation error approaches to zero rapidly. Further, some numerical examples are discussed to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed numerical technique and to validate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a mathematical model for HTLV-I infection by considering the role of imprecise essence of the biological parameters. The considered imprecise biologically realistic parameters are taken as a form of triangular fuzzy number. Then the imprecise parameters are transformed to the associated intervals and then with the aid of interval mathematics the corresponding differential equations is changed to two equations. Next, by utilizing utility function method the transformed differential equations is converted to a differential equation. The dynamics of fuzzy HTLV-I model is studied with the help of the utility function method. We explored the qualitative features of HTLV-I model including positivity, boundedness, uniform persistence and biologically feasible equilibrium points, namely disease-free equilibrium point, HTLV-I free steady state and an interior equilibrium point. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that local and global stability are examined by two critical parameters $$R_0$$ and $$R_1$$ , basic reproduction numbers due to viral infection and for cytotoxic-T-lymphocytes response, respectively. By using geometric approach, we performed global stability of the endemic equilibrium point which is not only theoretically significant but also important in forecasting the development of HTLV-I infection in the long-run so that involvement strategies can be effectively sketched. Some numerical illustrations are presented to support our theoretical analysis under imprecise biological parameters.},

Sterile mosquitoes are introduced to suppress the development of wild mosquito populations and a special function $$M_s(t)$$ is used as a control function to describe the number of sterile mosquitoes in the field. Firstly, the dynamic behaviors of the system when the control function is a constant function, a general continuous function and a periodic pulse function are analyzed theoretically, and the existence and stability of the equilibria of the system are determined. In particular, the conditions for the global stability of the wild mosquito-extinction equilibrium, that is, the conditions for the successful suppression of wild mosquitoes, are found. Then, a series of numerical simulations are carried out which on the one hand verify the theoretical results obtained, and on the other hand supplement the imperfections of the theoretical study. Finally, a brief conclusion is given, and the focus of further research is pointed out.},

  abstract     = {Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that most commonly affects the lungs. Due to its high mortality, it remains a global health issue, and it is one of the leading causes of death in the majority of sub-Saharan African countries. We formulate a six-compartmental deterministic model to investigate the impact of vaccination on the dynamics of tuberculosis in a given population. The qualitative behaviors of the presented model were examined, and the respective threshold quantity was obtained. The tuberculosis-free equilibrium of the system is said to be locally asymptotically stable when the effective reproduction number $$\mathcal {R}_{0}&lt;1$$ and unstable otherwise. Furthermore, we examined the stability of the endemic equilibrium, and the conditions for the existence of backward bifurcation are discussed. A numerical simulation was performed to demonstrate and support the theoretical findings. The result shows that reducing the effective contact with an infected person and enhancing the rate of vaccinating susceptible individuals with high vaccine efficacy will reduce the burden of tuberculosis in the population.},

The primary goal is to minimize operational expenses, which include inventory and shortages, interfaces, and labor. Consideration is given to batch sizing limits, inventory carrying costs, backlog, and settlement periods. Additionally, certain parameters have been classified as having the belief degree-based type of uncertainty due to a lack of relevant historical data. As solution strategies, three separate conversion approaches are used. The model&#39;s efficiency and dependability, as well as the proposed methodologies, are demonstrated numerically. Sensitivity analysis shows that objective function values are highly dependent on changes in confidence levels, so the best technique is implemented.},
