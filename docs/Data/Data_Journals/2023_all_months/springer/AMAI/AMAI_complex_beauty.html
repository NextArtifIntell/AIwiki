We prove that the conjectured configurations are local optimal, and construct a rectangular neighborhood of the local maximum point in the related feasible set, whose size is explicitly determined, and prove that (1): the objective function is bounded by a quadratic polynomial which takes the local maximum point as the unique critical point in the neighborhood, and (2): the remaining part of the feasible set can be partitioned into a finite union of a large number of very small cubes so that on each small cube, the conjecture can be verified by estimating the objective function with exact numerical computation. We also explain the method for constructing the neighborhoods and upper-bound quadratic polynomials in detail and describe the computation process outside the constructed neighborhoods briefly.},

Efficiency in the management of the inference rules, the set of already known facts and the new facts discovered, by the use of the efficient data manipulation techniques of the SQL library. Flexibility, by transforming the inference rules in SQL data manipulation language queries, will open the possibility of meta-development of GATP based on a provided set of rules.

In a system which is not full rank, one bisector condition can be derived from the others. In that paper, we describe methods for finding such rank deficient linear systems. The vector angle bisector relationship may be interpreted geometrically in a number of ways: as an angle bisector, as a reflection, as an isosceles triangle, or as a circle chord. A rank deficient linear system may be interpreted as a geometry theorem by mapping each vector angle bisector relationship onto one of these geometrical representations. In Todd (Submitted to AMAI, 2022) we illustrate the step from linear system to geometry theorem with a number of by-hand constructed examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm which automatically generates a geometry theorem from a starting point of a linear system of the type identified in Todd (Submitted to AMAI, 2022). Both statement and diagram of the new theorem are generated by the algorithm. Our implementation creates a simple text description of the new theorem and utilizes the Mathematica GeometricScene to form a diagram.},

Some such matrices can be represented as graphs whose vertices correspond to matrix rows and whose edges correspond to matrix columns. We show that if a bisector matrix which can be represented as a graph is rank deficient, then the graph is bicubic. We give an algorithm for finding the rank deficient matrices for a Hamiltonian bicubic graph, and report on the results for graphs with 6,8,10 and 12 vertices.

  abstract     = {Deciphering gene regulatory networks’ functioning is an essential step for better understanding of life, as these networks play a fundamental role in the control of cellular processes. Boolean networks have been widely used to represent gene regulatory networks. They allow to describe the dynamics of complex gene regulatory networks straightforwardly and efficiently. The attractors are essential in the analysis of the dynamics of a Boolean network. They explain that a particular cell can acquire specific phenotypes that may be transmitted over several generations. In this work, we consider a new representation of Boolean networks’ dynamics based on a new semantics used in Answer Set Programming (ASP). We use logic programs and ASP to express and deal with gene regulatory networks seen as Boolean networks, and develop a method to detect all the attractors of such networks. We first show how to represent and deal with general Boolean networks for the synchronous and asynchronous updates modes, where the computation of attractors requires a simulation of these networks’ dynamics. Then, we propose an approach for the particular case of circular networks where no simulation is needed. This last specific case plays an essential role in biological systems. We show several theoretical properties; in particular, simple attractors of the gene networks are represented by the stable models of the corresponding logic programs and cyclic attractors by its extra-stable models. These extra-stable models correspond to the extra-extensions of the new semantics that are not captured by the semantics of stable models. We then evaluate the proposed approach for general Boolean networks on real biological networks and the one dedicated to the case of circular networks on Boolean networks generated randomly. The obtained results for both approaches are encouraging.},

On the other hand, for any implicational system $$\Sigma $$ over the set of arguments, we associate an argumentation framework whose admissible sets are in bijection with closed sets of $$\Sigma $$ . Second, we propose conflict-closed sets reduction rules, based on implicational system, to find out minimal subsets of vertex cover closed while maintaining all potential admissible extensions as well as preferred extensions. This leads to a polynomial delay and space algorithm to enumerate admissible sets of argumentation frameworks without even cycles. Finally, based on the implicational system, a new decomposition of the argumentation framework is defined and leads to a polynomial delay and space algorithm to enumerate admissible sets for a bipartite argumentation framework. The proposed algorithm improves the exponential space complexity of previous algorithms.},

It allows the incorporation of prior knowledge, as probabilistic distributions, into the algorithms. Finding the resulting Bayes-optimal policies is notorious problem. We focus our attention on RL of a special kind of ergodic and controllable Markov games. We propose a new framework for computing the near-optimal policies for each agent, where it is assumed that the Markov chains are regular and the inverse of the behavior strategy is well defined. A fundamental result of this paper is the development of a theoretical method that, based on the formulation of a non-linear problem, computes the near-optimal adaptive-behavior strategies and policies of the game under some restrictions that maximize the expected reward. We prove that such behavior strategies and the policies satisfy the Bayesian-Nash equilibrium. Another important result is that the RL process learn a model through the interaction of the agents with the environment, and shows how the proposed method can finitely approximate and estimate the elements of the transition matrices and utilities maintaining an efficient long-term learning performance measure. We develop the algorithm for implementing this model. A numerical empirical example shows how to deploy the estimation process as a function of agent experiences.},

  abstract     = {Cyclic induction is a powerful reasoning technique that consists in blocking the proof development of certain subgoals already encountered during the proof process. In the setting of first-order logic with inductive definitions and equality (FOLID), cyclic proofs can be built automatically by the Cyclist prover, but their implementations are error-prone and the human validation may be tedious. On the other hand, cyclic induction is not yet integrated into certifying proof environments that support first-order logic and inductive definitions, such as Isabelle and Coq. We propose a solution to check, using Coq, the cyclic proofs produced by E-Cyclist, an extension of Cyclist that implements a more efficient soundness validation method, by using the general Noetherian induction principle integrated into Coq. Our work is based on a methodology for certifying first-order formula-based Noetherian induction proofs, such as those based on implicit induction. The advantages of our approach are threefold: - I) The certification of cyclic FOLID proofs is mechanical. Coq can validate every single step from the E-Cyclist proofs, as well as the induction arguments; also, it helps to identify errors in a very precise way. - II) There is a great potential for automation. The methodology has already been used to automatically convert to Coq scripts implicit induction proofs. - III) Cyclic induction can be directly performed in Coq. Coq functions are provided to manage the induction part.},

  abstract     = {For the precision calculations in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) gigantic expressions (several GB in size) in terms of highly complicated divergent multi-loop Feynman integrals have to be calculated analytically to compact expressions in terms of special functions and constants. In this article we derive new symbolic tools to gain large-scale computer understanding in QCD. Here we exploit the fact that hypergeometric structures in single and multiscale Feynman integrals emerge in a wide class of topologies. Using integration-by-parts relations, associated master or scalar integrals have to be calculated. For this purpose it appears useful to devise an automated method which recognizes the respective (partial) differential equations related to the corresponding higher transcendental functions. We solve these equations through associated recursions of the expansion coefficient of the multivalued formal Taylor series. The expansion coefficients can be determined using either the package Sigma in the case of linear difference equations or by applying heuristic methods in the case of partial linear difference equations. In the present context a new type of sums occurs, the Hurwitz harmonic sums, and generalized versions of them. The code HypSeries transforming classes of differential equations into analytic series expansions is described. Also partial difference equations having rational solutions and rational function solutions of Pochhammer symbols are considered, for which the code solvePartialLDE is designed. Generalized hypergeometric functions, Appell-, Kampé de Fériet-, Horn-, Lauricella-Saran-, Srivasta-, and Exton–type functions are considered. We illustrate the algorithms by examples.},

  abstract     = {In this note, I present my personal view on the interaction of the three areas Automated Programming, Symbolic Computation, and Machine Learning. Programming is the activity of finding a (hopefully) correct program (algorithm) for a given problem. Programming is central to automation in all areas and is considered one of the most creative human activities. However, already very early in the history of programming, people started to “jump to the meta-level” of programming, i.e., started to develop procedures that automate, or semi-automate, (various aspects or parts of) the process of programming. This area has various names like “Automated Programming”, “Automated Algorithm Synthesis”, etc. Developing compilers can be considered an early example of a problem in automated programming. Automated reasoners for proving the correctness of programs with respect to a specification is an advanced example of a topic in automated programming. ChatGPT producing (amazingly good) programs from problem specifications in natural language is a recent example of automated programming. Programming tends to become the most important activity as the level of technological sophistication increases. Therefore, automating programming is maybe the most exciting and relevant technological endeavor today. It also will have enormous impact on the global job market in the software industry. Roughly, I see two main approaches to automated programming: In this note, I explain how the two approaches work and that they are fundamentally different because they address two completely different ways of how problems are specified. Together, the two approaches constitute (part of) what some people like to call “artificial intelligence”. In my analysis, both approaches are just part of (algorithmic) mathematics. The approaches, like all non-trivial mathematical methods, need quite some intelligence on the side of the human inventors of the methods. However, applying the methods is just “machine execution” of algorithms. It is misleading to call the application “machine intelligence” or “artificial intelligence”. The analysis of the two approaches to automated programming also suggests that the two approaches, in the future, should be combined to achieve even higher levels of sophistication. At the end of this note, I propose some research questions for this new direction.},

The asymptotes of a curve $$\mathscr {C}$$ reflect the status of $$\mathscr {C}$$ at points with sufficiently large coordinates. It is well known that an asymptote of a curve $$\mathscr {C}$$ is a line such that the distance between $$\mathscr {C}$$ and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. However, a curve $$\mathscr {C}$$ may have more general curves than lines describing the status of $$\mathscr {C}$$ at infinity. These curves are known as g-asymptotes or generalized asymptotes. The pseudocodes of these algorithms are presented, as well as the corresponding implementations. For this purpose, we use the algebra software Maple. A comparative analysis of the algorithms is carried out, based on some properties of the input curves and their results to analyze the efficiency of the algorithms and to establish comparative criteria. The results presented in this paper are a starting point to generalize this study to surfaces or to curves defined by a non-rational parametrization, as well as to improve the efficiency of the algorithms. Additionally, the methods developed can provide a new and different approach in prediction (regression) or classification algorithms in the machine learning field.},

  abstract     = {The Bipolar Argumentation Framework approach is an extension of the Abstract Argumentation Framework. A Bipolar Argumentation Framework considers a support interaction between arguments, besides the attack interaction. As in the Abstract Argumentation Framework, some researches consider that arguments have a degree of uncertainty, which impacts on the degree of uncertainty of the extensions obtained from a Bipolar Argumentation Framework under a semantics. In these approaches, both the uncertainty of the arguments and of the extensions are modeled by means of precise probability values. However, in many real application domains there is a need for aggregating probability values from different sources so it is not suitable to aggregate such probability values in a unique probability distribution. To tackle this challenge, we use credal networks theory for modelling the uncertainty of the degree of belief of arguments in a BAF. We also propose an algorithm for calculating the degree of uncertainty of the extensions inferred by a given argumentation semantics. Moreover, we introduce the idea of modelling the support relation as a causal relation. We formally show that the introduced approach is sound and complete w.r.t the credal networks theory.},

  abstract     = {In a 2003-article, Sven Ove Hansson discusses the justificatory structure of a belief base, by highlighting that some beliefs of the belief base are held only because they are (deductively) justified by some other beliefs. He concludes that the relation between the justificatory structure of a belief base and the vulnerability of its beliefs (which in turn reflects their resistance to change) remains an open issue, both on a conceptual and on a technical level. Motivated by Hanssons’ remarks, we introduce in this article a new interesting type of change-operation, called deductive belief change (contraction and revision), and abbreviated as DBC. DBC associates in a natural manner the deductive justification that the logical sentences of the language have, in the context of a belief base B, with their vulnerability relative to B. According to DBC, the more explicit B-beliefs imply a sentence φ, the more resistant to change φ is, with respect to B. We characterize DBC both axiomatically, in terms of natural postulates, and constructively, in terms of kernel belief change, illustrating its simple and intuitive structure. Interestingly enough, as we prove, kernel belief change (and its central specialization partial-meet belief change) already encodes a strong coupling between justificatory structure and vulnerability, as it implements DBC. Furthermore, we show that deductive belief revision, properly adapted to the belief-sets realm, is indistinguishable from Parikh’s relevance-sensitive revision, a fundamental type of revision which, due to its favourable properties, constitutes a promising candidate for a variety of real-world applications. As a last contribution, we study relevance in the context of belief bases, and prove that kernel belief change respects Parikh’s notion of relevance.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in machine learning have highlighted the importance of using group equivariant non-expansive operators for building neural networks in a more transparent and interpretable way. An operator is called equivariant with respect to a group if the action of the group commutes with the operator. Group equivariant non-expansive operators can be seen as multi-level components that can be joined and connected in order to form neural networks by applying the operations of chaining, convex combination and direct product. In this paper we prove that each linear G-equivariant non-expansive operator (GENEO) can be produced by a weighted summation associated with a suitable permutant measure, provided that the group G transitively acts on a finite signal domain. This result is based on the Birkhoff–von Neumann decomposition of doubly stochastic matrices and some well known facts in group theory. Our theorem makes available a new method to build all linear GENEOs with respect to a transitively acting group in the finite setting. This work is part of the research devoted to develop a good mathematical theory of GENEOs, seen as relevant components in machine learning.},

Public signature awareness is satisfied if agents are aware of the vocabularies, or signatures, used by all agents they may, eventually, interact with. Multi-agent modal logics and in particular Dynamic Epistemic Logic rely on public signature awareness for modeling information flow in multi-agent systems. However, this assumption is not desirable for dynamic and open multi-agent systems because (1) it prevents agents to use unique signatures other agents are unaware of, (2) it prevents agents to openly extend their signatures when encountering new information, and (3) it requires that all future knowledge and beliefs of agents are bounded by the current state. We propose a new semantics for awareness that enables us to drop public signature awareness. This semantics is based on partial valuation functions and weakly reflexive relations. Dynamics for raising public and private awareness are then defined in such a way as to differentiate between becoming aware of a proposition and learning its truth value. With this, we show that knowledge and beliefs are not affected through the raising operations.},

  abstract     = {Rational verification refers to the problem of checking which temporal logic properties hold of a concurrent/multiagent system, under the assumption that agents in the system choose strategies that form a game theoretic equilibrium. Rational verification can be understood as a counterpart to model checking for multiagent systems, but while classical model checking can be done in polynomial time for some temporal logic specification languages such as CTL, and polynomial space with LTL specifications, rational verification is much harder: the key decision problems for rational verification are 2EXPTIME-complete with LTL specifications, even when using explicit-state system representations. Against this background, our contributions in this paper are threefold. First, we show that the complexity of rational verification can be greatly reduced by restricting specifications to GR(1), a fragment of LTL that can represent a broad and practically useful class of response properties of reactive systems. In particular, we show that for a number of relevant settings, rational verification can be done in polynomial space and even in polynomial time. Second, we provide improved complexity results for rational verification when considering players’ goals given by mean-payoff utility functions—arguably the most widely used approach for quantitative objectives in concurrent and multiagent systems. Finally, we consider the problem of computing outcomes that satisfy social welfare constraints. To this end, we consider both utilitarian and egalitarian social welfare and show that computing such outcomes is either PSPACE-complete or NP-complete.},

We study the Interpolation rule and position it in the landscape of non-normal modal logics. We show that it, in combination with basic axioms, gives us a complete characterisation of the properties of the secretly knowing modalities under weak assumptions about the properties of individual knowledge, in the form of a sound and complete axiomatisation.

The purpose of the studied problem is to get an approximately optimal schedule that reaches the minimum workload for physicians on the premise of satisfying the service requirements of patients as much as possible. We propose a novel hybrid algorithm integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) and variable neighborhood descent (VND) (named as PSO-VND) to find the approximate global optimal solution. A self-adaptive mechanism is developed to choose the updating operators dynamically during the procedures. Based on the special features of the problem, three neighborhood structures are designed and searched in VND to improve the solution.

In particular, congestion control in modern networks seems to be impossible without proper mathematical models of traffic flow assignment. Thus, the network design problem can be referred to as Stackelberg game with independent lower-level drivers acting in a non-cooperative manner to minimize individual costs. In turn, upper-level decision-maker seeks to minimize overall travel time in the network by investing in its capacity. Hence, the decision-maker faces the challenge with a hierarchical structure which solution important due to its influence on the sustainable development of modern large cities. However, it is well-known that a bilevel programming problem is often strongly NP-hard, while the hierarchical optimization structure of a bilevel problem raises such difficulties as non-convexity and discontinuity. The present paper is devoted to the network design problem with affine cost functions. First of all, we obtain exact optimality conditions to the network design problem in a case of a single-commodity network with non-interfering routes. Secondly, we show that obtained conditions can be exploited as optimization strategies for solving the network design problem in the case of an arbitrary network with affine cost functions. These findings give fresh managerial insights to traffic engineers dealing with network design.},

  abstract     = {Sensitivity analysis in general deals with the question of how changes in input data of a model affect its output data. In the context of optimization problems, such an analysis could, for instance, address how changes in capacity constraints affect the optimal solution value. Although well established in the domain of linear programming, sensitivity analysis approaches for combinatorial optimization problems are model-specific, limited in scope and not applicable to practical optimization problems. To overcome these limitations, Schulte et al. developed the concept of bilevel innovization. By using evolutionary bilevel optimization in combination with data mining and visualization techniques, bilevel innovization provides decision-makers with deeper insights into the behavior of the optimization model and supports decision-making related to model building and configuration. Originally introduced in the field of evolutionary computation, most recently bilevel innovization has been proposed as an approach to sensitivity analysis for combinatorial problems in general. Based on previous work on bilevel innovization, our paper illustrates this concept as a tool for sensitivity analysis by providing a comprehensive analysis of the generalized assignment problem. Furthermore, it is investigated how different algorithms for solving the combinatorial problem affect the insights gained by the sensitivity analysis, thus evaluating the robustness and reliability of the sensitivity analysis results.},

  abstract     = {One category of vehicle routing problems involving groups of people where there can be multiple possible drop-off locations is the School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP). In this paper, we investigate a form of SBRP where each passenger has a well-ordered set of preferred stops, e.g., the preferences can be based on the distance to their destination. The passengers continue their journey from the stop to their destination by an alternative mode, such as walking. Different drop-off choices allow for a different set of passengers to be dropped off together, affecting the total vehicle driving distance. As the transport provider and passengers have their own objectives, inevitably, there are two opposing goals (tradeoff aspects), reducing total driving distance versus passenger walking distance. Unlike typical SBRP, we focus on practical problems where the set of passengers is not known well in advance and there is only a short time window to compute a solution (a real-time requirement). Hence, runtime efficiency is more important than optimality. We introduce this variant as SBRP-RT, a school bus routing problem with tradeoff aspects and real-time requirements. We propose a model with an efficient greedy local search for such problems, and demonstrate the efficacy with experiments on real-world datasets with quick solving that balances tradeoffs.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a parallel machine scheduling problem with linearly increasing energy consumption cost. Maintenance activities are considered in the problem. After maintenance, the machine energy consumption cost returns to the normal level. Thus, an important decision is how to determine a reasonable number of maintenance activities to enable a significant tradeoff between the maintenance cost and the energy consumption cost. We define the jobs processed between two adjacent maintenance activities as a batch since the job processing cannot be interrupted. A further decision is how to batch the jobs. To solve the investigated problem, we first study a special case where there is only one single machine. A heuristic approach is proposed to solve the single machine scheduling problem. Then, we present a variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm for general cases, where the heuristic approach for the single machine case is intergrated. Extensive computational experiments are conducted and the results show that the proposed VNS algorithm is superior to artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, Tabu search (TS)algorithm, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The key contribution of this paper is a theoretical framework to analyse humans’ decision-making strategies under uncertainty, and more specifically how human subjects manage the trade-off between information gathering (exploration) and reward seeking (exploitation) in particular active learning in a black-box optimization task. Humans’ decisions making according to these two objectives can be modelled in terms of Pareto rationality. If a decision set contains a Pareto efficient (dominant) strategy, a rational decision maker should always select the dominant strategy over its dominated alternatives. A distance from the Pareto frontier determines whether a choice is (Pareto) rational. The key element in the proposed analytical framework is the representation of behavioural patterns of human learners as a discrete probability distribution, specifically a histogram considered as a non-parametric estimate of discrete probability density function on the real line. Thus, the similarity between users can be captured by a distance between their associated histograms. This maps the problem of the characterization of humans’ behaviour into a space, whose elements are probability distributions, structured by a distance between histograms, namely the optimal transport-based Wasserstein distance. The distributional analysis gives new insights into human behaviour in search tasks and their deviations from Pareto rationality. Since the uncertainty is one of the two objectives defining the Pareto frontier, the analysis has been performed for three different uncertainty quantification measures to identify which better explains the Pareto compliant behavioural patterns. Beside the analysis of individual patterns Wasserstein has also enabled a global analysis computing the WST barycenters and performing k-means Wasserstein clustering.},

  abstract     = {Human Learning Optimization (HLO) is a simple yet efficient binary meta-heuristic, in which three learning operators, i.e. the random learning operator (RLO), individual learning operator (ILO) and social learning operator (SLO), are developed to mimic human learning mechanisms to solve optimization problems. Among these three operators, RLO directly influences the exploration and exploitation abilities of HLO, and therefore its control parameter pr is of great importance since it controls the balance between exploration and exploitation. In this paper, an adaptive human learning optimization with enhanced exploration-exploitation balance (AHLOee) is proposed to improve the performance of HLO, in which a new adaptive pr strategy is carefully designed to meet the different requirements of HLO at different stages of iterations. A comprehensive parameter study is performed to evaluate the influences of the proposed adaptive strategy on exploration and exploitation, and then the deep insights on the role of RLO and the reason why the proposed adaptive strategy can achieve a practically ideal trade-off between exploration and exploitation are provided. The experimental results on the CEC05 and CEC15 benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed AHLOee has advantages over previous HLO variants and outperforms recent state-of-art binary meta-heuristics.},

  abstract     = {In most urban cities, the correct design of the bus routes network is a critical task to design a successful transportation system. Thus, network designers rely on solving the Urban Transit Routing Problem (UTRP) to find a set of bus routes that minimises users travelling time and system operator costs. Most UTRP instances lack real-life demand data information, are very small w.r.t. typical scenarios or standards, or are randomly generated. Moreover, state-of-the-art dimensional reduction techniques use inherent features of urban transportation systems; therefore, they cannot significantly reduce the order of magnitude in complex cases. This article proposes a framework for generating UTRP instances that shrink the complexity of substantial real-life scenarios through well-known clustering algorithms and geographic database applications. The generated instances preserve the original demand behaviour and road structure by connecting central and periphery locations. We discuss and validate this proposal by applying it in a complex study case, the RED system from Santiago of Chile.},

However, the relationship between tuning parameters and performance is complicated and non-intuitive, having no explicit algebraic description. This is true particularly for programs such as GPU applications and compiler tuning, both of which have discrete and often nonlinear interactions between parameters and performance. After assessing a few alternative algorithmic configurations, we present two hybrid derivative-free optimization (DFO) approaches to maximize the performance of an algorithm. We demonstrate how we use our method to solve problems with up to 50 hyperparameters. When compared to state-of-the-art autotuners, our autotuner (a) reduces the execution time of dense matrix multiplication by a factor of 1.4x, (b) identifies high-quality tuning parameters in only 5\% of the computational effort required by other autotuners, and (c) can be applied to any computer architecture. Our implementations of Bandit DFO and Hybrid DFO are publicly available at https://github.com/bsauk/HybridTuner .},

In this paper, we improve the $ \mathfrak {U} $ -TSVM method and propose an improved Universum twin bounded support vector machine (named as IUTBSVM). Indeed, by introducing different Lagrangian functions for the primal problems, we obtain new dual formulations of $ \mathfrak {U} $ -TSVM so that we do not need to compute inverse matrices. To reduce the computational time of the proposed method, we suggest a smaller size of the rectangular kernel matrices than the other methods. Numerical experiments on gender classification of human faces, handwritten digits recognition, and several UCI benchmark data sets indicate that the IUTBSVM is more efficient than the other four algorithms, namely $\mathfrak {U}$ -SVM, TSVM, $\mathfrak {U}$ -TSVM, and IUTSVM in the sense of the classification accuracy.},

From the perspective of systems/knowledge evolving, one may want to discard some atoms (elements) that become irrelevant or unnecessary in a specification; one may also need to know what makes something true, or the minimal condition under which something holds. This paper aims to address these scenarios for μ-calculus in terms of knowledge forgetting. In particular, it proposes a notion of forgetting based on a generalized bisimulation and explores the semantic and logical properties of forgetting, including some reasoning complexity results.
