  abstract     = {Every year, wildfires accentuated by global warming, cause economic and ecological losses, and often, human casualties. Increasing operational capacity of firefighter crews is of utmost importance to better face the forest fire period that yearly occurs. In this study, we investigate the real-world firefighters timetabling problem of the INFOCA institution, Andalusia (Spain). The main issue is to achieve maximum operational capability while taking into account work regulation constraints. This paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation that makes it feasible to solve small/medium instances to optimality. We put forward a matheuristic (ILPH) based on the ILP formulation, and we obtain solutions for larger instances. We propose an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search metaheuristic (ALNS) to obtain better results for larger instances and we use a version of the ILPH as one of the constructive methods. The ALNS obtains all the optimal solutions found by the ILP on small instances. It yields better solutions than the ILPH matheuristic on larger instances within shorter processing times. We report on experiments performed on datasets generated using real-world data of the INFOCA institution. The work was initiated as part of the GEO-SAFE project.},

  abstract     = {A travelling thief problem (TTP) is a proxy to real-life problems such as postal collection. TTP comprises an entanglement of a travelling salesman problem (TSP) and a knapsack problem (KP) since items of KP are scattered over cities of TSP, and a thief has to visit cities to collect items. In TTP, city selection and item selection decisions need close coordination since the thief’s travelling speed depends on the knapsack’s weight and the order of visiting cities affects the order of item collection. Existing TTP solvers deal with city selection and item selection separately, keeping decisions for one type unchanged while dealing with the other type. This separation essentially means very poor coordination between two types of decision. In this paper, we first show that a simple local search based coordination approach does not work in TTP. Then, to address the aforementioned problems, we propose a human designed coordination heuristic that makes changes to collection plans during exploration of cyclic tours. We further propose another human designed coordination heuristic that explicitly exploits the cyclic tours in item selections during collection plan exploration. Lastly, we propose a machine learning based coordination heuristic that captures characteristics of the two human designed coordination heuristics. Our proposed coordination based approaches help our TTP solver significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art TTP solvers on a set of benchmark problems. Our solver is named Cooperation Coordination (CoCo) and its source code is available from https://github.com/majid75/CoCo .},

  abstract     = {Qualitative Constraint Networks ( $$\textsf{QCN}$$ s) comprise a Symbolic AI framework for representing and reasoning about spatial and temporal information via the use of natural disjunctive qualitative relations, e.g., a constraint can be of the form “Task A is scheduled after or during Task C”. In qualitative constraint-based reasoning, the state-of-the-art approach to tackle a given $$\textsf{QCN}$$ consists in employing a backtracking algorithm, where the branching decisions during search and the refinement of the $$\textsf{QCN}$$ are governed by certain heuristics that have been proposed in the literature. Although there has been plenty of research on how these heuristics compare and behave in terms of checking the satisfiability of a $$\textsf{QCN}$$ fast, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any study on how they compare and behave in terms of obtaining a tractable refinement of a $$\textsf{QCN}$$ that is also robust. In brief, a robust refinement of a $$\textsf{QCN}$$ can be primarily seen as one that retains as many qualitative solutions as possible, e.g., the configuration “Task A is scheduled after or during Task C” is more robust than “Task A is scheduled after Task C”. Here, we make such a preliminary comparison and evaluation with respect to prominent heuristics in the literature, and reveal that there exists a trade-off between fast and robust solving of $$\textsf{QCN}$$ s for datasets consisting of instances of Allen’s Interval Algebra and Region Connection Calculus. Furthermore, we investigate reasons for the existence of this trade-off and find that more aggressive heuristics are more efficient at the cost of producing less robust refinements.},

It is organized by the French Operations Research and Decision Support Society (ROADEF) every 2 years since 1999. The most recent ROADEF challenge 2020 was co-organized by the French electricity transmission network operator, the RTE company. The competition problem addressed a novel variant of the transmission maintenance scheduling problem, distinctive in that it has multiple time-dependent properties, constraints, and a risk-based aggregate objective function. Therefore, the problem is more complex than the previous formulations, and the existing methods are not directly applicable. This paper presents a metaheuristic algorithm based on the adaptive large neighborhood search. The algorithm’s performance is based on a large bank of newly proposed problem-specific destroy and repair heuristics, an efficient local search engine, and a penalization mechanism for avoiding invalid solutions. The algorithm is compared with the best-known solutions from all competition phases and other methods submitted to the final phase. The result shows that the method yields consistent performance in all available datasets. The proposed algorithm finished 6th in the semifinal phase of the competition and 8–9th in the final phase. Finally, the effect of individual components and the algorithm’s behaviour are analyzed in detail.},

  abstract     = {Combinatorial optimization problems arise naturally in a wide range of applications from diverse domains. Many of these problems are NP-hard and designing efficient heuristics for them requires considerable time, effort and experimentation. On the other hand, the number of optimization problems in the industry continues to grow. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been explored to address this gap. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for leveraging machine learning techniques to scale-up exact combinatorial optimization algorithms. In contrast to the existing approaches based on deep-learning, reinforcement learning and restricted Boltzmann machines that attempt to directly learn the output of the optimization problem from its input (with limited success), our framework learns the relatively simpler task of pruning the elements in order to reduce the size of the problem instances. In addition, our framework uses only interpretable learning models based on intuitive local features and thus the learning process provides deeper insights into the optimization problem and the instance class, that can be used for designing better heuristics. For the classical maximum clique enumeration problem, we show that our framework can prune a large fraction of the input graph (around 99% of nodes in case of sparse graphs) and still detect almost all of the maximum cliques. Overall, this results in several fold speedups of state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the classification model used in our framework highlights that the chi-squared value of neighborhood degree has a statistically significant correlation with the presence of a node in a maximum clique, particularly in dense graphs which constitute a significant challenge for modern solvers. We leverage this insight to design a novel heuristic we call ALTHEA for the maximum clique detection problem, outperforming the state-of-the-art for dense graphs.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of urban distribution services, customers have increasingly strict requirements for the delivery time windows. Therefore it is necessary to study the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup-delivery and time windows (VRPSPDTW) in urban distribution. However, as one of the most important classification of the much anticipated reverse logistics, the VRPSPDTW problem has not received much attention, and lacks an efficient and simple implementation. Our method combines the enhanced Late Acceptance Hill Climbing algorithm (enhanced LAHC) to ensure the diversity of solutions and the Multi-armed Bandit Algorithm (MAB) to choose a neighborhood structure which has the best performance. In order to enhance its search ability at a later stage, a perturbation strategy is designed to effectively prevent premature convergence. To our best knowledge, the proposed h_LAHC (hybrid LAHC) algorithm is applied to the VRPSPDTW for the first time. We provide abundant experiments were conducted on 93 benchmark instances, and the results demonstrated that our algorithm can achieve better, totally equal or approximately equal results in 97.85%, 56.99% and 73.12% instances compared with the latest three mainstream algorithms respectively. In particular, the proposed algorithm has a prominent performance in scenarios with relatively narrow time windows. Moreover, we conduct an empirical analysis on critical components of the algorithm to highlight their impact on the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

The goal of the problem is to schedule all tasks on their related processors such that the makespan and the total tardiness are minimized. The proposed method starts with an initial reference set, namely Pareto front set, provided by applying an adaptation of the knapsack type procedure. It then solves the problem by making a cooperation between two stages: (i) the first stage focuses on improving the reference set by optimizing the objective related to makespan and, (ii) the second stage tries to highlight the final reference set by favoring the optimization of the total tardiness. Further, at each stage, the $$\varepsilon $$ -constraint strategy is employed as a learning strategy, where its aim is to enlarge the search process around reference solutions for covering some unvisited subspaces and so, to avoid a premature convergence. In order to link both stages of the method, the path-relinking is injected whenever a new/modified reference set is reached. Finally, the performance of the designed algorithm is evaluated on instances extracted from the literature. Its results are compared to the results obtained by more recent methods of the literature.

The formulation is novel and custom made to fit real quality control laboratory. The novelty comes from allowing multiple analyst interventions for each machine allocation while minimising the total completion time, formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model. A three-level dynamic heuristic is proposed to solve the problem efficiently for instances representative of real world schedules. The CPLEX solver and a Tabu Search algorithm are used for comparison. Results show that the heuristic is competitive with the other strategies for medium-sized instances while outperforming them for large-sized instances. The dynamic heuristic runs in a very short amount of time, making it suitable for real world environments. This work is valuable for the development of laboratory management solutions for quality control as it presents a way to provide automatic scheduling of resources.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the planning problem arising in the maintenance of a power distribution grid. Maintenance works require the corresponding parts of the grid to be shut down for the entire duration of maintenance which could range from one day to several weeks. The planning specifies the starting times of the required outages for maintenance and should take into account the constrained resources as well as the uncertainty involved in the maintenance works which is characterized by the risk values provided by the grid operator. The problem was presented by the French company Réseau de Transport d’Électricité for the 2020 ROADEF/EURO challenge. Several approaches were developed during the competition and all approaches are reported in this paper. We evaluate our approaches on the benchmark instances proposed for the competition. It is reported that the iterated local search metaheuristic with self-adaptive perturbation performed the best.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a task execution and routing problem in the autonomous transportation system that maps to the famous orienteering problem (OP) in operations research. By extending the classical OP to stochastic and dynamic OP with stochastic travel time and service time, an investigation is conducted that aims to optimize the selection of travel routes with the objective of maximizing the total collected rewards in accordance with the time availability of self-adaptive agent (e.g., unmanned aircraft vehicles and unmanned ground vehicle). Three self-adaptive multi-stage heuristics-based adjustment strategies (i.e., Insertion-and-Removal Heuristics, Hybrid Simulated Annealing-Tabu Search-based Re-Optimization, and Threshold-based Re-Optimization) are proposed to equip the autonomous agent with the ability of real-time routing adjustment in the context of the dynamic and stochastic orienteering problem. Finally, benchmark simulation experiments are used to test the effectiveness of all the three proposed adjustment strategies. The experimental results show that, compared with a priori solutions acquired by a static meta-heuristic algorithm (Hybrid Simulated Annealing-Tabu Search algorithm), the three strategies can improve the solution qualities at different levels.},

  abstract     = {The intelligent management of available resources is one of the greatest challenges of any organization. Find the balance between the size of the stock and the production and transport capacity and ensuring quality service to suppliers and customers. This type of challenge is also very common in port terminals. Ensuring efficient and effective operations is fundamental to reduce fines, avoid accidents, and build customer loyalty. This paper considers integrated planning, scheduling, yard allocation, and berth allocation problem in dry bulk port terminals. The integrated problem consists of planning and scheduling the flow of products between the supply and demand nodes, allocating the products to the storage yards, and determining the loading sequence and berth time and position of each vessel. A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed, connecting the problems and generating an integrated solution. To solve the integrated problem more efficiently, we developed an algorithm that combines the column generation method with a diving heuristic with limited backtracking, a relax-and-fix heuristic, and an exact algorithm from a commercial solver. The mathematical formulation and the proposed algorithm are tested and validated with large-scale instances. Computational experiments show that the proposed solution approach outperform commercial solver and is very effective in finding strong bounds for large instances.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel technique for algorithm-selection, applicable to optimisation domains in which there is implicit sequential information encapsulated in the data, e.g., in online bin-packing. Specifically we train two types of recurrent neural networks to predict a packing heuristic in online bin-packing, selecting from four well-known heuristics. As input, the RNN methods only use the sequence of item-sizes. This contrasts to typical approaches to algorithm-selection which require a model to be trained using domain-specific instance features that need to be first derived from the input data. The RNN approaches are shown to be capable of achieving within 5% of the oracle performance on between 80.88 and 97.63% of the instances, depending on the dataset. They are also shown to outperform classical machine learning models trained using derived features. Finally, we hypothesise that the proposed methods perform well when the instances exhibit some implicit structure that results in discriminatory performance with respect to a set of heuristics. We test this hypothesis by generating fourteen new datasets with increasing levels of structure, and show that there is a critical threshold of structure required before algorithm-selection delivers benefit.},
