  abstract     = {As people pursue the concept of green and low carbon, green supply chain is a key link of development, and the selection of its key green suppliers plays a crucial role in green development. As the decision making of green suppliers involves many factors, many experts need to make decisions together, the selection of green supplier can be regarded as a problem of multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM). Thus, this manuscript collected information in probabilistic hesitant fuzzy (PHF) environment and using CRITIC method to obtain the unknown weighting among criterions. Further, a MADM framework develop a novel QUALItative FLEXible (QUALIFLEX) method based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT) with the PHF information was constructed to conduct the selection problem. Finally, a numerical case of green supplier selection was illustrated with this proposed model, and other methods were utilized to compare with PHF-CPT-QUALIFLEX method to verify the feasibility and applicability.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS), which consists of multiple linguistic terms and their probabilities, has been proposed to tackle qualitative information in informs of linguistic expressions. Since experts are inclined to compare alternatives in pairs, the probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR), a matrix whose elements are PLTSs, has attracted wide attention since it was first introduced in 2016. Fruitful research achievements regarding PLPRs have been generated, especially in group decision making (GDM). This paper reviews 88 selected articles published from 2016 to June 4, 2023 regarding PLPRs, and presents a review of researches on theory and applications of PLPRs. First, we conduct a bibliometric study of these selected articles in terms of publication and citation trends, most productive countries/regions, categories of publications and keyword co-occurrence relationships. Next, the theory of PLPRs including definition, missing element deduction, consistency checking, prioritization, and decision-making analysis methods are recalled. We also review real-world applications of these publications and find that PLPRs have been mainly applied in four areas, including healthcare management, project evaluation, environment and energy management, and emergency management. In the end, we propose future research directions related to the probabilistic linguistic decision-making theory and provide insights for researchers and practitioners who have an interest in complex linguistic decision making.},

The power average operator can mitigate the consequences of some decision-makers’ strong biases while evaluating data. Additionally, the Dombi operators during the phase of aggregation are very adaptable with general parameter. Inspired by these topics, we propose some dual probabilistic linguistic Dombi power aggregation operators to aggregate the decision-making expert’s preferences and various elegant properties of these proposed dual probabilistic linguistic (DPL)-aggregating operators. Further, we establish an integrated method with the combination of proposed DPL-aggregation operators, full consistency method (FUCOM) and additive ratio assessment (ARAS) model called the “DPL-FUCOM-ARAS” methodology for solving multi-criteria decision analysis problems under dual probabilistic linguistic environment. In this methodology, the FUCOM is applied to determine criteria weight, while the ARAS model is presented to prioritize the options from dual probabilistic linguistic perspective. We present a case study on the selection of a medical equipment supplier to highlight the applicability and show the usefulness of the proposed DPL-FUCOM-ARAS methodology. Further, we discuss the sensitivity investigation and comparative discussion to check the stability and robustness of the proposed DPL-FUCOM-ARAS methodology.},

To further abate the transmission channel congestion caused by the limited bandwidth, an improved DETM is offered. Besides, point fuzzy controller is constructed to save control costs by utilizing limited actuators. Especially, in the networked control framework, the appearance of attacks will pose a serious threat to the systems’ stability. To simulate complex forms of attacks, dual deception attacks are taken into account. Moreover, some appropriate parameter-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals are employed to obtain correlated conditions that ensure the exponential stability of the target system. Finally, numerical and application examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design methods.

The implementation of the control scheme is categorized into three steps: (1) restricting the states to satisfy the corresponding constraints; (2) handling the explosion of complexity; and (3) achieving a better compromise between system performances and communication loads. First, tangent barrier Lyapunov functions are applied to constrain the outputs and system states within time-varying boundaries. Then, the explosion of complexity is addressed via the command filtering method. Furthermore, an adaptive self-triggered control mechanism is developed to reduce resource consumption for each subsystem. In addition to solving the problem of monitoring the triggering threshold continuously, the designed adaptive self-triggered mechanism allows the triggering intervals to be dynamically adjusted according to the tracking errors, which makes the proposed control protocol possible to coordinate the system performances and communication resources. By using the Lyapunov stability criterion, it is demonstrated that all signals of the closed-loop systems are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.},

  abstract     = {In new industrial product development, human-involvement conceptual design evaluation (CDE) is an information-intensive and multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) process. To capture and formalize the uncertain information from decision-makers (DMs), several derivations of fuzzy number such as triangular intuitionistic fuzzy number (TIFN), Z-number, and interval number have been employed in CDE, which only cover limited information. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: firstly, a new kind of fuzzy number by taking advantage of TIFN, Z-number and interval number, i.e., interval intuitionistic fuzzy-Z-number (IIFZN), is presented to utilize DM’s preference value (PV) for alternative, as well as his important rating (IR) and familiarity degree (FD) judgements for evaluation criterion. IIFZN is composed of not only the membership and non-membership of PV or IR, but also the affiliated confidence coefficient transformed from FD. Then, in terms of the IIFZN-based decision-making matrix, this study proposes new ideal solution definition rules and distance measurement metric in technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to form a new TOPSIS-IIFZN method. The proposed method will enable DM easily find the alternative which is most preferable for important and familiar criteria and least preferred for less important and unfamiliar criteria as the best one. It is more rational than traditional PV-only CDE method, which will help company to save manufacturing resources. Besides theoretical research, one practical example and three more complex comparative experiments have been carried out to validate the performance of TOPSIS-IIFZN. By comparing with other MCGDM methods using different types of fuzzy numbers, it proves that TOPSIS-IIFZN can obtain more reasonable evaluation results. Meanwhile, besides PV, the RI and FD factors also play great influences in CDE.},

This paper proposes a multi-attribute decision-making method based on fuzzy weight, which is a natural generalization of deterministic weight, and it can cope with the decision-making risks brought by uncertain environment, which has strong robustness. Meanwhile the new deviation function index proposed could reflect that the upper and lower decision-makers execute the final decision with the same enthusiasm, which is convenient to make exploratory decisions in unknown environment. Finally, compared with the traditional existing methods, the effectiveness of the proposed method and indicator is verified by the garbage classification game in the main urban district of Chongqing.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the carrier landing control problem of the fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with model uncertainties and external disturbances, a discrete-time fuzzy flight control (DFFC) strategy is proposed to improve the flight performance by utilizing a discrete-time disturbance observer (DTDO) and the prescribed performance control (PPC) method in this paper. Firstly, the continuous time system model with uncertainties and disturbances is transformed into a discrete-time model by Euler approximation method and then the model uncertainties are approximated by the fuzzy logic system (FLS). Then, a DTDO based on the FLS is designed to estimate and compensate the disturbances caused by the deck motion and airwake, and the DFFC method is developed with the assistance of the discrete-time dynamic surface control and the PPC method. Notably, the designed DTDO by introducing FLS further improves the robustness of the system. Preciously, the application of the PPC ensures that the UAV can track the reference glide trajectory within the specified performance range. At last, the stability of the system is proved by Lyapunov theory, and the effectiveness and supremacy of the DFFC are illustrated via the simulation comparison and analysis.},

  abstract     = {The probabilistic rough set (PRS) model, through the incorporation of error levels, represents a quantitative extension of the classical rough set model. It serves as a fundamental expansion that enables robust fault tolerance capabilities by employing relative quantitative description. However, when confronted with interval-valued fuzzy data, the PRS model is rendered ineffective. The primary reason for this lies in the absence of a unique equivalence relation in interval-valued decision systems. This paper presents a novel approach to address this limitation. In this paper, we first propose a fuzzy similarity relation based on diversity function, which establishes a viable foundation for constricting models of probabilistic rough fuzzy set and multi-granularity probabilistic rough set models for interval-valued fuzzy decision systems. Then the decision rules are derived from the presented three kinds of multi-granularity probabilistic rough fuzzy sets, respectively. In order to elucidate the concepts of interval-valued probabilistic rough fuzzy sets and multi-granularity probabilistic rough fuzzy sets, a case study is considered, which is helpful for applying these theories to deal with practical issues.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, agriculture has incorporated various sensors to obtain crop data. Nutrients, conductivity, and pH in soil are the key factors affecting the growth of crops. Before using fertilizers, farmers need to master the soil information of the orchard to decide the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to be fertilized and the amount of water to be irrigated. Although existing outdoor technology sensing solutions can detect soil nutrient information, there are high maintenance costs and systems that do not provide analysis recommendations, which are very unfriendly to farmers. Aiming at the above problems, we propose the fuzzy neural network of fertilization rate and fuzzy neural network of fertilization rate to provide farmers with the most direct fertilization and irrigation suggestions. This paper uses an automated self-propelled soil identification system that enables path planning in an orchard. After arriving at the measurement point designated by the farmer, we use the soil probe measurement system to measure soil nutrients within a certain range. The system provides farmers with suggestions on fertilization and medication and grasps the growth status of the orchard area. The advantage of this is that it can reduce the maintenance cost caused by the long-term installation of the system. The cost of our vehicle-mounted system is 150,000 NT dollars, which saves 350,000 NT dollars a year and 50,000 NT dollars in maintenance costs compared to installing ten outdoor weather station sensors. Compared with fixed weather station solutions, mobile unmanned vehicles can analyze more land areas and bring more precise benefits to farmers.},

A command filter-based adaptive fuzzy fixed-time control strategy is presented via combining the backstepping framework with fixed-time control theory. The packaged unknown nonlinearities appeared in the controller design process are estimated by adopting fuzzy logic systems. At the same time, the “explosion of complex” difficulty occurred in conventional backstepping algorithm is eliminated by adopting a command filter technique and corresponding error compensation signals are exploited to alleviate the influence of the errors generated by command filters. It is further shown that the developed controller not only guarantees the boundedness of all the closed-loop system signals, but also makes the output tracking error arrive a small neighbor around the origin within a fixed time. Finally, both theoretical analysis and simulation research are carried out to further test the feasibility of the presented methodology.},

It is crucial to improve the performance of the soft science institute. Facing the reality that the performance of soft science institute is affected by various factors and it is not feasible to optimize these factors simultaneously due to the limitation of resources. A feasible solution is to select and improve some key influencing factors. In this paper, a new hybrid Hermeneutic-fuzzy-DANP model for evaluating and ranking key influencing factors is proposed. First, we use a two-dimensional matrix as a template for text collection and expand the previous factors system based on the hermeneutic method. Second, expert evaluations of domain for relations between factors of soft science institute are presented as triangular fuzzy numbers. Then it is converted to precise numerical values to minimize subjectivity and fuzziness. Third, the complex interrelationships among factors are clearly quantified. The integrated DEMATEL-ANP model helps to identify cause-effect interrelation among the selected factors and supports to adjust the weights based on the feedback relationship between different levels of factors. The proposed method can solve the subjectivity and fuzziness of experts evaluations well. Based on the new hybrid model, the performance of the soft science institute will be significantly improved after identifying and optimizing these key influencing factors.},

However, it is worth noting that due to the differences in decision makers’ preferences and understanding of linguistic terms, there is a significant difference between the level of ER and the term in PLTSs, which hinders further development of ER in PLTSs. To fill this gap, this study modifies the existing ER algorithm with linguistic correlation and introduces it to multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems within PLTSs. First, the correlations between different linguistic terms are defined based on the expressive preferences of decision-makers. Second, the correlation between different linguistic terms is integrated into the original ER to reduce the contradiction caused by expressive preferences. Moreover, linguistic correlation is also involved in the calculation of reliability to adjust the distance measure, which can reduce the unreliability caused by the preferences expressed by decision-makers. Then, nonlinear programming models are conducted to drive expert reliability. Thereafter, the modified ER algorithm is employed to integrate expert opinions into a comprehensive evaluation of alternatives. Finally, an illustrative example of an industry evaluation problem is conducted to verify the robustness and validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In data analysis, analyzing the relationships between the variables such as correlation analysis and regression analysis are very important. Correlation analysis and regression analysis are not only very important in analyzing the influence relationship and causal relationship of variables but also serve as the basis for statistical analysis. Furthermore, they are essential and important as basic analysis for machine learning analysis such as deep learning. This is because in analyzing the input and output in deep learning, variables with high correlation are selected first, and in analyzing the causal relationship, it is basic to first conduct basic analysis such as regression analysis. Especially, when data are observed as fuzzy data with ambiguous information, it is difficult to propose unique methods for those analyses due to its complexity. However, the application of fuzzy theory to correlation analysis for data with such ambiguous information has not been an effective study, and several studies have been conducted in cases where the data is not general fuzzy data or interval estimation. As a result, the effectiveness of the fuzzy theory was not highlighted. In particular, the variable selection method for selecting important variables in multiple regression analysis is a very important and essential process in regression analysis. A variable that is significant in simple regression analysis may not be significant in multiple regression analysis due to its relationship with other variables. Therefore, not all variables that affect the dependent variable can be used as independent variables in multiple regression analysis. Therefore, multiple regression analysis goes through the process of excluding some variables. But until now, the process of fuzzy multiple regression analysis has not been applied without a variable selection method and the significance of important variables has not been emphasized that much. In this paper, a fuzzy correlation coefficient and multiple fuzzy regression analysis using variable section method are proposed. For this, first defuzzification and fuzzy ordering are defined. And then fuzzy correlation coefficient is proposed using $${\varvec{L}}_{2}$$ distance. Next, fuzzy sum of squares are defined for F-statistics to test the significance of the regression model. Using this F-statistics, fuzzy R2, and fuzzy RMSE, several variable selection methods are proposed based on distance approach. For the data analysis, foreign exchange reserve data and house price of South Korea have been applied which are important indicators for economic crisis. The financial data is mostly recorded as closing values, but the closing values cannot be the representative of the given period of time. Therefore, we can deal with the financial data as fuzzy data which have some fluctuation that can be considered as vagueness that the data originally include. We have used foreign exchange reserve data and house price data with several financial variables. And the proposed fuzzy correlation coefficient and variable selection for fuzzy regression analysis are applied to these financial data.},

  abstract     = {Unlike two-wheeled balancing robots, which are mechanically stable in one direction, unicycle robots use only one bottom wheel to maintain pitching balance, leaving the robot unable to maintain rolling balance. This study proposes an intelligent balancing control (IBC) system to address the highly nonlinear and underactuated behavior of the unicycle robot through the fuzzy control approach. The IBC system comprises three controllers: the fuzzy movement control (FMC), the fuzzy rolling control (FRC) and the fuzzy steering control (FSC). The FMC enables the unicycle robot to move at a desired speed in the longitudinal direction while maintaining balance, the FRC causes the roll angle to approach zero in the lateral direction, and the FSC controls the robot to rotate in place in the yaw direction. In addition, because the movement of bicycle robot is relatively complex, most of them only tend to simple movement patterns or linear movements. Further, this study proposes a trajectory tracking control (TTC) system using the fuzzy control approach to enable the bicycle robot to track a desired trajectory with high accuracy. Finally, the proposed control strategy is implemented using a 32-bit STM32F446RE microcontroller. Six experimental scenarios are studied to help test the robot&#39;s stability and maneuverability. The experimental results not only proved the balance of the IBC system in challenging terrain, but also proved the accuracy of the TTC system in tracking the command trajectory.},

  abstract     = {Precision agriculture refers to the use of advanced technologies and data analytics to optimize farming practices, maximize crop yields, and reduce resource wastage. In precision agriculture monitoring, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a valuable tool for large-scale implementation. The selection of suitable UAVs is a critical aspect of precision agriculture and is deliberated as significant multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem. In decision issues, the evaluation of experts about any available options plays an important role. In this context, interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (IVq-ROFS) is a useful tool allowing experts to provide their evaluations in a wider space and better deal with incomplete information. This paper aims to develop a new approach to determining expert weights using distance and similarity measures for interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (IVq-ROFNs). To achieve this, an average group assessment based on individual assessments is constructed. The experts&#39; weights were then established by computing similarity measures between the individual evaluations and the average group assessment. Moreover, the technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is extended to address the MAGDM problem under IVq-ROF information. An example involving UAV selection for precision agriculture is provided to demonstrate the validity of the suggested method, and the impact of parameters on decision results is discussed. Finally, a comparative analysis with existing approaches demonstrates the superiority and advantages of the proposed technique.},

There is much scope for the development of new theories based on the principles of the ambiguous set. In this direction, an idea of ambiguous logic is proposed, which can be regarded as a family of four-valued logic. In this study, the limitations of existing theories such as fuzzy logic, intuitionistic fuzzy logic, and neutrosophic logic that are used to deal with uncertainty are first discussed. Then an introduction to the ambiguous set and ambiguous logic is given. In ambiguous logic, there are four membership degrees for each proposition, which can be characterized as true, false, true-ambiguous, and false-ambiguous. We then analyze the membership degrees of propositions using various connectives, including negation, conjunction, and disjunction. In this study, we discuss various laws that support the different algebraic operations for comparing propositions in terms of membership degrees. An approach is presented to define a rule using a proposition consisting of membership degrees, called an ambiguous rule. The modus ponens rule of inference is defined by combining various ambiguous rules, and is called ambiguous inference. Finally, to demonstrate the real-time application of ambiguous logic, an ambiguous inference system is designed that can be used in machine control systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a dynamic event-triggered adaptive tracking control law is proposed for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) with power exponential functions based on fuzzy disturbance observers. By utilizing fuzzy logic systems, a fuzzy disturbance observer with power exponential function is firstly designed to estimate the external disturbance for MASs with power exponential. Then, an improved dynamic event-triggered scheme is constructed to save the communication resource. Different from the traditional event-triggered strategies, a special threshold function is introduced into the dynamic event-triggered strategy, which alleviates the communication pressure to a larger extent, avoids the large jump of control pulses and enhances the tracking performance in the early stage of system operation. Meanwhile, based on the structural characteristics of systems, the “adding a power integrator” is utilized to resolve the difficulty caused by power exponential functions. Moreover, the Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to verify that all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. Finally, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy transform (FT) is a soft computing method that has many successful applications. Least-squares fuzzy transform (LS-FT) combining $$L_{2}$$ -norm and FT was proposed by Patane in 2011, but it can be severely affected by the presence of outlier. To solve this problem, we proposed least absolute deviation fuzzy transform (LAD-FT) combining $$L_{1}$$ -norm and FT and verified the robustness of outlier through experiments based on the various functions. In the process, we found the solution of LAD-FT for a function of one variable cannot be directly extended to a function of two variables. This paper is a first attempt to prove this problem. We also propose a novel algorithm for applying the LAD-FT to a function of two variables. Since FT is already known as a useful tool for various image processing problems, we validate and compare the performance of FT, LS-FT, and LAD-FT on the three main perspectives, especially, image reconstruction, image denoising, and outlier robustness. Experiments are conducted by many various sizes of images and compression rates and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) are used to measure the difference between two images. Results show that LAD-FT is robust to outlier, FT is superior in image reconstruction and image denoising, and SSIM has better performance than PSNR.},

For controlling the charging/discharging cycles of the Li-ion of battery system linked to an induction motor driven by solar panels, the suggested BMS method uses an FLC (Fuzzy Logic Controller). The BMS prevents the battery to becoming overcharged or drained. The BMS techniques are discussed in this work, including SOC (State-of-Charge), safe charging, and battery protection. The FLC implements reliable control shifting techniques during battery charging and discharging. FLC&#39;s methodology has been confirmed through simulation verifications in SIMULINK/MATLAB.

First, as an approximate instrument of unknown nonlinear functions, the fuzzy logic system is adopted to tackle the uncertainty of stochastic robotic systems. Second, the command filter technique is used to solve the “complexity explosion&quot; problem in the traditional backstepping process, and error compensation mechanisms are introduced to eliminate the error influence caused by command filters. Then, based on barrier lyapunov functions (BLFs), the adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is designed such that the state constraints are not breached almost surely, all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded almost surely and the first-order moment of the tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero. Finally, the tracking problem of the two-link planar manipulator in stochastic surroundings is analysed to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {The existing online medical platforms are striving to provide various kinds of services to satisfy users&#39; dynamic demands. With the exponential growth of information, users usually suffer from information overload, confronting with high search costs and time costs. In order to reduce users&#39; search cost and assist users to retrieve appropriate medical service efficiently, recommending online medical services to users smarter and faster has becoming a valuable research topic. Unfortunately, certain imprecise and subjective information always exist in obtaining users&#39; preferences. Moreover, the effect of social trust on an individual user&#39;s decision-making is often omitted in previous methods, which may result in inaccurate recommendation results. This study proposes a method for recommending the most appropriate medical services to users, in which users&#39; linguistic preferences, assessments and social trust information are considered. The procedure of the proposed method consists of two steps: (1) to acquire various users&#39; linguistic preference based on Best–Worst Method (BWM) and fuzzy set theory, and (2) to recommend the corresponding medical services using trust-aware collaborative filtering (CF) technique. Firstly, the fuzzy BWM is adopted to determine the attribute weights based on various users&#39; linguistic preferences. Secondly, by combing the linguistic evaluation matrix and users&#39; social trust information, the trust-based similarity network is constructed, which is then merged into CF technique for predicting final rating and recommending online medical services. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the applications of the proposed method.},

Therefore, we design a dual-hunting framework for multiagent systems to hunt a small target. A hunting formation with double containment is designed to reduce the possibility of the target escaping. Then, an auction algorithm is designed to generate the desired formation and rationally plan the positions of the agents in the hunting formation. To improve the applicability of the dual-hunting framework, we take high-order multiagent systems as the research object, and the fuzzy logic system (FLS) is introduced to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics (UND) due to higher-order system model errors and environmental disturbances. Based on FLS and backstepping method, a hunting controller for high-order systems is designed, which enables multiagent systems to track targets and form hunting formations. Furthermore, the Lyapunov function is designed to prove the stability of the controller. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulating a multiagent system containing 12 intelligences hunting for a dynamic target.},

To handle the uncertainty in the data, two kinds of tolerances have been used. Fuzzification of data have been done using unilateral tolerance with the membership function as Right triangular generalized fuzzy numbers (RTrGFN) and bilateral tolerance with the membership function as generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (GTFN). Using lambda-tau expressions, failure rate, and repair time for the entire structure has been calculated and all reliability parameters of Condensate structure have been calculated as well. The defuzzified values are also obtained for application purpose. This paper aimed at finding the performance of the structure and best possible way to increase the reliability of the structure.

Second, with the finite-time stable lemma and Lyapunov function methods, novel criteria are presented to ensure the FTSY of drive-response FINNs (DRFINNs) under feedback control. Third, algebraic inequalities instead of complicated matrix inequalities are used to derive the sufficient conditions of delay independent or delay dependent. Meanwhile, Zeno behavior can be well excluded by the new criteria in this paper. Finally, to illustrate how the achieved results can be measured, two examples are given. The application is provided by the image encryption/decryption process based on the novel finite-time synchronization results of DRFINNs. An image diffusion algorithm based on XOR operation is adopted. The plain image is encrypted by the sender using the key generated from the drive system. The key generated by the response system is used to decrypt the cryptographic image. The result shows that the proposed method is extremely effective.},

Some nonparametric methods, such as the kernel regression method, have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks. In this paper, we derive a novel fuzzy nonparametric regression method. A convex nonparametric least squares approach (CNLS) is employed for the fuzzy regression models with crisp input fuzzy output data (Fuzzy-CNLS). Like Diamond&#39;s fuzzy least squares method, the fuzzy regression model is divided into three submodels, the Center, the Left endpoint, and the Right endpoint. We employ CNLS for each sub-model. Hence, the resulting Fuzzy-CNLS regression model consists of three sets of CNLS results (hyperplanes) for each sub-model, representing a fuzzy nonlinear regression model. One of the advantages of the original CNLS over ordinary least squares (OLS) is that the coefficient of determination of CNLS must be greater than that of OLS. Hence, the goodness of fit of Fuzzy-CNLS is better than the fuzzy least squares methods. On the other hand, CNLS can accommodate the concavity or convexity constraints for the regression functions following the concavity or convexity pattern, respectively. With these shape (concavity or convexity) constraints, it is considered that Fuzzy-CNLS is less sensitive to outliers. A similarity-distance measure is used to select the shape constraints and to evaluate the performance of Fuzzy-CNLS. An illustrative example and an application example are given. The numerical results show that Fuzzy-CNLS is better than Diamond&#39;s least squares method and fuzzy least absolute linear regression method in terms of the similarity measure.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to model the brushless direct current motors and regenerative braking system used in electric vehicles using intelligent control approaches. Type-2 fuzzy logic control model is used as an intelligent control method. The application of regenerative braking extends the driving range of electric vehicles. In this study, an innovative regenerative braking system is presented. Speed control of brushless direct current motor and control of regenerative braking system are provided by Type-2 fuzzy logic control. Type-2 fuzzy logic control outperforms other solutions in terms of modeling uncertainties, generating new solutions, robustness, and efficiency. Type-2 fuzzy logic control is built on Matlab/M-file platform. The simulation in which the experimental studies were carried out was created on the MATLAB/Simulink platform. With this simulation study, battery charge status, battery current and brushless direct current motor speed values were obtained. The simulation results show that Type-2 fuzzy logic control can effectively control regenerative braking system. The regenerative braking system maintains its braking quality, while the electric vehicle slows it down at a safe driving distance. In addition, it is clearly seen in the results that the brushless direct current motor in the electric vehicle can increase the driving distance by charging the vehicle battery, thanks to its use as an alternator during braking.},

Compared with the existing works, the threshold of the AED scheme can be dynamically adjusted in real time by an adaptive law which utilizes the latest released data and the historical released data information. Then, an FD fuzzy filter with mismatched membership functions and AED mechanism is designed, which is used to generate a residual signal and detect system faults. A membership functions iteration strategy is utilized to optimize the membership functions of the FD fuzzy filter in real time, which can achieve better system performance. Furthermore, the sufficient conditions for designing the FD fuzzy filter are obtained in terms of the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a simulation example of the tunnel diode circuit system is utilized for proving the effectiveness and showing the advantages of the proposed AED FD strategy.

The major objective of this article is to evaluate the novel theory of interaction operational laws for TSF information. Additionally, power Bonferroni mean (PBM) operators are the combination of two existing ideas such as Bonferroni and power aggregation operator and because of this reason, they are more general than the bundle of existing ideas. Inspired by the above valuable knowledge, we derive the PBM operators based on interaction operation laws for TSF values such as the TSF interaction PBM (TSFIPBM) operator and TSF weighted interaction PBM (TSFWIPBM) operator. Some special cases and the properties of the invented techniques are also examined. Furthermore, for addressing some real-life problems, we derive the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method in the consideration of the presented technique to enhance the stability and supremacy of the evaluated techniques.

  abstract     = {Distance measures have been scorching issues in solving problems of multi-attribute decision making (MADM). Though kinds of pioneered distance measures of hesitant fuzzy sets (HFS) have been proposed, several existing ones are still risking in achieving reasonable ranking results as which mainly are constructed on processes of arrangement and extension through adding certain membership degrees. Furthermore, in most distance measures, there are no influences of membership values as hesitant characteristics, which only take lengths of HFS elements (HFEs) into account. From such perspective, we establish the concept of hesitant index to express such hesitance with direction-senses, including positive hesitant index and negative hesitant index. Hesitant index is more supple and applicable in describing hesitant situation towards alternatives containing influences of both different directions of hesitance. Via utilizing positive hesitant index and negative hesitant index, we propose virous distance measures to make up inadequacies of some existing distance measures from the view of combing direct and indirect calculations. Furthermore, on the foundation of hesitant index, hesitant information scale is elaborated to describe characteristics of HFEs. Via taking hesitant information scales as important parts, new distance measures are presented from the view of indirect calculation. Proposed distance measures prompted from hesitant index satisfy better triangle inequality than compared existing ones, and proposed distance measures prompted from hesitant information scales not only satisfy triangle inequality, but also can avoid arrangement and extension processes towards different lengths of HFEs. Finally, relevant experiments demonstrate effectiveness and advantages of proposed distance measures in MADM.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) has captured the attention of the community with an increasing number of recent papers in regression applications, including surveys and reviews. Despite the efficiency and good accuracy in systems with high-dimensional data, many DL methodologies have complex structures that are not readily transparent to human users. Accessing the interpretability of these models is an essential factor for addressing problems in sensitive areas such as cyber-security systems, medical, financial surveillance, and industrial processes. Fuzzy logic systems (FLS) are inherently interpretable models capable of using nonlinear representations for complex systems through linguistic terms with membership degrees mimicking human thought. This paper aims to investigate the state-of-the-art of existing deep fuzzy systems (DFS) for regression, i.e., methods that combine DL and FLS with the aim of achieving good accuracy and good interpretability. Within the concept of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), it is essential to contemplate interpretability in the development of intelligent models and not only seek to promote explanations after learning (post hoc methods), which is currently well established in the literature. Therefore, this work presents DFS for regression applications as the leading point of discussion of this topic that is not sufficiently explored in the literature and thus deserves a comprehensive survey.},

Moreover, recent developments led to FCNs with functional weights (FCNs-FW), as a significant FCNs enhancement in terms of storage requirements, efficiency and less human intervention requirements. In this paper we proceed further by introducing hybrid deep learning structures, interweaving FCNs-FW with well established deep neural network (DNN) representative structures and apply the new schemes on a variety of pattern recognition and time series prediction tasks. More specifically, after discussing general issues related to the construction of deep learning structures using FCNs-FW we present three hybrid models, which combine the FCN-FW with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), echo state networks (ESNs) and AutoEncoder (AE) schemes, respectively. The hybrid schemes are tested on diverse benchmark data sets and prove that FCN-FW based hybrid schemes perform equally well or better than state-of-the-art DNN-based schemes, paving thus the way for using cognitive networks to deep learning representative structures.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new application of the secure communication system (SCS) of the chaotic systems with experimentally verification of wireless devices together with a new stability condition of disturbance observer, which is used to reject the attack signals on public channels and uncertain values on both master and slave of the secure communication system. To ensure the security of the text message transmission, the states of two nonidentical chaotic systems are used to encrypt and decrypt the signal, respectively. To synchronize the slave and master, first, the Lorenz chaotic system is remodeled into the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy (TSF) model for softening the designs of the controller and observer. Second, to meet the requirement of the sent and received signals are identical, the synchronization controller was designed based on the adaptive sliding mode control (SMC). The adaptive laws of the controller are based on the regulating boundary of saturation thickness. Third, to prevent the attack signals on the public channels and the variations of the system parameters, the disturbance observer (DO) was newly proposed. This is a new contribution of the paper to the area of disturbance observer design. Fourth, the stability of the proposed control method was proved using the Lyapunov condition. Final, the performances of the proposed method are demonstrated via simulation using MATLAB software and experiment using the chips WiFi ESP8266 Shields. The obtained results with attacked signals and parameter’ variations were mostly rejected both in simulation and experimental studies. The states of MSSs are identical. Therefore, the sent and received data are completely secured and identical.},

Instead of the exponentially decaying functions, a new-type performance envelop is designed to offer a way to explicitly and freely preassign the settling time and the accuracy of trajectory tracking. Moreover, in lieu of involving the approach angle or azimuth angle, a new idea for tackling underactuation is proposed that yields a singularity-free continuous control solution. The fuzzy logic systems are employed to address the unknown and lumped nonlinearities in the closed-loop system. The resulting control system possesses inherent robustness to the external disturbances and the second derivative of the reference trajectory, thus without the need for employing disturbance observers or assuming the available derivative information. It is demonstrated by the constraint analysis based on dialectic by contradiction that the developed control achieves arbitrarily fast and accurate trajectory tracking for the vehicle.

Compared with fuzzy set and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS), PFS is more capable to handle uncertainty in the real world. Similarity measure is an important topic in the theory of PFS and has been applied in various fields, such as classification, clustering, decision making, and so on. Meanwhile, overlap and grouping functions, as two novel continuous binary aggregation functions, have been discussed in the literature for applications in image processing, decision making, classification and so on. The main purpose of this paper is to construct similarity measures between PFSs based on overlap and grouping functions. Firstly, on the basis of overlap and grouping functions, we introduce two novel construction methods of similarity measure between PFSs, called O-similarity measure and G-similarity measure, respectively. Secondly, we use some numerical examples to illustrate characteristics of O-similarity measure in detail. Finally, we show the applications of O-similarity measure in classification and clustering to demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods in the environment of expert assessments and data sets. The results of experiments show that O-similarity measure has better performance than some existing similarity measures under some conditions.},

  abstract     = {This study applies a multistep fuzzy stochastic procedure to evaluate Turkish health system efficiency by comparing crisp and stochastic efficiency estimates blending machine learning predictors. Conventional, bias-corrected, and fuzzy data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimates are employed and compared to explore province-based health systems’ efficiency scores. Fuzzy DEA α-level models are used to assess underlying uncertainty, yielding fuzzy results by changing 10 different alpha (α)-cut parameters from 0.10 to 1. Data are obtained from the official statistics of the Turkish Statistical Institute, and cross-province efficiency comparisons are performed through spatial analysis of the best and worst performers. A Pythagorean forest is constructed incorporating random forest regression to identify the most accurate predictors of province-based efficiency scores. The results reveal that bias correction and fuzziness outperform conventional efficiency analysis. High efficiency scores are observed when the α-cut parameter in the fuzzy DEA application is increased. High correlations are observed between efficiency scores elicited from crisp and stochastic DEA estimates ( $${r}_{\rm s}&gt;90$$ ). The spatial distribution of average fuzzy DEA scores (α = 1) for seven geographic regions are presented on a map of Turkey. Finally, considering the imprecision of the fuzzy DEA estimates, fuzzy DEA efficiency scores are used to identify the predictors of health system fuzzy efficiency scores. The Pythagorean forest demonstrates that the most important predictor of province-based fuzzy efficiency scores is the number of physicians. The average efficiency values obtained from the conventional DEA model are outstanding in comparison to bias-corrected and fuzzy DEA estimates. Future studies could compare crisp and fuzzy efficiency estimates using large spatial datasets.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many studies have been conducted on developing cubic sets, like cubic intuitionistic fuzzy sets, cubic Pythagorean fuzzy sets, and cubic q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets. However, the cubic set combines interval-valued and fuzzy sets. But both parts of these fuzzy sets cannot attain the maximum value (equal to 1) due to the restriction at the sum of memberships and non-membership grades. For example if one has data of the form $$\Xi =\{&lt;x;([0.5,1],[0.1,1]),(1,0.9)&gt;|x\in X\},$$ then clearly these data cannot be handled through cubic q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets. To cover this situation, we introduce the notions of cubic q-fractional fuzzy sets ( $$Cqf_{r}Fs$$ ), combining the interval-valued q-fractional fuzzy sets ( $$IVqf_{r}Fs$$ ) and q-fractional fuzzy sets ( $$qf_{r}Fs$$ ) and allowing them to attain the maximum value by introducing a new parameter $$q\ge 2.$$ We first introduce the concept of interval-valued q-fractional fuzzy sets ( $$ IVqf_{r}Fs$$ ) with elemental properties. Then we propose the novel idea of cubic q-fractional fuzzy sets ( $$Cqf_{r}Fs$$ ) and discuss their sensitivity analysis. We also provide the fundamental arithmetic operations of cubic q-fractional fuzzy sets ( $$Cqf_{r}Fs$$ ) and properties. In the end, we propose the correlation coefficients to measure the relationship between cubic q-fractional fuzzy sets ( $$Cqf_{r}Fs$$ ). Finally, we presented a numerical example of the evaluation of using a digital library in the education department by considering its advantages and disadvantages using the developed correlation coefficients for user X. Thus, by knowing a user’s priorities, the digital library database can be updated.},

These indexes are the membership, non-membership and hesitancy of the intuitionistic fuzzy set. Secondly, the proposed distance has been proved that it satisfies the axiomatic characteristics of distance measure. Then using a few examples to illustrate the novel distance in pattern recognition and fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making, while could adapt to decision-making problems more flexible by adjusting tendency coefficients of each intuitionistic index.

It has been shown that the use of type-1 and type-2 fuzzy theory applied in parameter adaptation has contributed to effectively solve this problem. The advantage of utilizing fuzzy theory in parameter adaptation is the uncertainty management that offers a significant enhancement in finding solutions. The main goal is to utilize type-3 fuzzy theory in parameter adaptation of harmony search. Type-3 membership functions can use vertical slices for their construction. A new type-3 fuzzy harmony search approach is utilized to find the antecedent and consequent parameters of a fuzzy controller problem. Experiments with different lower scale parameters were carried out to verify the benefits of modeling the uncertainty domain with the type-3 fuzzy approach. A level of disturbance was applied to the control process to validate the performance of the method with respect to those existing in the literature.},

Trust, as an essential and important relationship in social network analysis, has gained increasingly more focus. Furthermore, it is important to design an accurate representation and computational model for a trust-enhanced social network. To develop the practical applications of social network analysis, we compare and discuss the properties of trust in SNs and propose the main challenges to measure trust. A fuzzy context-based social network description model is proposed based on these challenges. Multigranularity linguistic variables are used in this model to describe trust relationships among agents. Trust relationship is mapped to a tuple that is named the trust score and contains two parameters: the degree and the strength of trust. We design a trust propagation operator, using t-norm and t-conorm, to estimate the trust propagation score. Then, a trust relationship model for group decision making in the new social network environment is proposed. Finally, an illustrative example of group decision making with incomplete preference information in SNs is given. We show how to use trust relationship to estimate unknown evaluations and complete group decisions in this example. The proposal can realize qualitative descriptions and quantitative measures of trust in social networks. The main differences or innovations of our trust-enhanced social network model are that we distinguish trust relationships according to context and quantify uncertainty in the trust network with the paradigm of computing with words.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy projection is a mathematical operator inspired by the inverse fuzzy transform that is used to approximate functions. The fuzzy projection is designed such that the coefficients of the linear combination of the basis functions (fuzzy sets in a fuzzy partition) are optimized to obtain the best approximation of the functions from a global perspective, as opposed to the fuzzy transform, where the approximation focuses on fitting functions locally. The aim of this paper is to extend the fuzzy projection to a higher degree, similarly to the fuzzy transform, where the coefficients of the linear combination of the basis functions are expressed by polynomials. In this way, we can significantly improve the quality of the approximation by combining the settings of the fuzzy partition and the degree of polynomnials. In this paper, we show that a higher-order fuzzy projection can be computed using matrix calculus, leading to an easy algorithmization of the method. We also give its approximation properties and its applicability to discrete functions. The usefulness of higher-order fuzzy projection is demonstrated on two tasks, namely continuous function approximation and audio signal compression and decompression, where the results are compared with other relevant methods.},

Furthermore, Einstein&#39;s t-norm and t-conorm are very useful and more dominant tools in aggregating the collection of information into a singleton one, where the algebraic t-norm and t-conorm are the specific case of the Einstein t-norm and t-conorm. In this paper, we aim to propose the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy soft (CQROFS) information which is the modification or generation of the complex Pythagorean and complex intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets. Some specific operational laws are also derived for the proposed work based on algebraic t-norm and t-conorm. Additionally, we also develop the Einstein’s operational laws in the presence of the CQROFS set. Consequently, based on the Einstein operational laws and CQROFS information, we derive the CQROFS Einstein weighted geometric (CQROFSEWG), CQROFS Einstein ordered weighted geometric (CQROFSEOWG), and CQROFS Einstein hybrid geometric (CQROFSEHG) operators. Some notable properties and valuable results are also explored. Moreover, we develop a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method based on the derived operators for CQROFS set.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy sets, which have a crucial role in the decision making theory, model uncertainty by means of membership and non-membership functions. q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, which are the natural extension of fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy and Pythagorean fuzzy sets, are quite successful in modeling data thanks to their larger domains. However, in a q-rung orthopair fuzzy set the membership and non-membership degrees of an element to a set are given just by a pair of certain numbers from the closed interval [0, 1] that causes a strict modelling. Various types of interval valued fuzzy sets, multi fuzzy sets or circular fuzzy sets change these strict modelling with a sensitive one. In this paper, we introduce a new fuzzy set notion via continuous functions that take values on a closed interval to provide a more sensitive tool in decision making theory. In this new fuzzy set notion, the membership and non-membership degrees of an element to a fuzzy set are represented by continuous functions instead of numbers. Actually, we study not only with points, but also with functions by taking into account the sufficiently large and continuous neighborhoods of the points. Thus more sensitive and realistic models are made by relieving the precision of the fuzzy data or linguistic argument. The data carried to function space environment is processed with the function theoretic tools via aggregation functions, distance measures or score functions. This fact distinguishes the new fuzzy set notion from the other continuous extensions in the literature such as interval valued or circular structures. Moreover, we provide an extended Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in this new fuzzy environment and apply it to a multi criteria group decision making problem from the literature. Finally, we provide a comparison analysis and a complexity analysis. We also visualise the time complexity of the proposed extended TOPSIS for different numbers of decision makers.},

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a number of outlier detection (OD) methods have been established over time to identify data that do not match the rest of the data. These data are anomalies, outliers, or irregularities because they result from hostile attacks or sensor node malfunctions. OD is difficult due to the classification process and the challenges in feature development. The limitations of conventional OD include insufficient feature learning, noise, excessive dimensionality, and a lack of training data. Unsupervised outlier detection (UOD) in WSNs is a new research area that has been ascertained to perform exceptionally well in terms of detection accuracy. The fact that prior knowledge of abnormal data is unknown, i.e., the ground truth of data is unknown for the classification of outlier instances, is a substantial barrier in UOD. This made it possible for researchers to examine flexible deep learning methods for domain-specific UOD, like Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). In order to achieve an appropriate categorization of anomalous data, this research suggests using a Modified Variational AutoEncoder (ModVAE) model with a rule-based approach. In the first stage of the proposed system, an adaptive VAE model is developed to produce modified latent space vector samples suitable for reproducing the data with reasonable reconstruction loss, and in the second stage, fuzzy rules are generated to precisely classify abnormal data with fewer false positives. The suggested model&#39;s efficiency is demonstrated with experiments done using benchmark datasets. The experimental results show improved performance when compared with other approaches available in the literature.},

However, FRBSs suffers from many drawbacks such as uncertainty representation, high number of rules, interpretability loss, high computational time for learning. To overcome these issues with FRBSs, there exists many extensions of FRBSs. This paper presents an overview and literature review of recent trends on various types and prominent areas of fuzzy systems (FRBSs) namely genetic fuzzy system, hierarchical fuzzy system, neuro fuzzy system, evolving fuzzy system, FRBSs for big data, FRBSs for imbalanced data, interpretability in FRBSs and FRBSs which use cluster centroids as fuzzy rules. The review is for years 2010–2021. This paper also highlights important contributions, publication statistics and current trends in the field.

  abstract     = {This paper discusses an Event-Triggered (ET) control of nonlinear system with time-varying parameters. Based on the modeling technology, polynomial Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is applied to represent the nonlinearity. By virtue of Linear Parameter Variation (LPV) model, the parameter depended on time can be modeled by combining the weighting function and linear systems. With the modeling technology and LPV description, the polynomial T–S fuzzy model is built to interpret the considered system. For the stabilization problem, fuzzy controller is constructed via the polynomial gains with time-varying parameters. Moreover, the ET scheme is applied for building a fuzzy controller saving the control cost. For the stabilization problem, a criterion is proposed and Sum of Squares (SOS) algorithm is utilized to find solutions. Finally, some simulations are provided for show the applicability of this paper.},

  abstract     = {The frequent occurrence of emergencies has created huge economic losses and numerous casualties and has seriously affected the sustainable development of many societies. The abruptness, destructiveness, unpredictability and complexity of emergency situations pose a great challenge in implementing appropriate responses. To effectively respond to emergencies, it is necessary to select the most suitable, or several, of the numerous emergency plan alternatives, especially when the evolutionary direction of the emergency is highly uncertain. Some progress has been made in the study of emergency alternative selection (EAS) but the capacity for emergency decision-making in real disasters is still quite limited. Therefore, more in-depth research is necessary. As a remedy to the EAS problems, such as unitary information expression, inflexible decision-making processes and insufficient attention to uncertainty, this study proposes a hybrid decision-making method that considers an intuitionistic fuzzy environment, linguistic environment and their hybrid environment, and implements the conversion and processing of decision-making information in different environments based on the Dempster–Shafer theory (DST). This model provides a more flexible evaluation method for decision-makers, and provides a complete decision-making process for EAS. A flood disaster case study from China is used to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Due to the diversity of information, many decision-making problems cannot be solved based on a single criterion. The complexity of assessment objects and the limitations of individual cognition cause the opinions given by experts uncertain, which further aggravates decision-making difficulties. Although fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets are proposed to express vague information, they still have the problem of losing information. As a tool to express uncertain information, interval techniques can effectively prevent the loss of information and improve the accuracy of decision-making. In this regard, many scholars applied interval analysis techniques and their fuzzy extensions to solve multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. This study reviews 195-related articles published from 2007 to 2022, and analyzes the research progress of interval analysis techniques and their fuzzy extensions in MCDM problems. Through bibliometrics analyses, publication and citation trends as well as productive countries can be intuitively and quantitatively obtained. Then, we review theories and methods regarding the combination of interval techniques and MCDM methods, and find that interval-valued fuzzy sets are extensively discussed and combined with TOPSIS. Next, real-world applications of these publications are reviewed, and we obtain that interval techniques are mainly used in supply chain selection. Finally, we propose future directions regarding interval techniques in MCDM problems. It is hoped that this study would be helpful for scholars and practitioners to carry out further research.},

This paper proposes a list of novel q-rung orthopair probabilistic hesitant fuzzy rough averaging/geometric aggregation operators to handle the uncertainty effectively and reliably to aggregate the uncertain information under q-ROPHFRSs. Several interesting elementary properties have been investigated. Furthermore, a novel multi-attribute decision-making approach based on the proposed aggregation information is presented.

  abstract     = {Forecasting the dam displacement is an important problem in dam monitoring. By using multi-temporal monitoring data to make predictions and forecast dam structure health, it is possible to detect abnormalities over time of the dam so that remedial measures can be taken promptly to minimize risks. The paper proposes a method of applying the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) and ant colony optimization (ACO) technique to forecast hydroelectric dams’ displacement. The method consists of two stages: The first is to design an IT2FLS according to the input and output data with base rules and newly constructed membership functions. The second is to find the optimal parameters for an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system based on the ACO technique and give the final fuzzy forecasting system. Experimental data are measured from hydroelectricity monitoring data of Ialy, Gia Lai Province, Vietnam, in the period from 2004 to 2016. The proposed method is compared with some other methods to compare prediction efficiency and accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed model has the best performance compared to other standard methods in both accuracy and stability of prediction. This shows that a predictive model based on the IT2FLS is a promising method and can be used for forecasting time-series data.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, benefiting from the abilities in implementation of the smooth operation on noises and preservation of the original gradient information on the texture edges, the guided filter (GF)-based fuzzy clustering has achieved inspiring performance in the task of image segmentation. However, different to image pixels, the general data samples do not have the spatial adjacency relations. Current GF-based methods suffer some limitations in general data clustering. To solve this issue, a series of improved GF-based fuzzy clustering algorithms are proposed in this paper for general data analysis. In the most basic algorithm, a new data filtering window is first defined according to the neighbor relationships between data samples, and a pruning mechanism is designed to ensure the symmetry of neighbor samples. Then, the GF-based Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is put forward for the general data clustering. In addition, a weighted version is presented to process high-dimensional data, in which each dimension is assigned a weight, and the entropy regularization method is applied to optimize the weight assignment and highlight the important dimensions on both filtering and clustering. Furthermore, the kernelization of the above methods are realized for the non-linear data. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate better performance of the proposed methods in comparison with some existing FCM-type clustering approaches.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy clustering is widely used in image segmentation because of its ability to describe the uncertain information presented in images. However, traditional fuzzy clustering ignores the spatial contextual information in the image, which makes it poor in processing images corrupted by high noise. In this paper, we present a novel fuzzy clustering algorithm called PFLWCM-CIM algorithm for noise image segmentation by introducing the image patches, the correntropy induced metric (CIM), and a fuzzy local weighted factor. Firstly, we use image patches as samples in clustering. Compared with individual pixels, image patches can preserve the local geometry of images by considering comprehensive features. Secondly, a new distance measure is developed on the basis of image patches and CIM to describe the relationship between samples and cluster centers. The CIM is more robust to noise than the traditional $$L_2$$ -norm. Next, a novel weighting method to characterize the similarity between two pixels named local weights is proposed. The local weights combine the spatial location relationship and the pixel value relationship of two pixels simultaneously, which describes the relationship between pixels from a more reasonable perspective. Furthermore, a new fuzzy local weighted factor is put forward by integrating the new distance measure and the local weights, then the PFLWCM-CIM algorithm is proposed based on the new factor and the idea of image patches. Several commonly used fuzzy clustering algorithms are incorporated into the experiments in segmenting images polluted by various types of noise. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has reached state-of-the-art results in several metrics.},

Uncertainties in this paper are deemed to be (possibly fast) time-varying and bounded, and the information of boundaries is creatively depicted via a fuzzy set. By this fuzzy depiction, a robust control scheme, which is deterministic and not the traditional if-then rules-based, is designed. On top of that, we construct an optimization problem that targets the choice of the performance-dependent control parameter. Then, the existence and uniqueness of the global solution to this problem, which could be solved by minimizing a fuzzy performance index, is proven. In addition to meeting active constraints, the Delta-type parallel manipulator under the proposed control scheme assures two attractive performances: the deterministic performance and the fuzzy performance. The results of simulations illustrate the validity and practicability of the control scheme.},

  abstract     = {To obtain a competitive advantage in the e-commerce presale mode, an e-tailer needs to design new products favored by consumers and consider the demand matching and supply chain services to achieve better operational results. This paper develops a data-driven optimization model based on consumer analytics and bilevel multiobjective programming to provide practical solutions for the e-commerce presale mode. At the upper level, the e-tailer, as the leader, identifies consumer preferences by quantifying product popularity through consumer analytics. Then, the e-tailer optimizes the product popularity to select the products suitable for presale and formulates the production plan. At the lower level, the logistics enterprise, as the follower, formulates the distribution plan based on the leader’s decision. Because consumer analytics are utilized and the model has a bilevel structure, a data-driven optimization method is proposed to conduct simulations for the proposed model. The model uses the multiple objectives binary particle swarm optimization with multiple social structures (MOBGLNPSO) and bilevel multiobjective particle swarm optimization with multiple social structures (Bi-MOGLNPSO). The results analysis and sensitivity analysis verify that the proposed model and method can improve the demand matching and operational efficiency of the e-commerce supply chain and uncover managerial implications for both the e-tailers and logistic enterprises.},

  abstract     = {The studies done on lung protective strategies in medical ventilators have shown that tidal volume of 6-ml/ kg predicted body weight protects the lungs of a patient during the invasive ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients in intensive care unit. Corona virus disease 2019 has increased the need for mechanical ventilation, which are operated manually, in changing the settings on the mechanical ventilators. In this study, fuzzy logic method is used to develop a computer-aided decision-making to improve on the accuracy of the reasoning done during the ventilator setting adjustment, by adding the fuzzy reasoning concept into the ARDS Berlin definition. The ARDS positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values were used in building the fuzzy rules of the fuzzy algorithm. From the experimental results, the algorithm mimics the recommended ARDS PEEP values with respect to the values of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2); the algorithm as well increases the respiratory rate and tidal volume for potential of Hydrogen (pH) less than 7.2; maintains the respiratory rate and tidal volume for pH between 7.2 and 7.4; decreases the respiratory rate; and maintains the tidal volume for pH greater than 7.4. The developed fuzzy system can therefore be applied as a physician–ventilator interface to guide the clinician/physician during the ventilation, so as, to reduce the human errors and ensure lung protection.},

Stimulated by this point, this paper firstly establishes Mittag-Leffler Euler difference for fractional-order fuzzy bidirectional associative memory neural networks, which includes exponential Euler difference. Secondly, global exponential stability and synchronization of the derived difference model are investigated. Compared with the classical fractional-order Euler difference method, the fuzzy Mittag-Leffler discrete-time bidirectional associative memory neural networks can better describe and maintain the dynamic properties of the corresponding continuous-time models. More importantly, it opens up a new way to study discrete-time fractional-order systems and builds a set of theory and methods to study Mittag-Leffler discrete neural networks.},

However, although Taitung is a renowned B&amp;B hotspot, it is the poorest area in Taiwan. This phenomenon has prompted studies on the contribution of B&amp;B tourism to counties. Previous literature related to B&amp;B tourism has the lack of non-economic measures typically results in contradictory phenomena. In addition, most studies have been empirical and have incorporated expert opinions, which are susceptible to human semantical uncertainty and incomplete expression. To overcome these limitations, a framework based on human-land interactions focused on cultural landscape, locality, and regional revitalization was constructed in present study. An advanced decision method, Z-DEMATEL, in which Z-numbers and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) are combined, was applied. The expression confidence and consistency were evaluated through information integration using exclusive sematic, confidence, and perception scales. Subsequently, the DEMATEL was used to analyze the internetwork relations between Dimensions/Criteria. In the overall dimensions, the locality was a nexus of interrelations, while the cultural landscape was a cause. In each dimension, such nexus and cause-starter were identified using specific criteria. The findings were synthesized as improvement plans for easy indexing. Therefore, the results can improve poverty alleviation through B&amp;B tourism.},

When a BS location is poorly deployed, it will cause the overall coverage of sensor devices (SDs) to decrease. Hence, the more BSs are required to increase the number of covered SDs in IoT systems. It leads to a higher deployment budget of BSs. However, BSs cannot be deployed everywhere in real environments. Taking the SDs positions and BSs candidate locations into account, we design an efficient and novel BSs deployment strategy to maximize the number of covered SDs and to reduce the deployment budget of BSs in IoT systems. We employ the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFS) to make an adjustment decision for determining suitable BSs deployment positions from the BS candidate locations. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed IFS BS deployment strategy achieves a higher coverage ratio of SDs and a favorable deployment budget of BSs in IoT systems.},

During the procedure of devising fuzzy state-feedback controller, two imperfect communication channels of the NCSs are taken into account, and the corresponding mathematical models are built by using two independent Bernoulli random distribution procedures. To deal with the negative effects of time-varying packet loss issue caused by imperfect communication channels and the limited network bandwidth, an innovative dual-thresholds ET scheme is firstly proposed for the nonlinear NCSs. Different from the existing ET mechanisms equipped a fixed threshold and adaptive ET schemes, the proposed dual-thresholds ET scheme considers the state error information and the time-varying data loss information, which can both abate the utilization of limited communication resources and solve the negative impact of packet dropouts. Then, according to the Lyapunov stability theory, the sufficient criteria are established to devise the desired state-feedback controller subjected to mismatched membership functions. Finally, the advantage of the presented strategy can be testified via some simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Many real−world applications are dynamic multi−objective optimization problems (DMOPs). The transfer of knowledge in the evolutionary process is believed to have advantages in solving DMOPs. However, most existing works can hardly be focused on the effectiveness of knowledge, which may lead to the negative transfer to degrade searching performance of the population. To address this issue, a knowledge reconstruction (KR) method is proposed for dynamic multi−objective particle swarm optimization (DMOPSO) using fuzzy neural network (FNN). The contributions of the proposed KR−DMOPSO are threefold: First, a knowledge extraction method, using a FNN model, is developed to obtain the domain knowledge of two successive Pareto optimal sets when dynamic occurs. Then, the domain knowledge can be applied to explore the evolutionary tendency. Second, a knowledge evaluation mechanism, based on the diversity and convergence of non−dominated solutions, is devised to select the domain knowledge. Then, the effective knowledge can be achieved. Third, a knowledge reconstruction strategy is designed to obtain the suitable domain knowledge. Then, this knowledge can be used to adapt to dynamic environments to improve the searching performance of the population. Finally, the proposed KR−DMOPSO is compared with other advanced dynamic multi−objective optimization algorithms (DMOAs). The results show that the proposed KR−DMOPSO is superior to other compared algorithms.},

The major objective is to create some innovative and useful notions that may be used to handle uncomfortable and unreliable information in practical situations. Additionally, we examined various types of relations and also justified them with the aid of some appropriate examples. The BCIFSRs have a broad framework because it is discussing both positive and negative aspects of membership and non-membership degrees with multidimensional variables. The proposed idea is more dominant and superior to the pre-existing ideas. Further, the application of the proposed method is illustrated to select the best robots. Robots can often improve output, effectiveness, product quality, and consistency. Furthermore, a score function is established for the proposed structures to choose the best robotics.

  abstract     = {The key to achieving the safety and reliability of the production system is to implement an efficient maintenance management system to reduce or eliminate equipment failures. Maintenance planning costs constitute a large part of operating costs. Determining the optimal maintenance policy plays a significant role in improving system reliability and availability as well as providing cost-savings. For this reason, it is necessary to determine and implement the most appropriate maintenance planning for the production system to ensure the reliable, smooth, and healthy operation of the system. The decision-making process is multidimensional and complicated due to the nature of the maintenace policy selection problem, so it involves various conflicting evaluation criteria in identifying the optimal maintenance policies. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) instruments are appropriate for such complex issues. In this study, a hybrid-two-stage-MCDM-approach consisting of Pythagorean fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS (PF-TOPSIS) are carried out to determine the best maintenance policy, which is one of the most serious issues, both tactically and operationally, handled by one of the largest food companies in Turkey. Five main evaluation criteria (reliability, safety, cost, added-value, and feasibility), and six alternative possible maintenance policies (reliability-centered, predictive, time-based preventive, condition-based, opportunistic, and corrective maintenance) are considered to specify the optimal maintenance strategies. As a result of the application, the most appropriate maintenance strategy was emerged as reliability-centered maintenance (RCM). Other alternatives were appeared as predictive (PdM), time-based preventive (TBPM), condition-based (CBM), opportunistic (OM), and corrective maintenance (CM). The validation of the method was performed using the PF-VIKOR technique as a comparative study. In the final stage of the study, a sensitivity analysis based on criteria weights was conducted to test the robustness of the proposed integrated methodology.},

Via the parallel distributed compensator design method, the fuzzy formation and containment controller are developed. Different from the existing paper, the formation objective of leader ships is completed by the feedback controller of itself. Via the fuzzy containment controller, the follower ships also can be forced into the specific region spanned by leader ships simultaneously.

Based on Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC) method and gain-scheduled scheme, a PDPF controller is established to guarantee the stability. However, stability issue of PDPF model is often more complex and difficult than one of the traditional Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model since the nonconvex problem caused by the coupling of variables. To avoid the nonconvex term, a parameter-dependent polynomial Lyapunov function is adopted to derive the stability criterion. Besides, the convex combination is employed to eliminate the restriction of time-varying parameters. Thus, some sufficient conditions are derived into the SOS form and solved by the corresponding toolbox efficiently.

Having modeled any uncertain heterogeneous omnidirectional mobile robot by using a unified uncertain three-input three-output second-order state equation, we combine the actor-critic reinforcement learning, integral terminal sliding-mode control (ITSMC), and ORFBLS online learning to propose an adaptive ORFBLS-based reinforcement learning formation control, abbreviated as ORFBLS-ARLFC, method. Via Lyapunov stability theory, the ORFBLS-ARLFC method is shown to accomplish asymptotical consensus in the presence of uncertainties. One comparative simulation and one experiment are carried out to exemplify the effectiveness and merits of the proposed ORFBLS-ARLFC method on cooperative omnidirectional mobile robots with uncertainties.},

Considering the reliabilities of the experts, we determine the weights of the experts by the similarities of the information provided by the expert with regard to other experts. Subsequently, using the evidential reasoning (ER) method, we aggregate the information provided by all experts and obtain the conditional probability of each object. The introduction of the ER rules and the weights of experts successfully solve the problem of conflict between the evaluation information. Then an approach is presented to calculate loss functions and thresholds, which reduces the subjectivity of the decision-making process. Next, the decision result of each object is deduced based on the minimum-loss principle. Finally, a case study about the selection of mask foundries during the COVID-19 is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Given its fast learning and problem-solving capabilities, the proposed WT2FBC is an important fuzzy neural network. The next step is to investigate how a WT2FBC-based FTC system can help solve the puzzles that plague the robotic systems. To achieve FTC, a control system with a computed torque controller and the WT2FBC estimator is provided. If the robotic system ever exhibits faults, it can consult an online fault estimator built on WT2FBC, and then compensates the faults. For more efficient, the total number of fuzzy rules of WT2FBC can be dynamically adjusted using a self-organizing algorithm based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution.

  abstract     = {In this article, an improved MULTIMOORA approach is proposed for multi-attribute decision making (MADM) using the fuzzy concept, best–worst method (BWM) and half-quadratic (HQ) theory. The fuzzy concept helps to capture the vague information derived from human judgement at different stages of decision making, while BWM helps to simplify the attribute weighing. The standard MULTIMOORA method uses three utility functions, namely the ratio system (RS) utility function, reference point (RP) utility function and full multiplicative form (FMF) utility function, for evaluating the alternatives and obtaining the ranking orders using each of the utility function scores, which are consolidated using dominance theory. However, the dominance theory in the existing MULTIMOORA method has limitations, like there is no way to ascertain the trust level of the consolidated ranking and the level of consensus among the three ranking orders. Also, there is a need for multiple comparisons during aggregation, difficulty in automation, and the problem of circular reasoning. To overcome the limitations of dominance theory, a new HQ theory-based aggregation procedure has been proposed in this paper, which also has two associated indices, one to ascertain the level of consensus from the three ranking orders from MULTIMOORA and the other to ascertain the trust level or reliability of the final ranking in the aggregated ranking. The new modification is expected to add to the trustworthiness of the MULTIMOORA decision tool. The applicability of the proposed approach has been demonstrated with cases on welding process selection.},

Secondly, with consideration of the difficulty of the online lateral velocity measurement, a Lyapunov stability-based RHF-SOF control with the gain scheduling method is proposed to control the variables of the path following. Thirdly, since the actuator saturation can deteriorate the control performances, a norm-bounded strategy is designed to address the nonlinear saturation problem.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the study of a photovoltaic system for type-2 interval fuzzy models via event-triggered control (ETC). Compared to similar works initiated in the references, the necessary part of modeling the ETC for the photovoltaic system ( $${\mathscr {P}}{{\mathscr {V}}}$$ ) is to produce the maximum path which should be followed to guarantee the most extreme power activity. The system models are expected to depend on uncertain parameters, which are mostly experienced in the real dynamical system. To describe the $${\mathscr {P}}{{\mathscr {V}}}$$ system with event-triggered communication delay, the behavior of a nonlinear system can be addressed by using the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy rules with lower and upper membership functions. In this regard, we construct the suitable Lyapunov– Krasovskii functional (LKF) and integral inequalities to achieve the stability conditions and expand the maximum sampling period of the closed-loop system. The main purpose of this study is to design the event-triggered mechanism such that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and to reduce the communication burdens of the $${\mathscr {P}}{{\mathscr {V}}}$$ system. For this, a sufficient condition is derived for the proposed system in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the suitability and merits of the newly suggested techniques.},

Different from the conventional used full-state constraints method (such as the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) approach), the asymmetric and symmetric full-state constraints problem can be solved without switching controller structure and no additional assumption about virtual control is required to be satisfied by the NSCF approach. To overcome the “explosion of complexity” problem of the traditional backstepping method, the fixed-time command filters (FTCFs) are used to propose the control strategy. Furthermore, error compensation mechanisms are designed to remove the filtering errors induced by utilizing the FTCFs. Under the backstepping control framework, an adaptive fixed-time control strategy is designed to ensure that all signals in the closed-loop system and tracking error are bounded within fixed-time, and all states are guaranteed to maintain in the predefined regions.

To address the above two problems, a robust control design and parameter optimization method is proposed for the task space trajectory tracking of the CRAS in this paper. First, a fuzzy dynamical model of the CRAS is established. In this model, the uncertainty is assumed to be bounded and described by fuzzy set theory. It provides a bridge between the dynamical model and the practical system. Then, based on the fuzzy dynamical model, a robust approximate constraint-following servo control is developed to guarantee uniform boundedness (UB) and uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the controlled CRAS. The proposed control can realize the trajectory tracking in task space without JMT, which alleviates the difficulty of control design and implementation. Third, the optimal parameter of the proposed control is selected by solving a fuzzy-based performance index. This performance index is formulated to merge the system manifestation and the control consumption. Finally, a numerical simulation of a dual-arm system is carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy logic, especially fuzzy reasoning, has been widely used in many real-world applications for its tremendous practical value. This paper mainly focuses on a new theoretical principle of fuzzy logic, fuzzy reasoning, and its applications. It starts with enunciating a novel foundation: the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning. We then propose a practical framework, which enables the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning to be applied to various applications. This framework is divided into discrete case and continuous case. In the discrete case, we first solve the sorites paradox. We then proceed to a pattern recognition problem. So far, these are all passive approach in that the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning is used as is to measure if the reasoning is valid. In the continuous case, we proceed to actively designing the reasoning so that the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning is always guaranteed through Lyapunov stability approaches. This is formulated as a control-theoretic task. The problem of reasoning is converted to a control design one. This is then applied to a vehicle following problem. Through theoretical analysis and practical demonstrations, we show how the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning can be conceptualized, articulated, and formalized in fuzzy reasoning.},

To perform the high-order practical tracking control objective, which is quite different from both the low-order control ones and the asymptotic stabilization ones, a coordinate transformation related to tracking error is introduced to make the tracking error be constrained to a prescribed interval including the origin in a fixed time by employing a finite-time stable function. A unique adaptive parameter is adopted to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions by applying fuzzy logic functions. Nussbaum functions are utilized to determine the unknown control directions. Based on the domination technique and the method of adding a power integrator, the provided controller can guarantee all the states of the closed-loop systems and control signal are bounded. Three simulation examples show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed tracking control strategy.},

This new approach involves the digital development and transformation of products through the synchronization of processes in real-time. In order to achieve the expected goals and be successful in the application of Industry 4.0 technologies, some important factors need to be identified. For this purpose, critical success factors, consisting of 9 main criteria and thirty sub-criteria, were identified based on a comprehensive literature review and the evaluation of the expert group. In addition to the criteria in the literature, the criteria qualified workforce structure, and project management were included in the study. Technologies that affect the critical success factors of Industry 4.0 were examined using hybrid multi-criteria analysis. In determining the weighting of the criteria, the fuzzy-based best–worst method (F-BWM) was preferred because it can better represent human thinking. In determining the best alternative technology, the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method was used, which can flexibly deal with incomplete and uncertain information without too much a priori information. The results showed that vertical integration is the most suitable technology that influences the critical success factors of Industry 4.0.},

To fully consider the effects of quantizations, a new GC function is adopted, where the quantized state and quantized input instead of the normal state and normal input are contained. The nonfragile GC controller design criteria of the discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems are derived, which are expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

In an increasingly complex and highly uncertain evaluation environment, how to effectively select emergency logistics providers has become a hot topic in the field of emergency logistics management. In this paper, by integrating the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (DHHFLTS), the normalized projection measure and the improved ELECTRE II method, a practical integrated decision support model is proposed to handle the ELPS problem. First, DHHFLTSs are utilized to represent the complex and uncertain linguistic evaluation information provided by decision makers (DMs) to provide subjective judgments. Meanwhile, a distance measure for DHHFLTSs based on the proposed normalized projection is proposed to reflect both the included angle and the distance between evaluation objects, and a weight-determining method based on the proposed distance measure and the maximizing deviation method is constructed. Then a new decision support framework of double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic ELECTRE II based on positive and negative ideal solutions is put forward, in which three kinds of preference relations of the concordance and discordance sets are set up to rank the alternatives more reasonably. Finally, a practical example of ELPS is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and detailed comparative analysis with other representative methods is also conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

First, the form of the system model is adjusted by comparing each state value involved in the system with the state value of the controller. Then, the fuzzy Lyapunov function is designed using the difference value of the comparison. Both of the above observer-based switching controllers can stabilize the system.

To handle with the uncertainty and hesitation factors that arise in real-world transportation problems, the cost parameters of the transportation problem are modelled here as interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. To solve the transportation problem, a new subtraction operation is developed, and the diagonal optimal method is applied for interval valued triangular and trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In addition, a new ordering for interval valued trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on the Yager’s formula which is in the existing ordering of interval valued triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is proposed.

The linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP) is a prototypical compromising model that adjusts the deviation between objective assessments and subjective preferences on decision alternatives. However, the disadvantages of Pythagorean fuzzy sets in conflict measure and LINMAP model in inconsistent decision information structure have not been solved yet. To solve the problems that incomplete decision information in Pythagorean fuzzy set and inconsistent evaluation structure in LINMAP, the spatial measures and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory are introduced. A new spatial structure conflict measure is thus presented, and the belief structure of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is used to provide a unified decision-making framework for LINMAP inconsistent evaluation structure. Firstly, a novel spatial distance measurement method is developed. Secondly, comprehensive closeness is introduced to measure individual order consistency and inconsistency between subjective preference and objective evaluation. Thirdly, we define the objective basic probability assignment and subjective basic probability assignment based on Dempster-Shafer belief structure to develop the bi-objective LINMAP of Pythagorean fuzzy sets and add the deviance between individual goodness of fit and poorness of fit is introduced as constraints to obtain the optimal attribution weights. Then, the final order of decision alternatives can be obtained by the fusion rules of Dempster-Shafer. Finally, we verify that the proposed method can improve the alternative discrimination in the case of unstable order, and the result of alternative order total biased of the proposed method is reduced by at least 80% compared with the comparative method.},

  abstract     = {The conventional state-space form often leads to control design strategies and stability analysis techniques generally applicable to dynamical processes. Nevertheless, it may also lead to higher model complexity and loss of interpretability. Here, we skip this representation for nonlinear dynamical systems with high-order input derivatives and nonlinear input–output relationships. Specifically, we incorporate the principle of $${H}_{\infty }$$ design within an observer-based adaptive fuzzy controller to guarantee robust stabilization and trajectory tracking for such nonlinear systems. The proposed approach has four integral components. Firstly, zero-order Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems approximate nonlinear and uncertain functions by the estimated states of the observer. Secondly, the $${H}_{\infty }$$ control attenuates fuzzy approximation errors, observer errors, and environmental effects to a prescribed attenuation level. Thirdly, the adaptive laws and the $${H}_{\infty }$$ term are met with simple equations, avoiding the positive definite matrices in Lyapunov equations. Fourthly, a compensation term is added to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system. Fifthly, the Lyapunov theory guarantees the asymptotic stability of the overall system and the $${H}_{\infty }$$ tracking performance of the output. Finally, the proposed method is applied to two unknown nonlinear systems under disturbances, noises, packet loss, and asymmetric dead-zone. The first is a second-order spring-mass-damper trolley system, and the second is a third-order nonlinear system. Comparing the results with a recent competing controller reveals that the proposed approach improves transparency and lowers tunable parameters, fuzzy basis functions dimension, the observation and tracking errors, the consumed energies, and the settling times.},

  abstract     = {Energy is an inseparable aspect of the twenty-first century; its utilization and availability have become highly relevant to the issues of climate change and growing demands. Welding is another vital manufacturing process that requires special attention due to its energy-intensive nature and environmental burdens. Thus, a study addressing energy consumption in welding processes without compromising product quality is the need of the hour. This study looks into the energy consumption of the seldom reported electron beam welding (EBW) process while welding a popular nickel-based superalloy (Inconel 825) without compromising quality by maintaining optimal weld strength of the weldments. Four EBW parameters viz., beam current (I), accelerating voltage (V), welding speed (S), and beam oscillation (O) are selected, and their influence on the net input energy (Enet) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is studied. The V is found as the dominant process parameter that has a direct influence on the Enet and UTS of the weldments. A Study on sensitivity analysis inferred that the value of UTS of the weldments is highly sensitive to the change in accelerating voltage sensitivity (0–300 MPa/kV). A weldment produced with an intermediate or higher Enet has determined to have the highest achievable UTS. Furthermore, a modified integrated optimization methodology combining fuzzy logic (FL) modeling with the meta-heuristic-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to satisfy both objectives, i.e., minimize net input energy (Enet) consumption while achieving the desired ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The methodology yields a minimum Enet of 0.1243 kJ/mm, at parameter settings of V = 60 kV, I = 38 mA, S = 1100.4 mm/min, O = 200 Hz, achieving UTS of 701.8196 MPa. The validation at the optimal parameter setting yields UTS of 711.3214 MPa with a deviation of 1.354% and is observed to be highly consistent with a faster convergence rate in the consistency test suggesting the superiority and robustness of the FL-PSO algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy logic has been successfully utilized in a plethora of disciplines, and this article is presenting, for the first time, the utilization of interval type-3 fuzzy sets in the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Type-3 fuzzy theory is a recently new proposal in the literature, and for this work, a study is carried out by varying an important element of interval type-3 fuzzy sets, called the LowerScale (λ) parameter, which is varied to create different fuzzy systems that are used to dynamically move a parameter of differential evolution during execution with the goal of improving its convergence. Experiments with benchmark functions and motor control optimization were undertaken to test the proposed type-3 differential evolution approach. This work aims to find out how the variation of the LowerScale (λ) influences the results on the two different presented case studies. Simulation results demonstrate that interval type-3 in combination with DE outperforms the type-1 and interval type-2 variants of DE, previously proposed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we firstly proposed a novel concept of complex interval-valued q-rung orthopair linguistic (CIVq-ROL) information by integrating the concepts of complex interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy (CIVq-ROF) information and linguistic set (LS), and it is more generalized than most existing sets, and it is very feasible and valuable for depicting awkward and unreliable information in a difficult situation. Further, we developed some new operational laws of the CIVq-ROF information based on algebraic t-norm and t-conorm. It is also clear that it is a very challenging task to fuse the collection of data into a singleton set in information fusion and decision making, and the Heronian mean (HM) operator is an important aggregation operator, which can not only achieve the aggregation function from the collection of data into a singleton one, but also consider the relationship between any two data. Therefore, based on the CIVq-ROL information and HM operator, we proposed the CIVq-ROL Heronian mean (CIVq-ROLHM), CIVq-ROL weighted HM (CIVq-ROLWHM), CIVq-ROL geometric HM (CIVq-ROLGHM), and CIVq-ROL weighted geometric HM (CIVq-ROLWGHM) operators, and then, the various desirable properties and specific cases of them are also investigated. Furthermore, we developed a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) procedure for evaluating the finest business in the country from the collection of four different types of electronics-related businesses based on the proposed operators. Finally, various examples are given to show the application of the invented techniques, and a comparative analysis is carried out for the parameters to show the advantages of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {To deal with uncertainty in a very precise way, the ambiguous set theory has been proposed. This theory supports the representation of ambiguities in terms of four membership degrees, namely “true,” “false,” “true-ambiguous,” and “false-ambiguous.” These membership degrees are linearly dependent on each other, because they are defined over the same event. However, these four membership degrees have the difficulty of unclear margins that prevent them to be separated from each other in the ambiguities representation of an event. To address this problem of unclear margins in the ambiguous set, the membership degrees are defined using four different functions, and called ambiguous membership functions (AMFs). These membership degrees are defined in such a way that their sum should be less than or equal to 2, and the individual membership degree should be in the range [0, 1]. To visually represent the uncertain margins for the membership degrees, the concept of an ambiguous region (AR) is introduced. In this study, various set-theoretic operations, their properties, and methods for measuring distances in support of the ambiguous sets are discussed. Finally, we discuss a real-time application of the ambiguous set theory with respect to solving the decision-making problem of choosing the appropriate colleges for students.},

Meanwhile, the monotonicity of proposed operators is also analyzed, and it is discussed that how they indicate the decision-makers’ optimistic and pessimistic decision attitudes with risk preference. Furthermore, a novel CoCoSo method based on Hamming distance measure is proposed, which considers both decision-maker’s decision attitude and attribute priority, and a multiple attribute group decision-making framework with two independent and parallel T-spherical fuzzy information processing processes are designed. Lastly, a real case of spent power battery recycling technology (SPBRT) selection is presented to show the practicability of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {In the family-owned traditional manufacturing businesses, the intricate required competencies and traits of a successful successor resulting in ineffectual acquirement of competent successors could be regarded as one of the main reasons of predicament of inefficient succession. The issues of selecting and training a competent successor should be closely correlated with corporate sustainability and competitiveness of the industries. Nevertheless, in most previous studies, which were related to the successor selection or identification of critical indicators of competent successors, the data collections mainly relied on the subjective viewpoints, expressed in natural language, of shareholders/entrepreneurs. Thus, for the purposes of selecting competent successors, but rectifying the fuzziness and indeterminacy of information, which was generated by the natural language expressions, this study proposed a hybrid successor-selection and efficient successor-training model. The model simultaneously took the incompleteness, ambiguity, and non-concordance of information into consideration. First, based on an intensive literature review and the results of roundtable meetings, an evaluation framework was constructed. Second, under distinct circumstances with varied purposes, the single valued neutrosophic set and triangular fuzzy set technologies were respectively applied to quantify the incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent information. Finally, Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)-based analytic network process (ANP) with a modified VIKOR (DANP-mV) method was employed to proceed successor-selection evaluation and to develop an effective successor-training program. Additionally, to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of this model, an empirical study of successor selection for a business in the pulp industry was further conducted. The research results considerably benefit family-owned traditional manufacturing industries to develop a successor-selection plan, establish a systematic and efficacious successor-training program, and remedy the conundrum of inefficacious succession. Furthermore, this research considered the fuzziness and indeterminacy of language expression, the developed model could be expected to propose an optimal feasible decision-making scheme for the real world.},

The fuzzy theory is integrated with the Q-learning algorithm to develop a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy. Both the actions and the Q-functions in the classical Q-learning algorithm are inferred by means of fuzzy rules. The proposed hybrid reinforcement learning is then applied to self-organizing holonomic motion control of parallel Stewart platforms for industrial applications. After the kinematics analysis using a geometrical approach and genetic algorithm (GA)-based Newton–Raphson formulation, this study develops a practical control scheme that combines fuzzy Q-learning and proportional–integral–differential (PID) control scheme, called FQPID. In the proposed FQPID holonomic motion control method, the PID control gains are online-tuned via the fuzzy Q-learning computation process. An experimental Stewart platform consisting of six servo motors, adjustable links, and two platforms is constructed to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented methods. The experimental results are compared with some existing control methods using the same evaluation criterion. Through the experimental results and comparative works, the superiority of the proposed FQPID control scheme is presented and discussed.},

Second, a nonlinear decomposition method for the hysteretic quantizer is applied to simplify the procedures of controller design and stability analysis. Next, an adaptive controller is designed using backstepping theory, and a fast finite-time stability criterion is introduced to confirm its effectiveness and stability. Then, a given simulation example and a practical nonstrict feedback application about one-link manipulator are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Grouting is a fundamental technology in engineering construction, and its grouting quality evaluation is a critical scientific problem. Proper and reasonable grouting quality evaluation is vital to ensure engineering safety. Standard research on grouting quality evaluation does not consider the uncertainty in the evaluation process and lacks multi-index comprehensive analysis. Because of the above problems, this paper puts forward a comprehensive evaluation method of grouting quality based on FRES-VFS. Firstly, based on the systematic analysis of relevant factors affecting grouting quality, the comprehensive evaluation of grouting quality is divided into three parts: the groutability before grouting, the rationality of design and construction, and the quality evaluation after grouting. Then, twelve indexes, such as the number of joints in the rock mass, the opening degree of the joint in the rock mass, the water permeability before grouting, the water–cement ratio of grout, the grouting pressure, the design parameters, the hole position, the borehole deviation rate, the construction parameters, the permeability, the compactness, and the durability after grouting, are selected to construct the rating index system. Secondly, the weight of each index in the index system is calculated based on the fuzzy rock engineering system (FRES) method. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty in the comprehensive evaluation of grouting quality, the uncertain mapping between evaluation grade and evaluation index is established using variable fuzzy set (VFS) theory. Finally, the comprehensive evaluation method based on FRES-VFS is applied to the Huanggou Pumped Storage Power Station grouting project in China, which provides a new idea for the comprehensive evaluation of grouting quality.},

In addition, a modified prediction error is defined to construct a composite parameter adaptation law, where the compensated error dynamic system equation is integrated in a moving time interval such that all historical data are integrated into a regressor vector to calculate the prediction error.

  abstract     = {A dynamic event-triggered adaptive fuzzy control scheme for a class of non-strict feedback stochastic nonlinear systems with injection and deception attacks is developed in this article. Compared with the static event-triggered control (SETC), the dynamic event-triggered control (DETC) guarantees a longer trigger interval, which means it can be more efficient in saving system communication resources. In addition, both injection and deception attacks are considered to realize the information security of the controlled system, and a single parameter adaptive law is constructed for the control strategy to reduce the calculation scheme. This scheme ensures uniform boundedness of all signals within the closed-loop system in probability and the output is not violating the given constraint. Finally, a digital simulation and physical model comparison examples are presented and discussed, which visualize the superiority of the above scheme.},

  abstract     = {Echocardiographic strain imaging is used to quantify cardiac deformation noninvasively through various techniques including non-rigid image registration. However, non-rigid image registration should be strong enough to deal with the poor spatiotemporal resolution of echocardiographic images. Extracting relevant features and calculating a suitable geometric transformation for the relevant features are the main parts of a registration problem. This paper aims to introduce a suitable geometric transformation for quantifying cardiac deformation based on a modified fuzzy inference system (FIS). The proposed method extracts relevant features of two echocardiographic images to generate proper rules for registration of two echocardiographic images. The modified FIS comprises two FISs in a series structure. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method for echocardiographic motion estimation with both in silico and in vivo databases. Applying the proposed method to the well-known STRAUS database resulted in 0.68 mm tracking error and 0.5 ± 3.78 relative circumferential strain error, which indicate the competitiveness of the proposed method with the state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, the obtained results from in vivo database, CETUS, expressed the potential of the suggested algorithm for clinical application.},

Thus, it has proved to be an efficient tool for solving group decision-making (GDM) problems. However, considering the expression of linguistic information of the current extended IFPRs is limited by a single linguistic term, it is still imperfect to deal with GDM problems. Hence, this paper first proposes a novel extended IFPRs as linguistic dual hesitant fuzzy preference relations (LDHFPRs) by utilizing a set of ordered linguistic terms to describe the preferred and non-preferred evaluation information, which recognize the uncertainty and hesitance of each decision maker and conform to real-life decision-making situations better. Subsequently, we construct the conditions of additive consistency and develop a maximum consistency linear programming model to cope with the problem of inconsistent LDHFPRs. Furthermore, a novel consensus reaching process which pays more attention to the minority but important individual opinions is established. Finally, a real-world application is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and a comparison with the existing related works is presented to show the advantages and innovation of the proposed GDM method.},

The objective is to associate these variables by country based on the identification of similarities in the historical information for each variable. The hybrid approach consists of computationally simulating the behavior of cognitive functions in the human brain in the decision-making process by using different types of neural models and interval type-2 fuzzy logic for combining their outputs. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed approach, because starting from an input data set, the artificial neural networks are responsible for clustering and predicting values of multiple time series, and later a set of fuzzy inference systems perform the integration of these results, which the user can then utilize as a support tool for decision-making with uncertainty.},

The dual structure of the model is designed, and the parameter conversion method of the two models during training is offered, so the gradient descent and back propagation methods can be used to train our model without intervention. The nodes in the model are composed of fuzzy membership functions, fuzzy logic connectives, and classification categories, which make it easy to transform the trained model into fuzzy rules and provide interpretations. Finally, the methods of rule extraction and reduction are further offered, and the causality contained in the model is analyzed. Compared with several existing neuro-fuzzy models on UCI and KEEL datasets, the results indicate that the proposed FNNC can achieve high classification accuracy and meanwhile provide interpretations in the form of fuzzy rules. The proposed method can achieve high accuracy without intervention while showing the decision process, reasons, and basis for classification. Moreover, by interpretations in the form of fuzzy rules that conform to human intuition, the proposed model can help people better understand, grasp, and analyze the classification process.

Moreover, the typical “complexity explosion” problem in the backstepping design process is avoided with the help of the command filtered technique and the unknown nonlinear terms are handled by the presented adaptive fuzzy control method. Based on Lyapunov stability analysis, it can be proved that each tracking error separately converges to the prescribed small neighborhood of the origin in a finite time and is always within the prescribed boundary, and all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded.

The $$q^{r}$$ OFSs can gradually adapt the region of information by adjusting the parameter $$q \ge 1$$ in response to the fluctuation degree, so assisting in the generation of more numerous possibilities. Aczel–Alsina triangular norm and conorm are superior operations that may create general and adaptable working principles for aggregating arguments. To make use of $$q^{r}$$ OFSs and Aczel–Alsina triangular norms in “multiple attribute decision-making (MADM)” issues, a few q-rung orthopair fuzzy ( $$q^{r}$$ OF) Aczel–Alsina aggregation operators: $$q^{r}$$ OF Aczel–Alsina weighted average ( $$q^{r}$$ OFAAWA) operator, $$q^{r}$$ OF Aczel–Alsina order weighted average ( $$q^{r}$$ OFAAOWA) operator, $$q^{r}$$ OF Aczel–Alsina hybrid average ( $$q^{r}$$ OFAAHA) operator for aggregating $$q^{r}$$ OFSs are exhibited in this article to fix the MADM issues based on $$q^{r}$$ OFSs. Some significant properties are additionally demonstrated. A technique for taking care of the MADM issues is proposed based on these created operators. The adequacy of the suggested technique is shown by means of a numerical example on enterprise partner selection, a lot of investigations and correlations with other existing strategies. The sensitivity of the proposed aggregation operators to decision-making findings is investigated. The demonstration outcomes suggest that the suggested technique has fulfilling universality and adaptability in aggregating $$q^{r}$$ OF data and acquiring the correlations of criteria and the attitudes of “decision-makers (DMs)” and is doable and compelling for taking care of the MADM issues dependent on $$q^{r}$$ OFSs.},

Observations reveal that dispersed and distributed designs of intelligent systems are gaining attraction. Due to the possible complexities of fuzzy logic computations, distributed architectures have the potential to add value to the development of fuzzy systems. However, the absence of best practices and standard methodologies may prevent widespread adoption. By broadening the IEEE-1855 (2016) standard in terms of system definition and data exchange, this research offers a standard solution for building a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) as a novel method of implementing fuzzy logic systems by means of a cloud-based collecting, processing, and examining data over the web. A comparison between the performances of a stand-alone hardware-dependent solution and a cloud-based solution (known as fuzzy-as-a-service) is performed. The analysis is also carried out on two different cloud service providers and software libraries (Amazon Web Services using JFML as a java-based library and Azure Web Services using Simpful as a python-based library). The analysis and evaluation are performed on a human fall detection scenario involving wearable sensors. The proposed algorithm can identify between fall and non-fall events. However, the results show that the processing time taken per 10,000 samples using smartwatch and mobile was 2220 s and 101 s for a cloud-based non-fuzzy machine learning system, 1111 s and 45 s for a cloud-based fuzzy system with AWS and JFML, and 1250 s and 97 s for a cloud-based fuzzy system with Microsoft Azure and Simpful libraries. It has been observed that a smartwatch with a fuzzy stand-alone crashed after processing 5000 samples and a mobile phone requires 179.42 s to process 10,000 samples.},

First, according to the negative influence of actuator failure, the dynamics of the considered closed-loop system is modeled by a T-S fuzzy system with the occurrence of actuator failure. The main purpose of the problem addressed is to design a fuzzy sampled-data controller, such that the closed-loop system guarantees the asymptotic stability with actuator failure. Then, a novel augmented two-side looped Lyapunov functional is constructed, which can make full use of sampled information. A novel negative-determination lemma is applied to deal with the delay-dependent quadratic polynomial that comes from the derivative of the functional. The sufficient conditions of stability with actuator failure are given as the basis of controller design. Furthermore, the proposed fuzzy sampled-data control scheme is proposed to obtain the longer sampling interval. Finally, two examples show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller design scheme.},

  abstract     = {Technology research and development (R&amp;D) plays an increasingly critical role in emerging supply chains by endowing products with desirable technical features. Due to unpredictable market acceptance, the technology concern coefficient, namely, the sensitivity of price to the technology level of technological products is uncertain in the process of R&amp;D, and usually only its partial distribution information can be obtained by referring to similar products or resorting to experts in related fields. It reflects the subjective uncertainty of technology concern, which is different from the existing relevant literature. Motivated by this challenge, we construct a new ambiguity set of possibility distributions to characterize the distribution uncertainty of technology concern and build a novel robust fuzzy tri-level optimization model for decision-making in technology R&amp;D supply chain (tRDsc) with government subsidy. Based on the proposed ambiguity set, we have derived the closed-form equilibrium solutions to the developed robust optimization model. At the same time, the equilibrium under manufacturer subsidy is consistent with that under consumer subsidy. Besides, manufacturer subsidy is more beneficial to the supplier, while technology supplier subsidy benefits the manufacturer more when the subsidy ratio is big enough. Finally, an application case about electric vehicles is studied to illustrate the effectiveness of our new optimization method. The case study shows that the government’s subsidy strategy may change when the uncertainty perturbation parameters change. That is, taking investment efficiency as the selection criterion, the change of perturbation set will influence subsidy policy choices.},

The proposed variable subscript hesitant fuzzy language set (VS-HFLTS) takes into account the subjectivity and differences of investors&#39; behavior when investing in the securities market, and extends the application of behavioral finance to multi-criteria group decision-making portfolio. To evaluate the financial products, the VS-HFLTS multi-criteria group decision-making portfolio evaluation system is constructed in the research. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic value function and the purchase appetite weight function are proposed to convert the natural linguistic evaluation into a quantitative score for the judgment of future portfolio return in the securities market. Furthermore, a variable subscript hesitant fuzzy linguistic portfolio model is put forward for the risk-averse, risk-neutral, and risk-seeking investment decision-makers. The optimal portfolio strategy is obtained by solving the equivalent non-linear model. Meanwhile, an optimized group decision-making portfolio strategy is established to better achieve the goal of increasing group decision-making investors&#39; returns or reducing risks. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to find effective frontiers for future portfolio selection, which verifies the validity and feasibility of the models and methods proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Technology advancements are essential to creating a successful green supply chain. Both internal and external features can influence a business&#39;s innovative development; thus, there must be relationships between these aspects for Innovative Development to succeed. Additionally, anticipating a supply chain&#39;s pattern of Innovative Developments might be crucial and help the business owners have a more perceived perspective about their business technological level future. In the first stage of this research, the correlations between management pledge, environmentally friendly design, and green material usage on the expected innovation level in green supply chains are investigated. Then, a new method for using fuzzy weights of the factors used in the Support Vector Machine algorithm is proposed. Then, using a new model coded that is proposed and coded by Python, the innovation level related to technology in green supply chains will be classified and predicted. The results are compared with Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gaussian NB, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. The outcomes demonstrate the superiority of the Support Vector Machine algorithm in terms of achieved maximum score and minimum error. The results of the data analysis showed that, in the cases under study, Top Management Obligations and Responsibilities (0.385), Environmentally friendly Design (0.392), and Green Material Usage (0.443) all had a substantial impact on the advancement of Innovative Developments. The suggested support vector machine model was also evaluated in 30 case studies, demonstrating that the model is capable of accurately forecasting technological advancement in green supply chains (score: 0.81). This paper contributes to the industry owners to allocate a set budget to the use of green materials, Management Obligations and Responsibilities, and Environmentally friendly Design in their businesses, leading them to reach a pre-expected level of Innovative Developments in their system.},

These concepts can not only overcome some defects of existing methods, but also be applied to multi-attribute group decision-making problems. In this paper, the centroid coordinate representation of PFN is first introduced with regard to the hesitation region, when considering the degree of nonzero hesitation, the hesitation factor is proposed by comparing with the smallest element (0,1), and a new ranking method for PFNs is given by calculating the hesitation factor in the Pythagorean fuzzy number environment. Secondly, the distance measure and degree of similarity are put forward through the hesitation factor and centroid coordinates, and the Pythagorean fuzzy priority weighted average (PFPWA) operator is given by improving the priority weight parameter. Besides, the basic properties of PFPWA operator are discussed. Finally, the positive (negative) hesitation factor solutions, bidirectional projections and degrees of closeness for group comprehensive evaluation matrix are obtained, and a new TOPSIS method for dealing with multi-attribute decision-making problems is given under the Pythagorean fuzzy environment. The given example shows that the proposed method not only expands the scope of application and reduces the loss of some fuzzy information, but also eliminates the impact of abnormal data on the aggregation results by considering the priority of experts.},

The finite-time command filter is adopted to solve the issues of “explosion of complexity” and the error compensation mechanism is introduced to deal with the filtered error. The neural networks (NNs) are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinearly parameterized functions. Then, based on the minimal learning parameters (MLP) algorithm, a new adaptive NN backstepping control scheme is developed and only two adaptive parameters need to be adjusted online in the controller design procedure.

Artificial intelligence is incorporated into the controller with the help of a formula-based fuzzy logic system. The designed scheme combines fractional order fuzzy PI (FOFPI) and fractional order fuzzy D (FOFD) controller, derived from fundamental FOPID control law. The proposed scheme enjoys the linear structure of the FOPID controllers with non-linear gains that provide self-tuning control capability. The sufficient condition for stability of the closed-loop system is also established using the graphical approach. Performance of the proposed FOFPI + D, its integer order variant (FPI + D), and conventional controllers is examined for control of a highly non-linear and uncertain two-link robotic manipulator system. The optimum parameters of controllers are found by minimising aggregated control variation and error objective through non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The comparison for trajectory tracking shows that FOFPI + D has the minimum integral absolute error (IAE) compared to other controllers. Further, rigorous performance investigations are performed to verify the robustness of designed controllers against parametric uncertainties, the varying boundary conditions of reference trajectory and disturbance rejection. It is concluded from the results that the proposed FOFPI + D controller exhibits superior performance.},

  abstract     = {In the context of the increasingly competitive post-epidemic social marketing era, the sustainable development of supply chain finance is also facing the impact of more complex risk factors. However, the issue concerning how to scientifically and reasonably select the appropriate applicant company for financing cooperation on the basis of risk evaluation remains unresolved. For the smooth operation of banks’ sustainable supply chain finance (SSCF) business, this paper aims to develop a novel multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method considering the robustness and comprehensiveness among risk attributes and decision-makers (DMs). First, based on the idea that quantitative assessment values and qualitative linguistic sets can more accurately express uncertain risk information and importance degree of indicators, a novel concept is proposed that combines the probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) with the plithogenic set to evaluate the risk attributes of each alternative. Additionally, risk decision matrices evaluated by DMs are integrated and transformed through the operation of PLTS scoring function aggregation operators and the plithogenic contradiction degree. For deriving the integrated weight information of attributes, the objective attribute weights are determined on the basis of the subjective weights by adjusting coefficients. Then, the ranking order of alternatives is generated by applying the VIKOR method and constructing a MAGDM model with plithogenic PLTSs. Finally, the solving of a practical example concerning the selection of financing objects for SSCF oriented by risk evaluation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model, where five risk indicators are developed, and the superiority of our studies is demonstrated by comparing with the existing TOPSIS and ELECTRE methods.},

  abstract     = {It is still very difficult to exploit possibilistic concepts to identify the strict parameters of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) while minimizing the dispersion of its constraints. In this paper, as a first contribution, an empirical study is presented within the framework of the development of a predictive model based on a linear regression model to interpret the phenomenon of VANET network congestion in a precise way by minimizing the dispersion of predicted outputs. The objective of the model developed is twofold: (1) to model the interactions between the traffic variables involved in the model and to exploit possibilistic concepts to identify the constraints of the VANET network based on a linear optimization under constraints, (2) to anticipate with precision the probability of occurrence of an unforeseen incident on VANET traffic. In addition, the traffic data involved in our model are observed vehicle speed, predicted travel time, observed travel time, and delay time. In addition, the accuracy of the prediction is proven by checking the relevance of the model according to the goodness of fit and the statistical significance of each explained variable. Our second contribution focuses on the design of a new technique for collecting, aggregating, and predicting real-time traffic flow. The main objective is to optimize the prediction error rate under strict conditions whose traffic parameters have unstable values. For this, we propose a traffic flow prediction approach based on fuzzy logic and regression analysis. The approach incorporates approved traffic parameters with the appearance of fuzzy least squares. To increase the prediction accuracy of the traffic flow and then arrive at a quadratic resolution under constraints, we integrate the Fuzzy Support Vector Regression for VANET networks (FSVRNET) model and Unified Particle Swarm Optimization (UPSO) algorithm in our approach. The chosen approach aims to model the interactions between traffic data observed from multiple data sources (e.g., connected loop detectors) to adjust the stability of traffic parameters in the prediction process. Our experimental study shows a strong correlation between the predicted data and the actual state of the VANET traffic flow. In addition, the prediction error of regression analysis is significantly reduced. Prediction performance using UPSO-FSVRNET is better with the proposed test set, as assumed by most identification methods.},

For easy processing of video stream, it is greatly necessitated to correct camera on a stand yaw/pitch/roll angles by utilizing various algorithms. The task is regarded as an easy one for hot object besides obviously visible in the infrared. Heat exchange process is greatly necessitated for registering initiation from a cold object. Boundary markers set positioning is accomplished on the supervised object in addition it requires an algorithm for recognition. A fuzzy assessed spatial relations-based approach is exploited previously for visual markers set detection on a rotating steel cylinder. However, that fuzzy assessed spatial relations-based approach not producing enough detection accuracy. To mitigate the above-mentioned issue this work introduces Intelligent Water Drop Optimization based Fuzzy Inference System (IWD-FIS) on the basis of fuzzy-intrinsic shape aspects such as objects, during a source image, and also their reciprocal reference frame. In this work Otsu algorithm is used for background as well as foreground segmentation. And then Features Extraction and Object Labelling are performed. Markers detection is done by using Proposed IWT-FIS based on the extracted features.

Firstly, considering the excellent approximation ability of fuzzy NNs to nonlinear function, based on dual fuzzy RBF NNs, this paper puts forward a novel fault diagnosis observer, which is used to accurately estimate additive faults and disturbances, additive faults and disturbances can be compensated in the proposed controller by applying feedforward cancelation technique to realize the fault-tolerant control. At the same time, considering the velocity sensor fault may be occur in practical electromechanical servo system, so the designed fault diagnosis observer can also be used to estimate the velocity of the system, so as to realize the velocity reconstruction in controller when velocity sensor fault occurs. Secondly, in order to improve the response speed and tracking accuracy of electromechanical servo system, a fractional-order integral sliding mode controller is proposed, which combined integral sliding mode control with fractional-order calculus theory to improve the transient response performance of integral sliding mode control. By applying the proposed fault diagnosis observer and fractional-order integral sliding mode controller, the proposed active fault-tolerant control for electromechanical servo system is realized.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the limitations of existing fuzzy sets and fuzzy numbers, researchers have developed a new form of fuzzy numbers called R-numbers. For problems related to planning or forecasting future events, or where there is some uncertainty in the available data, R-number uses a certain percentage of risk and error as a confidence factor for such data, eliminating discrepancies between available data and determined values. Given its advantages and flexibility, this study aims to propose an R-number multi-attributive real–ideal comparative analysis (RN-MARICA) method suitable for using in multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM). In this regard, firstly, this study defines the Aczel–Alsina operation for R-numbers. Based on this, the R-number Aczel–Alsina operators were created, namely R-number Aczel–Alsina weighted geometric averaging (RNAAWGA) operator, R-number Aczel–Alsina ordered weighted geometric averaging (RNAAOWGA) operator, and R-number Aczel–Alsina hybrid weighted geometric averaging (RNAAHWGA) operator, and their related properties were studied. Secondly, based on the R-number Aczel–Alsina operators, the multi-attributive real–ideal comparative analysis (MARICA) method is extended to the R-number MAGDM environment, which is called the RN-MARICA method. Finally, this study applies the proposed RN-MARICA method to the risk analysis of 5G base station project construction, proving the feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework.},

Population Coding (PC) is the most popular scheme, but it fixes static coding parameters and cannot realize the intelligent transformation of information. This paper proposes a new Adaptive Fuzzy Population Coding (AFPC) method, where parameters are optimized synchronously with SNN weights by the learning algorithm to realize coding adaptation. Because the membership function defined in the fuzzy theory is a generalization of the indicator function for classical sets, the receptive field functions used in AFPC are extended to intermediate membership functions instead of a single Gaussian type as in PC. The optimized receptive field functions in AFPC can be really involved in coding, so that the distribution information of training data represented in the spiking time series is more abundant. Numerical experimental results obtained on four benchmark datasets show that AFPC-SNN performs well in terms of classification performance, required number of epochs, generalization and stability. AFPC method can be theoretically and practically applicable to any SNN with SpikeProp algorithm.},

To overcome the shortcomings of these clustering validity functions and improve the accuracy of the optimal cluster category classification for the datasets, based on the clustering performance evaluation components, a validity functional component construction method based on the exponential and log form was proposed. The weighting method adopts the combination of expert empowerment and standard separation method to combine the five weights so as to obtain 52 different fuzzy clustering validity functions. Then, based on the fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering algorithm, the performance analysis are carried out by using multiple data sets. Experimental simulation of these functions are proceeded on six commonly used UCI datasets. A clustering validity function with the simplest structure and the best classification effect was selected by comparison. Finally, this function is compared with 8 typical single clustering validity functions and four common clustering validity combination evaluation methods on 8 UCI data sets. Through experimental simulation, the proposed validity function is compared in processing data sets, but also has strong scientific theoretical basis.

Fuzzy association rule mining is one of the major techniques in rule mining, and it often provides better rules and flexibility over quantitative rule mining by utilizing fuzzy set theory. The outcome of fuzzy association rule mining is greatly affected by the appropriateness of its membership functions. In this research, we have provided a comprehensive description of fuzzy membership function optimization as a Markov decision process (MDP) as well as introduced two novel algorithms- one for membership function optimization and the other for choosing the optimal number of membership functions for any given problem. This study proposes a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning technique that incorporates scalarization of different value functions while determining optimal policy and is able to construct optimized membership functions with better suitability and coverage. The proposed multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm outperforms well-known techniques in fuzzy membership function optimization by utilizing the exploration and exploitation mechanism. The performance of the proposed techniques is clearly validated by the experimental analysis incorporated in this study and is the first study that concisely treats fuzzy membership function optimization in terms of an MDP environment it opens up enumerable opportunities for future reinforcement learning endeavors.},

  abstract     = {Rail transit systems, one of the important public transportation (PT) systems, are widespread in large cities to satisfy passengers or commuters for their daily trips. However, rail transportation (RT) investments are costly, and the budgets are minimal. Thus assessing RT systems in big cities play a crucial role in deciding on the best RT investment. In this study, for the first time, a two-stage fuzzy set is used among the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) studies in the area of transportation. The proposed method is a unique technique integrating the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) techniques with an extension of Pythagorean fuzzy sets. In this manner, datasets from the observations of three rail lines in Antalya, one of the largest cities in Turkey, are applied to the proposed method. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), a commonly used MCDM method, is used to weighting four main criteria and thirteen sub-factors. AHP is strengthened by interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (IVPFNs). The Fuzzy VIKOR (FVIKOR) approach is then applied for the prioritization of three rail line alternatives. Results are achieved by analyzing not only real RT service observations, also actual RT expenditures or costs. Consequently, the uncertainty in results is thus minimized. Outcomes of the case study reveal the most serviceable RT line in the city evaluating the main criteria, namely economy, comfort, environment, and safety. Therefore, the proposed approach methodologically contributes to adopting a new insight into the integration of MCDM methods with fuzzy set.},

In this paper, we first provide an approach for constructing the FPR with multiplicative consistency, and then an algorithm of improving consistency is presented to generate an acceptable FPR, in which the initial evaluation information is retained to the largest extent through the local adjustment strategy. Then, an input-oriented CCR DEA model is developed to derive the priority weight vector of alternatives, which is followed that a DEA cross-efficiency model is constructed to discriminate multiple DEA efficient DMUs. Subsequently, the complete rankings of alternatives can be generated by a novel DEA-driven decision-making method. Finally, a numerical example is proposed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed method. The advantages of the developed method are performed by comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis.},

Multi-objective evolutionary fuzzy systems can obtain the fuzzy rules with high accuracy and strong interpretability, but the efficiency is low because they are often limited by the complexity of the problem. Therefore, a multi-objective evolutionary fuzzy system algorithm with a flowing data pool and a rule pool (FPs-MOEFS) is proposed in this paper. Based on the multi-objective evolutionary learning of fuzzy rules, an iteratively updated data pool is introduced, so that the next evolution iteration can focus on the current unpredictable data and improve the ability of the algorithm to find the global optimum; a fixed-size flowing rule pool is introduced to guarantee the diversity of candidate rules during the evolution while reducing the encoding length. To further improve the level of evolution, the co-evolution algorithm is integrated into the multi-objective framework, and a set of fuzzy rules with a strong fitting ability and high interpretability are obtained. The interpretations of neural networks by fuzzy rules are visualized on the artificial data. Comparative studies with other algorithms on UCI datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed method can provide interpretations in the form of fuzzy rules for any kind of neural network with high interpretability and high accuracy. Therefore, it has good application prospects in the fields that need to understand the decision-making process and reasons of neural networks, especially in the high-risk decision-making fields.},

Furthermore, the dead zone nonlinearities are handled using the information for dead zone slopes.

The continued process of data sensing, transmitting and processing depletes the energy capacity of nodes rapidly. To overcome these issues, energy-efficient sensor nodes are to be established in the network to prolong the network lifetime. Therefore, to decrease the energy consumption and to increase the network lifetime, a novel fuzzy type 2 hybrid Archimedes (FT2HA) approach for energy-efficient WSN is established in this paper. In this, the Hybrid Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (HAOA) is utilized to maximize the convergence speed and to enhance the searching process thereby obtaining an optimal solution. Along with this, the Type 2 fuzzy logic system is employed for efficient cluster head selection. To evaluate the performances of the proposed FT2HA method, different performance metrics like network lifetime, energy consumption, residual energy, end-to-end delay, overhead control, throughput, stability period, and packet delivery ratio are utilized. In addition, the comparative analysis is carried out between the proposed FT2HA method and other existing methods such as TF-SCR, MECMOA, CTEEDG and FBECS protocols to find the effectiveness. The experimental analysis illustrates that the proposed FT2HA approach has shown a significant enhancement to various techniques.},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition from facial images is an important and active area of research. Facial features are widely used in computer vision for emotion interpretation, cognitive science, and social interaction. To obtain accurate analysis of facial expressions (happy, angry, sad, surprised, disgusted, fearful, and neutral), a complex method based on human–computer interaction and data is required. It is still difficult to develop an effective and computationally simple mechanism for feature selection and emotion classification. In this paper, an emotion recognition model using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system optimized with particle swarm optimization is proposed. The proposed model was compared with many classification algorithms (ANNs, SVMs, and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and their subcomponents). The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the performance of these classifiers. The proposed model was evaluated using the MUG database. The model achieved a prediction accuracy of 99.6%.},

Again, a novel estimation algorithm Robust Extended Complex Kalman Filter (RECKF), is used to estimate per-unit in phase fundamental component of the reference current. A novel Self-Adaptive Fuzzy-PID Controller (SAFPIDC) is adopted to create the maximum value of the reference current. All the parameters of the proposed controller are optimized by an Improved Football Game Optimization (IFGO) technique.

The comparative simulation and experimental results reflect the better performance of IFGO-SAFPIDC-HSAPF with respect to Football Game Optimization (FGO) optimized SAFPIDC or Conventional PID Controller (CPIDC)-based HSAPF using two different estimation algorithms considered such as RECKF and Extended Complex Kalman Filter (ECKF).},

  abstract     = {Among cancer types, lung cancer has one of the highest mortality rates worldwide. Clinicians currently use magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography (CT) to diagnose lung cancer in patients. For lung cancer detection, improving the accuracy of diagnosis or detection through CT is a challenging task. Therefore, this study proposes a fusion-based convolutional fuzzy neural network (F-CFNN) that identifies and classifies CT images. The F-CFNN has a convolutional fuzzy neural network (CFNN) that uses two convolutional and two pooling layers to extract features and utilizes a fuzzy neural network to provide robust classification results. Furthermore, five fusion methods are used, namely global max pooling (GMP), global average pooling (GAP), channel global max pooling (CGMP), channel global average pooling (CGAP), and network mapping fusion (NMF). In the F-CFNN, parameter selection is generally conducted through trial-and-error; therefore, the Taguchi method is applied to identify the optimal parameter combination of the network. To validate the proposed method, the SPIE-AAPM public data set is used in this experiment. The experimental results indicate that the classification accuracy of the F-CFNN with NMF is 93.26%. In addition, after the Taguchi method is applied to identify the optimal parameter combination, the classification accuracy of the Taguchi-based F-CFNN with NMF is increased to 99.98%.},

  abstract     = {As an important technique in safety and reliability analysis, failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) has been widely utilized to identify and eliminate existing and potential failure. When evaluating the failure modes (FMs), the weights of different FMs are always incompletely known, and different information forms are used to describe the risk assessment issues. The objective of the paper is developing a new approach to solve risk assessment problems faced by four transportation forms in fuzzy and complex environment. In the process of the assessment, the unbalanced double hierarchy linguistic term set (UDHLTS) is used as a linguistic technique to describe the information reasonably and practically. The contributions of this paper are reflected in the following four aspects. Firstly, three linguistic scale functions (LSFs) of the UDHLTS are improved and a semantic model with distinct linguistic cognitive bias parameters is constructed and unified. Secondly, multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method is applied to FMEA, and an FMEA-MACBETH model is presented to address the risk assessment problems under UDHLTS environment. Meanwhile, weight determination method is built based on the CRITIC method under the situation of completely unknown weights. Finally, a case study of risk assessment in different transportation forms is used to explain the feasibility and rationality of the presented method. Comparison and discussion are conducted to further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

This is a promising technology with advantages in comparison with the existing lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries such as lower production cost and higher energy density. In this study, a state-of-the-art Li–S prototype cell is subjected to experimental tests, which are carried out to replicate real-life duty cycles. A system identification technique is then used on the experimental test results to parameterize an equivalent circuit model for the Li–S cell. The identification results demonstrate unique features of the cell’s voltage-SOC and ohmic resistance-SOC curves, in which a large flat region is observed in the middle SOC range. Due to this, voltage and resistance parameters are not sufficient to accurately estimate SOC under various initial conditions. To solve this problem, a forgetting factor recursive least squares (FFRLS) identification technique is used, yielding four parameters which are then used to train an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The Sugeno-type fuzzy system features four inputs and one output (SOC), totalling 375 rules. Each of the inputs features Gaussian-type membership functions while the output is of a linear type. This network is then combined with the coulomb-counting method to obtain a hybrid estimator that can accurately estimate SOC for a Li–S cell under various conditions with a maximum error of 1.64%, which outperforms the existing methods of Li–S battery SOC estimation.},

Using the established TOPSIS method, a decision-making procedure is proposed under q-rung orthopair fuzzy hypersoft environment to solve the uncertain and ambiguous information.

An improved sliding-mode surface is incorporated into the controller, providing the system’s state with a faster convergence rate away from the stable equilibrium. The chattering problem in the controller is eliminated by designing fuzzy control rules which are derived from the Lyapunov energy function. A disturbance estimator is proposed to compensate for unknown dynamic and disturbances, which enhances the robustness and stability of the system.

Multiple vessels depart from a base to perform pipeline inspections using loaded UAVs such that the total travel cost of all vessels is minimized. A two-stage formulation with fuzzy parameters is established to address the collaborative optimization problem. The first-stage solves a UAV routing problem to determine the fuzzy service time at each OF. In particular, we use the triangular fuzzy number to characterize the inspection time uncertainty of UAVs on pipelines. The obtained fuzzy service time serves as the input for the second-stage vessel routing problem, which includes chance constraints. We then apply the credibility theory to transform the model into a deterministic and tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which can be solved using commercial solvers. However, given the NP-hardness of the studied problems, commercial solvers have difficulty when practical-sized instances are involved. To this end, we further develop a saving heuristic and a genetic-tabu search heuristic to solve the first- and second-stage models, respectively. We conduct numerical experiments using a practical-sized illustrative example to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.},

Then, a noise reduction term is added to the loss function to achieve a trade-off between the anti-noise effect and parameter identification accuracy. Furthermore, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is embedded into the parameter identification algorithm to achieve adaptive coefficient optimization. Finally, the simulation and experimental data are utilized for parameter identification and performance validation. By comparing with the recursive least-squares algorithm and least-squares support vector machine algorithm, the excellent anti-noise and maneuvering prediction abilities of the proposed ANLS algorithm are verified, i.e., up to 84% reduction of the identification error in the simulation and less than $$4^\circ$$ of the heading angle prediction error in the experiment.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new fault estimation observer for nonlinear Markovian jump systems. Following the interval type-2 fuzzy logic rules, the original system can be approximated as an interval type-2 fuzzy Markovian jump system. For such a system, we develop a new intermediate fault estimation observer, in which a variable is introduced to estimate actuator faults. Significantly, a larger design freedom can be achieved by providing the observer gain matrix in the new form. To further evaluate the proposed method, multiple fault cases are considered. The proposed method proves effective in the simultaneous fault estimation for both actuator fault and sensor fault. Furthermore, two examples are simulated to numerically verify the feasibility of the given method.},

A semi-Markov chain is introduced to reveal the switches of different attack degrees on actuators. The transition probabilities (TPs) and the sojourn-time probability density functions (ST-PDFs) of the introduced semi-Markov chain are partially unavailable because of unpredictable DoS attacks. Through introducing the upper bound of the sojourn time for each attack mode and giving an enlarged known threshold to unavailable TPs and/or ST-PDFs, the sufficient conditions for the $$\sigma$$ -mean square stability ( $$\sigma$$ -MSS) with performance of output tracking system are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Attack-tolerant controllers are then designed to overcome those stochastic DoS attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by a simulation study.},

Firstly, a modified fractional-order filter (FOF) is adopted to handle the issue of singularity inherent in the constraint domain under the backstepping framework. Meanwhile, the error compensation signal is designed to eliminate the negative effect of filter errors. Secondly, a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is utilized to accommodate the multiple objective constraints. Furthermore, the event-triggered rule with a relative threshold is constructed to neutralize the communication burden. Following the fixed-time stability criterion, it is demonstrated that the proposed control scheme not only ensures that the tracking error is adjusted to a residual set within a fixed time, but also multiple objective functions are confined within the specified range.

Second, based on the nominal model, a finite-time fuzzy adaptive control scheme is designed to deal with the control problem of two inputs from multiple elevators and two outputs for the vertical motion states. To reject uncertainties such as model uncertainty and external disturbances, robust and adaptive backstepping control laws are designed. Meanwhile, fuzzy approximation technique is employed to estimate the hydrodynamic terms. Based on the Lyapunov theory, the stability of the proposed control scheme is analyzed in detail. Finally, numerical simulation results show that the control laws guarantee the simultaneously tracking and pitch control in the presence of disturbance and enable the towed vehicle to follow the bottom terrain for the near-seabed survey mission.},

  abstract     = {Studying the stability of the open-pit mine slope and risk assessment is of great significance to the safety of the mine and guiding mining operations. The stability study and risk assessment of open-pit mine slopes are a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. Due to the rapid development of information technology, a large number of decision makers (DMs) are allowed to participate in the decision-making process, which is beneficial to improve the quality of decision-making. We proposed a large-scale multi-attribute group decision (LSMGDM) model based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and applied this model to the study of slope stability and risk assessment in open-pit mines. Most existing LSMGDM methods assume that all alternatives are flawless. However, ensuring that all initial alternatives qualify is difficult. In addition, on the issue of LSMGDM, the opinions of some DMs may be very different from the collective opinions, but they are unwilling to make any revisions to the evaluation information. In order to improve the efficiency of the Consensus-Reaching Process (CRP), reasonable and effective management of the non-cooperative behavior of DMs is required. The main contributions of this work are as follows: (1) calculate the defect degree of each alternative with the TOPSIS method, give the method of modifying and perfecting the alternative, and give the corresponding algorithm description and operation steps. (2) A CRP model based on IFS is proposed. DMs were clustered using the intuitionistic fuzzy C-means clustering method. Then a method of identifying and managing non-cooperative behaviors based on IFS is proposed, and the corresponding algorithm description and operation steps are given. (3) An effective LSMGDM method is provided for slope stability research and risk assessment of open-pit mines. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by comparative analysis.},

Fuzzy systems are considered to be a highly useful and applicable tool for designing effective ABS controllers. In this survey, first, the preliminary information regarding the ABS control, such as vehicle dynamics and tire models, is presented. Then, various type-1 (T1) and type-2 (T2) fuzzy logic systems and the structures of ABS controllers are examined and classified into distinct general categories. Finally, different research papers published in this field on different types of fuzzy logic-based control systems (e.g., fuzzy proportional integral derivative, fuzzy sliding-mode controllers, fuzzy neural networks, etc.) and also on other control techniques based on T1 and T2 fuzzy systems are compiled and reviewed.

One contribution of this study is to develop a new score function for comparing the magnitude of IVq-ROFNs. We construct the variance value-based index for analyzing different score functions and the results show that the developed score function well improves the fluctuation of IVq-ROFNs and has much stronger ability to distinguish IVq-ROFNs. The second contribution is that interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy neutral operational law is investigated and a new interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted average neutral aggregating (IVq-ROFWANA) operator is proposed. We conduct a detail comparison analysis with the existing operators and show that the calculated results obtained by them are consistent. The third contribution is that a new interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy preference selection index and complex proportional assessment (PSI-COPRAS) method is developed. On the one hand, we propose the similarity-proximity degree based-weight determination method for identifying the experts’ weights and modify the classical PSI method to identify weights of attributes under IVq-ROFNs environments. On the other hand, we introduce interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy COPRAS to rank alternatives. Finally, the proposed method is implemented in warning risk evaluation of hypertension in residents to demonstrate its applicability. Comparing with the classical TOPSIS, MOORA and MABAC, the biggest advantage of the developed method is that that it can not only fully consider the influences of the maximum and minimum attribute indices but also allow both the weights of attributes and experts to be completely unknown in advance.},

This study extends the normal wiggly hesitant fuzzy set (NWHFS) to propose a novel fuzzy set, the normal wiggly probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (NWPHFS), with the aim of further mining the probability hesitation fuzzy information hidden in expert assessment and improving the limitation pertaining to the inability of NWHFS in containing membership. To establish the theoretical basis for operationalizing NWPHFS, we put forward a preliminary theoretical and methodological framework of NWPHFS, which formulates the concept of cut set and decomposition theorem of NWPHFS, defines a score function of NWPHFS, and clarifies the basic properties and operations of NWPHFS. Finally, two aggregation operators of NWPHFS are proposed. The proposed NWPHFS method can comprehensively consider the subjective preference of membership importance and the potential preference of membership itself in expert assessment so as to mine the real preference of experts entirely, thus enhancing the rationality of decision-making. Furthermore, to demonstrate its application and superiority, NWPHFS is applied to multi-criteria battlefield threat assessment in a hypothetical war scenario, and compared with other types of fuzzy sets. Our study shows that NWPHFS can more comprehensively excavate and utilize the deep uncertainty information in expert assessment, and has great potential in applying to practical decision-making scenarios, such as battlefield threat assessment, a complex military decision-making problem heavily dependent on expert judgment.},

In contrast to some existing literatures, input quantization is considered in non-affine multi-agent systems, which not only reduce the waste of resources between agents communication, but also can better represent the systems in practical engineering. Then, by applying a Nussbaum function and nonlinear decomposition, the obstacles of unknown control direction cased by non-affine and input quantization are successfully circumvented. On this basis, a state observer based on fuzzy logic systems is constructed to counteract the unmeasurable states and unknown nonlinear dynamics of non-affine multi-agent systems. Through Lyapunov stability theory based on dynamic surface control, it is proved that all signals in multi-agent systems are cooperative semi-global uniform and ultimately bounded (CSUUB). The consistency tracking error and the estimation error converge on a small neighborhood of the origin. Finally, simulation experiment show the effectiveness of the above methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal medical image fusion has emerged as a famous and efficient tool in medical applications. The major goal of this fusion is to fuse diverse multi-modal medical images attained from varied imaging modalities into a single fused image, which is broadly utilized by surgeons for the precise diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Multi-modal medical images generally consist of captured images with the specific organ of a patient. These images will indicate a modality, which will provide the observed organ in a different way that leads to dissimilar examinations of a specific incident like stroke. The detection with more suitable clinical decisions is taken by the accurate analysis of each modality. Multi-modal medical imaging is an efficient research area that incorporates the improvement of robust techniques, which can facilitate the information of image fusion attained with diverse sets of modalities. The major goal of this paper is to develop the multi-modal medical image fusion model using the new hybrid meta-heuristic approach. At first, the high-frequency sub-bands and low frequency sub-bands of the images that to be fused split by the weighted fast discrete curvelet transform (W-FDCuT). Once the sub-bands are split, the high-frequency sub-bands of the two images are fused by the optimized Type-2 fuzzy entropy. On the other hand, Averaging approach is used for performing the fusion of low frequency sub-bands. Finally, the inverse W-FDCuT is done for generating the final fused image. To improvise the performance of W-FDCuT and Type-2 fuzzy entropy, the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm named hybrid jaya with sun flower optimization (HJ-SFO) is adopted, thus enhances the significant parameters by maximizing the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). The comparison over the conventional image fusion models proves the efficiency of the proposed model in terms of diverse analysis.},

Instead of fuzzy parallel distributed compensation, a decentralized nonlinear pseudo state-feedback is developed for each subsystem to stabilize the overall AFLSS. Using Lyapunov stability, sufficient conditions with low codemputational effort and free gains are derived in terms of matrix inequalities. The proposed controller guarantees asymptotic stability, robust stabilization, and $${H}_{\infty }$$ control performance of the AFLSS. A numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Consumers perform decision-making (DM) processes to select their preferred brands during their entire consumer journeys. These DM processes are based on the multiple perceptions they have about the products available in the market they are aware of. These consumers usually perform different DM strategies and employ diverse heuristics depending on the nature of the purchase, ranging from more pure optimal choices to faster decisions. Therefore, the design of realistic DM approaches for modeling these consumer behaviors requires a good representation of consumer perceptions and a reliable process for integrating their corresponding heuristics. In this work, we use fuzzy linguistic information to represent consumer perceptions and propose four consumer DM heuristics to model the qualitative linguistic information for the consumer buying decision. In particular, we use 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic variables, which is a substantially more natural and realistic representation without falling in a loss of information. The set of selected heuristics differ in the degree of involvement the consumers give to their decisions. Additionally, we propose a heuristic selection mechanism to integrate the four heuristics in a single DM procedure by using a regulation parameter. Our experimental analysis shows that the combination of these heuristics in a portfolio manner improves the performance of our model with a realistic representation of consumer perceptions. The model’s outcome matches the expected behavior of the consumers in several real market scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The diagnosed complex Pythagorean fuzzy (CPF) set is a more valuable and dominant tool than the Pythagorean and intuitionistic fuzzy sets to describe awkward and unreliable information more effectively. Further, Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm have a significant influence to depict the relation among aggregated values. To take advantage of the CPF set and Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm, and assume the relation among Archimedean norms and algebraic, Einstein, Hamacher, and frank norms at the same time, in this analysis, first, we proposed the fundamental Archimedean operational laws. Second, based on these laws, we developed confidence CPF Archimedean-weighted averaging (CCPFSAWA), confidence CPF Archimedean-ordered weighted averaging (CCPFSAOWA), confidence CPF Archimedean-weighted geometric (CCPFSAWG), confidence CPF Archimedean-ordered weighted geometric (CCPFSAOWG) operators and implemented their valuable results and properties. We know that Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm are the general form of the all-aggregation operators, so by using different values of t-norm and t-conorm, we explored the confidence CPF-weighted averaging (CCPFWA), confidence CPF-ordered weighted averaging (CCPFOWA), confidence CPF Einstein-weighted averaging (CCPFEWA), confidence CPF Einstein-ordered weighted averaging (CCPFEOWA), confidence CPF Hamacher-weighted averaging (CCPFHWA), confidence CPF Hamacher-ordered weighted averaging (CCPFHOWA), confidence CPF frank-weighted averaging (CCPFFWA), confidence CPF frank-ordered weighted averaging (CCPFFOWA), confidence CPF-weighted geometric (CCPFWG), confidence CPF-ordered weighted geometric (CCPFOWG), confidence CPF Einstein-weighted geometric (CCPFEWG), confidence CPF Einstein-ordered weighted geometric (CCPFEOWG), confidence CPF Hamacher-weighted geometric (CCPFHWG), confidence CPF Hamacher-ordered weighted geometric (CCPFHOWG), confidence CPF frank-weighted geometric (CCPFFWG), and confidence CPF frank-ordered weighted geometric (CCPFFOWG) operators. Then, we developed a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method based on the proposed operators. Finally, many examples are used to do comparative analysis among proposed and existing methods to show the validation of the new approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an automatic hitting-duration estimation method for a rechargeable impact wrench using a fuzzy neural network (FNN) to reach target torques. To manipulate a commercial rechargeable impact wrench to output a proper torque for a fastener and battery specification, an operator must determine the corresponding hitting duration based on experiences and experimental trials. Nevertheless, the determined hitting duration is fixed and cannot adapt to changes in battery voltage outputs affected by several factors, such as battery capacity and degradation, which leads to poor torque regulation. This paper addresses this problem by applying an FNN to estimate proper hitting durations to achieve target torques under different battery conditions. Without additional embedding of torque feedback sensors on the impact wrench, this paper feeds four easily available states as inputs to the FNN, including motor revolutions per minute, motor current, battery voltage, and target torque. Supervised input–output data are collected to train the FNN to estimate the optimal hitting durations for target torque regulation. The FNN-based hitting-duration estimation method is implemented in a microcontroller unit to control a real rechargeable impact wrench with different power sources. Experimental results show that proper hitting durations are estimated by the FNN under different battery conditions to control the rechargeable impact wrench to achieve different target torques.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new intelligent control algorithm for the decoupling control of a class of single-input fourth-order underactuated nonlinear systems. By introducing an intermediate variable, a coupling sliding surface of two second-order sliding surfaces can be defined. Then, by applying a single-input fuzzy brain emotional cerebellar model articulation controller (FBECMAC)-based control system, the decoupling control of underactuated systems can be achieved with favorable transient response. The proposed control system consists of an FBECMAC and a fuzzy compensator. The FBECMAC is used as the main controller to approach an ideal controller to achieve desired control performance, and the fuzzy compensator is used to eliminate the approximation error to achieve system stability. The brain emotional model has an amygdala cortex and an orbitofrontal cortex, so the FBECMAC contains two neural networks; the amygdala cortex is a decision-making neural network and the orbitofrontal cortex is an emotional neural network. The proposed FBECMAC is adaptive and can adjust the parameters to achieve efficient control performance. The fuzzy compensator can also adjust its singleton fuzzy value to satisfy system stability. Finally, the FBECMAC-based decoupled sliding mode control system is applied to control one degree underactuated systems, such as a bridge crane and an aeroelastic system. Simulation results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. The proposed method can be applied to the practical systems if the computation time is acceptable for these practical systems.},

A key feature of this paper is to present a new method for generating plural complicated paths and for achieving coordinated path following control of multiple UAVs in windy environments. To coordinate among plural flight paths for multiple UAVs, this paper newly introduces ratio parameters and path-length variables that are able to easily express a wide variety of complicated flight paths. Using the ratio parameters and path-length variables, kinematic models of UAVs defined on Serret–Frenet frame are exactly converted into augmented Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models in considered operation domains of UAVs. Stabilization conditions for the augmented T-S fuzzy models are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities and are utilized to obtain stable feedback gains of the T-S fuzzy controllers. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the designed controllers can stabilize the UAVs on complicated paths in coordinated flight under windy environments.},
