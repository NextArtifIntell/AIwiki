Many real-world applications of bilevel optimization, however, involve data uncertainty. We study discrete min-max problems with a follower who faces uncertainties regarding the parameters of the lower-level problem. Adopting a $$\varGamma $$ -robust approach, we present an extended formulation and a multi-follower formulation to model this type of problem. For both settings, we provide a generic branch-and-cut framework. Specifically, we investigate interdiction problems with a monotone $$\varGamma $$ -robust follower and we derive problem-tailored cuts, which extend existing techniques that have been proposed for the deterministic case. For the $$\varGamma $$ -robust knapsack interdiction problem, we computationally evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed algorithms for both modeling approaches.},

However, we are not aware of any empirical studies that evaluate their applicability and computational impact over large, heterogeneous test sets in general-purpose solvers. This paper provides a detailed computational study of perspective cuts within a linear programming based branch-and-cut solver for general mixed-integer nonlinear programs. Within this study, we extend the applicability of perspective cuts from convex to nonconvex nonlinearities. This generalization is achieved by applying a perspective strengthening to valid linear inequalities which separate solutions of linear relaxations. The resulting method can be applied to any constraint where all variables appearing in nonlinear terms are semi-continuous and depend on at least one common indicator variable. Our computational experiments show that adding perspective cuts for convex constraints yields a consistent improvement of performance, and adding perspective cuts for nonconvex constraints reduces branch-and-bound tree sizes and strengthens the root node relaxation, but has no significant impact on the overall mean time.},

Besides its relevance in integer programming, this concept has interpretations in aspects of social choice, symmetric cryptanalysis, and machine learning. We employ efficient mixed-integer programming techniques to compute a robust and numerically more practical variant of the relaxation complexity. Our proposed models require row or column generation techniques and can be enhanced by symmetry handling and suitable propagation algorithms. Theoretically, we compare the quality of our models in terms of their LP relaxation values. The performance of those models is investigated on a broad test set and is underlined by their ability to solve challenging instances that could not be solved previously.},

  abstract     = {Large-neighbourhood search (LNS) heuristics are important mathematical programming techniques that search for primal feasible solutions by solving an auxiliary problem with a restricted feasible region. Extending such powerful generic LNS heuristics to the branch-and-price context is inherently challenging. The most prominent challenges arise from the fact that in branch-and-price algorithms, columns are generated with the sole aim to solve linear programming relaxations. Hence, the ability to form integer feasible solutions is not considered during the generation of columns. Without any changes to the standard pricing schemes, the potential of deploying generic LNS heuristics within a branch-and-price procedure is severely limited. This paper proposes a matheuristic, based on an LNS heuristic framework, where the novelty is a customised pricing scheme for generating columns to solve an auxiliary problem. The theoretical foundation for this pricing scheme is a set of optimality conditions for integer programs. From this foundation, a column generation strategy is developed for finding columns that are likely to be of use in high-quality primal feasible solutions for the original problem. The proposed matheuristic is implemented in the generic branch-price-and-cut solver GCG. On a broad test set comprising classical block diagonal structured instances and general instances from the MIPLIB 2017 Collection, the computational results show a significant improvement to the solving performance of GCG.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic gradient methods (SGMs) are the predominant approaches to train deep learning models. The adaptive versions (e.g., Adam and AMSGrad) have been extensively used in practice, partly because they achieve faster convergence than the non-adaptive versions while incurring little overhead. On the other hand, asynchronous (async) parallel computing has exhibited significantly higher speed-up over its synchronous (sync) counterpart. Async-parallel non-adaptive SGMs have been well studied in the literature from the perspectives of both theory and practical performance. Adaptive SGMs can also be implemented without much difficulty in an async-parallel way. However, to the best of our knowledge, no theoretical result of async-parallel adaptive SGMs has been established. The difficulty for analyzing adaptive SGMs with async updates originates from the second moment term. In this paper, we propose an async-parallel adaptive SGM based on AMSGrad. We show that the proposed method inherits the convergence guarantee of AMSGrad for both convex and non-convex problems, if the staleness (also called delay) caused by asynchrony is bounded. Our convergence rate results indicate a nearly linear parallelization speed-up if $$\tau =o(K^{\frac{1}{4}})$$ , where $$\tau $$ is the staleness and K is the number of iterations. The proposed method is tested on both convex and non-convex machine learning problems, and the numerical results demonstrate its clear advantages over the sync counterpart and the async-parallel nonadaptive SGM.

The method is based on the solution of an integer programming problem, called IH-OPT, that takes as input a fractional solution of the Subtour Elimination Problem (SEP) on a TSP instance and computes a TSP instance having an integrality gap larger than or equal to the integrality gap of the first instance. The decision variables of IH-OPT are the entries of the TSP cost matrix, and the constraints are defined by the intersection of the metric cone with an exponential number of inequalities, one for each possible TSP tour. Given the very large number of constraints, we have implemented a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving IH-OPT. Then, by sampling cost vectors over the metric polytope and by solving the corresponding SEP, we can generate random fractional vertices of the SEP polytope. If we solve the IH-OPT problem for every sampled vertex using our branch-and-cut algorithm, we can select the generated TSP instance (i.e., cost vector), yielding the longest runtime for Concorde, the state-of-the-art TSP solver. Our computational results show that our method is very effective in producing challenging instances. As a by-product, we release the Hard-TSPLIB, a library of 41 small metric TSP instances which have a large integrality gap and are challenging in terms of runtime for Concorde.},

  abstract     = {We present Feasibility Jump (FJ), a primal heuristic for mixed-integer linear programs (MIP) using stochastic guided local search over a Lagrangian relaxation. The method is incomplete: it does not necessarily produce solutions to all feasible problems, the solutions it produces are not in general optimal, and it cannot detect infeasibility. It does, however, very quickly produce feasible solutions to many hard MIP problem instances. Starting from any variable assignment, Feasibility Jump repeatedly selects a variable and sets its value to minimize a weighted sum of constraint violations. These weights (which correspond to the Lagrangian multipliers) are adjusted for constraints that remain violated in local minima. Contrary to many other primal heuristics, Feasibility Jump does not require a solution of the continuous relaxation, which can be time-consuming for some problems. We compare FJ against FICO Xpress Solver 8.14 and we show that this heuristic is effective on a range of problems from the MIPLIB 2017 benchmark set, significantly improving the average time to find a first feasible solution. We also show that providing these quick solutions to Xpress produces a modest reduction in the average time to optimality in the same benchmark set. Our entry based on FJ to the MIP 2022 Computational Competition (which challenged participants to write LP-free MIP heuristics) won 1st place. Moreover, an implementation of Feasibility Jump now runs by default on FICO Xpress Solver 9.0, where similar results to the ones presented here could be observed.},

  abstract     = {We consider unconstrained stochastic optimization problems with no available gradient information. Such problems arise in settings from derivative-free simulation optimization to reinforcement learning. We propose an adaptive sampling quasi-Newton method where we estimate the gradients using finite differences of stochastic function evaluations within a common random number framework. We develop modified versions of a norm test and an inner product quasi-Newton test to control the sample sizes used in the stochastic approximations and provide global convergence results to the neighborhood of a locally optimal solution. We present numerical experiments on simulation optimization problems to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. When compared with classical zeroth-order stochastic gradient methods, we observe that our strategies of adapting the sample sizes significantly improve performance in terms of the number of stochastic function evaluations required.},

  abstract     = {Since its introduction in the early 2000s, robust optimization with budget uncertainty has received a lot of attention. This is due to the intuitive construction of the uncertainty sets and the existence of a compact robust reformulation for (mixed-integer) linear programs. However, despite its compactness, the reformulation performs poorly when solving robust integer problems due to its weak linear relaxation. To overcome the problems arising from the weak formulation, we propose a bilinear formulation for robust binary programming, which is as strong as theoretically possible. From this bilinear formulation, we derive strong linear formulations as well as structural properties for robust binary optimization problems, which we use within a tailored branch¬†and¬†bound algorithm. We test our algorithm‚Äôs performance together with other approaches from the literature on a diverse set of ‚Äúrobustified‚Äù real-world instances from the MIPLIB¬†2017. Our computational study, which is the first to compare many sophisticated approaches on a broad set of instances, shows that our algorithm outperforms existing approaches by far. Furthermore, we show that the fundamental structural properties proven in this paper can be used to substantially improve the approaches from the literature. This highlights the relevance of our findings, not only for the tested algorithms, but also for future research on robust optimization. To encourage the use of our algorithms for solving robust optimization problems and our instances for benchmarking, we make all materials freely available online.},

Several computational approaches to solve these problems have been proposed in the literature, that broadly fall into two main classes: evolutionary methods, which are usually very good at exploring the feasible region and retrieving good solutions even in the nonconvex case, and descent methods, which excel in efficiently approximating good quality solutions. In this paper, first we confirm, through numerical experiments, the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. Then we propose a new method which combines the good features of both. The resulting algorithm, which we call Non-dominated Sorting Memetic Algorithm, besides enjoying interesting theoretical properties, excels in all of the numerical tests we performed on several, widely employed, test functions.},

We develop an efficient and easy-to-implement dynamic programming algorithm for solving the proposed model whose recursion nature is carefully uncovered and exploited. For special $$\ell _2$$ -GNIO problems, implementation details and the optimal $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$ running time analysis of our algorithm are discussed. Numerical experiments, including the comparisons among our approach, the powerful commercial solver Gurobi, and existing fast algorithms for solving $$\ell _1$$ -GNIO and $$\ell _2$$ -GNIO problems, on both simulated and real data sets, are presented to demonstrate the high efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithm in solving large scale GNIO problems.},

We propose to employ Dantzig‚ÄìWolfe reformulation and machine learning methods to obtain a fully data driven automatic decomposition framework. We also design strategies and introduce algorithmic techniques in order to make such a framework computationally effective. An extensive experimental analysis shows our framework to grant substantial improvements, in terms of both solutions quality and computing time, with respect to state-of-the-art automatic decomposition techniques. It also allows us to gain insights into the relative impact of different techniques. As a side product of our research, we provide a dataset of more than 31 thousand random decompositions of MIPLIB instances, with 121 features, including computations of their root node relaxation.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores integer programming formulations for solving graph partitioning problems that impose an upper limit on the weight of the partition clusters. Traditional efforts have concentrated on studying a model commonly known as the triangular formulation, which has some undesirable properties, like requiring a cubic number of constraints with respect to the number of vertices. We study some alternative formulations arising from different perspectives. In particular, we consider the idea of modeling the problem from the standpoint of an attacker who wants to deteriorate the graph‚Äôs integrity by removing edges and show that some of the structural properties of the proposed formulations can be exploited to speed up the solution times. To compare the strength of the formulations‚Äô LP bounds, we study their projection into the space of the edges and show that all of them concentrate on partitioning subtrees of the input graph. Inspired by this observation, we develop a formulation based on a dynamic program for the problem on trees and show how to use it to derive strong valid inequalities for the problem on general graphs. As part of the technical developments of the paper, we also expand the polyhedral characterization of the problem‚Äôs solution space, introducing new families of inequalities and provide empirical evidence of their efficacy to improve the quality of the proposed formulations. Finally, we conduct an extensive computational study to compare the strength of our developments.},

  abstract     = {In recent work, we provide computational arguments for expanding the class of proper cones recognized by conic optimization solvers, to permit simpler, smaller, more natural conic formulations. We define an exotic cone as a proper cone for which we can implement a small set of tractable (i.e. fast, numerically stable, analytic) oracles for a logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier for the cone or for its dual cone. Our extensible, open-source conic interior point solver, Hypatia, allows modeling and solving any conic problem over a Cartesian product of exotic cones. In this paper, we introduce Hypatia‚Äôs interior point algorithm, which generalizes that of Skajaa and Ye (Math. Program. 150(2):391‚Äì422, 2015) by handling exotic cones without tractable primal oracles. To improve iteration count and solve time in practice, we propose four enhancements to the interior point stepping procedure of Skajaa and Ye: (1) loosening the central path proximity conditions, (2) adjusting the directions using a third order directional derivative barrier oracle, (3) performing a backtracking search on a curve, and (4) combining the prediction and centering directions. We implement 23 useful exotic cones in Hypatia. We summarize the complexity of computing oracles for these cones and show that our new third order oracle is not a bottleneck. From 37 applied examples, we generate a diverse benchmark set of 379 problems. Our computational testing shows that each stepping enhancement improves Hypatia‚Äôs iteration count and solve time. Altogether, the enhancements reduce the geometric means of iteration count and solve time by over 80\% and 70\% respectively.},

  abstract     = {We consider mixed integer bilevel linear optimization problems in which the decision variables of the lower-level (follower‚Äôs) problem are all binary. We propose a general modeling and solution framework motivated by the practical reality that in a Stackelberg game, the follower does not always solve their optimization problem to optimality. They may instead implement a locally optimal solution with respect to a given upper-level decision. Such scenarios may occur when the follower‚Äôs computational capabilities are limited, or when the follower is not completely rational. Our framework relaxes the typical assumption of perfect rationality that underlies the standard modeling framework by defining a hierarchy of increasingly stringent assumptions about the behavior of the follower. Namely, at level k of this hierarchy, it is assumed that the follower produces a k-optimal solution. Associated with this hierarchy is a hierarchy of upper and lower bounds that are in fact valid for the classical case in which complete rationality of the follower is assumed. Two mixed integer linear programming¬†(MILP) formulations are derived for the resulting optimization problems. Extensive computational results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MILP formulations and the quality of the bounds produced. The latter are shown to dominate the standard approach based on a single-level relaxation at a reasonable computational cost. Finally, we also explore a class of bilevel problems for which 2-optimal lower-level solutions imply global optimality, and hence we can solve these bilevel problems exactly using the developed MILP formulations.},
