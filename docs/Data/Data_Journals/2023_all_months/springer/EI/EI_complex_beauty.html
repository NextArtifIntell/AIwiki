  abstract     = {Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome that disables the heart from pumping blood to effectively nourish the body or does it to elevated intracardiac pressures. Currently, the main diagnostic methods for this pathology are performed clinically by the measurement of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and by cardiac imaging methods. As cardiovascular diseases are the primary causes of premature death, new technologies to identify these diseases at an early stage are of great importance. Thus, this research presents the development of two artificial neural networks (ANNs), one for each gender, that recognize the vocal distortions caused by HF in an individual. Therefore, the voices of 142 individuals were collected, separated by sex and age. Among these 142, 84 voices of people already diagnosed with HF were collected at the Heart Institute of Sao Paulo University (INCOR—USP) and the Metropolitan Hospital of Paraiba. Also, the voices of 58 healthy individuals were collected in an extra-hospital environment. Then, the following techniques were applied to extract the signals&#39; features: statistical analysis, FFT, discrete wavelet transform, and Mel-Cepstral analysis. The selected features were used to develop ANNs that aim to identify HF. Both ANNs achieved an efficiency of 96.7%. Also, values of 91.86%; 88.1%; and 92.1% were obtained for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. Therefore, comparing the results reached by this research to other studies in the field, it is possible to conclude that the use of voice analysis represents a great improvement in HF recognition and early treatment.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, obstacle avoidance has been one of the main challenges in autonomous vehicle navigation, which has been used in a wide range of different autonomous devices and it is also a fundamental requirement for mobile robots. In this paper, a novel method is proposed and evaluated for mobile robot navigation in an unknown environment while avoiding collision with unexpected obstacles. This mobile robot has been equipped with a mono-vision sensor, which communicates with the environment. Therefore, the decision-making unit is entirely vision-based and no other sensor is used to communicate with the environment. The deep neural network method has been used to inform the robot about the suitable direction of movement but central decision-making unit will do some preprocessing on the output command before sending it to the operation unit. In this research, various techniques are investigated to train the convolutional neural network in a better way to generate more accurate commands for the mobile robot’s movement towards the safe area without colliding into any obstacles. Besides, lots of various methods have been used to increase the performance of the neural network. The most important one is using an adjustable learning rate. The results show the vital role of learning rate in network performance. The designed network attained a 96.88% accuracy and a 0.14 loss, which indicates that this approach could successfully improve the neural network performance and reasonably solve the obstacle avoidance problem.},

  abstract     = {During the last two decades, due to environmental laws and the competitive environment, the formulation of effective closed-loop supply chain networks has attracted researchers’ attention. On the other hand, although there are many metaheuristics applied for these NP-hard problems, applying more efficient and effective algorithms with tailor-made local searches and solution representation is inevitable. In this paper, mixed-integer linear programming is assumed to deliver the final product to customers in the forward direction from suppliers through manufacturers and distribution centers (DCs). Simultaneously, collecting recycled products from customers and entering them into the recovery or landfilling cycle is examined. Mathematical modeling of this problem aims to minimize both the costs of opening facilities at potential locations as well as the optimal flow of materials across the network layers. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, a cloud-based simulated annealing algorithm (CSA) has been applied for the first time in this area. Moreover, a spanning tree-based method which occupies the least number of arrays, regarding the other methods of the literature has been adopted. To analyze the accuracy and the speed of the investigated algorithm, we have compared its performance with the genetic algorithm (GA) and the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm (which were applied in the literature). The results, regarding cost function, show that the CSA algorithm provides more effective results than the other two ones. Moreover, regarding CPU time, although the CSA shows better results than GA, statistically, it failed to show more efficient results than SA.},

  abstract     = {Visible and infrared images are important ways for the power inspection robot to detect the status of power equipment. Image registration can make full use of the advantages of the visible and infrared images, which can provide a better basis for subsequent state monitoring. Traditional registration methods have the low and poor registration accuracy caused by infrared image blurring. Therefore, a new chaos cat swarm optimization algorithm based on saliency gradient is proposed to improve the registration accuracy. Firstly, based on the visual saliency detection of infrared images, the edge gradient information of saliency region is enhanced. Secondly, the saliency gradient information and the normalized mutual information are combined as the measurement function of registration. Thirdly, a new chaos cat swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to improve the convergence of the image registration. It uses different chaotic mappings to improve the step size of the search model. Logistic chaos mapping is used in the algorithm to change the location information of the cat population in each iteration process to avoid the local optimal problem, so that the whole population can reach a balance between the global search ability and the local search ability, which has a good convergence speed. Finally, substation inspection image, standard registration test image set are selected for comparative experiment. The results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance in registration rate and registration speed.},

  abstract     = {Wireless body area network (WBAN) is an excellent platform to transfer crucial health data from a human body to the database over a public channel. Thus, it is essential to protect sensitive data, as an adversary can intercept communications. Besides, it is also vital to verify the user (sender and receiver) before providing data access for health information. To deal with these challenges, different message transmission protocols are designed to check the user legitimacy, data correctness, and secrecy of information. The Big data-Driven futuristic Fabric System(B- FFS) databases contain a lot of user data. B FFS is grouped into three categories: data collecting, data gathering, and error checking. By collecting useful user data from multiple sources, a smart B FFS enhances the business decision support process. The data comes from a variety of ways, including sensors that collect traffic, health, weather, and transfer data, as well as updates to various social networking sites. Researchers in this work have suggested different data transmission schemes for WBAN to enhance security while exchanging messages. They have discussed various features, limitations, and constructions of existing WBAN data transmission mechanisms to clearly understand the strengths and weaknesses of the existing work. To make it more clearly to readers, researchers in this study have described different essential security properties for WBAN communication. In addition, researchers have explained various security attacks, which can be launched during message transmission in WBAN. Moreover, possible countermeasures are discussed to resist the discussed attacks. Finally, while dealing with the WBAN system, this survey study presents a comprehensive discussion of the security properties, attacks, and countermeasures.

In this paper, resources are categorized into computational and consumed. A computational resource processes data and a consumed resource captures data. A novel approach, in Web 2.0 context, is proposed which combines social networks of resources with the principles of recommender systems, in order to define the interactions between resources. These interactions are exploited to develop two algorithms for dynamic computational and consumed resources selection in case of substitution. The search space of resources is considerably reduced by their categorization and the creating of social networks associated with each resource. Each resource is engaged in one and only one social network, which considerably reduces the task of replacing unavailable or failing resources. The results obtained are encouraging and show the indisputable contribution of resources categorization for the purpose of their substitution.},

To solve the two-stage optimization model, a particle swarm optimization algorithms (PSO) algorithm with exponentially decreasing weight strategy is introduced to search for a satisfied solution to ensure the feasibility of distribution plan and vehicle routing.

  abstract     = {Numerous methods for human activity recognition (HAR) have been proposed in the past two decades. Many of these methods are based on sparse representations, which describe the whole video content by a set of local features. Trajectories, as mid-level sparse features, are capable of describing the movements of interest points in two-dimensional (2D) space. However, 2D trajectories might be affected by viewpoint changes, potentially decreasing their accuracies. In this paper, we first propose and compare different 2D trajectory-based algorithms for human activity recognition. Then, we propose a new way of augmenting 2D trajectories with disparity information, without the calculation of the 3D reconstruction. Our obtained HAR results have shown a 2.76% improvement when using disparity-augmented trajectories, compared to using classical 2D trajectory information only. Furthermore, we have also tested our method on the challenging Hollywood 3D dataset, on which we have obtained competitive results, at a much faster speed.},

Specifically, identifying what should be annotated in texts remains a recurring question. This prevents proper design and fair evaluation of EL systems. To tackle this issue, the present paper introduces a set of rules intended to define the EL task for tweets. We experimented the effectiveness of the proposed rules by developing TELS, an end-to-end supervised system that links tweets to Wikipedia. The experiments conducted on five publicly available datasets show that our system outperforms the baselines with an improvement, in terms of overall macro F1-score (micro F1-score), ranging from 25.04% (7.32%) up to 35.36% (42.03%). Moreover, feature analysis reveals that when the annotation is not limited to very few entity types, the proposed rules capture more efficiently annotators’ tacit agreements from datasets. Consequently, the proposed rules constitute a step further towards a consensus on the EL task.},

  abstract     = {Degenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) have an influence on daily activities due to rigidity of muscles, tremor or cognitive impairment. Micrographia, speech intensity, and deficient generation of voluntary saccadic eye movements (Pretegiani and Optican in Front Neurol 8:592, 2017) are manifestations of PD that can be used to devise noninvasive and low cost clinical tests. In this context, we have collected a multimodal dataset that we call Parkinson’s disease Multi-Modal Collection (PDMultiMC), which includes online handwriting, speech signals, and eye movements recordings. We present here the handwriting dataset that we call HandPDMultiMC that will be made publicly available. The HandPDMultiMC dataset includes handwriting samples from 42 subjects (21 PD and 21 controls). In this work we investigate the application of various Deep learning architectures, namely the CNN and the CNN-BLSTM, to PD detection through time series classification. Various approaches such as Spectrograms have been applied to encode pen-based signals into images for the CNN model, while the raw time series are directly used in the CNN-BLSTM. In order to train these models for PD detection on large scale data, various data augmentation approaches for pen-based signals are proposed. Experimental results on our dataset show that the best performance for early PD detection (97.62% accuracy) is reached by a combination of CNN-BLSTM models trained with Jittering and Synthetic data augmentation approaches. We also illustrate that deep architectures can surpass the models trained on pre-engineered features even though the available data is small.},

  abstract     = {Mobile intelligent terminal speaker identification for real-time monitoring system of sports training is presented in this manuscript. The purpose of speaker recognition is to use speaker’s voice characteristics to identify the speaker’s identity. No two people in the world have exactly the same voice characteristics, because from the perspective of the human physiological structure, different people’s vocal shapes, throat sizes, and other factors related to pronunciation are different, which makes it possible to recognize speech by speech. From the technology level, the proposed framework contains the four core aspects, namely: speaker identification, motion gesture detection, heart rate detection and breath detection. In the information collection part, we adopt the ZigBee + WIFI wireless transmission, GPRS data transmission and Bluetooth communication joint framework to capture the accurate data to rrealize the dual-network dual-pass function, the TD-SCDMA receiver must also work at the same time when the GSM radio module of the terminal is working. In the speaker identification part, we propose the novel deep neural network framework and revise the architecture. The experiment compared with the other state-of-the-art models have proven the robustness of the proposed framework.},

However, owing to trade imbalance as the fundamental cause of EER, such problem is inevitable and requires consideration in pricing decisions. Accordingly, this study explores a marine service chain with one carrier and two dominant forwarders providing transportation service between two ports. We built a mathematical model to examine how carrier and forwarders determine pricing decisions with and without EER cost sharing. We find that the smaller one between empty equipment balancing and EER costs determines pricing decisions. We also investigate whether the EER cost-sharing mechanism can coordinate the service chain and subsequently found that the EER cost-sharing mechanism aggravates double marginalization. Then, we design a two-part tariff coordination mechanism to coordinate the service chain. Lastly, we study the effect of EER cost sharing and coordination mechanism on the environment. Interestingly, we find that EER cost-sharing and coordination should be avoided from the perspective of environmental protection.},

Compared with the derivative-free algorithms based on the maximal 2n positive base, the algorithms based on the minimal $$n+1$$ positive base only need at most $$n+1$$ function evaluations at every iteration, where n is the number of variables. Therefore, we can reduce the number of function evaluations from 2n to $$n+1$$ at each iteration. But the minimal positive base can cause undesirable large angles between some positive base directions and large unexplored feasible domain. In order to overcome this defect, we propose a modified set of feasible directions based on the minimal positive base and the technique of search direction rotation to investigate the unexplored domain at the next iteration. Accordingly, convergence to stationary points is proved. Moreover, the numerical experiments show that the method based on modified minimal positive base can reduce the number of function evaluations and is beneficial in a derivative-free context.},

Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), as an important kind of energy, is widely used in many area where the natural gas can not reach, especially in the developing countries. Although the sales of the LPG need the order information from the customers, and the order can be sent through the online platform, the online platform’s cost information is unknown to the LPG. In this paper, we consider the switching problem of LPG sale to the online platform, and establish the LPG enterprize’s optimal switching model with asymmetric information. Then we derive the optimal solution through the analysis of the incentive constraint and the participation constraint to the online platform. Moreover, the comparison with the optimal solution with symmetric information is also addressed.

The parameter of population size usually has important influence on the performance of DE, but it is not widely studied in the scope of DE. Based on the relationship between the population size and the exploration/exploitation ability of DE, we propose a novel fluctuant population (FP) strategy for automatically adjusting the value of population size during the runs. More specifically, the FP strategy mainly contains three parts: a monotone decreasing function is used to coordinate the focus between the exploration ability and exploitation ability, which can cause the FP strategy to decrease progressively at the macro level; a periodic function is applied to control the population diversity, which leads to the fluctuant feature of FP strategy at micro level; a rearranging and auto-grouping operation is used for removing and adding individual when the population size is changed. To evaluate the effect of the fluctuant population strategy on DE algorithm, based on 30 benchmark functions, we compare six selected DE algorithms with and without the FP strategy. The simulation results show that the fluctuant population strategy can significantly improve the performance of the six DE algorithms.},

In MO TPS, the cells of the tissue P system are divided into two groups. The first group, consisting of only one cell, aims at approaching to the Pareto front by the NSGA-II while second group, consisting of six cells, focuses on searching boundaries by the artificial bee colony algorithm with different prioritization rules. The main ideas of the MO TPS are to utilize the evolution of two groups of cells with different functions in the tissue P system for searching the boundaries of solution sets, obtaining solution sets which are uniformly distributed and have better extensibility and approaching to the Pareto front on the premise of preserving the elite boundaries. 56 Solomon benchmarks are utilized to test algorithm performance.

Identifying the heights of different buildings using a specific method can reduce secondary disasters such as building damage and house collapse caused by destructive earthquakes. The traditional building object detection model uses the feature expression of the dataset based on manually sketching the shape of the building in the remote sensing images, which will cause less acquired image information, unclear target features of buildings, and the decrease of target detection accuracy of identifying building types. The real-time target detection algorithm YOLO has fast detection speed and high accuracy, but its main disadvantage is the inaccurate positioning of the building bounding box and the misjudgment of partially overlapping building objects. Image feature retrieval using large data set domain adaptive fast algorithm is a new research hotspot in current image recognition. This research proposes a multi-branch network with the addition of a module using attention mechanism to coordinate the salient and sub-salient information of images. The algorithm adds channel and spatial attention mechanisms to the feature extraction network, and uses weighting and filtering methods to perform residual fusion on the original features vectors in images. The model is deployed on the remote sensing geographic information evaluation platform to conduct various building target detection experiments. The average detection accuracy of the urban buildings can reach 81.8%, and the detection speed for remote sensing segmentation images is 26 per second. The mAP@0.5 of the YOLOv5 algorithm with the attention mechanism is 12% higher than that of the unimproved YOLOv5 algorithm on the urban street view image dataset.},

  abstract     = {Smart advertising is an important part of the modern information industry. The main problems of smart advertising in Chinese cities at this stage include cluttered settings, single form, lack of coordination and integration between advertising and cities and urban buildings, and inconspicuous visual effects. In order to deal with these problems, it is necessary to optimize the design of smart advertisements to enhance the visual aesthetic effect. Image aesthetics quality assessment has good application prospects in industries such as image recommendation and image editing aesthetics, and can be used to help smart advertisements improve visual aesthetics. This paper proposes an objective quantitative scoring method for image aesthetics based on a multi-scale feature extraction network, which is a computational intelligence approach. The model is mainly composed of multiple multi-scale feature extraction units cascaded, and each unit contains a feature extraction layer composed of 3 different convolution kernels, fusion layer and mapping layer. The feature extraction layer forms the input end of the network by combining the global view and local view of the image. At the output end, the EMD function is used as the loss function, and the output distribution is a probability density mass function of 1–10 points. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method in this paper, the AVA dataset, which is commonly used in the field of image aesthetic evaluation, is selected for testing experiments. In this paper, two parameters, Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient and accuracy rate, are selected as indicators to evaluate the method in this paper.

  abstract     = {For the design and implementation of Clinical decision support system, computation time and prognostic accuracy are very important. To analyze the large collection of a dataset for detecting and diagnosis disease machine learning techniques are used. According to the reports of World Health Organizations, heart disease is a major cause of death and killer in urban and rural areas or worldwide. The main reason for this is a shortage of doctors and delay in the diagnosis. The outcome presaging of this disease is a very challenging job. This proposed work used the approach of self-diagnosis algorithm, fuzzy artificial neural network, and NCA and PCA and imputation methods. By the use of this technique reduces the computation time for prediction of Coronary heart disease. For the implementation of this the two datasets are using such as Cleveland and Statlog datasets. In this research work, heart disease is a diagnosis by used the clinical parameters of patients for early stages. Classifiers used for that random forest algorithm, ANN, and K-NN algorithm. The datasets for the disease prediction measure are used to accurately calculate the difference between variables and to determine whether they are correlated or not. For this classification model, the performance measure is calculated in requisites of their accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity. This approach is evaluated on the heart disease datasets for improving the accuracy performance results obtained. The experimental results obtained by NCA provide greater performance in terms of performance metrics for the multiple classifiers like RF, DT, NB, SVM. The aim of this study to develop the classification model as well as show a comparative analysis between existing systems is discussed. In this paper for Cleveland dataset has taken 303 instances and 14 attributes are used. This dataset has preprocessed dataset. This paper depicts the higher accuracy score with the multiple classifiers such as Random forest,SVM, and NB using NCA is 99.34 % and for DT is 98 %. Overall NCA is best in terms of classification accuracy. The result shows not only accuracy for the proposed method but obtains better results for multiple classifiers that exhibit their reliability.in medical science, this approach is used to predict heart disease at its early stages.The outcome for KNN + SDA + NCA + Fuzzy ANN for Cleveland dataset accuracy achieved 98.56% and for Statlog dataset 98.66%. This result describes the hybrid method used for prediction of heart disease and achieved better results.﻿},

  abstract     = {With the development of world economy, sports development has also become a symbol of national strength. Nowadays, sports competition has become an important activity for all countries to show their strength, and also an important bridge to connect all countries and build friendship. In the process of challenging the limit, human beings gradually master the action essentials of various sports, and the action difference of athletes directly affects the grades of the competition. Therefore, in the process of sports training, athletes of various countries will focus on the standard of action of each athlete. In traditional sports training, veteran athletes with rich experience are usually used as coaches to guide athletes empirically. However, the difference of coaches will also lead to the difference of sports effects. At the same time, coaches’ grasp of athletes’ action standards is more based on subjective observation, which cannot be accurately measured, so there may be large differences and errors in their grasp of action standards. In this paper, we propose an intelligent action recognition and correction system to assist coaches to measure and evaluate athletes’ actions more accurately, and give correction suggestions according to standard actions. Our system uses RGB-D sensors to analyze athletes’ skeleton key points in real time. The different between the athlete’s action and the standard action is calculated through the connection between the joint key points. In this paper, we also use the timing tracking algorithm to comprehensively evaluate the consistency of the action with the standard. We verified the feasibility of the recognition correction system through the actual movement and measurement of athletes. The experiment shows that our system can accurately measure the movements of athletes, and has more accurate measurement results and correction suggestions than the traditional coach naked eye measurement.},

With this type of magnitude of online content, there is a need to deeply understand the insights of it in order to make use of the information for practical applications such as event detection, polarity, sentiment analysis and so on. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the study of such information which is used for text classification, sentiment analysis, clustering of similar text. NLP makes use of linguistic knowledge and build machine learning models to analyse textual information. NLP finds its way in various applications like classification of online review into positive and negative without actually reading the reviews and feedback. For text analysis, there should be a way to quantify the text based on its frequency of occurrence, correlation with neighbouring words, contextual similarity of words, etc. One such way is word embedding. This study applies various word embedding techniques on tweets of popular news channels and clusters the resultant vectors using K-means algorithm. From this study, it is found out that Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has achieved highest accuracy rate when used with K-means clustering.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection aims to find a best feature subset from all feature sets of a given dataset, which represents the whole feature space to reduce redundancy and improve classification accuracy. The evolutionary computation algorithm is often applied to feature selection, but there exists low efficiency in the search process. With the increase of the number of features, solving the feature selection problem become more and more difficult. Existing evolutionary algorithms have many defects, such as slow convergence speed, low convergence accuracy and easy to fall into local optimum. Therefore, the research of more effective evolutionary algorithms has important theoretical significance and application value. Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) is a kind of evolutionary computation algorithm and has a good performance in feature selection problems. It uses transfer function to convert the continuous search space to the binary one. Transfer function plays an important role in BPSO. So this paper proposes an improved BPSO by combining V-shaped and U-shaped transfer function, and introduces a new learning strategy and a local search strategy based on adaptive mutation. The improved BPSO enhances its optimization ability in feature selection problem. The experimental results show that the improved BPSO has better dimension reduction ability and classification performance than other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative co-evolution (CC) algorithm is an evolutionary computational framework that can effectively solve high-dimensional optimization problems. One of the main challenges of the CC is how to allocate computational resources to subcomponents reasonably. Therefore, a new adaptive computing resource allocation mechanism (ACRA) is proposed in this paper. ACRA defines the average value of the relative change rate of the original problem after each round of optimization as the contribution rate of the subcomponent, so that the optimization information of each round can be effectively used. ACRA also sets a new threshold, when the random number is greater than the threshold, the subcomponent with the largest contribution rate is selected for optimization; otherwise, a subcomponent is randomly selected for optimization. In the early stage of optimization, such a subcomponent selection strategy will try to select the subcomponents with a large average contribution rate for optimization to speed up the decline of the objective function, while in the later stage of optimization, all components will be selected on average to improve the computing resources in the later stage. Finally, the algorithm proposed in this paper is compared with other algorithms on the CEC’2013 benchmark functions, and the experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has better experimental performance and is feasible compared with other algorithms.},

From the demand side, effective prediction of building power consumption can provide effective support for energy consumption diagnosis, operation optimization and regional energy management. To this end, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) building electricity prediction method based on attention mechanism is proposed. This method combines the speed and light weight of the convolutional neural network with the order sensitivity of the long short-term memory network, and uses the attention mechanism to improve the performance of the LSTM when the sequence is too long and the information is lost. Taking the power consumption data of an office building as an example, this prediction method is compared with other commonly used prediction models. The experimental results show that the CNN-LSTM model based on the attention mechanism can reduce the loss of historical information and have higher prediction performance, thereby realizing the load prediction of short-term intelligent buildings.},

The realization of movements is complex, diverse, and detailed, with flexibility and variability that cannot be achieved by machinery. Human motion analysis and recognition is a challenging research topic that plays an essential role in promoting bionic engineering, medical engineering, sports competition, and game animation. The traditional human motion estimation method relies heavily on image segmentation, so it may be affected by inaccurate segmentation in the process of athlete movement detection, resulting in errors in the following analysis. This paper proposes a track and field training state recognition method based on the acceleration sensor and deep learning algorithms. The proposed method uses an acceleration sensor to detect the accurate motion information of the human body in real-time and a deep learning method to process and analyze the data, which can provide robust data and analysis results even in inclement weather, such as on rainy or snowy days. The proposed method does not rely on unstable image segmentation or perception results. However, it only carries out state analysis through real-time sensor data, which can provide robust analysis results of track and field training. Practical tests show that the proposed method is robust, stable, and robust to sensor and motion noise. At the same time, this method can provide more accurate motion estimation and state analysis. Based on the validation of the public dataset UTD-MHAD, the proposed method significantly improves action recognition accuracy.},

On the other hand, it also proposes solutions to the phenomenon of &quot;information overload&quot; brought about by the rapid growth of learning resources. A distinctive feature of online education is interest-driven. The traditional online education course recommendation method has poor topic concentration due to the problem of data sparse. For this reason, an online education course recommendation method based on the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) user interest model is designed, where LDA is an unsupervised machine learning method. The LDA user interest model is used to judge the user&#39;s preference for topics, obtain the user&#39;s interest in online education courses, and complete the recommendation of online education courses based on this. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated using online learning website data.

Human civilization has a long history, and each region has its own unique history of language development. By the way, language is constantly updated and changed with the development of the times. Especially English is one of the most popular languages in the world. It has a long history and is widely used in all countries and nationalities in the world. Therefore, how to effectively recognize the emotion of English text through computer technology is still an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based method to analyze the English text sentiment. In this method, the game between the generator and discriminator from the GAN is used to update the model’s understanding ability of semantic analysis, and the emotion classification and recognition are realized through iterative training. GAN is more like a young child who constantly updates his understanding of language by receiving foreign information in his life. The generator mainly implements emotion analysis and generate a new sentence which the sentiment is similar to the recognition results. While the discriminator determines whether the input language is real emotion. Therefore, we first train a sentences generator to give us some related possible sentences based on our input some reference words. When the network converges, we analyze the English text through the sentiment analysis network, and then input the analysis results into the sentence generation network, and the output sentences into the discriminator for judgment. Meanwhile, the whole process includes text analysis based on big data. When the results generated by the sentiment analysis network and the generation network can deceive the discriminator, the results generated by the network are close to the real sentiment analysis results. Our results show that this approach is effective in open data sets.},

Finally, based on convolutional neural networks of computational intelligence, a quantitative method of the relationship between the lightning resistance level of the lightning arrester and the main influencing factors is proposed. The experimental results prove that the method proposed in this paper can predict the accuracy of the factors affecting the lightning resistance level of the lightning arrester of transmission lines and provide strong support for improving the lightning protection performance of transmission lines.},

Writing stylistics is the analysis of an author&#39;s writing style through statistical methods. In this paper, our main purpose is to identify the style of English novels based on text analysis methods. We use the method of information entropy calculation which is an evolutionary intelligent method to identify the style of English novels, so as to provide reference for better grasping the content of literary works. We focus on how to process text data and mine text intrinsic features to better identify English novel style. To better solve the problems, we design following strategies in our proposed method. First, we need to collect and process English novel samples. Then tokenize the text and consider the object content that needs to be analyzed. The next step is to count the number of words and calculate the information entropy. Finally, the data is processed and analyzed to get a conclusion.

Online teaching evaluation aims to systematically test teachers&#39; teaching process according to certain teaching objectives and standards, and evaluate its value, advantages and disadvantages, so as to improve the quality of teaching. It is not only an important part of the teaching process, but also the basis of all effective and successful teaching. In this paper, we propose an online teaching evaluation method based on Epistemic Neural Network (ENN), which is an evolutionary intelligence method. In terms of uncertainty modeling, ENN&#39;s design innovation provides the improvement effect of geometric progression in terms of statistical quality and calculation cost. Therefore, it is very suitable for teaching evaluation, which is an evaluation process guided by a variety of uncertain factors. Specifically, this paper considers the content and grade standards of online teaching evaluation from five aspects. (1) Teachers&#39; syllabus, teaching progress, teaching plan, courseware and other teaching documents and teaching materials; (2) Abide by teaching discipline, the implementation of teaching plan and the completion of teaching tasks; (3) Teaching attitude, teaching investment, teaching and educating people, and the comprehensive quality of teachers; (4) Whether the concepts taught in the course are accurate, the expression is clear, whether the key points are prominent and whether the difficulties are clearly explained; (5) The depth, breadth and frontier of teaching content, and the amount of classroom information. According to the above five evaluation indexes which involves the big data analysis, we train ENN to get an evaluation score that can evaluate the teacher&#39;s online teaching process.

  abstract     = {RNA (Ribonucleic Aci) plays a crucial role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Over the past few decades, researchers have designed many types of RNAs and their derivatives and applied them to different fields of biology. Studies have confirmed that RNA molecules play an important role in tumor growth, metastasis, metabolism and immune escape. Based on the research of tumor-associated RNA and the application of related technologies, RNA has been designed and applied in tumor immunotherapy. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to solve tumor type classification predictions with the large-scale data, some with high prediction accuracy and others with limited accuracy. For the early detection of tumors, this paper proposes to use machine learning and RNA technology to establish a tumor type prediction model to enhance the effect of anti-tumor immunotherapy. The model first preprocesses the data. Then, this paper uses an improved principal component analysis algorithm to perform feature dimensionality reduction and data fusion on the RNA expression and DNA methylation data of patients with 32 tumor types. Finally, the data is fed into a tumor type classifier based on the CNN-LSTM model for training and prediction. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has excellent performance in tumor classification, and has important guiding significance for the early diagnosis and treatment of tumor patients, which further indicates that the intelligent ML method can be used for data analysis in the field of tumor type prediction.},

In this paper, we propose an English translation model based on the LSMT model and the attention mechanism to provide fast and accurate translation. First, we use a set of multiple vectors instead of fixed dimensions to represent source language sequences. Second, in the process of generating the target sequence, by dynamically selecting the background vector, the translation model pays more attention to the parts with high correlation with the source language during the translation process, thereby improving the translation performance of the model. Third, we design a multi-feature fusion method for automatic identification of English translation errors to improve translation quality.

Under the current situation, it is difficult for athletes to win in competitions only by training their physical, technical, and tactical abilities under heavy load. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen the psychological training of athletes in training and before a match. Artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, has recently been widely used in sports, which gives us the power to study athletes’ psychological balance before training and competition. This paper uses the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model, which combines time-domain and space-domain characteristics to classify the collected electroencephalogram signals of athletes into emotional categories. LSTM network is used to process the information of emotions changing with time, while CNN can mine the correlation between channels and finally fuse the two network outputs to obtain the results of emotional recognition of athletes; hence coaches can put forward targeted intervention strategies to help athletes adjust their psychological state in time. The experimental results show that this method has high classification accuracy and short classification time on Valence and Arousal dimensions and is superior to similar emotional recognition methods based on machine learning and deep learning. It provides dynamic support for the research of psychological balance detection of athletes.},

With the “carbon peak, carbon neutrality” goal and the proposal of a new power system, the construction of a power system in the metaverse is the trend of future development. For the application of the Metaverse in the power system, the Metaverse is recognized by means of digital twin technology, Internet of Things technology and other means, and then the energy storage power station system in the Metaverse is analyzed. To this end, this paper proposes a Metaverse-driven remote management scheme for energy storage power stations, and gives a specific design scheme. With the help of large-scale computing experiments and the parallel execution of virtual and real closed loops, the remote management and virtual-real interaction of the real energy storage power station system is realized, and the energy storage power station system is promoted from the management and control that relies on simulation to the intelligent management and control driven by the metaverse. In addition, in view of the demand of energy storage power station system for high-precision power load prediction, this paper also proposes a power load prediction model based on genetic algorithm-BP neural network. Considering the data characteristics, a scene-based classification model generation method is designed. The simulation results show that, compared with the BP neural network algorithm, the performance of the prediction model proposed in this paper has been significantly improved, and it can achieve effective prediction of power load.},

Especially in basketball teaching, if students do not have promising sports talents and solid basic basketball skills, it is not easy to acquire more basketball skills in physical education courses. Therefore, teaching through video has become inevitable. However, with the growth of video services, traditional cloud computing methods cannot meet the requirements of low latency tasks such as basketball teaching videos. Hence, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) comes into being. Specifically, by introducing the end-edge-cloud system collaborative architecture, a cache strategy of simulated annealing algorithm for extended short-term memory networks is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed caching strategy can effectively reduce transmission latency, improve the quality of basketball teaching, make it easier for students to get basketball skills, and significantly improve students’ basketball skills when the ends used by students move between different MEC servers under the collaborative architecture of the end-edge-cloud system.},

Due to the superior 3D model creation of 3D animation, it has important practical prospects in the field of art. At the same time, 3D animation is an important part of the animation industry, and its artistic style affects the quality of animation works and derivatives. Against the backdrop of computer technology, computer has a great influence on 3D animation art, which greatly enhances the artistic expression of 3D animation and promotes new animation forms. The artistic expression of 3D animation is mainly reflected in the performance of light and film, space and motion, lens, details and texture, and traditional artistic expression of 3D technology. However, when viewing 3D animation, we are often affected by the network bandwidth which leads to lag in 3D animation video and affects the user Quality of experience (QoE). According to the duration of 3D animation videos, this paper divides them into three types and obtains better user QoE through reinforcement learning (RL). The datasets of 3D animation videos of different durations are used to train the RL model, and the corresponding reward function parameters of different 3D animation video durations are obtained. Therefore, duration-sensitive Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C)—RL algorithm is presented. The experimental results show that the A3C-RL algorithm has a much better user QoE for 3D animation video than that of state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Due to the differences between eastern and western cultures, many students often face difficulties in language learning caused by cultural differences in learning English. Adaptability in cross-cultural communication and fluency in language learning are the highest realm of learning English and the highest pursuit for every student’s learning. To push the dialogue contents for students, this paper proposes a recognition model of multi-input feature extraction based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for English emotion recognition. The model adopts an end-to-end training method for learning, which can simplify the workflow and improve the overall recognition accuracy. At first, a speech is transformed into a form more suitable for model learning: spectrogram and Mel spectrogram. Then, it is input into the model for automatic feature extraction. In the model design, the information of spectrogram in time-domain and frequency-domain is considered at the same time. Finally, the high-level features of the image are fused, which greatly improves the effect of speech emotion recognition. Experimental results prove that the proposed speech emotion recognition fusion model has high recognition accuracy and quality of experience.},

  abstract     = {Two stage grid search accepted as a promising heuristic search technique, involves a search performed in two stages. In the first stage a search is performed in coarse grain/low resolution to identify the optimal region and, in the second stage, a fine grain/high resolution search is performed in the neighborhood of the optimal region to identify the optimal parameters. Performing a search in two stages considerably reduces the computational complexity when compared to the basic grid search algorithm. However, an exhaustive search is to be carried out in the subspace during the second stage which may again be a computationally expensive task. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a new heuristic search technique which explores the discrete parameter space dimension wise recursively. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is less than that of the two-stage grid search. The performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of required number of probes and time for optimal model selection, compared with the two-stage grid search, is verified for correctness and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus pandemic has hampered human life all over the world with several serious casualties and numerous deceased cases. Though the pace of the pandemic slowed down owing to the vaccination process, still new mutant variants of the virus continue to evolve. Our research aims on developing an Autoencoder (AE) based multi-class prediction model for detecting the severity of coronavirus. Our proposed model is based on certain symptoms, such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, difficulty in breathing, aches, sore throat, nasal congestion, diarrhea, etc. Our AI driven prediction model can efficiently identify distinct classes of severity, which includes no-infection, mild, moderate, and severe cases where a patient may require intensive medical care. We have considered machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and decision trees; and recurrent deep neural network model for performance comparison with proposed Autoencoder (AE) based models. Our autoencoder-based logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machine improves the prediction performance and accuracy towards anticipating the spread of coronavirus. It has been observed that AE-based deep learning models outperformed some of the existing machine learning and deep learning techniques with a maximum accuracy of 99.66%. Hence, AE-based models were found to be more suitable for multi-class prediction of large-scale patient-centric data in terms of F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall, model testing, training loss, and other validation statistics.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has spread worldwide and the World Health Organization was forced to list it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The disease has severely impacted most of the people because it affects the lung and causes severe breathing problems and lung infections. Differentiating other lung ailments from COVID-19 infection and determining the severity is a challenging process. Doctors can give vital life-saving services and support patients’ lives only if the severity of their condition is determined. This work proposed a two-step approach for detecting the COVID-19 infection from the lung CT images and determining the severity of the patient’s illness. To extract the features, pre-trained models are used, and by analyzing them, integrated the features from AlexNet, DenseNet-201, and ResNet-50. The COVID-19 detection is carried out by using an Artificial Neural Network(ANN) model. After the COVID-19 infection has been identified, severity detection is performed. For that, image features are combined with the clinical data and is classified as High, Moderate, Low with the help of Cubic Support Vector Machine(SVM). By considering three severity levels, patients with high risk can be given more attention. The method was tested on a publicly available dataset and obtained an accuracy of 92.0%, sensitivity of 96.0%, and an F1-Score of 91.44% for COVID-19 detection and got overall accuracy of 90.0% for COVID-19 severity detection for three classes.},

ALO is strong in exploitation due to the mechanism of antlions in hunting other insects. On the other hand, the social forces in GOA represent the strong capability of exploration all over the search space. So, these features give the chance to combine ALO and GOA in one hybrid algorithm that significantly enhances the performance of both methods. The proposed hybrid algorithm is tested on 32 well-known benchmark test functions, 13 functions of the challenging CEC2015 functions, and two real problems in antenna array synthesis where the elements’ excitation amplitudes and phases are optimized to minimize the maximum sidelobe level and impose nulls at specific angles. Comparisons show that the proposed algorithm outperforms 18 well-known optimization methods, including ALO and GOA, in the majority of these tests, with huge differences in some of them, which prove the stability, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed method over other robust algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Timely inspection of structures is necessary to prevent damage progression and ensure the safety and efficiency of structures at the lowest cost. The existence of defects and partial failures in structures is the source of general failures and threats to the behavior of structures. In many cases, impending failure may not be apparent from its appearance. Hence, the study of structural failure is one of the essential areas of research that helps increase the structure&#39;s life and control the failure of structures. This research aims to investigate an approach for detecting damage in the structure, especially in the plates. An efficient method utilizing the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) as an optimization solver is presented here to detect the multiple-damage of structural systems. Accelerations changes of a structure are considered as a criterion for damage occurrence. The structural damage detection problem is first transmuted into a standard optimization problem dealing with continuous variables. Then the GOA is utilized to solve the optimization problem for finding the site and severity of structural damage. To assess the performance of the proposed method for damage identification, numerical examples with considering measurement noise are considered. All the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for accurately determining the site and severity of multiple-damage. Also, the performance of the GOA for damage detection compared to the differential evolution algorithm (DEA) is confirmed by a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Data clustering is a popular machine learning technique widely applied for data structure analysis. Among the major techniques, fuzzy co-clustering (FCoC) is known for the capability of complex data processing such as many features, large size, and uncertainty. In some cases, FCoC has demonstrated superior performance over some traditional clustering methods. However, FCoC has some limitations such as being sensitive to the initial cluster centers and being stuck at locally optimal values. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a multidisciplinary optimization algorithm. PSO was used to find a suitable initial cluster centers solution for the clustering algorithms. However, PSO is limited and unclear, especially for algorithms with complex structures and many parameters. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy co-clustering algorithm by using the optimal solution of the PSO algorithm to find the initial centroids for the FCoC algorithm. We call the new algorithm FCOCM. In our experience, we use symbols and mathematical language to describe the process of finding initial centroids called the optimal centroids model (OCM). Thus, our work proposes two new contributions including the OCM model and the FCOCM algorithm. Experiments were conducted on benchmark data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the School of the Computing University of Eastern Finland to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.},

To tune the PID controller for efficient operation, a novel metaheuristic algorithm is also developed in this paper which improves the performance of the reptile search algorithm via the integration of Lévy flight concept. This paper then proposes a new objective function by modifying the performance index called integral of time multiplied squared error in order to increase the performance of the proposed algorithm to effectively adjust the PID parameters adopted in a VCC system. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated comparatively using several assessments. Lastly, comparisons with the other available methods in the literature is performed in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method from a wider perspective.

It is found that the retailer with fairness concern sets lower retail price, the manufacturer chooses lower product greenness and wholesale price, and 3PL green level is not related to fairness concern. The retailer’s fairness concern is not conducive to the manufacturer, the 3PL supplier and the whole supply chain, but beneficial to the retailer. In addition, both these two contracts improve the performance of the supply chain and get more environmental benefits.

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of ad-hoc wireless technology amidst the huge demands of high data-rates, the simultaneous optimization of overall networking throughput and utility-proportional resource allocation is of utmost significance. The design of infrastructure-less ad-hoc wireless network with highly dynamic operating conditions can be intelligently modeled by using the artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning techniques. In this work, we employ the meta-heuristic computational method of genetic algorithm for multi-criterion optimization of sigmoidal utility maximization and throughput efficiency. The iterative implementation of the evolutionary genetic algorithm is effectively enforced by considering the comprehensive application of eight disparate combinations of individual creation, selection, mutation and crossover operations. Through the simulation experiments, the impact of execution of these feasible composite models on the derived two-dimensional Pareto-optimal frontier, the criteria satisfaction ratio and the average spread of individual solutions is extensively investigated. Furthermore, these diverse genetic operations for retrieving the optimal solution to the proposed problem formulation are compared in terms of the estimated precision and time complexity metrics. Finally, the efficacy of our optimization model is significantly compared with the previous works in terms of achievable throughput.},

  abstract     = {Future autonomous driving and next-generation vehicle control require further advances in vehicle dynamic state estimation. This paper describes a new localization approach based on the development of a personalized dynamic model for an autonomous car-like vehicle called “Robucar”. The proposed approach is used within a framework for the development of a Robucar Simulator Platform. This approach is firstly used offline (due to the computation time constraint) employing recorded odometric data to study and validate some developed applications related to the navigation function such as obstacle avoidance, target tracking, etc. However, this approach can be used online to obtain a good localization in real time, by using a powerful embedded system or simplifying some aspects not easily influenced in the proposed dynamic model. Localization issues have been discussed while analyzing some methods used in mobile robotics and describing the background and choices made in this paper. Using an appropriate tire-road contact model, dynamic equations of the forces and torques acting on the Robucar have been determined. The proposed dynamic model discussed in this paper has 18 Degrees of Freedom (DoF), considering fine technical characteristics related to the electrical motion, the geometry of the bi-steering system, and the tire-road contact type. Secondly, the developed dynamic model has been exploited to provide the Robucar’s position in outdoor environments using odometric measurements, adjusting several internal parameters. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the behavior of the developed dynamic model. Furthermore, an experimental test has been realized outdoors for a distance of 513 m to validate our new localization approach. The obtained experimental results are interesting and promising, showing clearly the effectiveness of the new approach adopted for localization in offline mode. The accuracy provided by the proposed dynamic model compared to the kinematic model is highlighted. Moreover, the developed dynamic model can be used in several fields other than localization, such as motion planning, control, and Robucar stability study.},

  abstract     = {The motivation for the search of efficient cache management policies is due to the drawback of the large number of CPU cycles taken to fetch a block from the main memory to the last level cache. Recently, Researchers are using most recent advancements in machine learning (ML) to optimise the performance of cache. They designed different models using ML techniques to improve the performance of cache. Unfortunately, the schemes suffer from several drawbacks like storage complexity incurred while storing the extra bits required for prediction, excess time required for prediction, increase in difficulty of reuse prediction when workloads are increased, increase in energy consumption during the prediction process and lack in achieving expected accuracy. In order to overcome these drawbacks, cache reuse prediction is analysed using classification problem, which is actual view of the learning problem. The vital parameters used are the Frequency of access and reuse distance, in which the latter is modelled as stack distance. As an innovative idea, reuse distance is calculated based on status of each block into account. In addition, numerical nature of the dataset used in this article, helps in exploration of the ensemble-based ML, which is less frequently experimented into the context of cache memories rather than the deep learning approach. By applying suitably placed models, the memory references with high reuse capabilities are fetched into the cache. They are predicted with the aid of classification and cross-validation on the feature sets, which improve the accuracy and sensitivity by 6.2% and 5.46% respectively, when compared to the existing works.},

This paper presents a new model that employs deep convolutional neural networks within a Gaussian-Bernoulli limited-time, for adult content image recognition of a wide variety in a precise and effective manner. There are various layers within Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and classification. Gaussian-Bernoulli limited-time was used for feature extraction to describe the images, and these features were summarized using the Boltzmann machine limited in the feature summary phase. The benefit of such an approach is convenience in carrying out feature extraction. Additionally, when tested on the most modern criterion dataset, this finding is believed to be more precise compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

The energy sector faces issues of unreliable supply, undersupply and high electricity rates. As power supply is an important source of daily requirement, this research work aims to improve the efficiency of solar power generation efficiency. In line with the aim, we proposed a modified Normative Fish Swarm Algorithm (mNFSA) and applied it to Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) process in Photovoltaic (PV) application systems. Significant modifications have been made to the original NFSA, including the removal of unnecessary features, the formulation of modified behaviors, the refinement of adaptive parameters as well as settings, and the implementation of the MPPT architecture. Results: A complete PV system model is constructed for simulation, in which 10 PV arrays with different shading levels are connected in series in the PV panel. For a consistent evaluation, 10 sets of data on maximum extracted power were collected during MPPT simulation process. The statistical data were recorded for comprehensive performance checks. Overall, mNFSA was compared with 6 other optimization algorithms, including 5 state-of-the-art algorithms and 1 related evolutionary algorithm. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that mNFSA outperforms other compared algorithms in terms of maximum extracted power and relative percentage error, demonstrating higher compatibility and effectiveness of mNFSA for MPPT. The statistical results support that mNFSA is one of the most robust algorithms and best suited for MPPT applications.},

The presented algorithm is evaluated on a group of 23 classical benchmark functions defined in CEC 2005 and 10 functions defined in CEC-C06, 2019. The results show that our algorithm outperforms, in many functions, other metaheuristics such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), Jaya algorithm, differential evolution (DE) and genetic algorithm (GA). The difference between the solution obtained with our EM-BT method and the global optimum solution is very small, up to $$1 \times 10^{-16}$$ , with a low standard deviation, which proves the accuracy, stability and superiority of the proposed method.},

Grey wolf Optimizer (GWO) is one such effective algorithm that was proposed recently. It has been researched extensively owing to its impressive characteristics—easy to understand and implement, few parameters to be tuned, capability to balance exploration and exploitation and high solution accuracy. But in solving high dependence or complex optimization problems, GWO can stagnate into local optima owing to poor exploration strategy and can converge prematurely. To overcome these drawbacks of GWO, we propose Quantum Entanglement enhanced Grey Wolf Optimizer (QEGWO). Quantum Entanglement is particularly useful in significantly improving the treatment of multimodal and high dependence problems. One more element—local search—is used and is helpful in the search intensification. The QEGWO algorithm is benchmarked on 12 standard benchmark functions (unimodal as well as multimodal) and results are compared with some existing variants of GWO. Further, it is also benchmarked on Congress of Evolutionary computing-2019 (CEC’19) benchmark set consisting of 10 shifted and rotated functions. Further, the applicability of the QEGWO is tested over harmonic estimator design problem. A bench of smooth and noisy functions is employed to test estimation accuracy of QEGWO. The results reveal that QEGWO performs significantly better as compared to other GWO variants.},

  abstract     = {Genomic clustering is a big data application that uses the K-means (KM) clustering approach to discover hidden patterns and trends in genes for disease diagnosis, biological analysis, and tissue detection. The KM algorithm is highly dependent on the initial centroid because it determines the effectiveness, efficiency, computing resources, and local optima of the KM clustering. The existing initial centroid initialization approach traps local optima due to randomization and achieves high computational cost due to the enormous interrelated dimension. Therefore, the KM algorithm produces the lowest quality cluster and maximizes the computation time and resource consumption. To address this issue, this study has presented the Min–Max Kurtosis Mean Distance (MKMD) algorithm for big data clustering in a single machine environment. The MKMD algorithm enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of the KM algorithm by measuring the distance between data points of the minimum–maximum kurtosis dimension and their mean. The performance of the presented algorithm has been compared against KM, KM +  + , ADV, MKM, Mean-KM, NFD, K-MAM, NRKM2, FMNN and MuKM algorithms using internal and external effectiveness evaluation criteria with efficiency assessment on sixteen genomic datasets. The experimental results reveal that the MKMDKM algorithm minimizes iterations, distance computation, data comparison, local optima, resource consumption, and improves cluster performance, effectiveness and efficiency with stable convergence and results as compared to other algorithms.

Unlike traditional ensemble learning that processes the whole image, the proposed system processes only the Suspected Nodule Regions (SNRs), extracted using an optimal dynamic thresholding method, where the threshold varies corresponding to the details of each input image. The SNRs affords better performance and offer the ability to detect small size nodules. The ensemble is composed of four transfer learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (i.e., AlexNet, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201). A binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) follows each CNN model to provide either a malignant or a benign score. To obtain the final system decision, the first-order momentum is derived over the four binary outputs of the ensemble CNNs and the final decision is guided by the four CNNs’ training accuracies. The proposed ensemble fusion scheme, tested on Region of Interest (ROI) images, using the public digital medical images Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM), achieves an accuracy of 94% to distinguish between Malignant (M) and Benign (B) classes and of 95% to distinguish between Malignant Mass (MM) and Benign Mass (BM) nodules. Comparison with related methods on the same data confirms the accuracy and advantages of the proposed ensemble system.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning is an emerging technology that can effectively safeguard personal information. As opposed to traditional centralized learning, federated learning can avoid data sharing while maintaining global model training. However, in the process of updating the global model, it will consume huge client communication resources, which hinder the wide application of this technology. To reduce the communication overhead without seriously reducing the accuracy of the global model, under the federated learning framework, we use decomposition based multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOEA/D) to optimize the structure of the global model. For the structure of the global model, a highly scalable coding method is used for coding, which improves the efficiency of the evolutionary neural network. As a comparison, we use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II(NSGA II) to optimize the problem under the same conditions and verify the effectiveness of both algorithms according to the obtained Pareto solution. We verify that MOEA/D has better convergence when using multilayer and convolutional neural networks as the global model. Overall, MOEA/D can further strengthen the structure optimization of the federated learning model and reduce communication costs.},

  abstract     = {Hyper-parameter optimization (HO), regardless of the type of optimization, inherently not only increases the completion time of the algorithm to be optimized but also creates a remarkable computational burden. However, employing the most suitable HO technique for a specific problem may not be sufficient to improve the performance of the selected machine learning algorithm. In such cases, it is common to deploy default values of the initialization hyper-parameters of HO. Instead, a configured set of initialization hyper-parameters of HO is significantly more impactful than a default mode of HO. In this study, a metaheuristic ensemble technique is proposed to configure the initialization hyper-parameters of HO. The proposed method is devised after an extensive time analysis of metaheuristics and applied to Echo State Network (ESN). The experiment performed with weather forecast data shows that metaheuristic initialization methods are quite compatible with evolutionary algorithms. In the benchmark, the proposed method outperformed two alternatives. Probabilistic methods such as Bayesian optimization are not preferable for metaheuristic initialization methods, according to the results of the experiment. Metaheuristic hyper-parameter initialization methods can be performed by utilizing Random search that provides a moderate performance in which there are hardware-restricted sources. Last, the hyper-parameter called leakingrate of ESN is the most sensitive one and creates the largest churns in the prediction performance.},

In this present study, a new swarm-based nature inspired algorithm, called Termite Alate Optimization Algorithm (TAOA), is proposed based on the phototactic activity of a termite alate group. The advantage of this algorithm is its faster convergence rate with effective exploration and exploitation capability. The algorithm also has a moderate number of process parameters and computational complexity. To evaluate the capability total 30 benchmark instances and 5 real-life problems are solved by this algorithm. Apart from the benchmark and real-life instances, the algorithm is also applied in the flow shop problem to evaluate its effectiveness. Finally, a comparison between the results of TAOA and other existing algorithms is carried out, which validates its ability.},

AOA represents the behavior of four basic arithmetic operators. Therefore, AOA performs the optimization process in a wide search space with its mathematical model. Therefore AOA has an effective convergence capability. In addition, ten different chaotic maps are applied on the AOA. In this study, 7 scenarios were created with chaotic maps, taking into account different phases of AOA. The proposed CAOA is tested on eighteen benchmark problems. CAOA produces successful and promising results in solving optimization problems compared to original AOA algorithm. The proposed CAOA is also compared with the original AOA.

Aiming at how to effectively segment soot target area from the background by using computer image recognition technology in the automatic monitoring of Ringelmann scale, and the industrial soot is characterized by unstable shape and high cloud similarity, which leads to inaccurate results of smoke segmentation with traditional existing methods under complex scenes. This paper proposes a novel fully convolutional network (FCN) based on marker-controlled watershed segmentation algorithm for industrial soot target segmentation. Firstly, the marker-controlled watershed algorithm is used to extract the connected regions in the soot image, and the corresponding target positions of the original image are marked and normalized to extract the candidate soot regions. The marker-controlled watershed method can greatly reduce the detection time of candidate regions and the recognition time of FCN. The extracted candidate regions are input into the improved FCN for feature extraction and prediction. Combined with multi-scale convolution operation, the feature extraction ability of FCN network is enhanced. By adding dynamic weights on the basis of cross entropy, the training of inaccurate regions is enhanced and the accuracy of segmentation is further improved. Experimental results on a real industrial soot emission image data sets show that the proposed method is more accurate than the original models under the complex scene for smoke segmentation. The F1 measurement and IoU indexes are significantly improved than that of state-of-the-art segmentation methods, which exceeds 87% and 85% respectively.},

This paper aims to improve the quality of that method by finding ways to increase both the number of obtained itemsets and the associated total utility of those itemsets. The method used is based on binary particle swarm optimization, which is one of the best algorithms to obtain high-utility itemsets based on swarm intelligence. To get the maximum results we tuned up the method to determine the optimal configurations of four parameters: initial population, inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and velocity clamping. Our experimental results on five datasets indicate that the best configuration is combining constriction factor or adaptive method for setting inertia weight and using self-adaptive for acceleration coefficient. The use of frequent itemset or transactions of the highest total utility for initializing population does not have a significant addition compared to the inertia weight and acceleration coefficient parameters. The correct configuration of the binary particle swarm optimization can increase the number of high-utility itemsets compared to the standard configuration. The percentage increase of the number of itemset compared to the existing standard method is 157.93% for chess dataset, 134.39% for connect dataset, 42.69% for accident dataset, 4.62% for foodmart dataset, and 1.58% for mushroom dataset.},

This research focuses on designing an automatic recommendation approach for the learners using the proposed optimization algorithm, named Bat Competitive Swarm Optimizer (BCSO). Initially, the e-learning contents are added into One Learning Repository, where the learning objects are uploaded manually as well as dynamically. The web crawler is used for the automatic content preparation by inputting the parent link with the restricted rule list. Thereafter, the categorization of the e-learning objects is done on the basis of types, topics, and preparation methods using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Local Enhancement based Rough K-Means Clustering automatically. Once the e-learning topics are categorized, the automatic recommendation of learning objects to the user is carried out by Deep Maxout Network (DMN). Here, the training of DMN is performed based on BCSO, which is devised by the combination of Bat Algorithm with Competitive Swarm Optimizer. Furthermore, the performance of the developed approach is analyzed and compared with the existing methods.

At each iteration, the inertia weight value is dynamically adjusted to balance the global exploration and local development, and improve the optimization accuracy and convergence speed of the algorithm. Secondly, compared with the switching probability, the algorithm can perform Levy flight with high probability at the beginning of the iteration to increase the population diversity and improve the global search ability. Thirdly, the greedy strategy is introduced to select the solution with optimal adaptability. Finally, to verify the performance of the DFGWO algorithm, the simulation experiments are carried out on 12 standard test functions and compared with several other algorithms.

In the present study, a modified version of FPA is proposed accounting for an additional feature of flower pollination in nature that is the so-called pollinator attraction. Pollinator attraction represents the natural tendency of flower species to evolve in order to attract pollinators by using their colour, shape and scent as well as nutritious rewards. To reflect this evolution mechanism, the proposed FPA variant with Pollinator Attraction (FPAPA) provides fitter flowers of the population with higher probabilities of achieving pollen transfer via biotic pollination than other flowers. FPAPA is tested against a set of 28 benchmark mathematical functions, defined in IEEE-CEC’13 for real-parameter single-objective optimization problems, as well as structural optimization problems. Numerical experiments show that the modified FPA represents a statistically significant improvement upon the original FPA and that it can outperform other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms offering better and more robust optimal solutions. Additional research is suggested to combine FPAPA with other modified and hybridized versions of FPA to further increase its performance in challenging optimization problems.},

Event, changes the amount of textual data, in a way that it presents related topics in a specific time period. This event is identified by time and topic, and is related with entities like people and places. The computations related to event detection in real time is a big problem in this context.

Later, in a flow manner, unlabeled data are presented to the model. The unlabeled data are divided into the present classes according to the model which they have been trained. If the data are higher than an identified threshold, they are assigned to a new class, and when the data are lower than the threshold, they are categorized as temporary event. Innovation of the proposed method is in two issues. First, the data in this model are semi-supervised; therefore, the labeled data are used in the first phase and the rest of the data are used in the second phase. In HAN classification phase, a module titled bag of sentence was produced for exact classification of sentences, and in the second phase the abstract concept of Virtual backbone was used to enhance precision of multi label clustering. Adding these two sections using the proposed method enhanced the precision of classification and purification of the data in unlabeled data.},

  abstract     = {We propose an online learning model that efficiently teaches a defender’s agent to learn the attacker’s behavior while interacting in the cyber-world. This paper models the interaction between these two agents as a stochastic game with limited rationality. Because of this limited rationality, the proposed model helps the defender’s agent learn the unknown communicator’s behavior from the feedback obtained while interacting with it. Many models are built to solve the interaction between them by developing a state-oriented stochastic Markov game. However, such models fail due to the state explosion problem, and therefore, this paper discusses a model to solve this game, restricting it to a stateless stochastic game. The model is then compared to check the performance with different algorithms that solve stochastic games. The comparison between them shows that the proposed algorithm converges to an optimal strategy in a brief simulation time span. Finally, our model checks the performance with an existing technique that shows that the proposed algorithm chooses the correct strategy for around 91% of the simulation time compared to 73% of the simulation time by the existing algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has badly affected people of all ages globally. Therefore, its vaccine has been developed and made available for public use in unprecedented times. However, because of various levels of hesitancy, it did not have general acceptance. The main objective of this work is to identify the risk associated with the COVID-19 vaccines by developing a prognosis tool that will help in enhancing its acceptability and therefore, reducing the lethality of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The obtained raw VAERS dataset has three files indicating medical history, vaccination status, and post vaccination symptoms respectively with more than 354 thousand samples. After pre-processing, this raw dataset has been merged into one with 85 different attributes however, the whole analysis has been subdivided into three scenarios ((i) medical history (ii) reaction of vaccination (iii) combination of both). Further, Machine Learning (ML) models which includes Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Light Gradient Boosting Algorithm (LGBM), and Multilayer feed-forward perceptron (MLP) have been employed to predict the most probable outcome and their performance has been evaluated based on various performance parameters. Also, the chi-square (statistical), LR, RF, and LGBM have been utilized to estimate the most probable attribute in the dataset that resulted in death, hospitalization, and COVID-19. Results: For the above mentioned scenarios, all the models estimates different attributes (such as cardiac arrest, Cancer, Hyperlipidemia, Kidney Disease, Diabetes, Atrial Fibrillation, Dementia, Thyroid, etc.) for death, hospitalization, and COVID-19 even after vaccination. Further, for prediction, LGBM outperforms all the other developed models in most of the scenarios whereas, LR, RF, NB, and MLP perform satisfactorily in patches. Conclusion: The male population in the age group of 50–70 has been found most susceptible to this virus. Also, people with existing serious illnesses have been found most vulnerable. Therefore, they must be vaccinated in close observations. Generally, no serious adverse effect of the vaccine has been observed therefore, people must vaccinate themselves without any hesitation at the earliest. Also, the model developed using LGBM establishes its supremacy over all the other prediction models. Therefore, it can be very helpful for the policymakers in administrating and prioritizing the population for the different vaccination programs.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19, is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It has a direct impact on the upper and lower respiratory tract and threatened the health of many people around the world. The latest statistics show that the number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 is growing exponentially. Diagnosing positive cases of COVID-19 is important for preventing further spread of the disease. Currently, Coronavirus is a serious threat to scientists, medical experts and researchers around the world from its detection to its treatment. It is currently detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis at the most test centers around the world. Yet, knowing the reliability of a deep learning based medical diagnosis is important for doctors to build confidence in the technology and improve treatment. The goal of this study is to develop a model that automatically identifies COVID-19 by using chest X-ray images. To achieve this, we modified the DarkCovidNet model which is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and plotted the experimental results for two scenarios: binary classification (COVID-19 versus No-findings) and multi-class classification (COVID-19 versus pneumonia versus No-findings). The model is trained on more than 10 thousand X-ray images and achieved an average accuracy of 99.53% and 94.18% for binary and multi-class classification, respectively. Therefore, the proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness of COVID-19 detection using X-ray images. Our model can be used to test the patient via cloud and also be used in situations where RT-PCR tests and other options aren&#39;t available.},

  abstract     = {Every day millions of skin and acne face images are generated all around the world and compression is the inevitability of all such types of images. Acne images suffer from the problem of poor compression ratios for obtaining high Peak Signal to Noise Ratio. Both, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio and Compression Ratio follow an inverse relationship. In this paper a new algorithm for acne image compression is proposed. The Proposed algorithm works in such a way that even a highly compressed image would retain all the mandatory information, since the region of interest (that is necessary for diagnosis) retains a significant quality and is compressed to an optimal level. Based on the image’s Red and Green matrices, an automatic selection algorithm for the region of interest (patch) is introduced. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the conventional compression methods. A better peak signal to noise ratio of the instructive patch and overall compression ratios are achieved. Further the results are compared using different wavelet functions such as ‘haar’, ‘db2’and ‘bior1.3’ wavelet. We also investigate proposed algorithms on other mother wavelets such as &#39;coiflet1&#39; and &#39;symlet1’’ and results are found to be superior.},

The proposed adaptive DRQN model includes the application of GRU instead of LSTM unit to store the relevant features for the effective classification of Sacramento city crime data. The storage of relevant features for a long time helps to handle the data imbalance problem and irrelevant features are eliminated to avoid overfitting problems. Adaptive agents based on the MDP are applied to adaptively learn the input data and provide effective predictions. The reinforcement learning method is applied in the proposed adaptive DRQN model to select the optimal state value and to identify the best reward value. The proposed adaptive DRQN model has an MAE of 36.39 which is better than the existing Recurrent Q-Learning model has 38.82 MAE.},

  abstract     = {Image clustering is one of the most important and challenging process of digital image processing and computer vision; refers to partitioning an image into meaningful regions. In medical imaging, the segmentation of anatomical magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a crucial step to a multitude of applications, including computer-aided diagnosis, monitoring of cancerous pathologies, morphometric analysis and visualization of human tissues. Unfortunately, MR images contain intensity inhomogeneity and noise produced by the scanning tool can lead to inaccurate and unreliable results segmentation. In this context, we proposed a robust and efficient fuzzy clustering method called Modified Kernel with Exponential Entropy: MK2E which is introduced by modifying the kernel fuzzy c-means method and by incorporating the fuzzy exponential entropy and a logarithmic penalty term. Moreover, we have examined an important theoretical question regarding the mathematical properties behind our fuzzy MK2E clustering algorithm such as convergence. Experiments were performed on normal brain images from T1-weighted MRI scans with varying noise levels and intensity inhomogeneity. The results illustrate the superiority of our proposed method over other six compared methods in terms of accuracy segmentation and execution time.},

WCA has received critical intrigued from researchers in different fields. Nevertheless, the search equation provided in WCA is not of adequate explorative behavior. In this study a reconfigured version of the WCA is proposed, the proposed algorithm is named as RWCA. So as to improve the exploration procedure, a new position update strategy is proposed by integrating cauchy operator and a greedy selection procedure. Furthermore, in order to promote the exploration-exploitation balance of the RWCA algorithm, a nonlinear controlling parameter is proposed. The performance of RWCA is exhibited on 19 unconstrained benchmark functions. Statistical analysis proves that, RWCA significantly improves the performance of basic WCA by providing better solution quality, faster convergence and stronger robustness. Moreover, RWCA has been used to solve five constrained numerical and three engineering application problems. Based on the experiments and comparative findings, RWCA illustrates the adequacy and effectiveness to solve various constrained problems; as well as its capability of providing promising and competitive results solving real-world challenging engineering problems.},

MBO is used to determine the optimal length of intervals in the Universe of Discourse (UoD) while keeping the number of intervals constant. The accuracy of the resulting algorithm is determined by taking the measures, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

This paper focuses on exactly satisfying the linear equality constraints present in continuous optimization problems that may also include additional non-linear equality and inequality constraints. The proposed method, named DELEqC-III, is an extension of two other previously developed methods. In this work, the original constrained problem (in $${\mathbb {R}}^n$$ ) is transformed into a lower-dimensional ( $${\mathbb {R}}^{n-m}$$ ) unconstrained optimization problem, where n is the number of variables and m is the number of linear equality constraints. DELEqC-III performs the search in the null space associated with the linear equality constraints allowing the method to exactly satisfy such constraints. In order to show the efficiency of the method, scalable test-problems are used to analyze the performance of the new proposal.},

This paper proposes an Island-Based Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (IBHEA) that uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Differential Evolution (DE) Algorithm with different parameters settings in different islands communicating through several migration policies to solve the CRDP. Computational experiments showed that IBHEA outperformed more than 5% compared with non-distributed and non-hybrid implementations, generating a greater variety of diets with a small calorie count.},

The node locations and DG ratings of DG placement (DGP) problem are considered as optimization parameters with an objective of minimizing the network loss (NL). The soccer game optimization (SGO) models the movements of soccer game players by &quot;move-off&quot; and &quot;move-forward&quot; phases, and has the drawback of performing simple arithmetic average for representing random stochastic movements of players during its &quot;move-forward&quot; phase. This paper endeavours to first remodel the move-forward phase by adapting Levy Flight mechanism to simulate the random jumping action of players to a long distance in getting the ball and scoring a goal, and then develop new modified SGO (MSGO) based methods for solving the formulated DPF and DGP problems. The simulation study exhibited that the proposed DPF method is 751 and 666 times faster than the NR PF technique and the DGP method is able to save the NL by 65% and 69% for 33 and 69 node systems respectively.},

RCPSP is very important in production and management but computationally hard. It is widely used in many fields like job shop scheduling, flow shop scheduling, transactional planning, wireless communication etc. The objective of solving RCPSP is to obtain minimum makespan maintaining all constraints. There are some exact, approximate, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms which were proposed to solve this problem. RCPSP is an NP-hard problem. Chemical reaction optimization (CRO) is a population based metaheuristic method to solve such problems and it shows better performance comparing with some other existing algorithms. CRO explores the large search space both locally and globally using its four operators. Genetic algorithm (GA) is also a nature inspired algorithm which is used to solve various optimization problems. In this paper, we are proposing a hybrid metaheuristic approach that integrates chemical reaction optimization (CRO) and genetic algorithm (GA) named CRO-GA to solve RCPSP. We have redesigned the basic operators of CRO and GA to find out the solutions. An additional operator called priority based selection operator is used in CRO to adjust with GA. Our proposed method is compared with other related approaches such as adaptive particle swarm optimization (A-PSO), multi agent optimization algorithm (MAOA), artificial bee colony (ABC), genetic algorithm (GA) which are state of the art for the RCPSP.

Global position systems are a familiar solution for outdoor localization systems. But the presence of complicated obstacles in buildings poses a major challenge in indoor localization. Though few indoor localization techniques based on ranging and fingerprint based techniques are devised, they are time consuming and laborious. Therefore, this paper devises an efficient deer hunting optimization algorithm with weighted least square estimation (DHOA-WLSE) technique for accurate 3D indoor node localization technique. The proposed DHOA-WLSE technique has the ability to accomplish minimal localization error with least localization time. In DHOA-WLSE technique, the DHOA is used to estimate the primary target location to eliminate the non-line of sight errors. Based on the primary locations attained, the WLSE technique is applied to determine the accurate target’s final location. In order to validate the 3D indoor localization performance of the DHOA-WLSE technique, an extensive simulation analysis is performed and the results are investigated in terms of different measures. The simulation outcomes demonstrated the superior performance of the DHOA-WLSE technique over the recent state of art techniques.},

We formulate the robust multi-objective VRPTW (RMOVRPTW) model and propose a robust optimization algorithm based on MOEA/D (R-MOEAD-VRP) for simultaneously optimizing the total distance and the number of vehicles required for transport. First, we use the priority of the customers being served to encode and use the defined transformation approach to form the feasible routes. Next, we employ Order Crossover and Exchange mutation operators to increase population diversity. For the new routes by reproduction, we use Monte-Carlo tests to check the feasibility of the routes after adding uncertainty. For the feasible routes, we calculate the solution robustness values based on the defined method. Finally, we consider both optimality and robustness to form a set of highly robust and relatively optimal solutions. For verifying the availability of the presented algorithm, the simulation experiments conduct on Solomon’s benchmark problems compared with several related algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can bring more robust and non-dominated solutions under uncertainty and can achieve good performance.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation is considered one of the important tasks for extracting useful information from an image. Multilevel thresholding image segmentation is one of the effective techniques for image segmentation. The computation time grows exponentially of traditional multilevel thresholding methods such as Kapur with the number of thresholds. Meta-heuristic algorithms based on swarm intelligence have proved their efficiency in solving the multilevel thresholding optimization problem. In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm based on quantum computing (QC) and optimal foraging algorithm (OFA) for multilevel image segmentation is presented. The main characteristic of the proposed quantum optimal foraging algorithm (QOFA) is the integration of quantum operators such as interference with the optimization process of OFA to get a proper balance between exploration and exploitation phases. The feasibility of the proposed multilevel image segmentation algorithm has been evaluated and tested on real abdominal CT liver images. All the results are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to evaluate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm is a very promising algorithm and it can provide better segmentation results compared with the standard OFA.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a new version of cat behavior in hunting. Cat Hunting Optimization (CHO) algorithm Unlike cat optimization algorithms, search strategy is not limited to tracking and attacking. The CHO algorithm has various behaviors such as changing the nature of the search from global to local, creating the number of positions based on the merit of a point for the cat to roam, searching between the optimal space and the current solution, search strategy at the gravity point of the solution and so on. The advantage of the proposed algorithm over the standard cat algorithm is that the answers do not attack the prey quickly, and this provides a chance to find more efficient solutions in the global search. In the proposed method for intelligent search, the problem space of the search radius around the optimal solutions changes in a new way based on trigonometric relations such as cosine. The CHO algorithm considers a kind of individual learning between cats, and experienced cats inspire young cats to identify optimal solutions. Experiments on a set of standard benchmark functions show that in most of the functions the optimal calculation error of the CHO is less than SHO, GOA, GWO, FA, DE, PSO, COA algorithms. Implement on the Experiments show that in the most exam the CHO has the first rank in terms of the accuracy of the global optimal calculation in the Frieden test. The CHO algorithm offers less cost in solving engineering optimization problems than WOA, LDF, and HHO algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) based Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UASN), efficient data collection with minimum delay and high throughput is a fundamental research challenge. Most of the existing data collection schemes using AUVs are suffered from unbalanced energy consumption, long delay, partial coverage, and incomplete data collection problems. To overcome these problems, this paper proposed an optimized coverage-aware target node selection and trajectory planning scheme for AUVs for fast and efficient data collection in the Underwater Sensor Networks. Optimal selection of coverage-aware target nodes and trajectory planning of the multiple AUVs are proposed using Backtracking Search Optimization (BSO) technique. After deployment of the underwater sensor nodes, first, network is partitioned into a set of load balanced cluster-region. After that, optimized coverage-aware target node is selected from each cluster-region for collection of the sensed data using AUVs. For optimizing the trajectory of the AUVs, a BSO-based trajectory planning scheme is proposed with novel fitness function. The proposed scheme dispatches multiple AUVs concurrently for high availability and low delay in the data collected from the cluster-regions. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with some latest state-of-art existing schemes in terms of coverage ratio, total travel distance, maximum travel distance, delay, and average energy consumption. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme performs well and very capable in providing the fast and high availability of the sensed data collection from UASN.},

  abstract     = {The world is currently undergoing water scarcity problems, even if it seems to be the most abundant resource on earth. However, the freshwater account is really in small amounts, while agriculture production consumes 70% of the majority of water withdrawals than any other source. Therefore, in order to preserve it, the irrigation operation has to be optimized by controlling efficiently the water used for irrigation. For that purpose, several technologies can be applied, such as the internet of things (IoT) technology which can perform as decision support in the irrigation process. The precise irrigation systems based on IoT involve several intricacies such as huge amounts of data and integration of large system components, which makes it difficult to be optimized analytically or with deterministic methods. For this reason, it was necessary to develop stochastic multi-objective optimization methods such as the evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which can solve complicated problems with a large number of parameters in relation. The EAs may be of relevant use except that they introduce processing time constraints. In this article, we aim at making a state of the art about the use of EAs combined with IoT and applied to precise irrigation. We will focus particularly on their uses classifications as well as the manner in which they have been implemented to reduce their computing times in distributed computing architectures, particularly those using the cloud, as well as in hardware accelerators forms.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is still one of the most common unsupervised learning techniques in data mining since it allows the discovery of meaningful and interesting patterns, knowledge, rules and associations from large-scale datasets. K-medoids, a variant of K-means, is a popular clustering method that attempts to find the optimal combination of K medoids from among a set of potential combinations. It has been successfully applied to solve various real-life problems owing to its simplicity and effectiveness. Nevertheless, due to the exponential number of possible combinations of K medoids, it is extremely challenging to produce the optimal one within a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, in this work, we propose to formulate the problem of K-medoids clustering as an optimization problem and then combine two effective and powerful Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms, namely Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to select the appropriate combination of K medoids. We extensively evaluate the proposed FA-PSO for K-medoids-based clustering, abbreviated as FA-PSO-KMED, using 10 UCI datasets. We first use the Iterated F-Race (I/F-Race) algorithm to determine the optimal parameter settings for FA and PSO. Then, we compare the results of the proposed FA-PSO-KMED with those obtained using the well-known state-of-the-art K-medoids-based clustering algorithms: PAM, CLARA and CLARANS. We also compare the results with 11 popular swarm intelligence algorithms: PSO, ABC, CS, FA, BA, APSO, EHO, HHO, SMA, AO and RSA. Experimental results and statistical analysis show that the proposed FA-PSO-KMED is very promising and demonstrates a significant improvement over the other clustering algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Forest fire disturbs the balance of the earth’s ecological system, increases global warming, flood, drought and decreases the oxygen level. Early identification of forest fires is the only way to mitigate the risk of damages. This motivates authors to design a fog assisted wildfire detection framework using Internet of Things. The proposed model is divided into three layers, such as- data sensing edge layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. The forest area is categorized into different zones. In the data sensing edge layer, the edge nodes of each zone sense the forest fire causing data and transmit it to the corresponding fog devices of the fog layer. Furthermore, an Integrated Rule based classification technique is developed in this paper to detect the status of the zone (VHR/HR/MR/LR) by the fog devices of that zone. This way, edge nodes of LR zones will not transmit data further to the corresponding fog device. As a result, the energy of the edge devices is preserved. Moreover, the cloud layer of the proposed model involves into forest fire monitoring and burnt area prediction using the Keras API model. All the communications are done here applying proposed Modified Greedy Forwarding Algorithm. The fire detection accuracy of proposed FogFire model is 94% which is greater than other existing fire detection techniques. On the other hand, the Qualnet simulator proves that average remaining energy, over all throughput and goodput of the proposed model is also high compared to other IoT communication protocols such as RPL, AODV.},

The OPF learning process is performed in a competitive fashion where a few key samples (i.e., prototypes) try to conquer the remaining training samples to build optimum-path trees (OPT). The task of selecting prototypes is paramount to obtain high-quality OPTs, thus being of great importance to the classifier. The most used approach computes a minimum spanning tree over the training set and promotes the samples nearby the decision boundary as prototypes. Although such methodology has obtained promising results in the past year, it can be prone to overfitting. In this work, it is proposed a metaheuristic-based approach (OPFmh) for the selection of prototypes, being such a task modeled as an optimization problem whose goal is to improve accuracy. The experimental results showed the OPFmh can reduce overfitting, as well as the number of prototypes in many situations.

However, classifying an enormous amount of remote sensing data is a challenging task in scene classification. In this research work, a new model is introduced to improve the feature extraction ability for better scene classification. A multiscale Retinex technique is employed for color restoration, and contrast enhancement in the aerial images that are collected from UC Merced, aerial image dataset, and RESISC45. Further, the feature extraction is carried out using steerable pyramid transform, gray level co-occurrence matrix features, and local ternary pattern. The feature extraction mechanism reduces overfitting risks, improves training process, and data visualization ability. Generally, the extracted features are high dimension, so an unsupervised feature selection based on multi subspace randomization and collaboration with state transition algorithm is proposed for selecting active features for better multiclass classification. The selected features are fed to long short term memory network for scene type classification. The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved 99.14 %, 98.09%, and 99.25% of overall classification accuracy on UC Merced, RESISC45 and aerial image dataset. The proposed model showed a minimum of 0.03 % and maximum of 18.6 % improvement in classification accuracy compared to the existing models like self-attention based deep feature fusion, multitask learning system with convolutional neural network, multilayer feature fusion Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, and transfer learning model on UC Merced, RESISC45 and aerial dataset, respectively.},

Non-stochastic methods of fuzzy time series forecasting are preferred by the researchers over the years because these methods are capable to deal with real life uncertainties and provide significant forecast. There are generally, four factors that determine the performance of the forecasting method (1) number of intervals (NOIs) and length of intervals to partition universe of discourse (UOD), (2) fuzzification rules or feature representation of crisp time series, (3) method of establishing fuzzy logic rule (FLRs), (4) defuzzification rule to get crisp forecasted value. Considering, first two factors to improve the forecasting accuracy, we proposed a modified non-stochastic method of fuzzy time series forecasting in which interval index number and membership value are used as input features to predict future value. We suggested a rounding-off range and large step-size method to find the optimal NOIs and used fuzzy c-means clustering process to divide UOD into intervals of unequal length. We implement two techniques (1) regression by support vector machine and (2) neural network by multilayer perceptron to establish FLRs. To test our proposed method by both techniques we conduct a simulated study on eight widely used real time series and compare the performance with some recently developed models. Two performance measures RSME and SMAPE are used for performance analysis and observed better forecasting accuracy by the proposed model.},

Direct load control (DLC) and time of use (TOU) based on the demand response program (DRP) have been used for simulations. In addition, a two-stage optimization algorithm has been devised to solve the optimization problem. In the first stage, all responses to form the Pareto optimal front (the response of each objective) are generated using a genetic algorithm. In the second stage, the best solution is achieved using max –min decision-making method. The results obtained from the simulations revealed that, due to the positive implementation of TOU and DLC of DRP, total technical constraints of SPL-based distribution networks were improved. This means that, power loss and voltage profile objectives are satisfied. All of the simulations are carried out on a 33-buses IEEE system by MATLAB software.},

In case these inspections are not performed properly, the likelihood of occurrence of accidents will be very high. In this sense, structural health monitoring techniques based on the use of optimization algorithms appear as a promising and non-destructive methodology. In this study, an inverse damage identification problem is formulated and solved in order to identify damages in large-scale lattice-type structures. The direct problem is numerically formulated using finite element method considering a 72-bar truss where the modal response is obtained. A recent new metaheuristic SunFlower Optimization algorithm is used to solve the inverse damage problem formulated in terms of multiple damage sites and two independent objective functions (based on natural frequencies and mode shapes). Numerical results have shown that the inclusion of mode shapes in a multiobjective formulation improves the ability to accurately identify the damage in terms of its location and severity.

  abstract     = {Symbiotic Organism Search (SOS) is a novel metaheuristic algorithm based on reciprocal behaviour of organisms in environment by considering three imperative relationships such as mutualism, commensalism and parasitism. The mutualism phase of SOS algorithm contemplates Benefit Factors (BFs) which influences the SOS algorithm. In this work, two novel approaches are introduced to enhance the competence of SOS algorithm to exquisitely preserve the balance between exploration and exploitation. Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) is used to decide relevant influential parameter of SOS algorithm such as BFs and further, SCA optimized fuzzy inference system is used for this purpose. The efficacy and effectiveness of proposed algorithms are demonstrated over other recently proposed algorithms by solving benchmark functions, engineering design problems and prediction of next day closing price of DJI market. The proposed SCA optimized fuzzy adaptive SOS algorithm is substantiated with the results which outperforms other algorithms hypothetically by using Wilcoxon rank sum test.},

The proposed MOMPA can address multiple and conflicting objectives when solving optimization problems. The MOMPA is formulated using elitist non-dominated sorting and crowding distance mechanisms. The proposed method is tested on various multi-objective case studies, including 32 unconstrained, constraint, and engineering design problems with different linear, nonlinear, continuous, and discrete characteristics-based Pareto front problems. The results of the proposed MOMPA are compared with several well-regarded Multi-Objective Water-Cycle Algorithm, Multi-Objective Symbiotic-Organism Search, Multi-Objective Moth-Flame Optimizer algorithms qualitatively and quantitatively using several performance indicators.

The proposed approach is firstly tested in the deterministic environment using the EVRP benchmark data set, where the numerical results show that this approach is able to provide EVRP optimal solutions, within a very short computational time, for 39 out of 48 used benchmark instances with 20, 50, 75 and 100 customers.

A further pattern of data in terms of shape, size, and distribution has a significant effect on the exploitation and exploration characteristic of algorithms which draw attention to many researchers. This work attempts to solve this problem by proposing an LNSMO local neighbour spider monkey optimization algorithm for data clustering. In the proposed algorithm Local Leader Phase of the spider monkey optimization algorithm is improved with its neighbour solution. Further to enhance the global search global leader phase of spider monkey optimization is improved with a chaotic operator. The performance of LNSMO is compared with eleven real-life datasets with five well-known Meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of a sum of within-cluster distance and convergence speed. It is further compared with recently developed hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms.

Mutual fund is a structured investment instrument in economic market and the measuring instrument required to price it is called as Net Asset Value (NAV). For NAV prediction, Artificial Neural Network has been immensely utilized in the past due to its adaptive learning, robustness and great ability to identify and handle hidden nonlinear patterns. In this study, a Chebyshev Polynomial Neural Network (CPNN) has been proposed for one day ahead prediction of three different NAV data set belonging to three leading Indian financial houses. The controlling parameters of the network are estimated by a computationally intelligent meta-heuristic algorithm known as Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA). It is a nature inspired algorithm, motivated by the pollination process of flowering plants with very few control parameters and rapid convergence rate. The efficacy of the proposed forecasting model is also examined by a comparative analysis of training of CPNN with other optimizing algorithms like Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on the same set of data collected over the same period of time. The convergence plots obtained during the training of the models and the different error metrics values calculated during their testing phase of the study showcase that the proposed CPNN-FPA model clearly outperforms the other two experimented predictive models.},

The modules include global guide assignment, local and global guide update, line assignment to the guides and swarm, and evolutionary search for global guides.

  abstract     = {According to the research works of the references on chaotic cryptanalysis, many recent chaotic image encryption algorithms cannot resist chosen-plaintext attacks. Although some chaotic image encryption algorithms introduce plain-image information, they still violate some design requirements of modern cryptosystems. The traditional image encryption algorithm has the disadvantages of low security and time-consuming. Therefore, after analyzing many literatures related to chaotic image encryption and aiming to improve the security of ciphertext and effectively resist plaintext attack, we propose a hybrid chaotic system-oriented artificial fish swarm neural network method for image encryption. Firstly, based on the nonlinear combination theory, the Logistic, Tent and Sine mappings are used to design the hybrid complex chaotic system. According to the pixel value of plaintext, it generates the initial value to output the chaotic sequence. Taking a chaotic sequence as the input layer, the artificial neural network is introduced to train and learn the chaotic sequence. It eliminates the chaotic periodicity and outputs the neural network sequence. The artificial fish swarm algorithm is used to optimize the initial weight and threshold of the Elman neural network. The set obfuscation method is defined to scramble the plaintext. A quantization method is constructed to quantify the neural network sequence and obtain the key flow. The mixed images are classified, the key flow is combined, the pixel value is changed and the ciphertext is output by designing the piecewise diffusion technology. Experimental results show that compared with the current state-of-the-art image encryption methods, the proposed algorithm has higher security and resist plaintext attack ability.},

  abstract     = {Protein remote homology detection (PRHD) is one of the intense researched and a complex problem in computational biology. The objective of PRHD is to predict the structural and functional characteristics of un-annotated protein sequences by means of homologies. Two sequences are said to be homologous if there exists a shared ancestry between them. It aims to detect the evolutionary relationships among protein sequences, that are distantly located, via computational techniques. Prediction of functions of protein sequences are computationally intensive. Features extracted from protein sequences are too high and presence of insignificant redundant features degrades the performance of computational model with respect to time and cost. Hence, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA, the high dimensional input matrix was transformed into a lower dimension matrix. In the first stage, for each protein sequence, 531 physico-chemical properties from AAIndex database are considered as features for homology detection. The protein sequences are taken from protein families from UniProtKB database. A set of 185 representative features have been extracted from 531 features using PCA. In the second stage, NSGA II and NSGA III, two powerful optimization techniques are used to efficiently search the non-zero eigen space and retrieve distinguishable eigen vectors. This work is tested on widely used Uniprot and SCOP benchmark datasets. To check the efficiency of both the algorithms, the controlling parameters are kept same and numerical simulations were performed. NSGA-III outperformed NSGA-II in the results.},

But the simultaneous presence of electrical vehicles and distributed generation resources requires meticulous planning, because lack of access to an application can reduce the lifetime of these technologies, leading to multiple blackouts in the power grid. Therefore, this study proposes the dynamic distribution network reconfiguration in the presence of distributed generation units and electrical vehicles with various objective functions including energy loss, operational cost and energy not supplied. Moreover, the time of use mechanism as a demand response application is introduced to enhance the power usage of subscribers. In order to generalize the proposed approach, Time varying electricity prices and different load levels are considered to provide accurate production planning of distributed generation resources and electrical vehicles in the real space of the electricity network. The inherent complexity of the distribution feeder reconfiguration problem has made the presentation of solution techniques a topic of ongoing research. Therefore, a hybrid improved particle swarm optimization -artificial bee colony optimization algorithm has been presented to alleviate the complexities of the optimization problem. The resented method is tested on the 95-bus system and a comparison is drawn between its outcomes and that of other methods including particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony optimization and enhanced gravitational search. The review of the results manifests that the proposed method is superior to other evolutionary algorithms.},

At times, it offers superior performance compared to the most well-known optimization techniques. However, this algorithm faces several difficulties when it is utilized to enhance complex optimization problems. This work addressed the robustness of the method to solve real-world optimization issues, and its deficiency to improve complex optimization problems. This review paper shows a comprehensive investigation of the dragonfly algorithm in the engineering area. First, an overview of the algorithm is discussed. Besides, we also examined the modifications of the algorithm. The merged forms of this algorithm with different techniques and the modifications that have been done to make the algorithm perform better are addressed. Additionally, a survey on applications in the engineering area that used the dragonfly algorithm is offered. The utilized engineering applications are the applications in the field of mechanical engineering problems, electrical engineering problems, optimal parameters, economic load dispatch, and loss reduction. The algorithm is tested and evaluated against particle swarm optimization algorithm and firefly algorithm. To evaluate the ability of the dragonfly algorithm and other participated algorithms a set of traditional benchmarks (TF1-TF23) were utilized. Moreover, to examine the ability of the algorithm to optimize large-scale optimization problems CEC-C2019 benchmarks were utilized. A comparison is made between the algorithm and other metaheuristic techniques to show its ability to enhance various problems. The outcomes of the algorithm from the works that utilized the dragonfly algorithm previously and the outcomes of the benchmark test functions proved that in comparison with participated algorithms (GWO, PSO, and GA), the dragonfly algorithm owns an excellent performance, especially for small to intermediate applications. Moreover, the congestion facts of the technique and some future works are presented.
