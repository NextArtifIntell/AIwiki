  abstract     = {Cleaning concrete bridges and overpasses is essential before inspections, but traditional methods put workers and commuters at risk of bodily harm. UAS for bridge and overpass cleaning is attractive because it keeps humans out of harm’s way while reducing cost and time required for cleanings. The challenge for a hosing-UAS is that high pressure flow required for cleaning produces high reaction forces and torques that can easily destabilize small, low-thrust vehicles. Other state-of-the-art hosing-UAS approaches “over-engineer” their solutions with vehicles with huge masses and arrays of propellers. This work presents results from an iterative modeling and design process with the goal of engineering “mechanically intelligent” smaller, more agile UAS tailored for specific hosing task constraints. The UAS consists of a UAV, actuated spraygun payload, hose, gas-powered pump, and base-station PC. Results from bench, simulation, and field testing are presented with detailed exposition of the dynamic modeling and controls design.},

  abstract     = {Accurately detecting, localizing, and tracking an unknown and time-varying number of dynamic targets using a team of mobile robots is a challenging problem that requires robots to reason about the uncertainties in their collected measurements. The problem is made more challenging when robots are uncertain about their own states, as this makes it difficult to both collectively localize targets and avoid collisions with one another. In this paper, we introduce the convex uncertain Voronoi (CUV) diagram, a generalization of the standard Voronoi diagram that accounts for the uncertain pose of each individual robot. We then use the CUV diagram to develop distributed multi-target tracking and coverage control algorithms that enable teams of mobile robots to account for bounded uncertainty in the location of each robot. Our algorithms are capable of safely driving mobile robots towards areas of high information distribution while maintaining coverage of the whole area of interest. We demonstrate the efficacy of these algorithms via a series of simulated and hardware tests, and compare the results to our previous work which assumes perfect localization.},

To validate the capabilities of the framework, we propose English teaching games that integrate Virtual Reality (VR), game-based Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). These games aim to foster linguistic competence within dynamic and interactive virtual environments. The incorporation of large language models bolsters the robot’s capability to generate human-like responses, thus facilitating a more realistic conversational experience. Moreover, the simulation framework reduces real-world testing risks and offers a cost-effective, efficient, and scalable platform for developing new HRI applications.

Nevertheless, this approach faces robustness issues when GNSS signals become unavailable or sensors malfunction. Clearly, the robustness of the system increases considerably when multiple UAV agents are employed to perform collaborative positioning. In this work, an online distributed solution is proposed for relative localization, which incorporates multiple UAVs together with Signals of Opportunity (SOPs) as well as inertial, visual, and optical flow measurements. The proposed localization system includes relative self-localization of each UAV agent, as well as a reliable distributed relative positioning system (DRPS) for each UAV based on the relative positions from other UAV agents in its vicinity. The latter positioning strategy is required in case the relative self-localization fails, mainly due to such problems as inertial measurement unit (IMU) accumulated error drift, camera sensor errors, or SOP shortfalls due to multipath or antenna obstruction. Extensive field experiments validate the proposed technique and demonstrate increased localization accuracy and robustness when compared to the benchmark approach that does not include cooperation between UAVs.},

  abstract     = {Accounting for wind perturbations while controlling a formation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is of a particular interest for researchers: it helps confirm the operability of algorithms in realistic non-laboratory conditions and increases the efficiency of these algorithms. This approach, however, becomes a problem for a decentralized formation due to its interconnected structure. This research work focuses on the problem of accounting for wind perturbations for a fixed-wing UAV formation controlled using the vector field path following method in cooperative or collective circumnavigation. We only study the control based on the local data about nearby UAVs as we consider the consensus-based control. The suggested solution is an adaptive control algorithm studied with Lyapunov functions. At the same time, we conduct computer simulation using complete non-linear UAV models, as well as the comparison with an algorithm that does not account for wind perturbations. As a result, we theoretically demonstrate uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the trajectories of the system in question. Simulation shows that, although the algorithm that does not account for wind perturbations can control a formation with reduced accuracy, the suggested algorithm can improve its efficiency. Therefore, the solution considered in this article helps develop the applicability of consensus-based UAV formation control methods under more realistic conditions and wind impacts.},

  abstract     = {Rigid joint manipulators are limited in their movement and degrees of freedom (DOF), while continuum robots possess a continuous backbone that allows for free movement and multiple DOF. Continuum robots move by bending over a section, taking inspiration from biological manipulators such as tentacles and trunks. This paper presents an implementation of a forward kinematics and velocity kinematics model to describe the planar continuum robot, along with the application of reinforcement learning (RL) as a control algorithm. In this paper, we have adopted the planar constant curvature representation for the forward kinematic modeling. This choice was made due to its straightforward implementation and its potential to fill the literature gap in the field RL-based control for planar continuum robots. The intended control mechanism is achieved through the use of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), a RL algorithm that is suited for learning controls in continuous action spaces. After simulating the algorithm, it was observed that the planar continuum robot can autonomously move from any initial point to any desired goal point within the task space of the robot. By analyzing the results, we wanted to recommend a future direction for research in the field of continuum robot control, specifically in the application of RL algorithms. One potential area of focus could be the integration of sensory feedback, such as vision or force sensing, to improve the robot’s ability to navigate complex environments. Additionally, exploring the use of different RL algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), could lead to further advancements in the field. Overall, this paper demonstrates the potential for RL-based control of continuum robots and highlights the importance of continued research in this area.},

  abstract     = {Globalization impacts directly pollution, and one of the side effects is the increasing number of forest fires and their fast propagation. To reduce this phenomenon, several studies have tried to model fire propagation and find an adequate method to predict (or follow) this spread to stop it. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the developed works do not use an adaptive exploration strategy to follow the fire evolution. Instead, they are mainly focused on observing the evolution and trying to find an adequate spread model to predict fire behavior. Due to the lack of all the exact parameters to predict the fire spread, in this paper, we propose a new exploration strategy based on reinforcement learning using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The learned exploration strategy is able to predict and follow the fire propagation. To follow the generated waypoints by the exploration strategy, we develop a new robust controller, which can be embedded in a UAV. All these modules are encapsulated and interact with each other using a synchronized architecture. To prove the efficiency of our proposal, we present the obtained results on several simulated forest fire scenarios and compare them with other approaches. Then, We validate our entire architecture and show its efficiency using software in the loop environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS).},

  abstract     = {Path planning plays a major role in autonomous vehicle navigation. Among different kinds of intersections, roundabouts are far more difficult to plot a course than other intersections due to their special design. Different curve fitting methods such as circles, clothoid curves, Bezier curves are utilized for path planning inside a roundabout. Among those Bezier curves are widely used as they can generate a possible number of paths. However, the major drawback when adopting a Bezier curve is locating its control points. Control points need to be placed correctly for the path to generate. Roundabouts have varying shapes and sizes, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for locating the control points in a roundabout. Moreover, the circulating path of a roundabout is generally formed based on the radius of the circular path, but this method cannot be applied in all roundabouts since the roundabout can have variable shapes depending on the available space. Therefore, this paper introduces a new method called the triangular-based point selection approach for locating the control points for a Bezier curve traversing a path. The triangular-based point selection approach is used to find points on the road to calculate the control points of a Bezier curve passing through these points. The circular path is likewise created using Bezier curve allowing the path to follow the contour of the roundabout. The proposed method is demonstrated in an oval-shaped roundabout and tested using a vehicle model also the proposed path generation algorithm is compared with other path planning methods.},

In this study, we propose a novel approach that seamlessly integrates the advantages of KLT and descriptor-matching techniques through a tightly-coupled fusion for feature tracking. The proposed method effectively overcomes the limitations of both methods, resulting in longer tracking lengths and reducing accumulative errors. Consequently, the enhanced feature tracking module contributes to improving localization accuracy and stability in VIO. To validate the proposed approach, we incorporate it into the feature tracking module of mainstream VIO and evaluate its performance via open-source datasets.

The objective of this study is to investigate the applicability and targeted improvements of Deep Learning-based object detection in complex stacked environments. We analyzed the limitations in practical applications under such conditions, pinpointed the specific problems, and proposed corresponding improvement strategies. First, the study provided an overview of recent advancements in mainstream one-stage object detection algorithms, which included Anchor-based, Anchor-free, and Transformer-based architectures. The high real-time performance of these algorithms holds particular significance in practical engineering applications. It then looked at relevant technologies in three emerging research areas: Parts Recognition, Intelligent Driving, and Agricultural Picking. The study summarized existing limitations in real-time object detection within complex stacked environments and provided a comprehensive analysis of prevalent improvement strategies such as multi-level feature fusion, knowledge distillation, and hyperparameter optimization. Finally, after analyzing the performance of recent advanced one-stage algorithms on official datasets, this paper conducted empirical tests on a self-constructed industrial stacked dataset with algorithms of different structure and analyzed the experimental results in detail. A comprehensive analysis shows that Deep Learning-based object detection algorithms offer extensive applicability in complex stacked environments. In addressing diverse target sizes, overlapping occlusions, real-time constraints, and the need for lightweight solutions in complex stacked environments, each improvement strategy has its own advantages and limitations.

  abstract     = {There are many potential applications for an autonomous robotic agent capable of sensing gases in the environment, from locating leaks in pipes to monitoring air quality. However, the current state of the art in the field of robotic olfaction is not mature enough for most real-world applications. Due to the complexity of gas dispersion phenomena and the limitations of sensors, a great deal of research into the development of techniques and algorithms remains necessary. A very important part of this research is thorough experimentation, but carrying out robotic olfaction experiments is far from trivial. Real world experiments are usually limited to very simplified, wind-tunnel-like environments, as it is impossible to closely monitor or control the airflow in more complex scenarios. For this reason, simulation with CFD offers the most plausible alternative, allowing researchers to study the behavior of their algorithms in more challenging and complex situations. This work presents a CFD-based gas dispersion dataset composed of 120 cases generated under variable environmental conditions, taking place in 30 realistic and detailed models of real houses. All the data is made available in multiple formats, and is directly accessible through ROS, to permit easy integration with other robotic tools.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a human–robot collaborative symmetric lifting motion prediction using inverse dynamics optimization. The human and robot arm are modeled in Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) representation. A floating-base rigid body with 6 global degrees of freedom (DOFs) is similarly modeled as a three-dimensional (3D) table. A set of grasping forces characterizes the human-table and robot-table interactions. The joint torque squares of human arm and robot arm are minimized and subjected to physical and task related constraints. During lifting, the design variables include the cubic B-spline control points of joint angle profiles of the human arm, robot arm, and table. In addition, the discretized grasping forces are also treated as design variables. Both numeric and experimental human–robot lifting was performed with a 2 kg table. The simulation reports the human and robot arm’s joint angle profiles, joint torque profiles, and grasping force profiles. These profiles were validated with experimental data, which was collected using a motion capture system, force sensors, and the robot operating system (ROS). The human and robot arms’ joint angle and torque profiles demonstrate a similar trend in the experimental environment. The grasping force comparison implies that the human and robot share the load while lifting together.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes an extrinsic calibration approach designed for the alignment of a monocular camera with a prism-spinning solid-state LiDAR. Challenges arise due to the absence of adjacent laser rings, which are essential for the detection of line or plane features, in solid-state LiDAR systems. Additionally, the existence of a distinct type of outlier, designated as ‘vacant points’, complicates the task of feature extraction, particularly those reliant on depth variation. In contrast to existing methods that leverage reflectivity variation in depth-continuous measurements to circumvent this issue, we use depth discontinuous measurements to retain more valid features by efficient removal of the vacant points. The detected 3D corners thus contain more robust a priori information than usual which, together with the 2D corners detected by camera and constrained by our proposed rules, produce accurate extrinsic estimates. The efficacy of our algorithm is thoroughly evaluated through real-world field experiments, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative performance assessments. The results show its superiority over existing algorithms. Moreover, robustness tests demonstrate the algorithm’s resilience, particularly in feature-barren outdoor environments. The code is available on GitHub.},

Moreover, we prove that the optimal robust solution for a single agent suffices for the control of a homogeneous multi-agent scenario. Numerous simulations analyze the impact of different network conditions on the proposed architecture for a multi-agent scenario.

Unlike a conventional one- or two-layer NN, the three-layer NN allows the user to apriori determine the number of neurons in each layer. In this case, only the weight norms of the two consecutive outer layers are tunable, which alleviates computational complexity. The tuning law is derived using Lyapunov stability theory. The leader-following formation control problem with communication delays is addressed through a delayed integral of error variables, an NN-based control, and a robustifying term. The semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) solution of the closed-loop system is rigorously proven using a barrier Lyapunov function.

This paper proposes Changing-SLAM, a method for robust Visual SLAM in both dynamic and changing environments. This is achieved by using a Bayesian filter combined with a long-term data association algorithm. Also, it employs an efficient algorithm for dynamic keypoints filtering based on object detection that correctly identifies features inside the bounding box that are not dynamic, preventing a depletion of features that could cause lost tracks. Furthermore, a new dataset was developed with RGB-D data specially designed for the evaluation of changing environments on an object level, called PUC-USP dataset. Six sequences were created using a mobile robot, an RGB-D camera and a motion capture system. The sequences were designed to capture different scenarios that could lead to a tracking failure or map corruption. Changing-SLAM does not assume a given camera pose or a known map, being also able to operate in real time. The proposed method was evaluated using benchmark datasets and compared with other state-of-the-art methods, proving to be highly accurate.},

In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the robot’s pose in non-static environments containing movable objects. We understand as non-static environments, dynamic environments in which objects might be moved or changed their appearance. We propose a probabilistic localization approach that combines metric and semantic information and takes into account both, static and movable objects. We perform a pixel-wise association of depth and semantic data from an RGB-D sensor with a semantically-augmented truncated signed distance field (TSDF) in order to estimate the robot’s pose. The combination of metric and semantic information increases the robustness w.r.t. movable objects and object appearance changes. The experiments conducted in a real indoor environment and a publicly-available dataset suggest that our approach successfully estimates robot pose in non-static environments and they show an improvement compared to robot localization based only on metric or semantic information and compared to a feature-based method.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Autonomous Marine Vehicles, research on real-time health monitoring based on data from remote monitoring and shore-based control center has attracted more and more attention. However, the feature extraction capability of each local client model is limited by the size and quality of data collected by remote monitoring. For clients with zero-shot, it is necessary to design an efficient federated learning framework which allows shore-based federation center with few-shot help to strengthen the feature extraction capability of clients. In this paper, a semi-supervised federated learning strategy based on adaptive learning mechanism of prototype points is proposed to solve the problem that clients with zero-shot have difficulty in establishing reliable fault diagnosis models when the quality of client data is inhomogeneous. By designing an adaptive prototypical network learning mechanism driven by sample quality and a dynamic in-and-out mechanism for local pseudo-labeled dataset, the few-shot learning capability of federation center as well as the reliability of local client’s prototype points are enhanced to alleviate the impact of unreliable pseudo-label on semi-supervised learning. The experiment validation on the rolling bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University can come to an accuracy increasement of 13.12%, which indicates that the proposed Adpro-SSFL outperforms existed semi-supervised federated learning method when data suffered by high missing rate due to the interference of external factors on the signal acquisition sensor.},

This will be critical if a vision-based solution will eventually feed into the control loop for the uncrewed system. This research used a fleet representative refueling drogue and probe. A computer vision system installed at the base of the refueling probe was used to feed imagery to a deep neural network trained to identify the refueling drogue and determine the drogue’s position relative to the probe tip. Ground truth experiments validated via a motion capture system demonstrated that the error in relative position measurements was within tolerances to allow the deep neural network to be used in feedback control for a notional uncrewed system. Finally, the laboratory-trained deep neural network demonstrated its ability to identify the drogue outside of the laboratory with mission-representative backgrounds.},

In the manufacturing industry, a wide range of insertion tasks can be found, from peg-in-hole insertion to electronic parts assembly. Robotic stations designed for this problem often use conventional hybrid force-position control to perform preprogrammed trajectories, such as e.g. a spiral path. However, electronic parts require more sophisticated techniques due to their complex geometry and susceptibility to damage. Production line assembly tasks require high robustness to initial position and rotation variations due to component grip imperfections. Robustness to partially obscured camera view is also mandatory due to multi stage assembly process. We propose a stereo-view method based on reinforcement learning (RL) for the robust assembly of electronic parts. Applicability of our method to real-world production lines is verified through test scenarios. Our approach is the most robust to applied perturbations of all tested methods and can potentially be transferred to environments unseen during learning.},

  abstract     = {By utilizing only depth information, the paper introduces a novel two-stage planning approach that enhances computational efficiency and planning performances for memoryless local planners. First, a depth-based sampling technique is proposed to identify and eliminate a specific type of in-collision trajectories among sampled candidates. Specifically, all trajectories that have obscured endpoints are found through querying the depth values and will then be excluded from the sampled set, which can significantly reduce the computational workload required in collision checking. Subsequently, we apply a tailored local planning algorithm that employs a direction cost function and a depth-based steering mechanism to prevent the robot from being trapped in local minima. Our planning algorithm is theoretically proven to be complete in convex obstacle scenarios. To validate the effectiveness of our DEpth-based both Sampling and Steering (DESS) approaches, we conducted experiments in simulated environments where a quadrotor flew through cluttered regions with multiple various-sized obstacles. The experimental results show that DESS significantly reduces computation time in local planning compared to the uniform sampling method, resulting in the planned trajectory with a lower minimized cost. More importantly, our success rates for navigation to different destinations in testing scenarios are improved considerably compared to the fixed-yawing approach.},

  abstract     = {Easy-to-use collaborative robotic solutions, where humans and robots share their skills, are becoming more and more popular in industrial applications. To improve human-robot collaboration, it is fundamental that the operator is aware of the robot status. Haptic feedback represents a promising way to convey robot intent, since the haptic perceptive channel is usually less overwhelmed than visive and auditive channel. Hence, it can be used to convey information on a background robot status in an unintrusive manner, especially when user’s attention is divided. In this paper, we propose to provide haptic feedback as vibration exerted to user’s wrist by a wearable device. To this end, we use a smartwatch, which is easy to program and not cumbersome to wear. We propose a haptic icon set consisting of different vibration patterns, each associated to different robot behaviors. Three experimental studies are set up to explore human ability to recognize such vibration patterns and assess their use in collaborative robotics, also in comparison with light notification. Results indicate that subjects perceive the proposed patterns as different: out of more than 1000 trials, vibration patterns are correctly identified by test participants in $$87.4\%$$ trials. Moreover, haptic feedback results advantageous in cooperative assembly, since it allows a reduction of $$30\%$$ of the total assembly time. Comparison with light feedback in a simulated industrial use case shows that vibration is more effective and appreciated by test participants, given its locatedness with the subject. However, test results also show that, when possible, vibration should be reinforced with visual feedback in order to further improve robot to human communication.},

  abstract     = {Several works have been carried out in the realm of RGB-D SLAM development, yet they have neither been thoroughly assessed nor adapted for outdoor vehicular contexts. This paper proposes an extension of HOOFR SLAM to an enhanced IR-D modality applied to an autonomous vehicle in an outdoor environment. We address the most prevalent camera issues in outdoor contexts: environments with an image-dominant overcast sky and the presence of dynamic objects. We used a depth-based filtering method to identify outlier points based on their depth value. The method is robust against outliers and also computationally inexpensive. For faster processing, we suggest optimization of the pose estimation block by replacing the RANSAC method used for essential matrix estimation with PROSAC. We assessed the algorithm using a self-collected IR-D dataset gathered by the SATIE laboratory instrumented vehicle using a PC and an embedded architecture. We compared the measurement results to those of the most advanced algorithms by assessing translational error and average processing time. The results revealed a significant reduction in localization errors and a significant gain in processing speed compared to the state-of-the-art stereo (HOOFR SLAM) and RGB-D algorithms (Orb-slam2, Rtab-map).},

  abstract     = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has been the primary positioning solution for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) due to their worldwide coverage, high precision and lightweight receivers. However, GNSS is prone to electromagnetic interference and malicious assaults, including jamming or spoofing because of its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To ensure the continuity and protection of UAV operations, using redundant navigation systems is essential. In recent years, the phased array radio system (PARS) has established itself as a local navigation solution. PARS is robust towards malicious assaults because of an much higher SNR than GNSS regarding directed and encrypted transmission. An essential factor of PARS is that the orientation of the radio antenna at a ground station needs to be precisely determined to obtain the correct positioning of UAVs. This paper presents a method for extending a previously proposed calibration algorithm to estimate the ground antenna orientation with an inertial navigation system (INS) aided by redundant positioning sensors (GNSS, PARS or barometer) using a multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) so that the calibration can be activated during flights whenever GNSS is available. In other words, the proposed navigation system is essentially an aided-INS which switches between two modes depending on the availability of GNSS: calibration and GNSS aiding mode when GNSS is available (Mode 1) and PARS and barometer aiding mode when GNSS is unavailable (Mode 2). Considering that the navigation system needs to include the effect of Earth’s curvature for a long-distance flight, PARS horizontal measurement and the barometer measurement were treated independently, and the navigation equations were propagated in Earth Centred Earth Fixed (ECEF) frame. The independent treatment of barometer measurement, and the propagation in ECEF frame were also beneficial when using multiple ground antennas to have a common reference point and reference frame. The proposed method was validated using data (Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), GNSS, PARS, Pixhawk autopilot (including barometer) measurements) collected during a field test. In the validation, GNSS was made available at the middle of the flight and the calibration mode was activated for 200s. The proposed navigation system successfully estimated the precise orientation of multiple ground antennas and the navigation solutions were verified using GNSS and Pixhawk autopilot solutions as ground truth.},

  abstract     = {Nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been attracting growing attention from both academia and industry with their compact and versatile nature. With the size of merely several centimeters, they are particularly well-suited for executing targeted missions in confined spaces, such as tracking a single pedestrian indoors. However, due to strict constraints on payload and power consumption, the onboard computing unit of nano-UAV is limited to the microcontroller Unit (MCU), which makes the novel single object tracking algorithms not applicable on nano-UAV platform. In this paper, we present a lightweight single pedestrian tracking algorithm to meet the strict resource constraints of nano-UAV system. The algorithm consists of an object detection frontend and a motion-based tracking backend. Based on our deployment methodology, covering from dataset production, model training to layer fusion and deployment, the proposed algorithm achieves extreme complexity reduction (13 $$\times $$ fewer operations and 106 $$\times $$ less memory), and keeps good tracking performance compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) research work. The full range of onboard experiments illustrate the efficiency our algorithm for real-time tracking (up to 43 fps). Meanwhile, both high computing efficiency (5.2 MACs/cycle) and energy efficiency (5.3 mJ/frame) are achieved and exceed similar works on nano-UAV.},

  abstract     = {Absolute accuracy of industrial robot is required for most of industrial applications. However, positioning errors of several millimeters are induced by many factors. Hybrid calibration, combining analytical model and learning-based regression, can compensate for most of the positioning error, including payload effects. However, when the payload changes, hybrid calibration has to be performed again. In this paper, hybrid calibration is applied on an industrial robot in two different sub-workspaces, with two different payloads. The results of this method have been compared to other calibration approaches, and highlight that hybrid calibration provides a higher final accuracy. Moreover, two data-efficient and pragmatic approaches are proposed, to address the issue of changing payload. Both methods are based on hybrid calibration. The first one uses previously-acquired knowledge to drastically reduce the number of measurements necessary to update a trained learning model with another payload. The second one uses a model trained separately for two different payloads and interpolates the outputs to compensate for new payloads without any additional measurement. The datasets used are available at: https://doi.org/10.57745/DWUC0H . The methods have been experimentally validated using a compensation algorithm and compared to other approaches, and show that the positioning error can be reduced by 95%.},

This work aims to contribute to the above objective by presenting a novel hybrid architecture for implementing monocular-based SLAM systems for mobile robots. The key idea is to take advantage in a complementary manner of the inherent properties of the two main methodologies available today for implementing visual-based SLAM systems: the filter-based methods, and the optimization-based methods. The proposed method differs from previous approaches among other aspects because filter-based and optimization-based functionalities run concurrently in separate processes, improving the modularity and robustness of the system due to a degree of redundancy. Also, due to its modularity, the proposed approach can be easily applied to different mobile robot platforms using a monocular camera as its main sensor and different setups of additional sensors. In this sense, experiments with real data obtained from a differential robot and a quadrotor are presented to show that the proposed SLAM system can perform well in out-of-the-lab environments by using low-cost sensors. The experiments also show that the SLAM system exhibits real-time and stable computational performance. Moreover, a ROS-2 C++ open-source implementation of the proposed system is provided.},

A distributed output-feedback event-triggered controller is proposed based on a dynamic gain compensator for each follower agent, such that consensus tracking can be achieved. To deal with the input saturation, the unknown lower bound of the saturation degree is estimated adaptively. To eliminate the effects of time delays, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is applied. By Lyapunov stability analysis, it is ensured that the consensus tracking error converges to a bounded neighborhood of the origin.

  abstract     = {Hand-eye calibration is one of the important problems in the field of robot vision and control, aiming to determine the pose transformation between the robot end-effector and the visual system. The analytical solution of this problem has a more explicit numerical computation process and a more stable solution time compared with iterative or deep learning methods, and theoretically provides more accurate results. When using quaternion parameterization for rigid body motion rotation, the hand-eye calibration problem can be transformed into solving the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix. This paper proposes an analytical solution for hand-eye calibration based on quaternion parameterization. Compared with previous methods, the advantage of this method is that the solution for the required eigenvector is transformed into solving cubic equations through the eigenvector-eigenvalue identity, without SVD or Eigendecomposition, thus making the proposed method a complete analytical solution, and avoids solving irrelevant information. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through multiple experiments conducted on a synthetic dataset as well as two real-world datasets, and compared to representative analytical methods. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable accuracy with significantly shorter solution times. Therefore, our complete analytical solution offers an efficient and accurate alternative for addressing the hand-eye calibration problem without SVD or Eigendecomposition.},

We discuss the structure of the NIR systems in a modern factory, considering physical dynamics, control systems, and manufacturing networks, and then explore the vulnerabilities and the attack surface of this paradigm. Moreover, a new effort is that typical data integrity (DI) attacks that may cause serious robot equipment failures are elaborated in detail, which mainly achieves intrusion by tampering with the data of sensors or controllers through known or potential attack paths. In particular, the covert nature of several DI attacks is revealed. We analyze the existing anomaly detection strategies of the robot system and present numerical examples using dynamics-based control law to illustrate how adversaries achieve stealth to traditional detectors and the impact of the undermined robot system. Conclusively, a security framework integrating protective, detective, and responsive actions is proposed as a compensatory countermeasure for traditional methods against DI attacks. We believe that understanding these attacks and associated defense mechanisms will help accelerate the implementation of robot-based smart manufacturing technology.},

The hybrid algorithm (A*-DWA-B) combines the advantages of A* algorithm and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA). Firstly, methods of environmental modeling and collision detection are set. The improvement of A* algorithm lies in the establishment of a new calculation method for the evaluation function. After adding the risky cost, the parent node information is introduced into the calculation of the estimated cost, and the influence of the robot starting and braking modes is added to the calculation of the actual cost. Secondly, after removing superfluous nodes, the path obtained by the improved A* algorithm is divided into several linear segment paths. Then the endpoints of each line segment path are taken as the start node and target node of DWA for path planning. Adaptive initial attitude is set and two dynamic obstacle avoidance strategies are added for DWA. After integrating the paths planned by DWA, the B-spline smoothing method is used to optimize the integrated path, and finally obtained a smooth path. Compared with other similar algorithms, the proposed algorithm has advantages in path cost and turning angle. Experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm not only has strong ability of safe and smooth path planning, but also can avoid dynamic obstacles in time and effectively.},

By Lyapunov theory, the sufficient conditions for the strategy to achieve global exponential consensus are obtained, which implies that the formation of the system can be completed successfully. This research proposes a novel event-triggered condition which reduces the system’s energy loss when performing formation tasks. The proposed scheme not only realizes the system formation but also avoids the occurrence of Zeno behavior. Furthermore, the influence of the external environment with obstacles to consensus formation is considered.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the demand for robots is not only limited to sophisticated industrial setups, there exists an unprecedented demand for low-cost robots in living places with the capabilities of performing human-centric operations. For the semantic-rich mapping of random environments, current state-of-the-art techniques include sophisticated hardware like Kinect sensor, Lidar, deep learning (DL)-based vision, and stereo vision-based systems. Inevitably, these systems increase the cost of the product which requires expensive hardware for processing the information. It, therefore, creates a hurdle to implementing them on low-cost service robots where interaction matters more than precision. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose two novel techniques: 1) a light, yet efficient, semantic mapping technique for scene-wise localization of objects by combining object detection and camera geometry; 2) an accurate and robust novel integration technique for coalition of scene-wise information for large-scale maps. The main goal of this framework is to host a semantic mapping process on a limited processing device like Raspberry Pi. The semantic information can be further integrated into any Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) system. A tensorflow-lite version of Single Shot Detection (SSD) for object detection, a wheel odometer for odometry tracking, and pinhole camera geometry are used for the whole mapping process. The proposed model has demonstrated promising results by accurately mapping the environment with semantic-rich features. Current work is time efficient and suitable for object-orientated task execution of low-cost robots, such as smart toys and other smart home gadgets.},

  abstract     = {The pillow spring grabbing robot is the core module of the intelligent assembly of railway wagon pillow springs in the overhauling workshop. The pillow spring end face and the center of the outer spring notch need to be quickly detected and accurately positioned. To address the shortage of hardware computing power in pillow spring assembly systems, a lightweight object detection YOLO model based on MobileNetv3 and GhostNet network architecture is proposed in this paper: M-G-YOLOv5s. The COCO2017 dataset and custom dataset are employed for model training and validation. The results indicate that compared to the YOLOv5s model, the M-G-YOLOv5s model reduces the model size by 81%, decreases the model parameter count by 83%, and improves the detection speed by 1.7 times. Based on the M-G-YOLOv5s algorithm, a novel image visual serving control method is proposed to address the automatic positioning problem of pillow springs and improve the efficiency of grabbing operations. This method is based on the mixed corner point features composed of the corner points of the pillow end object detection box and the pillow spring gap center. The visual servo positioning and grasping comparison experiments are carried out on the pillow spring grasping robot platform. The results show that the proposed M-G-YOLOv5s detection model can meet the grasping requirements of the pillow spring assembly system based on IBVS. The research findings have been successfully applied to the development of the pillow spring assembly manipulator for railway wagon bogie.},

  abstract     = {Performance assessment is crucial for managing the health of complex systems, including single-agent and multi-agent systems. However, research on the latter has been relatively sparse. Approaches to assessing system performance must consider both assessment result accuracy and process explainability, especially in cases with small or unbalanced samples, which limits the application of data-driven approaches. In this paper, the Belief Rule Base (BRB) grey-box expert system is adopted to assess the performance of leader-following multi-agent systems subject to switching topologies and unpredictable disturbances. By fusing historical data and expert knowledge, the precision of assessment results and the traceability of the assessment process are balanced. Two time-varying features based on the states and distributed communication characteristics of the leader-following MASs are designed as model input. The robustness of the feature matching degree is quantitatively analysed, and the obtained robustness factors can reflect their effectiveness on the final performance utility produced by the BRB model. This approach helps raise the cognitive ability of specialists and devise more rational model structures and initial parameters. In comparative studies, better prediction accuracy of the proposed BRB performance assessment model is demonstrated compared to other classical models based on small training samples, while avoiding an opaque inference process.},

  abstract     = {A Reconfigurable Modular Robotic System (RMRS) consists of multiple interconnected robots and can achieve various functionalities by rearranging its modular robots, such as transporting loads of various shapes. The path planning for an RMRS involves the system motion and also its formation arrangements. Sampling-based path planning for the RMRS might be inefficient due to the formation variety. Recently, convex subsets of the obstacle-free workspace, referred to as polygon nodes, are instead sampled to formulate constrained optimization problems. The success rate of sampling is however unsatisfactory due to connectivity requirements. This paper proposes an obstacle-aware mixture density network to guide the generation of polygon nodes, where the connectivity of polygon nodes is guaranteed by non-zero Minkowski differences between the formation geometry and the intersection of nodes. Subsequently, Convex-Polygon Trees* (CPTs*) are proposed to connect these polygon nodes in an RRT* manner, outputting candidates of convex optimization problems. The optimality degeneration due to distance approximation is proven bounded and the computational complexity is shown linear to the Lebesgue measure of the entire workspace space. Numerical simulations have shown that in most tested large and cluttered environments the CPT* is more than 8 times faster than an existing constrained optimization method. The results have also shown CPT*’ improved scalability to large environments and enhanced efficiency in dealing with narrow passages.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem for a moving agent using Visual Odometry (VO) while measuring the range from a set of Ultra Wide Band (UWB) antennas, deployed in unknown position in the environment. The solution approach is based on a switching observer which, under standard working conditions, for each observed UWB, uses a two dimensional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) providing an estimate of the range and bearing of the observed UWB with respect to the agent. This information is then used in a Robust EKF algorithm which solves the SLAM problem with performances that, even before closing the loop, are comparable to the ones that a VO algorithm (namely ORB-SLAM2) would obtain only after closing the loop. Moreover, a resilient module is added to the algorithm to evaluate the reliability of the position estimate of each observed UWB. When the Visual Odometry is not available, the switching observer uses an auxiliary EKF to provide an estimate of the agent position. This makes the proposed approach robust with respect to several kinds of unmodeled disturbances, like multipath effects, and automatically adapts to sensor failures with resilience (e.g. when Visual Odometry or UWB measurements are not available).},

  abstract     = {The paper focuses on safety and simplicity of unmanned aircraft longitudinal control and proposes a new combination of total energy control (TECS) and conventional control. The introduced new modified total energy control (TECSMOD) method applies IAS priority all the time. IAS is controlled through the elevator while the total energy of the system and so the altitude is maintained with throttle. Neither engine fault or stall detection nor switching logic is required while stall is prevented keeping the solution simple and safe. To prove the viability of the new concept it is compared to a conventional multiple zone PI controller and the TECS solution in simulation and real flight tests. First, the six degrees of freedom simulation model of the Sindy test UAV (developed and built in Institute for Computer Science and Control, HUN-REN, Hungary) is verified comparing its inputs and outputs to flight results. Then a simulation campaign is done for all three controllers with special test cases which can be critical according to the literature. Finally, real flight test comparison is done considering IAS and altitude tracking and engine fault handling. The new method was the best in IAS tracking with acceptable results in altitude tracking and successful stall prevention upon engine fault (without any fault detection or switching). Future improvements can be fine tuning for improved altitude tracking with the price of decreased IAS tracking performance and the introduction of a glideslope tracking mode for landing scenarios.},

The observer performs the Fast Fourier Transform on the interaction force signal within a sliding window and quickly detects system oscillation through a simple mathematical transformation. Compared with the existing methods, it can calculate a normalized system stability index more accurately and faster. This quantified index is employed in a linearized adaptive law to tune the parameters of the admittance controller. Experimental validation of the proposed strategy is performed and compared with state-of-the-art work in a task of human-guided drawing.

  abstract     = {Grasp generation is a crucial task in robotics, especially in unstructured environments, where robots must identify suitable grasp locations on objects and determine the grasp configuration. Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of end-to-end models for 6-DOF grasp generation that can learn to directly map from input point clouds to grasp configurations without intermediate processing steps. However, these models often treat all points in a scene equally, leading to suboptimal results in cluttered contexts where meaningfulness distributions are disparate due to occlusion. While attention mechanisms have shown promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of various tasks in occluded scenes, their effectiveness in improving grasp generation performance is still an active area of research. Inspired by this potential, we explore the power of attention mechanisms in improving grasp generation from 3D point clouds. Building upon the previous work with VoteGrasp 2022, we integrate a wide range of attention modules and compare their effects and characteristics to identify the most successful combination for enhancing grasp generation performance. We also extend VoteGrasp by adding a semantic object classification loss to the loss function, making our method more flexible than existing approaches.

  abstract     = {Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) may affect the quality of the patient’s life if it is left untreated. Bracing is prescribed to halt or reduce the curvature progression and avoid surgery. However, the in-brace correction pressure remains unclear, and it is controlled passively by tightening/losing the brace’s strap. Computational modeling has recently attracted researchers’ attention to predict and optimize the AIS bracing treatment. In this paper, a Multi Body-Finite Element (MB-FE) Simscape model and an analytical model of the AIS bracing treatment are created. The MB-FE Simscape model is used to predict the in-brace correction pressure. Furthermore, a Novel Position-based Impedance Control (NPIC) is proposed to control the dynamic interaction between the robotic brace and torso. In this method, the error between the desired and estimated impedance parameters is involved in the controller design to improve the performance of the typical PIC in terms of pose tracking and impedance model tracking. In-vivo data from the literature and numerical simulations are used to validate the MB-FE Simscape model and analytical model. The performance of the proposed controller is verified using numerical simulations in terms of pose tracking and impedance model tracking.},

  abstract     = {Semi-autonomous telerobotic systems allow both humans and robots to exploit their strengths while enabling personalized execution of a remote task. For soft robots with kinematic structures dissimilar to those of human operators, it is unknown how the allocation of control between the human and the robot changes the performance. This work presents a set of interaction paradigms between a human and a remote soft-growing robot manipulator, with demonstrations in both real and simulated scenarios. The soft robot can grow and retract by eversion and inversion of its tubular body, a property we exploit in the interaction paradigms. We implemented and tested six different human-robot interaction paradigms, with full teleoperation at one extreme and gradually adding autonomy to various aspects of the task execution. All paradigms are demonstrated by two experts and two naive operators. Results show that humans and the soft robot manipulator can effectively split their control along different degrees of freedom while acting simultaneously to accomplish a task. In the simple pick-and-place task studied in this work, performance improves as the control is gradually given to the robot’s autonomy, especially when the robot can correct certain human errors. However, human engagement is maximized when the control over a task is at least partially shared. Finally, when the human operator is assisted by haptic guidance, which is computed based on soft robot tip position errors, we observed that the improvement in performance is dependent on the expertise of the human operator.},

  abstract     = {The accumulation of litter is increasing in many places and is consequently becoming a problem that must be dealt with. In this paper, we present a manipulator robotic system to collect litter in outdoor environments. This system has three functionalities. Firstly, it uses colour images to detect and recognise litter comprising different materials. Secondly, depth data are combined with pixels of waste objects to compute a 3D location and segment three-dimensional point clouds of the litter items in the scene. The grasp in 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) is then estimated for a robot arm with a gripper for the segmented cloud of each instance of waste. Finally, two tactile-based algorithms are implemented and then employed in order to provide the gripper with a sense of touch. This work uses two low-cost visual-based tactile sensors at the fingertips. One of them addresses the detection of contact (which is obtained from tactile images) between the gripper and solid waste, while another has been designed to detect slippage in order to prevent the objects grasped from falling. Our proposal was successfully tested by carrying out extensive experimentation with different objects varying in size, texture, geometry and materials in different outdoor environments (a tiled pavement, a surface of stone/soil, and grass). Our system achieved an average score of 94% for the detection and Collection Success Rate (CSR) as regards its overall performance, and of 80% for the collection of items of litter at the first attempt.},

This information is used to make risk-informed decisions enabling the system to proactively avoid failure and to minimize the consequence of faults.

The multi-robot system consists of a team of heterogeneous robots with different capabilities that operate in a dynamic scenario that can change in the robots’ capabilities or in the operational requirements. The human supervisor can intervene in the operation scenario by approving the final plan before its execution or forcing a robot to execute a specific task. The proposed task allocation strategy leverages an auction-based method in combination with a sampling-based multi-goal motion planning. The latter is used to evaluate the costs of execution of tasks based on realistic features of paths. The proposed architecture enables the allocation of tasks accounting for priorities and precedence constraints, as well as the quick re-allocation of tasks after a dynamic perturbation occurs –a crucial feature when the human supervisor preempts the outcome of the algorithm and makes manual adjustments. An extensive simulation campaign in a rescue scenario validates our approach in dynamic scenarios comprising a sensor failure of a robot, a total failure of a robot, and a human-driven re-allocation. We highlight the benefits of the proposed multi-goal strategy by comparing it with single-goal motion planning strategies at the state of the art. Finally, we provide evidence for the system efficiency by demonstrating the powerful synergistic combination of the auction-based allocation and the multi-goal motion planning approach.},

QSF achieves linear time-invariant (LTI) exponentially stable error dynamics which simplifies controller tuning. The linearizing feedback has an important static dependence on state, i.e., the controller is not dynamic even though traditional static state feedback linearization is not possible. We apply the algorithm to a Slung Load System (SLS), which is a flat system consisting of a multirotor drone and suspended payload. After linearization using the QSF, a straightforward output tracking control yields LTI exponentially stable error dynamics in the design coordinates. The QSF is designed to compensate for rotor drag and blade flapping. Integral action compensates for constant force and torque disturbance. The control design is tested in an open-source PX4 Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulation. An automatic software pipeline is presented for transforming the symbolic controller expression into a C++ executable which can run on a real-world autopilot.},

Hence, endowing fixed-wing UAVs with the ability to autonomously generate evasive maneuver is the primary problem that should be solved. With considering the threat of air-to-air missile attacks, this paper designs a novel hierarchical goal-guided learning (HGGL) method, which combines with traditional off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and endows the agent with the ability to evade a series of air-to-air missiles. The pivotal idea of the proposed algorithm is to use the hierarchical features of the goal, it improves the availability of training data to eliminate the limitation of the convergence rate of traditional DRL algorithms owing to sparse rewards. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in several simulation experiments. All experiments are applied on the XSimStudio platform.

Among the methods used for robot pose estimation from a single image, the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) based approach is widely used due to its popularity and efficiency. An important part of this framework is keypoint detection. However, the current keypoint detection module used for PnP has two problems: Small number of input keypoints and Large error of input keypoints. This paper proposes a Grouping and Soft-ArgMax (G-SAM) framework to address these two problems: First, a simple and powerful Soft-ArgMax module followed by point subset selection is designed to address the problem of small number of input keypoints; Second, a grouping module is introduced, taking into account the texture and spatial structure information of the robot, to solve the problem of large error of input keypoints.

Closed-loop stability is analyzed in the Lyapunov sense. Extensive numerical simulations and real-time experiments validate the proposal.

Besides, the learning policy conservatively deals with many high-frequency scenarios. However, in some infrequent scenes, such as dead corners, it can’t perform well. In this paper, we propose a collision avoidance policy trained with deep reinforcement learning, which captures the relationship between robots using Graph Attention Network (GAT). The attention mechanism can indicate the importance of interaction between robots. We present a hierarchical structure to improve the navigation efficiency, which uses motion selector as high-level action and uses collision avoidance policy and target-driven policy as low-level actions.

  abstract     = {Object SLAM uses additional semantic information to detect and map objects in the scene, in order to improve the system’s perception and map representation capabilities. Previous methods often use quadrics and cuboids to represent objects, especially in monocular systems. However, their simplistic shapes are insufficient for effectively representing various types of objects, leading to a limitation in the accuracy of object maps and consequently impacting downstream task performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for representing objects in monocular SLAM using superquadrics (SQ) with shape parameters. Our method utilizes object appearance and geometry information comprehensively, enabling accurate estimation of object poses and adaptation to various object shapes. Additionally, we propose a lightweight data association strategy to accurately associate semantic observations across multiple views with object landmarks. We implement a monocular semantic SLAM system with real-time performance and conduct comprehensive experiments on public datasets. The results show that our method is able to build accurate object maps and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on object representation.},

It focuses specifically on investigating the capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) equipped with limited sensing capabilities and onboard computational resources to perform visual inspections of apriori unknown fractured and collapsed structures in unfamiliar environments. The proposed approach, referred to as First Look Inspect-Explore (FLIE), employs a flexible bifurcated behavior tree that leverages real-time RGB image and depth cloud data. By employing a recursive and reactive synthesis of safe view pose within the inspection module, FLIE incorporates a novel active visual guidance scheme for identifying previously inspected surfaces. Furthermore, the integration of a tiered hierarchical exploration module with the visual guidance system enables the UAV to navigate towards new and unexplored structures without relying on a map. This decoupling reduces memory overhead and computational effort by eliminating the need to plan based on an incrementally built, error-prone global map. The proposed autonomy is extensively evaluated through simulation and experimental verification under various scenarios and compared against state-of-art approaches, demonstrating its performance and effectiveness.},

This paper utilizes instantaneous local sensory data to stimulate the safe feedback motion planning (SFMP) strategy with adaptability to diverse prior-unknown environments without building a global map. This is achieved by the numerical optimization with the constraints, referred to as instantaneous local control barrier functions (IL-CBFs) and goal-driven control Lyapunov functions (GD-CLFs), learned from perceptional signals. In particular, the IL-CBFs reflecting potential collisions and GD-CLFs encoding incrementally discovered subgoals are first online learned from local perceptual data. Then, the learned IL-CBFs are united with GD-CLFs in the context of quadratic programming (QP) to generate the safe feedback motion planning strategy. Rather importantly, an optimization over the admissible control space of IL-CBFs is conducted to enhance the solution feasibility of QP. The SFMP strategy is developed with theoretically guaranteed collision avoidance and convergence to destinations. Numerical simulations are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of the proposed SFMP strategy that drives mobile robots to safely reach the destination incrementally in diverse prior-unknown environments.},

  abstract     = {The recent development of lower limb exoskeletons has focus on assisting walking on a variety of terrains, such as level ground, stairs, and ramps. However, smooth transitions between different locomotion modes are challenging due to unknown future information. In this paper, we propose a method that adaptively generates a complete gait cycle of trajectory and event prediction for lower limb exoskeletons during the transition stage. First, we design a generative model with the variational autoencoder (VAE) structure to parameterize the gait cycles of trajectory and events into low-dimensional latent representations. Then, the gait trajectory and event prediction are generated by VAE reconstruction, stride time and gait phase alignment. Lastly, reinforcement learning (RL) is adopted to minimize the process error of continuous gait trajectory and event prediction by finding the optimal latent representations of a generative model. The experiments collected gait data from passive and active exoskeletons. The results show that our method significantly outperforms the extend Kalman filter (EKF)-based method and moving horizon estimation (MHE)-based method for both gait trajectory and event prediction tasks during transitions between and within locomotion modes. The capability of our method gives the opportunity to enrich the control mode by providing future information and contributes a valuable tool for natural and smooth transitions among different terrains for the lower limb exoskeleton.},

  abstract     = {Flexible, continuum-type robots can access narrow spaces in debris areas during search-and-rescue missions. However, their current problem is the lifting capability of the head, which is necessary to surmount the rubble. This study proposes a passive-thrust vectoring method to stabilize head levitation for air-jet-actuated, long, continuum robots, and thus enhance their step-climbing abilities. An air jet can generate a thrust force that is sufficient for head levitation. A critical issue in levitation involves the backward bending of the head without using any air-jet control; however, thrust control is inappropriate because of the delay caused by the long channel. Therefore, the proposed method maintains the thrust direction constant. Sufficient conditions for global stability are derived and confirmed via dynamic simulations. The proposed method is simple and can be mechanically realized with a passive head-bending mechanism, thus contributing to a lightweight design. Experiments demonstrated that the developed air-floating-type, 7-m long robot, can achieve stabilized head levitation, and that the robot can climb a step with a height of 250 mm. Robot demonstrations in rubble justify the robot’s capacity to surmount the rubble. This passive-thrust vectoring method is expected to contribute to the future enhancement of the mobility of continuum robots owing to its simplicity and practicality.},

This parameter essentially triggers a Hopf bifurcation in an underlying time-varying dynamical system that steers a robotic swarm. This way, the swarm can exhibit a variety of behaviors that arise from the same set of continuous differential equations. Other approaches to bifurcation-based swarm coordination rely on agent interaction which cannot be realized if the swarm members cannot sense or communicate with one another. The contribution of this paper is to offer an alternative method for steering minimally instrumented multi-robot collectives with a control strategy that can realize a multitude of dynamical behaviors without switching their constituent equations. Through this approach, analytical solutions for the bifurcation parameter are provided, even for more complex cases that are described in the literature, along with the process to apply this theory in a multi-agent setup. The theoretical predictions are confirmed via simulation and experimental results with the latter also demonstrating real-world applicability.},

  abstract     = {Wheeled field robots have promising widespread civil and military applications in off-road conditions. The complex off-road working conditions pose substantial challenges in applying field robots, especially the newly emerged fully autonomous “smart” mobile ground robots without human intervention. Two key issues arise for a successful navigation, namely geometrical and non-geometrical obstacles. So far, most of the research on off-road mobile robots has focused on approaches to avoid geometrical obstacles by ignoring the influence of wheel slippage on the robot mobility. On the other hand, wheel slippage plays a key role in the performance of off-road mobile robots and must be addressed. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the methods in the study on the wheel slippage estimation and modeling of off-road mobile robots, along with the control and sensing technology, and report the state-of-the-art in this research field. Multiple approaches: proprioceptive-sensor-based, exteroceptive-sensor-based, model-based slippage estimation and compensation methods will be discussed. In addition, this paper also investigates the new research trend of developing machine learning methods to predict and compensate for the wheel slippage under complex working conditions. Current technical challenges and room for further research improvement are also generalized. This paper will help researchers new in this field to be familiar with the wheel slippage modeling, control and sensing technology, and inspire for the next-generation robot design that can help address the wheel slippage issues.},

To maintain the balance of the impacted robot, three strategies are proposed inspired by the human response to external disturbance, including supporting leg adjustment strategy, one-step motion of swinging legs strategy, and N-step motion of swinging legs strategy. Quadruped robots can be considered as humanoids owing to the nature of their trotting gait. Thus, the contributions of this artile are as follows. A simplified dynamic model of a quadruped robot is established based on linear inverted pendulum (LIP), and the idea of capture point (CP) and zero moment point (ZMP). A push recovery control system based on model predictive controller (MPC) is established according to the requirement of the control strategy.

With the general use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in recent years, the gesture recognition concept for HMI has become a considerable study in UAVs. They can be used in different domains and for different purposes. The main motivation for this paper is to create as simple a human-machine interface design for UAVs as possible. The vector-based features can be arranged in low memory size and the low-complexity decision process on them can be aimed. The gesture recognition problem for HMI in UAVs can be modeled as a pattern recognition problem in a multi-sensor system with vectorial data from various types of sensors. The speed of the action and the magnitude of the action can be different even within the same class of gesture action. In other words, user-independent gesture action recognition is difficult due to large intra-class differences in gesture action patterns. This paper introduces the wavelet-based vectorial feature extraction and the discriminant function-based decision in the supervised-based reduced vectorial dimension. According to experimental studies, the promising method is put forward for gesture recognition in the control of UAVs.},

This study proposes a multimodal feature association-based stereo SLAM method. Firstly, a method to extract point and line features from stereo images and estimate plane features through the line features is proposed. Then, the corresponding mathematic models for representing the association relations between different features are given. After that, the association relations are integrated into the back-end optimization model to improve system robustness and accuracy by adjusting reprojection errors with confidence weights. Finally, comparison tests are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method with the mainstream stereo SLAM systems using the EuRoC and KITTI datasets. The test results show that our approach not only generates semantic maps with higher fidelity but also provides a better positioning capability, with the positioning accuracy of the algorithm on the EuRoC and KITTI datasets improved by an average of 14.78% and 20.09%, respectively.},

Each local tree is expanded towards all other trees via bur of free configuration space ( $$\mathcal {C}$$ -space). Each node is assigned a cost-to-come value, which is then used to optimally connect (if possible) all nodes from local trees to a single main tree according to Bellman’s principle of optimality. The algorithm is provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost-surely to the optimum. Main and local trees are aptly grown in order to prevent exploring $$\mathcal {C}$$ -space in regions which are unlikely to yield solutions. A comprehensive simulation study is performed analyzing runtimes and convergence rate, where RGBMT* is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract     = {In this article, the mechanical design and analysis of a novel three-legged, agile robot with passively compliant 4-degrees-of-freedom legs, comprising a hybrid topology of serial, planar and spherical parallel structures, is presented. The design aims to combine the established principle of the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum model for energy efficient locomotion with the accuracy and strength of parallel mechanisms for manipulation tasks. The study involves several kinematics and Jacobian based analyses that specifically evaluate the application of a non-overconstrained spherical parallel manipulator as a robot hip joint, decoupling impact forces and actuation torques, suitable for the requirements of legged locomotion. The dexterity is investigated with respect to joint limits and workspace boundary contours, showing that the mechanism stays well conditioned and allows for a sufficient range of motion. Based on the functional redundancy of the constrained serial-parallel architecture it is furthermore revealed that the robot allows for the exploitation of optimal leg postures, resulting in the possible optimization of actuator load distribution and accuracy improvements. Consequently, the workspace of the robot torso as additional end-effector is investigated for the possible application of object manipulation tasks. Results reveal the existence of a sufficient volume applicable for spatial motion of the torso in the statically stable tripodal posture. In addition, a critical load estimation is derived, which yields a posture dependent performance index that evaluates the risks of overload situations for the individual actuators.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM), which refers to an air transportation system wherein unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are used to deliver small payloads on-demand by safely maneuvering in the low-altitude known urban infrastructure inhabited by dynamic air traffic. A multi-stage framework based on numerical potential fields is proposed for establishing UTM in the non-segregated airspace. Numerical potential fields are adopted for global path planning as they provide optimum stand-off clearance from obstacles in the environment. The proposed global path planning approach is augmented with a prediction-based zone determination algorithm to minimize high-density air traffic encounters by the UAS. In the event of low-density traffic in the vicinity of the UAS, the UAS neighborhood is sectorized into octants. An octant-based local collision avoidance strategy generates force fields that divert the UAS into a vacant octant. Extensive simulations have been carried out to show the efficacy of the proposed method in dense urban settings.},

In the front-end, semantic segmentation is performed using Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network), also, combining the depth and distance information of feature points with random sampling to obtain static feature points with higher confidence. Then, the relative static point is obtained by matching the dynamic feature points of the adjacent frames, which is added to the tracking and optimization of the current frame to obtain the minimized re-projection error and the optimal pose of robot. In order to adapt the uncertainty of dynamic feature point changes, a high-performance keyframe selection method is developed for different situations. In the back-end, a closed loop detection strategy is constructed by combining semantic information with bag-of-words (BOW) model. Further, according to whether a closed loop is formed or not, a combinatorial optimization strategy based on graph optimization and factor graph optimization is adopted to improve the real time performance of the algorithm. Finally, these images with semantic tags obtained after semantic cutting are employed to build a semantic octree map of the environment. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The field of human activity recognition is evolving at a quick pace. Indeed, over the last two decades, several approaches have been proposed to recognize human activities from generic videos, but still limited for daily living videos which have more characteristics that make them much more complex to manage. In fact, they present several challenges to overcome, such as; camera view variations, time information representation, inter-class variation between similar actions, fine-grained actions representation and high intra-class variation. Generally, the recognition of the action requires the extraction of spatial and temporal information in the videos. To extract temporal information, several works based on the LSTM network have been published. Although, they have proven their great potential in this field, they fail to model long range temporal information in very long video sequences. We have hence thought of using Transformer networks to propose a new pose-guided self-attention mechanism combined to 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) by a Bilinear Pooling Attention module (BPA) which allows the spatial-temporal skeleton features to recalibrate the RGB features for Daily Living Activity (DLA) recognition. In addition, the majority of the implemented datasets are static and do not show strong variations in movement over time. We then thought of going towards a large-scale dataset called NTU RGB+D, since it contains RGB-D human actions that evolve much more over time. The Experimental results demonstrate that our Spatial Temporal Self Attention mechanism combined to 3D CNN through BPA module (ST-SA-BPA) outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.},

  abstract     = {Selecting suitable kinematic configurations for autonomous, flexible mobile systems remains a prominent challenge in various applications of trajectory tracking, including path solver planning, redundant robot control, grasping, and robotic system design. Current techniques based on the inverse kinematic problem suggest that the classic manipulability index referencing the local frame’s velocity is sufficient to infer the behavior of the kinematic constraints. Successful constraint inference then allows the control strategy to be updated when the performance becomes suboptimal with respect to the target path. However, these approaches become deficient when the joint space is flexible, making it necessary to explicitly account for the structural parameters of the mobile system (e.g., number of joints, mass, wheel size, and links) in order to infer the behavior of the kinematic constraints. Instead, the dynamic confined space of velocities (DCSV), initially proposed by the author, suggests a Markovian process relating the local frame’s velocity, kinematic constraint violations, and implicit flexibility. Hence, the present paper analyzes the DCSV’s behavior and proposes an offline method to reconfigure the structural parameters, thus demonstrating how the DCSV’s behavior can be used to reduce the violation of kinematic constraints. To this end, two lemmas and one theorem provide a new viewpoint regarding manipulability by using invariant and ergodic measurement conditions corresponding to the kinematic constraint evolution to compose DCSV-based selection criteria. The results are based on tracking problems and path-planning solvers in which the manipulability of a kinematic configuration is improved by updating the configuration according to optimal paths.},

  abstract     = {One option for teaching a robot new skills is to use learning from demonstration techniques. While traditional techniques often involve expensive sensors/equipment, advancements in computer vision have made it possible to achieve similar outcomes at a lower cost. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research on a robot learning to produce 3D motions from 2D data and then using this knowledge to interact with people. To this end, we designed a study using a NAO robot to imitate human behavior by reproducing motions in 3D space after viewing a small number of 2D RGB videos for each motion. The goal is for the robot to learn certain social interactive skills by learning from video observation and then apply them during human-robot interaction. Five steps were taken to achieve this objective: 1) collecting a dataset, 2) human pose estimation, 3) transferring data from human space to the robot space, 4) robot control, and 5) human-robot interaction. These steps were separated into two phases, robot imitation learning and human-robot social interaction. The majority of the algorithms employed are deep learning-based, achieving ~96% accuracy in the action recognition on our dataset. The results were also promising when implemented on the robot. Overall, this preliminary exploratory study successfully showed the proof of concept for producing 3D motions from 2D data. This approach is noteworthy because of the amount of online training data, the robot can be trained quickly, and it does not require an expert.},

To address this problem, we propose a real-time compatible method that achieves globally maximizes manipulability in redundancy, while simultaneously tracking the end-effector’s pose. Our method is particularly applicable to a 7-degrees of freedom (DOFs) anthropomorphic manipulator, where its joint exhibits monotonicity. Utilizing the joint monotonicity, we initially propose an algorithm capable of computing redundancy resolution for global maximum manipulability in real-time. Subsequently, the task of optimizing manipulability in redundancy is transformed into tracking the redundancy joint with maximum manipulability. The redundancy joint tracking task is then integrated into an optimization-based controller. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in simulation and experiment.},

We proposed a shared autonomy framework that incorporates human-robot joint perception and action to enhance the practicality and applicability of the mobile robot navigability. Accuracy of robotic sensing and precision of robotic action are employed as autonomous safety in the loop of human control. In shared autonomy, autonomous safety is incorporated into human-teleoperated robot control and their integration is adjusted through an online user-customizable arbitration function. Beyond the current state of the art in shared autonomy, social skills and social preferences in terms of human perception, as well as cognitive decision-making and action, are compiled into autonomous behaviors through learning from demonstration method. Autonomous behaviors exported from the trained neural networks are integrated with autonomous safety and then adjusted by user-desired control arbitration for robot autonomy. The transition of shared and full autonomy is easily managed by users, depending on specific applications. To validate the methodological approach, we implemented the framework on two mobile robot platforms to evaluate its feasibility, practicability, and reproducibility. Our experimental results showed that the shared autonomy framework was well applied to incorporating personal skills and social preferences in mobile robot navigation systems. To a certain extent, the framework plays the role of the road map guiding how to take advantage of human cognitive perception and decision and precision of robotic action in developing mobile robot navigation systems that can be deployed and applied to real-world applications.},

The novelty of the work is presented in two parts; first is the design of a Robot Operating System (ROS)-Physics Engine-based hybrid machine learning model with separate terrain classification and slip ratio estimation algorithms. The motivation for developing a hybrid model is presented by analyzing slip ratio-longitudinal friction coefficient characteristics in three different terrains: sand, grass, and asphalt. The longitudinal friction coefficient ( $$\mu _x$$ ) values are distinct for the same values of slip ratio in different terrains, potentially influencing the model’s feature extraction. The features for the slip estimation model are collected from torque sensors and IMU, which measure the external forces acting on robot wheels. The slip estimation is achieved using ensembles of weak classifiers to reduce the computational load of onboard systems. An optimized model with slip ratio classes as output has been evaluated and presented for three different terrains. The model provides an accuracy of 78.1% in the sand, 77.8% in the grass, and 73.5% in asphalt in simulations. The model is compared with a strong classifier used in previous works regarding the accuracy, training time, and computational time. Second, the virtually- trained learning algorithm is tested and validated using the physical robot whose virtual model is implemented in simulations with the actual slip ratio estimated using an experimental framework.},

To operate in dynamic and complex environments efficiently demands an optimal path planning where multiple factors should be taken into account. In this paper, the multi-objective path planning problem of USV is formulated aiming to minimize the traveled distance maximizing in parallel the trajectory smoothness and energy efficiency. To address this multi-objective path planning problem with contradicting terms, the popular Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed enhanced with the proposed Fuzzy Pareto framework. In particular, ACO is used to solve the problem by finding the Pareto solutions optimizing each single objective. Then these solutions are evaluated via the Mamdani fuzzy inference system to identify the optimal one. The ranking of the solutions is based on the defuzzification values. A case study is performed in a simulation area based on Saronic Gulf topology. The results showed that depending the needs of an operation and the conditions of the area of operations (number of obstacles, currents, and distance from the initial to the target point), each objective can impact the path quality differently.},

  abstract     = {Generating motions to grasp the objects in the scene is critical in robotic manipulation. The feasibility and quality of the output trajectory are closely related to both the grasping pose and the motion to reach the object, and decoupling grasp and motion planning cannot balance these two factors. In this paper, a motion planning method is proposed that comprehensively considers trajectory optimization, trajectory goal selection, and grasp adjustment. Trajectory optimization is formulated as an equality-constrained optimization problem, in which the end configuration of the trajectory can be changed during optimization. The update rule is derived and acts as a basic rule for goal selection and adjustment. The grasp configuration is chosen from a goal set, which helps the optimization to jump out of the local minima and generate smooth and feasible trajectories. We propose a two-stage grasp selection algorithm to balance between exploitation of the trajectory optimization and exploration of the goal set. To further optimize the trajectory, we propose a grasp adjustment method that allows the grasp pose to rotate about the connection line of the contact points in the workspace. To address this complicated problem, we divide the problem into two subproblems: computing the angle to rotate in the workspace and calculating the grasp configuration in the joint space. We design the overall planner and incorporate our method into a complete robotic arm platform with perception and the grasp generation network. All proposed methods are validated by performing comparative simulations and experiments.},

Adaptive grippers are useful for grasping objects of varied geometric shapes by wrapping fingers around the object. The finger closing sequence in adaptive grippers may lead to ejection of the object from the gripper due to any unbalanced grasping force and such grasp failure is common for lightweight objects. Designing of the proposed gripper is focused on ensuring a stable grasp on a wide variety of objects, especially, lightweight objects (e.g., empty plastic bottles). The proposed actuation mechanism is based on movable pulleys and tendon wires which ensure that once a link stops moving, the other links continue to move and wrap around the object. Further, optimisation is used to improve the design of the adaptive gripper and the optimised gripper has been developed using 3D printing. Finally, validation is done by executing object grasping on common household objects using an industrial robot fitted with the developed gripper.},

Collision avoidance from dynamic obstacles in unstructured environments, such as pedestrians and other vehicles, is one of the key challenges for mapless navigation. This paper proposes a DRL algorithm based on heuristic correction learning for autonomous navigation of a UGV in mapless configuration. We use a 24-dimensional lidar sensor, and merge the target position information and the speed information of the UGV as the input of the reinforcement learning agent. The actions of the UGV are produced as the output of the agent. Our proposed algorithm has been trained and evaluated in both static and dynamic environments. The experimental result shows that our proposed algorithm can reach the target in less time with shorter distances under the premise of ensuring safety than other algorithms. Especially, the success rate of our proposed algorithm is 2.05 times higher than the second effective algorithm and the trajectory efficiency is improved by $$24\%$$ in the dynamic environment. Finally, our proposed algorithm is deployed on a real robot in the real-world environment to validate and evaluate the algorithm performance. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can be directly applied to real robots robustly.},

  abstract     = {Capsule Network is powerful at defining the positional relationship between features in deep neural networks for visual recognition tasks, but it is computationally expensive and not suitable for running on mobile devices. The bottleneck is in the computational complexity of the Dynamic Routing mechanism used between the capsules. On the other hand, XNOR-Net is fast and computationally efficient, though it suffers from low accuracy due to information loss in the binarization process. To address the computational burdens of the Dynamic Routing mechanism, this paper proposes new Fully Connected (FC) layers by xnorizing the linear projection outside or inside the Dynamic Routing within the CapsFC layer. Specifically, our proposed FC layers have two versions, XnODR (Xnorize the Linear Projection Outside Dynamic Routing) and XnIDR (Xnorize the Linear Projection Inside Dynamic Routing). To test the generalization of both XnODR and XnIDR, we insert them into two different networks, MobileNetV2 and ResNet-50. Our experiments on three datasets, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MultiMNIST validate their effectiveness. The results demonstrate that both XnODR and XnIDR help networks to have high accuracy with lower FLOPs and fewer parameters (e.g., 96.14% correctness with 2.99M parameters and 311.74M FLOPs on CIFAR-10).},

  abstract     = {To successfully perform autonomous navigation, mobile agents must solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. However, acquiring the map in a single SLAM session may not be possible, thus the map may be incrementally built over multiple sessions. Two solutions could be considered to solve the multisession SLAM problem: (i) the robot must localize itself in the previously stored map before the new session starts; (ii) it can start a new map and merge it with the map from the previous sessions. To date, only scenario (i) has been addressed by RatSLAM, an algorithm inspired by the navigation system in rodent brains. Therefore, this work proposes a multisession solution that solves both scenarios. A new mechanism merges the data from the RatSLAM structures of the current mapping session with those previously stored if there are connections between these paths. This approach was tested in four different scenarios, from virtual controlled environments to real-world environments with two, three, and five sessions. The robot started in an unfamiliar location for each mapping session, but it also works if the agent starts in a known place, scenario (ii) and (i), respectively. For all experiments, the entire map was consistently obtained. Furthermore, the proposed approach updates and enhances the previous session’s map in real-world environments. Therefore, the proposed approach may be a multiple SLAM session solution for the RatSLAM algorithm.},

This work provides extensions to RRT and RRT* that employ fillets as motion primitives, allowing path curvature constraints to be considered when planning. Two fillets are developed, an arc-based fillet that uses circular arcs to generate paths that respect maximum curvature constraints and a spline-based fillet that uses Bézier curves to additionally respect curvature continuity requirements. Planning with these fillets is shown to far exceed the performance of RRT* using Dubin’s path motion primitives, approaching the performance of planning with straight-line path primitives. Path sampling heuristics are also introduced to accelerate convergence for nonholonomic motion planning.

  abstract     = {The structure of the hopping robot is such that the robot, relying on a single leg, must make consecutive jumps and be able to maintain its balance with hand tools. For this purpose, changing the angle of the robot&#39;s hands on the upper body is responsible for maintaining the robot&#39;s balance. If the upper body function is optimal, the leg mechanism can jump from the momentum caused by the robot mass. In this research, a semi-active mechanism is used for jumping, and the active actuator only performs the task of compensating for wasted energy. The new content of this research is based on the use of a simple four-link mechanism to compress the passive element rather than the ball-screw mechanism or any complete active mechanisms for jumping actions, and two moving arms to get balanced and do horizontal motion like acrobats by leading forward and changing orientation based on a unicycle model. Robot control method and how to implement PD controllers to move on a plane in a 3D space are presented; also, this paper presents the total modeling and motion control based on jump movement, balance, and robot orientation. The control concept of jumping is obtained as an open-loop multi-phases controller with no feedback from spatial position and orientation, just the internal joints of the robot, as well as the balancing control that used feedbacks of position and velocity states for observing different phases. Although, the rotating motion is a feedforward control. Finally, by implementing the control method and the robot model in a virtual environment (Simscape/Matlab), the robot&#39;s pursuit of some paths simulated. So the control motions act independently to guide the robot at a maximum speed of 3.1 cm per second. The simulations included the following online and offline trajectories, and the robot&#39;s performance is validated for movements in the range of 7–16 m per 260–600 s, as the robot is able to jump as high as 28 cm at the duration of 0.6 s in each stage hop.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAV are vehicles capable of take-off and landing vertically like helicopters while maintaining the long-range efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft. Unfortunately, due to their wing area, these vehicles are sensitive to wind gusts when hovering. One way to increase the hovering wind-rejection capabilities of hybrid UAV is through the addition of extra actuators capable of directing the thrust of the rotors. Nevertheless, the ability to control UAVs with many actuators is strictly related to how well the Control Allocation problem is solved. Generally, to reduce the problem complexity, conventional (CA) methods make use of linearized control effectiveness in order to optimize the inputs that achieve a certain control objective. We show that this simplification can lead to oscillations if it is applied to thrust vectoring vehicles, with pronounced non-linear actuator effectiveness. When large control objectives are requested or actuators saturate, the linearized effectiveness based CA methods tend to compute a solution far away from the initial actuator state, invalidating the linearization. A potential solution could be to impose limits on the solution domain of the linearized CA algorithm. However, this solution only reduces the oscillations at the expense of a lag in the vehicle acceleration response. To overcome this limitation, we present a fully nonlinear CA method, which uses an Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm to solve the CA problem. The method is tested and implemented on a single board computer that computes the actuator solution in real time onboard a dual axis tilting rotor quad-plane. Flight test experiments confirm the problem of severe oscillations in the linearized effectiveness CA algorithms and show how the only algorithm able to optimally solve the CA problem is the presented Nonlinear method.},

The MRS Drone contributes to the state-of-the-art of UAV platforms by allowing smooth real-world deployment of multiple aerial robots, as well as by outperforming other platforms with its modularity. For real-world multi-robot deployment in various applications, the platform is easy to both assemble and modify. Moreover, it is accompanied by a realistic simulator to enable safe pre-flight testing and a smooth transition to complex real-world experiments. In this manuscript, we present mechanical and electrical designs, software architecture, and technical specifications to build a fully autonomous multi UAV system. Finally, we demonstrate the full capabilities and the unique modularity of the MRS Drone in various real-world applications that required a diverse range of platform configurations.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles has spread across different fields of the industry due to their ease of deployment and minimal operational risk. Firefighting is a dangerous task for the humans involved, in which the use of UAVs presents itself as a good first-action protocol for a rapid response to an incipient fire because of their safety and speed of action. Current research is mainly focused on wildland fires, but fires in urban environments are barely mentioned in the bibliography. To motivate the research on this topic, ICUAS’22 organized an international competition inspired by this mission, with the challenge of a UAV traversing an area populated by obstacles, finding a target, and precisely throwing a ball to it. For this competition, the Computer Vision and Aerial Robotics (CVAR-UPM) team developed a solution composed of multiple modules and structured by a mission planner. In this paper, we describe our approach and the developed architecture that led us to be awarded the first prize in the competition.},

  abstract     = {The aviation use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) necessitates a strong control design. The key to designing a durable control system is a well-developed flight dynamics model. System-based model identification techniques provide a useful means for estimating UAV modal parameters thereby saving time and money. Although considerable research is performed on UAV flight dynamics analysis utilizing system identification techniques, limited work exists that compares various techniques of system identification for UAVs in an exhaustive manner. Moreover, the research contributions toward performance evaluation and comparison of system identification methods outputs are even more scarce, especially under varying environmental conditions. In this study, a comprehensive framework utilizing various linear and nonlinear estimation techniques estimates unknown UAV model dynamics. To analyze the effects of varying flight conditions, a detailed analysis is performed which includes a parametric sweep of environmental elements as input arguments to the estimation process. The comparison involves the estimation of key performance parameters such as residual analysis, final prediction error, and fit percentages. Through rigorous analysis, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework predicts system parameters under a variety of conditions, thereby confirming its validity. It has also been demonstrated that a parametric sweep of environmental conditions, can be utilized to improve the authenticity of models’ data learning ranges, and their response to the prediction parameters. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, provides an elaborate platform for researchers to carry out comprehensive model prediction under a wide range of environmental conditions.},

We also improve real-time sparse Gaussian process regression models by introducing an adaptation of the mean shift and fixed-width clustering algorithms called radial clustering. Radial clustering enables real-time SGPR models to have an adaptive number of inducing points through an efficient inducing point selection process. The entire DSGPR framework is evaluated on multiple simulated random vector fields. The results show that this framework effectively estimates vector fields using multiple autonomous agents.

  abstract     = {Solving the inverse kinematics of redundant and hyper-redundant manipulators is more challenging because their kinematic redundancy leads to a more complicated mapping from end-effector pose to configuration space. A heuristic inverse kinematics solver, called Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK), has been demonstrated to solve the inverse kinematics of complex chain systems with fast convergence and simple implementation. However, as the pose precision of the end-effector increases to a higher value, such as $$ 10^{-6} $$ , FABRIK converges slowly in some configurations and thus exhibits unstable convergence behavior. Hence, this paper presents a novel inverse kinematics algorithm that combines FABRIK and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm, in which the joint angles deduced by FABRIK will be taken as the initial seed of the SQP algorithm to realize fast convergence. Meanwhile, a universal and non-trivial mapping from joint Cartesian positions to joint angles is included to enable the extension of FABRIK to redundant and hyper-redundant manipulators while retaining its simplicity. With the $$ 10^{-6} $$ pose error constraint, quantitative tests on serial chain manipulators demonstrate that the combined algorithm outperforms FABRIK in terms of success rate and runtime. Meanwhile, some popular inverse kinematics algorithms are treated as benchmarks to compare with the combined algorithm. Finally, simulations using serial chain manipulators indicate the effectiveness of the combined algorithm on path tracking.},

Yet it remains a challenge due to the coupled translational and rotational dynamics and the complexity of the movements. This paper proposes a brain-inspired architecture for autonomous maneuvering flight of miniature UAVs. In designing such system, several key issues will be addressed: maneuver controller design, online maneuver decision making, and command generation. First, a modeling method based on dual quaternion is proposed to describe maneuvering flight. Then, an incremental flight control method in 6-DOF is introduced. Furthermore, a novel dual quaternion-based dynamic maneuvering primitive(DQ-DMP) is proposed to learn the trajectories performed by human pilots. Finally, a decision-making method based on a spiking neural network and Actor-Critic network is provided for the choice of maneuvering primitives. The hardware-in-the-loop simulation and outdoor flight test show that the architecture can learn, repeat and generalize the maneuvers. Various aerobatic maneuvers can be performed by the fixed-wing UAV after several demonstrations.},

It can adapt to the inspection function of rock holes at an angle of 0–90 ° with a diameter of 95 mm–105 mm. ADAMS software is used to carry out dynamic simulation analysis of the robot, and the reasonable design of the pre-tightening reducing mechanism is obtained. At the same time, the important influence of the pre-tightening pressure between the walking wheel and the hole wall and the spring pre-tightening force on the robot’s traction force is obtained. On this basis, the problem of vertical walking is emphatically solved, so that the robot can walk at any angle within the 90 ° range rock hole, thus expanding the application scope of the robot. Based on the theoretical analysis, a robot experimental platform is built to verify the key technologies of the robot and test the performance of the robot, including visual acoustic signal acquisition, moving speed test and traction force test, which proved the correctness of theoretical analysis and design.},

The method uses exact dynamic state-feedback linearization, and the controller expression is derived using the dynamic extension algorithm (DEA). Flatness relations are used to determine conditions for reference trajectories which avoid singularities. The proposed design achieves error dynamics which is ES in the presence of constant force and torque disturbance acting on the UAV. Finally, the proposed control law is compared to a geometric output-tracking design through numerical simulations, and the advantages of the proposed method are highlighted including its ease of tuning and disturbance robustness.},

Social Value Orientation is a concept taken from social psychology which has not been studied from the perspective of control of multi-agent systems. Here SVO is encoded as a parameter in the control protocol, resulting in different agent behaviors or in a sense different agent personalities such as social (swarming), prosocial or asocial (selfish) agents. It is guaranteed that agents eventually enter a user-defined ellipsoidal ring around the target and the target will be captured/enclosed. The obtained results show that agents with different personalities act differently while moving towards the target and have different steady-state behaviours or configurations. In particular, selfish agents converge to steady state faster than their more social counterparts. In contrast, social agents interact more with the swarm, and therefore, they stay more cohesive but converge slower to steady state. We present analytical derivations as well as simulations with agents with quadcopter dynamics for both stationary and moving targets.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, several robotic end-effectors have been developed and made available in the market. Nevertheless, their adoption in industrial context is still limited due to a burdensome integration, which strongly relies on customized software modules specific for each end-effector. Indeed, to enable the functionalities of these end-effectors, dedicated interfaces must be developed to consider the different end-effector characteristics, like finger kinematics, actuation systems, and communication protocols. To face the challenges described above, we present ROS End-Effector, an open-source framework capable of accommodating a wide range of robotic end-effectors of different grasping capabilities (grasping, pinching, or independent finger dexterity) and hardware characteristics. The ROS End-Effector framework, rather than controlling each end-effector in a different and customized way, allows to mask the physical hardware differences and permits to control the end-effector using a set of high-level grasping primitives automatically extracted. By leveraging on hardware agnostic software modules including hardware abstraction layer (HAL), application programming interfaces (APIs), simulation tools and graphical user interfaces (GUIs), ROS End-Effector effectively facilitates the integration of diverse end-effector devices. The proposed framework capabilities in supporting different robotics end-effectors are demonstrated in both simulated and real hardware experiments using a variety of end-effectors with diverse characteristics, ranging from under-actuated grippers to anthropomorphic robotic hands. Finally, from the user perspective, the manuscript provides a set of examples about the use of the framework showing its flexibility in integrating a new end-effector module.},

Smooth Q-Learning aimed to solve the relative over-generalization and the stochasticity problems while also performing well in the presence of other non-coordination factors such as the miscoordination problem (also known as the Pareto selection problem) and the non-stationarity problem. Smooth Q-Learning is an algorithm that tries to find a trade-off between two incompatible learning approaches: the maximum-based learning and the average-based learning, by dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on the value of temporal difference error in a way that ensures the algorithm lies somewhere between average-based learning and maximum-based learning. We compare Smooth Q-Learning against different algorithms from the literature: Decentralized Q-learning, Distributed Q-Learning, Hysteretic Q-Learning, and a recent version of Lenient Q-Learning called Lenient Multiagent Reinforcement learning 2. The results show that Smooth Q-Learning is very effective in the sense that it has the highest number of convergent trials.

It combines a model-free approach intertwined with a model-based approach such as sliding mode control (SMC) to counter the unknown disturbances and decouple them to provide better tracking. A proportional-integral (PI) control-like structure is taken as the first sliding surface. A proportional derivative (PD) control-like structure is proposed as the second sliding surface for trajectory tracking. This motion control works for any fully actuated or over-actuated vehicle. Initially, the dynamic model and vehicle configuration are presented. Then the vehicle’s closed-loop behavior is studied in the presence of underwater currents. Later, the study considers external disturbances and compensates them with the help of a nonlinear disturbance observer. Lyapunov’s direct method and Barbalat’s lemma ensure the asymptotic convergence of tracking errors. The proposed controller performance is evaluated using a detailed comparison study with different model-free and model-based controllers from the literature. Later, the control scheme’s effectiveness is demonstrated numerically with the help of computer-based simulations.

  abstract     = {Redundant and dual-arm manipulators exhibit good flexibility and excellent cooperation ability, respectively. Therefore, both these manipulators are used to design a redundant dual-chain manipulator with two kinematic chains and a fixed base. In addition, a motion planning method is proposed using a manifold analysis based on the characteristics of this designed manipulator to resolve the difficulty associated with motion planning for a dual-chain manipulator under multiple constraints. Firstly, the paths of the two end-effectors of the dual-chain manipulator are planned synchronously by the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) in the Cartesian space. Then, joint trajectories that correspond to the paths are generated by the manifold analysis in the joint space. In this method, the manifold continuity constraint is added to the end-effector path planning of RRT* to ensure that the planned paths have continuous joint trajectories. The joint trajectories are optimised by analysing the performance of the manipulator on the manifolds to improve their motion performance. The prototype experiments of loose coordination and tight coordination are provided in the experimental section; these experiments prove the feasibility and practicability of the motion planning method proposed in this study.},

The study employs well-established system identification strategies in both time and frequency domains to extract equivalent linear models. By exciting the system dynamics with a frequency sweep signal, non-parametric and parametric models are derived for each control channel, namely the flap and thrust. Furthermore, a comprehensive nonlinear simulation model is developed to facilitate trade study and design optimization. The identified models undergo careful validation using a two-square wave input signal, demonstrating their accuracy through a comparison with flight test data. Moreover, in terms of the control design, a noteworthy achievement is made by proposing a novel approach. The study showcases the effectiveness of a unique combination of multi-loop PID controllers specifically adapted to the time-periodic nature of the system. Remarkably, this approach enables satisfactory control behavior in a 3D environment utilizing only the flap input in the control loop while keeping the motor speed constant. Such a breakthrough holds great significance as it allows for the reliable application of a complex time-periodic aerial vehicle in demanding maneuvers, relying on just a single effective actuator.},

The problem is solved by decomposing into three sub-problems: information fusion, task assignment, and multi-UAV behavior decision-making. Specifically, in the information fusion process, we use the maximum consistency protocol to update the joint estimation states of multi-targets (JESMT) and the area detection information. The area detection information is represented by the equivalent visiting time map (EVTM), which is built based on the detection probability and the actual visiting time of the area. Then, we model the task assignment problem of multi-UAV searching and tracking multi-targets as a network flow model with upper and lower flow bounds. An algorithm named task assignment minimum-cost maximum-flow (TAMM) is proposed. Cooperative behavior decision-making uses Fisher information as the mission reward to obtain the optimal tracking action of the UAV. Furthermore, a coverage behavior decision-making algorithm based on the anti-flocking method is designed for those UAVs assigned the coverage task. Finally, a distributed multi-UAV cooperative area coverage and target tracking algorithm is designed, which integrates information fusion, task assignment, and behavioral decision-making. Numerical and hardware-in-the-loop simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve persistent area coverage and cooperative target tracking.},

  abstract     = {In many automated motion planning systems, vehicles are tasked with tracking a reference path or trajectory that is safe by design. However, due to various uncertainties, real vehicles may deviate from such references, potentially leading to collisions. This paper presents rigorous reachable set bounding methods for rapidly enclosing the set of possible deviations under uncertainty, which is critical information for online safety verification. The proposed approach applies recent advances in the theory of differential inequalities that exploit redundant model equations to achieve sharp bounds using only simple interval calculations. These methods have been shown to produce very sharp bounds at low cost for nonlinear systems in other application domains, but they rely on problem-specific insights to identify appropriate redundant equations, which makes them difficult to generalize and automate. Here, we demonstrate the application of these methods to tracking problems for the first time using three representative case studies. We find that defining redundant equations in terms of Lyapunov-like functions is particularly effective. The results show that this technique can produce effective bounds with computational times that are orders of magnitude less than the planned time horizon, making this a promising approach for online safety verification. This performance, however, comes at the cost of low generalizability, specifically due to the need for problem-specific insights and advantageous problem structure, such as the existence of appropriate Lyapunov-like functions.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies have not extensively researched swarm robot multiobjective search in a complex environment sunch as unknown dynamic nonconvex (UDNC) obstacle environment to address collision prediction and low search efficiency. In addition, research on unnecessary excessive robot rotation and the loss caused by rotation during movement has not received enough attention. In this paper, a multitarget search strategy of a robot swarm based on triangular cones (MSTC) is proposed to satisfy the previously mentioned challenges. First, to address the problem of obstacle avoidance in a UDNC environment, an expanding triangular cone (ETC) method is proposed. This method not only considers the size of the robot but also enables the robot to avoid obstacles and other robots effectively and safely. Second, a roaming direction cone (RDC) and a target search cone (TSC) are proposed to improve the robot’s search ability. The RDC improves the ability to exploit the global unknown environment, while the TSC effectively enhances the local search capabilities. Furthermore, the three methods can avoid the time consumption, energy consumption and mechanical loss due to unnecessary direction rotation through a simple geometric relationship to improve the robot service life. Finally, the three proposed methods are combined to construct an MSTC strategy to simulate the multitarget search process of swarm robots. Simulation experiments are carried out using a simplified virtual force (SVF), a straight-line search method different from the nearest neighbour (LSDN), and a particle swarm optimization algorithm with kinematic constraints (KCPSO). The results show that the time consumption, the road consumption, the degree of rotation and the number of rotations have all made significant improvements.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, based on terminal sliding mode control (TSMC), a cooperative impact time and angle constrained guidance (CITACG) law for multi-missile system with switching network topologies is proposed. The obtained CITACG is composed of two parts. One part is designed to make the missiles intercept the target from their predetermined impact angles. And the other part’s goal is to make the multiple missiles intercept the target simultaneously without predefining a common impact time. Sliding mode surface of the first part is designed based on TSMC, meanwhile integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) and graph theory are applied to derive the second part of the CITACG. When the communication network switches between the connected topology and the disconnected one, a Lyapunov candidate function is introduced and the corresponding stability conditions are derived. The proposed guidance law is the summation of the two guidance parts, therefore it is a direct method and do not have to switch the guidance command between the impact angle constrained guidance law and the impact time constrained guidance law. The predetermined common impact time is not required in the proposed CITACG, and the missiles can automatically adjust themselves to intercept the target simultaneously by communicating between their neighbors. Numerical simulations demonstrate the great performance of the proposed guidance law.},

The work proposed in this paper increases the robustness of contemporary feature-based visual odometers for application in such environments by evolving a state-of-the-art approach; ensuring the tracking of visual keypoints that are geometrically and photometrically invariant, highly distinguishable, and exhibit strong repeatability. Experimental results, obtained from visual datasets captured by a stereoscopic camera installed on an AUV while performing different missions in large areas of the Balearic Islands with special ecological interest, show the improvement of this proposal with respect to other approaches already available and its feasibility to be used online.},

Since this kind of robot inherits nonlinear dynamics, designing a nonlinear suboptimal controller such that the robot tracks time-varying trajectories in complex missions to achieve optimal performance is of great importance. In this paper, a nonlinear suboptimal controller is suggested to track time-varying desired trajectories by the cable-suspended planar parallel robots (CSPPRs). For this aim, the mechanical and electromechanical models of the CSPPRs based on Newton’s second law are derived. After that, the controller is designed by taking three main steps. At first, a reference model is formulated by paying attention to the desired trajectory. Next, the pseudo-linearization technique is used to rewrite the state-space representation of an augmented system consisting of the robot and the reference model. Finally, a state-dependent Riccati equation is numerically solved to achieve the control law. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by both simulation results and experimental results. The results show that the proposed controller is able to stabilize the closed-loop system while the tracking error converges asymptotically to zero and robust tracking performance is obtained.},

To achieve the desired formation of multiple robots, the sensor-to-control signals with the noisy channel are modeled by a nonlinear function, which includes unknown and estimated parameters. Based on the adaptive control technique and robust control technique, the unknown parameters of noisy signal models are estimated and compensated, respectively. Meanwhile, the prescribed performances are enforced to standardize the transient performance of nonholonomic mobile robots. Then, a novel distributed prescribed performance formation control scheme is designed to guarantee formation errors evolving always with the predefined regions under noisy communication, achieving the desired formation. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the formation errors are proved to converge to a compact set, and closed states are bounded. Simulations are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the true signals estimation algorithm and distributed prescribed performance formation control laws.},

The UAV moves to the fire-alike target-set and for the unexplored area it uses a Chebyshev shortest path from the boundary free cells to the boundary of the target-set. Due to SLAM-induced errors, the UAV employs virtual potential fields and local depth measurements for obstacle avoidance. Upon detection of the target, comprised as a fiducial marker to emulate a fire-source, the UAV uses a ballistic trajectory to propel its payload (fire extinguishing material) towards the target.

The proposed framework uses a novel frontier selection method that also contributes to the safe navigation of autonomous MAVs in obstructed areas such as subterranean caves, mines, and urban areas. The framework presented in this work bifurcates the exploration problem in local and global exploration. The proposed exploration framework is also adaptable according to computational resources available onboard the MAV which means the trade-off between the speed of exploration and the quality of the map can be made. Such capability allows the proposed framework to be deployed in subterranean exploration and mapping as well as in fast search and rescue scenarios. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated in detailed simulation studies with comparisons made against a high-level exploration-planning framework developed for the DARPA Sub-T challenge as it will be presented in this article.},

Besides, it was compared to Dead Reckoning and a learning-based particle filter method. The experimental results present the feasibility of the proposed method and its advances in relation to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel dual-handed master single slave teleoperation framework based on the four-channel structure and wave variable theory. Through the coordination of dual-handed masters, the teleoperation system may exert more accurate and flexible operations, such as grasping soft objects. In practice, it is inevitable to generate partial active power by human operators, which may decrease the stability of the system. Considering the partial active power in dual-handed masters, we discuss and give the definite maximum proportion to stabilize the system. With the proposed framework and the partial active power of dual-handed masters, we design an energy flow-based teleoperation control that combines the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller with a disturbance observer to maintain stability, increase the tracking accuracy and enhance the transparency of the system. The stability of the system is analyzed, and numerical simulations are performed to verify the performance of the proposed control. For real robot experiments, we designed a platform including two Omni robots and an industrial manipulator, which acted as dual-handed masters and a single slave manipulator. A computer is used to connect the communication between the masters and the slave side. Real soft object grasping teleoperations are presented; the results show the high efficiency of the proposed method.},

However, controlling these systems in real-world applications requires a highly functional teleoperation framework, capable of leveraging all utility of the robot to complete tasks. In this work, such a teleoperation framework is presented, where a wearable whole-body motion capture suit is integrated with a whole-body controller specialised for teleoperation and a set of teleoperation strategies that enable the control of all main frames of the robot along with additional functions. Within the whole-body controller, all tasks and constraints can be configured dynamically due to their modularity, hence enabling seamless transitions between each teleoperation strategy. As a result, this not only enables the realisation of trajectories outside the workspace without the whole-body controller but also the ability to complete tasks that would require an additional manipulator if just the gripper frames of the robot were controllable. To validate the presented framework, a set of real robot experiments have been completed to demonstrate all teleoperation strategies and analyse their proficiency.},

To remedy this autistic impact at its very early stage, researchers are focusing their attention on robotics research with humanoid robots. It has been claimed that under certain circumstances, children with ASD (CwASD) interact more actively and spontaneously with robots than humans. Therefore, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a beneficial approach in training CwASD to abate their autism disabilities. This paper extensively reviews the prior findings on HRI for CwASD. With some critical analysis, a couple of findings have been highlighted to address the research gaps on the effectiveness of the intervention sessions administered by the robots. A total of nine traits of autism, intervention sessions administered by various tasks, different types of robots used, number of CwASD’s along with their age, diagnosis methods applied to quantify the autism levels, and, finally, the outcomes with identified research gaps have been analyzed. With some comparative depictions, the reader can visualize the broad scenario and overall research condition of robot-assisted training (RAT) for CwASD. This review recommends employing robots in supervised applications to enhance therapeutic effectiveness, broaden acquiescence, and inspire trust among practitioners, CwASD, and guardians. Overall, RAT is a promising use for intelligent social robots, especially for helping CwASD achieve therapeutic and educational goals. We expect interdisciplinary collaboration to address its difficulties quickly.},

Such limitations may exist due to lack of communication or due to privacy restrictions (for example, autonomous vehicles may not want to share their locations or intents with other vehicles or even to a central server). The key insight that allows us to solve this problem is to stochastically distribute the robots across different routes in the environment by assigning them paths in different topologically distinct classes, so as to lower congestion and the overall travel time for all robots in the environment. We outline the computation of topologically distinct paths in a spatio-temporal configuration space and propose methods for the stochastic assignment of paths to the robots. A fast replanning algorithm and a potential field based controller allow robots to avoid collision with nearby agents while following the assigned path. Our simulation and experiment results show a significant advantage over shortest path following under such a coordination-free setup.},

  abstract     = {Dual mobile manipulators are increasingly used in cooperative operation tasks, and their appropriate joint configurations are the premise to ensure the success of the tasks. However, for a given task path, due to the existence of redundant degrees of freedom, there are countless possible joint configurations, which makes it difficult to solve the inverse kinematics. In addition, most of the existing redundant inverse kinematics solutions are only for redundant manipulators or single mobile manipulator, with less consideration given to the impact of the constraints between the dual mobile manipulators on the solution performance. To this end, a new inverse kinematics solution method for the dual mobile manipulators is proposed in the paper. First, six parameters are introduced to describe the kinematic redundancy, so as to transform the inverse kinematics of the dual mobile manipulators into non-redundant inverse kinematics. Then, in order to make full use of the redundancy, the weighted product form of the normalized ideal redundant behaviors including manipulability, joint motion continuity, collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and joint motion synchronization is considered as an objective function. Finally, the redundancy parameters are optimized by the Nelder-Mead simplex method to obtain the desired joint configurations. Based on the platform composed of SUMMIT-XL STEEL mobile robot and UR5 manipulator, a single target pose solution is simulated. Moreover, using the platform composed of SUMMIT-XL STEEL mobile robot and AUBO-i16 manipulator, the performance of path solution and obstacle avoidance is evaluated experimentally. The simulation and experimental results show that under the constraints of the desired redundant behaviors, satisfactory joint configurations can be acquired in the reachable space of the joints. Besides, the joint configurations of the dual mobile manipulators are solved in about 1 ms. It follows that the proposed method can select the optimized one from multiple possible joint configurations by the redundancy parameters optimization.},

The SLAM method, coupled with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), has recently received much attention due to its excellent performance. However, the tightly coupled LiDAR and IMU odometry (LIO) will be interfered with by the unknown initial state during system startup, which will lead to system startup failure in severe cases, especially in the case of low-cost sensors. Therefore, this paper presents a Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) aided initialization procedure to estimate unknown initial states assuming that the vehicle always starts from stationary. The proposed initialization procedure includes two phases: static phase and dynamic phase, and this paper also proposes a Zero Velocity Detector to distinguish the two phases precisely. The proposed system is evaluated on the datasets gathered from the campus zone with low-cost sensors to evaluate the whole system. The results show that our approach can effectively improve robustness and partly improve precision when the system is bootstrapped.},

In this paper, we first propose a gap-guided controller switching strategy to significantly improve the training efficiency of DRL by introducing human-designed priori knowledge. Specifically, we design a reward-based controller switching algorithm that allows the priori controller (expert) to correct the robot behavior in case of poor DRL controller performance, which can avoid random exploration during training. In addition, a gap detection algorithm is used as an online-mapless planner to compute a passable sub-goal within a limited field of view, ensuring that the robot receives dense rewards in complex scenarios. In summary, our method incorporates prior knowledge into network training by combining online-mapless planner and expert demonstration, which greatly improves training efficiency. We apply our method to mapless navigation tasks in both simulation and real worlds to demonstrate that the proposed method improves exploration efficiency by 62%, total reward by 42%, and training speed by 60% compared to the normal DRL methods.},

In addition, a compensation algorithm is proposed to improve the robot position accuracy using the calibration results; the proposed algorithm does not require modification of the kinematic parameters of the robot controller and can be applied to robots with different degrees of freedom. Simulations on a PUMA560 robot and a SCARA robot were performed to validate our algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms were applied to our self-designed modular robots with four and six degrees of freedom.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a dynamic modeling and trajectory tracking control design for a hyper-redundant continuum manipulator (HRM), which is able to continuously bend along its length. The HRM has the advantages of high flexibility, large workspace, and low inertia, but also poses challenges of complex kinematics, and dynamic coupling. To address these challenges, the kinematics model was developed based on the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption that captures the relationship between the cable lengths, joint angles, and end-effector pose. Inverse kinematics is presented geometrically by solving trigonometric equations. The dynamic model for the continuum robot (CR) is derived using the Euler–Lagrange representation, which incorporates the effects of gravity and elasticity. Accordingly, three control strategies are developed and applied to a two-section continuum robot, which are the inverse dynamic proportional integral derivative controller (PID), fuzzy logic controller (FLC), and sliding mode controller (SMC). We validate our proposed methods through simulations on various 3D trajectories, utilized MATLAB symbolic math toolbox in conjunction with Simulink simulation; demonstrate and evaluate different close-loop dynamic control responses for different scenarios. This simulation used in the creation of a unique animated simulation for a whole 3D continuum robot while tracking its desired trajectories. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods can effectively control the HRM with high tracking performance, exhibiting enhanced responses in terms of settling time, rising time, and steady-state error. While the developed SMC outperforms Poth&#39;s PID and FLC in terms of robustness and settling time (51% and 10.3%), respectively.},

To economize the limited communication resources, two ET mechanisms are employed in the controller-to-actuator channel and communication channel respectively. In the controller-to-actuator channel, a novel switching ET mechanism is developed, where the agents can choose the ET strategies arbitrarily in a unified control framework by adjusting a switching parameter. In the communication channel, an improved filter composed of only triggered output signals is presented, which can avoid the transmission of multiple signals between agents and reduce the dispensable data transmission effectively. In the designed filter-based backstepping control framework, the parameter estimation technique is employed to deal with unmatched uncertainties and disturbances problems for high-order nonlinear MASs. By applying the Lyapunov stability method, it is proved that the outputs of agents can reach a leaderless consensus, and the stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed. Finally, two simulation examples demonstrate that the proposed control strategy is effective.},

  abstract     = {Typically the longitudinal and lateral control is separate for the tracking control of autonomous vehicles, especially for vehicles distributed driven at rear wheels. It may cause problems, such as high computation complexity and low performance. This paper proposes a trajectory tracking control algorithm with coupling of longitudinal and lateral control. In the presented algorithm, the trajectory tracking errors in lateral direction, heading angle error and speed error, and the allocation of longitudinal forces to the driven wheels are taken accounted in a cost function. By using model predictive control (MPC) method, the front wheel steering angle and the longitudinal force of the driving wheels are optimized in one step with no further need of torque allocation. A torque control algorithm is designed based on the target longitudinal force obtained and tire characteristics. Longitudinal forces are fulfilled through sliding control to achieve vehicle velocity. Stability of this algorithm is validated through map of $$\beta$$ - $$\dot{\beta }$$ method. This paper conducted simulation analysis on typical scenarios such as skid pad test, extreme corner turning test, and closed loop test. The results verified that the proposed algorithm has better tracking performance which decreased the lateral error by 14.6% than the decoupled method in closed loop test, and better dynamic response compared to the traditional MPC algorithm that does not consider longitudinal force optimization.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an AD*-based technique for fast, dynamically feasible path replanning for collision avoidance of anguilliform-inspired articulated mobile robots operating in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles in underwater environments. Although a few past approaches have addressed the problem of the generation of dynamically feasible paths in the presence of static obstacles, to the best of our knowledge, path planning in the case of fish-inspired robots in the presence of dynamic obstacles has not been explored. We employ a lattice-based approach to generate dynamically feasible reachable nodes and, thereby, a search graph that captures the robot’s kinodynamic constraints and accounts for the interaction with surrounding fluid flow. We employ proximity sensors to sense the dynamic obstacles for replanning. Moreover, a simple vector-based time-to-collision and collision state prediction method has been proposed to adapt the problem to a graph-search approach. We found that the developed approach could avoid collision with dynamic obstacles moving at 1.5 times the robot’s speed, with a maximum success rate of around 78%. The average success rate obtained using the developed technique is 70%, which is more than the success rate obtained using D*-Lite for the examples reported in this paper. The developed approach can impart autonomy to fish-inspired robots operating in unstructured and cluttered environments.},

  abstract     = {Among the works related to the planning of trajectories of manipulator robots, a subject that has been approached by different authors is the study associated to the manipulator’s movement, without considering the variable &quot;time&quot; involved in these tasks. These studies involve the robot&#39;s kinematic constraints (path geometry, obstacles and the characteristics of the effector). This paper proposes an optimization technique for planning the trajectory of a cylindrical manipulator robot with 5 degrees of freedom. The technique considers two crucial factors: obstacle deviation and the kinematic characteristics of the manipulator. In the first step, an algorithm is employed to generate intermediate points along the trajectory. This algorithm optimizes the intermediate points to minimize the distance between them and the final destination. In the second step, the proposed method utilizes b-spline functions of the 5th degree to generate smooth and efficient trajectories with minimal joint movement. Joint space restrictions are proposed to ensure that the trajectory obtained does not cause collisions and it is applied within the operational limits of the robot. The proposed steps have been implemented using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results of the study indicate that the proposed method is highly suitable for cylindrical robots operating in the presence of obstacles. The computational analyses conducted during the study clearly demonstrate that both the intermediate points and the trajectory within the joint space of the robot under investigation remained well within the designated collision-free zone.},

  abstract     = {Wildfires are a common problem in many areas of the world with often catastrophic consequences. A number of systems have been created to provide early warnings of wildfires, including those that use satellite data to detect fires. The increased availability of small satellites, such as CubeSats, allows the wildfire detection response time to be reduced by deploying constellations of multiple satellites over regions of interest. By using machine learned components on-board the satellites, constraints which limit the amount of data that can be processed and sent back to ground stations can be overcome. There are hazards associated with wildfire alert systems, such as failing to detect the presence of a wildfire, or detecting a wildfire in the incorrect location. It is therefore necessary to be able to create a safety assurance case for the wildfire alert ML component that demonstrates it is sufficiently safe for use. This paper describes in detail how a safety assurance case for an ML wildfire alert system is created. This represents the first fully developed safety case for an ML component containing explicit argument and evidence as to the safety of the machine learning.},

To better release the control performance of ATSMC, an improved honey Badger algorithm was designed to obtain the controller parameters with good performance, and the parameters optimization goal of ATSMC can be achieved in limited time.

The hyperbolic tangent function is employed to design the position control law, and the adaptive laws of the uncertainties are obtained by Lyapunov direct method, so as to guarantee the global stability of the tracking controller. An adaptive sliding mode controller is designed for control of the direction angle, and the influence of direction angle error on the stability of the position tracking system is considered. By adjusting the control gain coefficients of the two control subsystems, the convergence speed of the direction angle control subsystem is far greater than that of the position control subsystem, so as to assure the asymptotic convergence of the whole robot control system. Furthermore, the stabilization problem is converted into an equivalent tracking problem through the selection of appropriate reference velocities. The asymptotic convergence of pose errors for mobile robot is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulations and experiments are carried out to verify that the designed control method can simultaneously handle the problems of trajectory tracking and stabilization of mobile robot.},

  abstract     = {Loop closure detection(LCD) is an essential part of the visual SLAM system, which can reduce the cumulative error caused by drift. LCD based on traditional methods adopts artificially designed image features. However, this method lacks semantic information and is vulnerable to the external lighting environment. Aiming at the problem of missing information in the image feature representation of LCD, this article proposes a feature extraction method based on multi-layer feature fusion of the lightweight network SqueezeNet. This method can reduce the loss of location and detail information and significantly improve the feature-matching accuracy and extraction rate. Then we employ the nonlinear KPCA method to reduce the dimension of the extracted image feature vectors. In addition, in order to prevent the error matching of adjacent images and the long matching time, we propose an adaptive range matching algorithm, which adaptively limits the matching range in the matching feature stage and jumps out of unnecessary candidate ranges by setting corresponding thresholds and dictionaries of candidate key frames. It not only improves the accuracy of LCD but also dramatically reduces the matching time. The extensive experiments on relevant datasets show that the proposed method has higher accuracy and rate than other methods of CNNs, achieving better robustness and real-time requirements and proving the method’s effectiveness for LCD.},

Firstly, a novel parallel mechanism consisting of one PUU (P-active prismatic pairs, U-universal joints) limb and two PRRS (R-revolution joints, R-active revolution joints, S-spherical joints) limbs (PUU-2PRRS) is proposed. Secondly, considering the particularity of the sub-closed loop structure of the mechanism, the dynamic model of the proposed PUU-2PRRS parallel mechanism is established based on closed loop vector and Lagrange methods, and then the correctness of the established dynamic model is proved by the comparative analysis of MATLAB and Adams software. Thirdly, an adaptive impedance control law with switching update rate is proposed to achieve constant force tracking in uncertain environments. Considering that the composite skin grinding task requires low maximum overshoot and high convergence speed of force tracking, the selection methods of the update rate are obtained based on the maximum overshoot and convergence speed analysis in frequency domain. Finally, by simulating different working conditions of composite skin grinding, the adaptive impedance control under switching update rate has better force tracking performance compared with the adaptive impedance control under fixed update rate, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

They are kinematically coupled versions of well–known planar mechanisms, namely the 4–bar, the crank–slider, the swinging–block, and the turning–block. A control procedure, which involves alternative multistep reconfiguration sequences becomes relevant. It allows for energy efficient reconfigurations, while providing flexibility in motion planning. Simulation studies together with laboratory–scale hardware implementations exemplify the concepts, demonstrate the applicability of the methods, and highlight the potential as well as the challenges of reconfigurable architecture.

  abstract     = {Coverage path planning (CPP) is the foundation of multiple robotic applications. The efficiency of CPP is affected by the local extremum, which describes a situation with the robot surrounded by obstacles and explored areas, even if unexplored areas remain in the environment. Most online CPP methods reactively deal with the local extremum after the mobile robot is trapped within it. However, repeated coverage is generated since the path of escaping the local extremum revisits the covered areas. This paper presents an online spiral coverage framework with proactive prevention of extremum (SP2E) to address the CPP problem in an unknown environment. Unlike other CPP methods, the SP2E approach prevents the local extremum through a cut vertex detection algorithm and a direction adaptation algorithm. The cut vertex detection algorithm predicts the local extremum by detecting cut vertexes, and the direction adaptation algorithm prevents it by adjusting the spiral path’s direction. The SP2E approach was validated by simulations and real-world experiments, and its performance was compared with other CPP algorithms. The results of simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that the SP2E approach provides the minimum coverage time and computation time while avoiding the local extremum.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an Image data-based autonomous navigation system for an under-canopy agricultural mini-rover called TerraSentia. This kind of navigation is a very challenging problem due to the lack of GNSS accuracy. This happens because the crop leaves and stems attenuate the GNSS signal and produce multi-path data. In such a scenario, reactive navigation techniques based on the detection of crop rows using image data have proved to be an efficient alternative to GNSS. However, it also presents some challenges, mainly owing to leaves occlusions under the canopy and dealing with varying weather conditions. Our system addresses these issues by combining different image-based approaches using low-cost hardware. Tests were carried out using multiple robots, in different field conditions, and in different locations. The results show that our system is able to safely navigate without interventions in fields without significant gaps in the crop rows. In addition to this, we see as future steps, not only comparing more recent convolutional neural networks based on processing power needs and accuracy, but also the fusion of these vision-based approaches previously developed by our group in order to obtain the best of both approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a multi-model localization framework for tethered drones. The framework is composed of three independent localization strategies, each one relying in a different model. The first strategy uses simple trigonometric relations assuming that the tether is taut; the second method relies on a set of catenary equations for the case when there is slack on the tether; the third estimator is a neural network-based predictor that can cover different tether shapes. Multi-layer perceptron networks previously trained with a dataset comprised of the tether variables (i.e., length, tether angles on the drone and on the ground) as inputs are used to select which model instantaneously provides the best results. Those networks are also able to identify situations where tether localization is not possible, thus rejecting all estimates. We evaluate our methodology using an in-house built tethering system, which is also described in this paper. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed localization framework consistently selects good solutions from the three estimators and rejects them when the input tether variables suggest bad estimation results.},

  abstract     = {The use of spherical robots in outdoor operations has increased because they can move on uneven/three-dimensional (3D) terrain. Since the non-holonomic constraints and the rolling, tilting and turning kinematics of spherical robots are coupled on 3D terrain, these operations may require complex design or advanced control techniques for stable rolling kinematics on a straight trajectory. Instead, a simple design or solution can be used for these operations. This study proposes a simple design for stable rolling kinematics of spherical robots on a straight path without changing the existing design and without a controller. The proposed design is based on coupling the spherical robots with a mechanical component and can be easily applied to all spherical robots. The proposed design does not require any change in the structure of a spherical robot, but only an additional identical spherical robot and a mechanical coupler. The main contribution and significance of this study is a simple design to overcome the stability problems of a single spherical robot operating on flat and 3D terrain. The rolling stability of the single and the coupled spherical robots on flat road and 3D terrain was investigated by kinematic analysis to verify the validity of the proposed design. The effect of the stiffness of the mechanical coupling on the rolling kinematics of the spherical robots was studied in the kinematic analysis using different mechanical couplings, such as a rigid shaft, a relatively soft spring and a relatively stiff spring. Experimental studies were conducted to verify the validity of the proposed design for the spherical robots rolling especially on 3D terrains. The results show that the proposed design, which requires only a mechanical coupler instead of a complex design or advanced controller, is reliable and feasible. The rigid mechanical coupling of the two identical spherical robots could overcome the problems of maneuvering and rolling stability of spherical robots on 3D terrains.},

The TAD game consists of an attacker and a cooperative target-defender pair. The attacker’s objective is to capture the target, whereas the target-defender team acts together such that the defender can intercept the attacker and ensure target survival. We assume that the cooperative target-defender pair do not have perfect knowledge of the attacker states; hence, they are estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). NMPC is used to determine the optimal control commands for the target and the defender. A capture analysis based on the Apollonius circles was performed to identify the target survival regions. The findings from the analysis and the efficacy of the NMPC-based solution were evaluated through extensive numerical simulations. The results verified the escape and capture regions obtained through the analysis and showed that the NMPC-based solution offers robustness to the different unknown attacker models and performs better than the CLOS and A-CLOS based strategies.},

Given a set of points of interests (POI), a set of refueling stations for UVs, and a base station where the UVs are stationed and their availability is random, the objective is to determine route for each UV starting and terminating at the base station such that overall incentives collected by visiting POIs is maximized. We present an outer approximation based decomposition algorithm and the skewed variable neighborhood search heuristic to solve large instances, and perform extensive computational experiments using random instances.

  abstract     = {Advanced robotic systems are finally becoming a reality; following the increased attention that robotics have attracted during the last few decades, new types of robotic applications are launched, from robotic space vessels and fully autonomous cars to robotic dancers and robot companions. Even more, following the advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, robots can now participate in more complex systems, namely Cyber-physical systems (CPS). In such systems, robots, software, sensors and/or “things” cooperate seamlessly in order to exhibit the desired outcome. However, the high heterogeneity of the components comprising CPS systems requires expertise in various scientific domains, a fact that makes development of CPS applications a resource- and time-consuming process. In order to alleviate this pain, model-driven (or model-based) approaches have been introduced. They employ a low code software engineering approach and hide the domain-specific knowledge needed, by providing an abstract representation that can be more easily understood. Following the low-code paradigm, current work focuses on the development of Domain-specific Languages (DSL) for ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) systems in order to hide low-level middleware-specific setup and configuration details and enable access to robot development by non ROS experts. Furthermore, in order to enable the integration of ROS2 robots in CPS, a second DSL was developed. The first language, GeneROS, is used for the development and configuration of the core functionalities of the robot (such as hardware drivers and algorithms), while the second language, ROSbridge-DSL, implements the interfaces for connecting robots to the Edge and the Cloud, enabling this way remote monitoring and control in the context of IoT and CPS.},

In this research, considering the nonlinear friction model of each joint, an identification approach based on swarm intelligence algorithms for nonlinear joint dynamics of a 6-DOF UR5 robot manipulator has been proposed by using a two different excitation trajectory approach for analyzing the accuracy of parameters to be identified. The Coulomb-Viscous friction model, the Stribeck friction model and the centrosymmetric static friction model (CSFM) are chosen to describe the friction effects of the joints. By using five different arbitrary paths and a Fourier reference excitation trajectory, the nonlinear friction model and robot dynamic parameters are identified by using swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithms such as Cuckoo Search (CS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and also the hybrid algorithms called GWO-CS and GWO-PSO. For the purpose of showing the prediction accuracy of the algorithms and comparing the prediction torques of the dynamic model based on the different joint friction models, the verification of parameter estimation is performed. Finally, simulation results are used to illustrate which swarm intelligence algorithms provide better estimation performance and which joint friction models achieve higher torque prediction accuracy.},

Second, a reactive collision avoidance and trajectory recovery strategy (RCATRS) is presented based on the model of relative kinematics. In this strategy, by acting an acceleration vector with different magnitude and direction on UAV, a horizontal collision avoidance maneuver is realized in situations of different relative position and velocity vector. When UAV has bypassed the obstacle, the horizontal trajectory recovery maneuver is initiated to make UAV to return to original flight paths. Thus, different recovery trajectories corresponding with different relative velocity vector are planned. Finally, the safety controller is designed to apply RCATRS to autonomous quadrotor. Since a few of computation is off-line, RCATRS is simple in implement and can satisfy the request of running in real time. The results of simulation show the validity of the proposed RCATRS.},

However, tracking the predesigned reference ZMP may not result in a flexible response to disturbances. Hence, walking patterns that use a capture point (CP) were introduced to improve the robustness of walking, which typically control to track the reference CP. In this study, a method is adopted that updates the reference ZMP with the feedback of the CP. This method was used in our previous study on a ZMP-based preview approach that accounts for CoM tracking performance. The stability analysis of the proposed approach is derived, and its physical meaning is explained.

In this research, the motion of the mobile robot on uneven surfaces is investigated and its kinematic equations are revised to take the unevenness of surfaces into account, and its navigation and path tracking are studied. In this regard, the solution of real time updating the rotation matrix on the basis of Euler angles is proposed. To verify this algorithm, a procedure for obtaining Euler angles in the simulation is also presented and verified. In the experimental test, the Euler angles are calculated with the low-cost inertial sensors. Experimental tests are performed by an omnidirectional three-wheeled mobile robot on a laboratory uneven terrain specifically designed and built for this purpose. By employing this algorithm in the simulation, the positioning error caused by the unevenness of the surface was completely eliminated and the traveled path was matched with the desired path. In the experimental test, the improvement of the error of the path final point, was more than 83% and the improvement of the RMS error of all the points of the path was more than 77%.},

  abstract     = {Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) are increasingly used in time-consuming and effort-heavy scientific exploration applications. One such application is the inspection of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of water in aquatic ecosystems. This paper presents a novel autonomous UAS capable of sensing water properties and collecting up to three 250 mL water samples from multiple sampling locations. The system features a customized UAS with an in-house built fluorescence sensor and pumping mechanism. The system does in situ fluorescence measurements to map the gradient of fluorescent content across the body of water and determine the best sampling spot for targeted sampling. To ensure safe near-water operation, multiple sensor fusion with an Extended Kalman Filter has been implemented for accurate altitude estimation within 1.5 m from the water surface. To validate the performance of the system, we present experimental results from deployment in two different water ecosystems, namely the Congaree River, SC and Lake Wateree, SC.},

  abstract     = {Swarm robotic systems comprising members with limited onboard localization capabilities rely on employing collaborative motion-control strategies to successfully carry out multi-task missions. Such strategies impose constraints on the trajectories of the swarm and require the swarm to be divided into worker robots that accomplish the tasks at hand, and support robots that facilitate the movement of the worker robots. The consideration of the constraints imposed by these strategies is essential for optimal mission-planning. Existing works have focused on swarms that use leader-based collaborative motion-control strategies for mission execution and are divided into worker and support robots prior to mission-planning. These works optimize the plan of the worker robots and, then, use a rule-based approach to select the plan of the support robots for movement facilitation – resulting in a sub-optimal plan for the swarm. Herein, we present a mission-planning methodology that concurrently optimizes the plan of the worker and support robots by dividing the mission-planning problem into five stages: division-of-labor, task-allocation of worker robots, worker robot path-planning, movement-concurrency, and movement-allocation. The proposed methodology concurrently searches for the optimal value of the variables of all stages. The proposed methodology is novel as it (1) incorporates the division-of-labor of the swarm into worker and support robots into the mission-planning problem, (2) plans the paths of the swarm robots to allow for concurrent facilitation of multiple independent worker robot group movements, and (3) is applicable to any collaborative swarm motion-control strategy that utilizes support robots. A unique pre-implementation estimator, for determining the possible improvement in mission execution performance that can achieved through the proposed methodology was also developed to allow the user to justify the additional computational resources required by it. The estimator uses a machine learning model and estimates this improvement based on the parameters of the mission at hand. Extensive simulated experiments showed that the proposed concurrent methodology improves the mission execution performance of the swarm by almost 40% compared to the competing sequential methodology that optimizes the plan of the worker robots first and, then, the plan of the support robots. The developed pre-implementation estimator was shown to achieve an estimation error of less than 5%.},

In addition to rough terrain, they may confront unexpected impact forces during their leaping gaits. While facing external disturbances, legged robots should maintain and (if necessary) restore their stability while completing their gaits. To this end, external disturbances and body orientation errors should be identified, and appropriate actions have to be taken to restore the balance of the robot and to provide advantageous landing circumstances. This paper briefly surveys the developments for balance and posture control of legged robots. The primary focus of these studies is on balancing legged robots under external disturbances or performing dynamic gaits.

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical systems are taking on a permanent role in the industry, such as in oil and gas or mining. These systems are expected to perform increasingly autonomous tasks in complex settings removing human operators from remote and potentially hazardous environments. High autonomy necessitates a more extensive use of artificial intelligence methods, such as anomaly detection, to identify unusual occurrences in the monitored environment. The absence of data characterizing potentially hazardous events leads to disruptive noise displayed as false alarms, a common anomaly detection issue for hazard identification applications. Contrastingly, disregarding the false alarms can result in the opposite effect, causing loss of early indications of hazardous occurrences. Existing research introduces simulating and extrapolating less represented data to expand the information on hazards and semi-supervise the methods or by introducing thresholds and rule-based methods to balance noise and meaningful information, necessitating intensive computing resources. This research proposes a novel Warning Identification Framework that evaluates risk analysis objectives and applies them to discern between true and false warnings identified by anomaly detection. We demonstrate the results by analyzing three seismic hazard assessment methods for identifying seismic tremors and comparing the outcomes to anomalies found using the unsupervised anomaly detection method. The demonstrated approach shows great potential in enhancing the reliability and transparency of anomaly detection outcomes and, thus, supporting the operational decision-making process of a cyber-physical system.},

  abstract     = {Pneumatically driven soft actuators have been widely used in soft material robotics. However, soft pneumatic actuators are usually tethered to a rigid pump or compressor, which is complicated, cumbersome and noisy. In this study, we present a novel self-pumping actuation module which is composed of a soft origami pump, two soft pneumatic actuators, a servo motor, a controller and battery. During a working cycle, the soft pump is compressed or restored by pulling or releasing the tendons using the servo motor. As a consequence, the pneumatic actuators connected to the pump generate bending and restoring deformations. Moreover, the air flow inside the proposed module is closed-loop without exchanging air with the environment, making it possible to operation in certain scenarios such as in underwater or vacuum conditions, the advantage of our designed self-pumping actuation module is to recycle air without relying on a large rigid air pump. Theoretical model of the self-pumping actuation module is derived and its performance is characterized via several experiments. The maximum bending speed by the soft actuator is 239.2° s−1, the maximum compression speed of origami pump is 38.2 mm s−1, the maximum pressure inside the pump is 48 kPa, the maximum internal flow rate of pump is 11.5 L min−1, and the maximum torque of actuator is 0.0455 N·m. A soft robotic gripper, a fully untethered quadrupedal soft swimming robot and a rehabilitation glove are fabricated to show the superiority of the proposed design over traditional pneumatically actuated soft robots.},

  abstract     = {Flexible robots have exhibited impressive features in working in congested environments due to their compliance behavior and morphological structure. However, designing motion planning techniques and robust control strategies that actively control their deformations are challenging in many applications. Thus, this article presents the learning by Demonstration (LbD) approach for planning the spatial point-to-point motions of a multi-section continuum robot. Via teleoperation, the human demonstrations are captured by moving the flexible interface with similar kinematics of the active robot in front of the Motion Capture System (MCS). Meanwhile, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme is proposed based on the robot’s kinematic model to follow the reference trajectories while respecting the constraints imposed by the cable lengths and control actions. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the LbD approach in reproducing and generalizing the spatial motions of the robot’s tip and avoiding obstacles and external disturbances. On the other hand, the numerical simulations show the performance of NMPC scheme in terms of trajectory tracking and avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. Additionally, its robustness is analyzed by comparing it to the Pseudo-Inverse Jacobian Kinematic Control (PIJKC) while considering the constraints of cable lengths. Finally, the stability of NMPC is evaluated against input perturbations using the Monte Carlo simulations.},

Some of these solutions are mission planning platforms for broader usage, without aiming to solve a single scenario. However, these often either do not support multi-UAV collaboration or generate a static flight trajectory, which does not facilitate the coordination of a fleet of several UAVs in a mission that may need to adapt to the current environment. Through the development of a domain-specific language (DSL) - EasyMission - for UAV mission definition and control, we introduce a mission planning framework that makes it possible to describe mission plans that also enable the user to define adjustments and constraints that may have to be taken into account in real-time according to sensor readings or other events. This framework enables inexperienced users to design missions with low or moderate complexity levels, while still being a useful tool for advanced users due to its versatility in addressing multiple scenarios through a single platform. We show how the mission framework is able to easily define differentiated mission examples with distinct purposes and scenarios, and with real-time decisions and constraints.},

Therefore, in order to meet the requirements for high-accuracy periodic gait of legged robots, an impedance compound control of the HDU is designed based on the authors&#39; previous research of state feedback control (SFC). Firstly, according to the characteristics of the periodic signal, the system error is analyzed, and plug-in repetitive control (PIRC) is designed. Secondly, considering the influence of load force on control accuracy, a model-based feedforward disturbance rejection control (FDRC) is designed. Finally, a high-accuracy impedance compound control of the HDU combined the SFC, PIRC and FDRC is formed and the control structure is also designed. The experimental results show that both PIRC and FDRC can improve the control accuracy of the HDU, and PIRC has better control effect.

While simulating a VE, the HD should be stable; otherwise, it can damage itself or its operator. Usually, HDs are multi-degree-of-freedom serial manipulators with sensor quantization and friction in their joints. Hence, the HD dynamics is complex and its analytical stability analysis is complicated. During simulating of the VE for the operator, stylus movements are small. In the previous studies, the multi-DOF nonlinear dynamics of the HD was replaced with simple dynamics in which mass and viscous values are constant. However, there were neither analytical methods to determine the values of the mentioned parameters in the simplified model nor studying the accuracy of this simplification is studied. In this paper, a novel and general approach is employed for simplifying a multi-degree-of-freedom haptic device dynamics during arbitrary motion around the operating point, and its accuracy in the prediction of the stable simulation of the VE is discussed. Meanwhile, sensor quantization and Coulomb friction are considered in the model. This method is evaluated through simulation for stability analysis of the PHANToM 1.5 and KUKA Light Weight Robot IV (LWR IV) as haptic interfaces in various situations.},

However, AMCL performs poorly on localization when robot navigates to a featureless environment. To address this issue, an enhanced AMCL is proposed through using the information from laser scan points to improve the preciseness and robustness of the localization problem for service robots. The proposed new method first matches the laser scan points with a pre-built grid map by an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm and then designs a Localization Confidence Estimation (LCE) method to evaluate the localization credibility of ICP and AMCL respectively. Finally, the ICPs with high LCE scores are selected to inject particle swarms in the form of particles with adaptive amounts to optimize the next step of the AMCL estimation process. With the improved method, AMCL’s particle swarm can quickly converge to the correct position after several iterations. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the original AMCL in respect of accuracy and robustness even in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Focusing on the problem of extracting a set of feasible parameters to characterize the standard Newton-Euler (SN-E) dynamics model of robots, as an alternative to the linear matrix inequalities framework, a composite multiobjective differential evolution (MODE) algorithm based on the constraints of the linear combination vector inferred from the dynamic variables and the physical characteristics of the rigid links is proposed to recover feasible parameters from the estimated set of basic inertial parameters. In order to solve the challenge of difficult population evolution caused by complex feasible regions, the trial vector generation strategy for convergence is implemented through the elaborately combination of feasibility rule and $$\varepsilon $$ constrained method. In addition, the peak deviation of prediction of the classical viscous-coulomb (Vis-Cou) friction model during the robot joint inversion has thus far remained an open question, which is addressed by a specially developed improved model based on the viscous-arctan function. The proposed solutions have been validated with a set of experiments on a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot. The experiment results show that the established SN-E model tracks the actual torque effectively, and compared with the classical friction model, the optimized model reduces the deviation of the predicted torque by 22.1% while the peak error is effectively eliminated.},

  abstract     = {Wheeled locomotion mechanisms can traverse even terrains with high velocity, while tracked locomotion mechanisms can traverse rough terrains. Since different locomotion mechanisms are suitable for different terrains, there has always been a problem to choose appropriate modes according to terrains for all-terrain unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). In order to make UGVs can traverse various terrains efficiently, based on the concept of mechanism reconfiguration, the reconfigurable deformable tracked wheel (RDTW) is proposed, which can realize wheeled mode and tracked mode. The mechanical design of RDTW is introduced, and the kinematic of reconfigurable rims is investigated. The nonlinear terramechanics model is established by coupling with the deformation parameter of reconfigurable mechanisms. Further, this model is validated by Multibody Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (MBD-DEM) co-simulation and experiments. Based on the theoretical model, the passing ability can be improved by changing the configuration of the mechanism. The simulation and test prove that the structural design of RDTW is reasonable and effective, and the optimal deformation strategy obtained from the terramechanics based on its structure is effective and can be applied in practice. The analysis results show that the nonlinear sinkage curves and traction performance of UGVs can be effectively improved by configuring RDTW. The proposed locomotion mechanism is an important attempt in improving the design of multi-locomotion-mode UGVs.},

The substantial advancement of soft grippers may be attributed to the growth of soft robotics, the investigation of various materials, and the creation of flexible electronics. The field of soft robotics does have the potential to have a substantial influence, among other applications, on the field of soft grippers and manipulators. Grippers of various varieties are necessary for handling various types of items, both hard and soft. It is crucial to adopt flexible and adaptive gripping tactics to get more item holding flexibility. Soft-robotic grasping systems that are extremely flexible in terms of workpiece shape, size, and structure are an ideal choice for increasing production flexibility. The major reason for the review is to learn about the existing soft gripper and the repeatability of existing soft-robotic grippers with large payload capacities. This article offers a thorough analysis of soft gripper recommendations, covering machine learning techniques along with physical theories, sensor technologies, actuation strategies, and device topologies.

  abstract     = {This work deals with the closed-loop altitude control of a hybrid unmanned aerial-underwater vehicle (HUAUV) during media transition. Researches about HUAUVs are important for hard-to-reach operations. There are already several studies developed for unmanned vehicles, either in air or underwater. However, research on HUAUVs is a recent topic. There is a significant complexity in adapting of vehicles to navigate in both environments, and design a controller for hybrid vehicles is not a trivial task, mainly due to the transition region. This paper presents the analysis of the altitude control of a hybrid vehicle in the media transition region between the air and water. The main objective is the development of an altitude controller suitable for the challenge of media transition and able to deal with the abrupt changing characteristics ineherent to this region. Moreover, physical limitations are also estimated for the rotational speed of the motors to improve the mathematical model of HUAUV, and a smooth reference trajectory is generated for better environment transitions. A classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and a nonlinear controller are proposed for the altitude control. Finally, simulation results present the main characteristics of the altitude controllers on media transition, corroborating its feasibility for control of this complex system.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving technology is safety-critical and thus requires thorough validation. In particular, the probabilistic algorithms employed in perception systems of autonomous vehicles (AV) are notoriously hard to validate due to the wide range of possible critical scenarios. Such critical scenarios cannot be easily addressed with current manual validation methods, thus there is a need for an automatic and formal validation technique. To this end, we propose a new approach for perception component verification that, given a high-level and human-interpretable description of a critical situation, generates relevant AV scenarios and uses them for automatic verification. To achieve this goal, we integrate two recently proposed methods for the generation and the verification that are based on formal verification tools. First, we use formal conformance test generation tools to derive, from a verified formal model, sets of scenarios to be run in a simulator. Second, we model check the traces of the simulation runs to validate the probabilistic estimation of collision risks. Using formal methods brings the combined advantages of an increased confidence in the correct representation of the chosen configuration (temporal logic verification), a guarantee of the coverage and relevance of automatically generated scenarios (conformance testing), and an automatic quantitative analysis of the test execution (verification and statistical analysis on traces).},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based trajectory planning methods have been designed for manipulator trajectory planning, given their potential in solving the problem of multidimensional spatial trajectory planning. However, many DRL models that have been proposed for manipulators working in dynamic environments face difficulties in obtaining the optimal strategy, thereby preventing them from reaching convergence because of massive ineffective exploration and sparse rewards. In this paper, we solve the inefficient convergence problem at the two levels of the action selection strategy and reward functions. First, this paper designs a dynamic action selection strategy that has a high probability of providing positive samples in the pre-training period by using a variable guide item and effectively reduces invalid exploration. Second, this study proposes a combinatorial reward function that combines the artificial potential field method with a time-energy function, thereby greatly improving the efficiency and stability of DRL-based methods for manipulators trajectory planning in dynamic working environments. Extensive experiments are conducted using the CoppeliaSim simulation model with a freely moving obstacle and the 6-DOF manipulator. The results show that the proposed dynamic action selection strategy and combinatorial reward function can improve the convergence rate on the DDPG, TD3, and SAC DRL algorithms by up to 3-5 times. Furthermore, the mean value of the reward function increases by up to 1.47-2.70 times, and the standard deviation decreases by 27.56% to 56.60%.},

This paper proposes the Dynamic RRT algorithm, which aims to plan a feasible path while balancing the convergence time and path length in an environment with randomly distributed obstacles. It estimates the length of a path from the start node to the goal node that is constrained to pass through an extended tree node, and this path length is heuristically taken as the major axis diameter of the informed subset. Then new node sampling is performed directly in this subset to optimize the estimated path. In addition, the idea of dynamic programming is employed to decompose the planning problem into subproblems by updating the node selected through Pareto dominance as the new start node to optimize the distance to the goal. Simulation results confirm the performance of the proposed algorithm in balancing the convergence time and path length and demonstrate that the convergence time is faster than that of RRT, while the path length is better than that of RRT*. Dynamic RRT also shows better performance than Lower Bound Tree-RRT(LBT-RRT), and Informed RRT* takes more time to compute a path of the same length.},

Moreover, each robot is only capable of local sensing and empty positions in the structure are not known a priori. Robots carry a blueprint of the structure, containing relative coordinates for where blocks should be placed. A graph is extrapolated from the blueprint and used to define the structural properties necessary to analyze correctness and efficiency of the proposed technique. Simulated results show that the distance that robots travelled during assembly is likely to be the shortest path possible. Also, graph-based metrics are applied to evaluate the selection of different seed positions, drawing a relationship between structure blueprint and the distance travelled by the robots. Finally, physical experiments demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithms in realistic scenarios.},

In order to efficiently guarantee the energy replenishment for the UAVs, this paper presents a dynamic route planning strategy to solve the route planning problem for a USV-UAV multi-robot system, with the USVs traveling as mobile charging stations on the sea with obstacles. Based on the graph theory and receding horizon control (RHC) strategy, we formalize the dynamic route planning problem into a dynamic multiple generalized traveling salesman problem (DMGTSP). A heuristic approach is utilized to solve the optimization problem at each control step in a receding manner. The proposed strategy is compared with the global horizon strategy in different case studies with static and moving obstacles. A lake experiment is conducted to validate the developed dynamic planning strategy. The results indicate that the dynamic route planning approach enables the USV-UAV cooperative system to fulfill the recharging task successfully and efficiently by periodically rendezvousing at varying locations during the long-term mission.},

This method detects three gait states: stair ascending (SA), stair descending (SD), and level walking (LW). The GID is a highly important factor for the control of gait assistive devices. If the GID is limited to the motion information from a single leg, analyzing the gait motions becomes more challenging, owing to the absence of information regarding the phase difference between both legs. To address this challenging, previous GID methods have used fusion data from several sensors. In this paper, only three inertial measurement units are used for proposed single leg GID method. To analyze gait motions using these limited sensors, the divergent component of motion (DCM) of the user is computed. The DCM is a physical quantity incorporating the linear position and linear velocity of the center of mass; these can be computed from the kinematic data of a support leg. In each of the three gait states SA, SD, and LW, the DCM shows different patterns. To classify and detect these different patterns, a pattern recognition method based on an artificial neural network algorithm is used. The GID performance of the proposed method was experimentally evaluated, and it showed 99% success rate for the SA, SD, and LW states.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the analytic formulation of kinematics for a planar continuum parallel manipulator with large-deflection links. This development is motivated by the need for object manipulation with light-weight mechanisms in small spaces or human-machine collaborative environments. The manipulator contains two independent branch chains with links formed by highly flexible panels, and the moving platform is driven by the bending deflections of the links. For kinematic analysis, the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is applied to model the continuous deflections of the links. Then, the relationship between the internal force/moment and the deflection of each branch is formulated via elliptic integrals. By establishing the equilibrium equations for the internal force and moment, analytic formulations can be derived for the forward and inverse kinematics, respectively. The proposed method can account for the nonlinearity and inflection points due to large deformations and the inherent coupling between the closed-loop chain kinematics and the static characteristics of the chains. Numerical simulation has been carried out for the kinematic analysis to reveal how the link deflections generate planar motion for the moving platform. The proposed method has been validated by comparing the simulation results with finite element analysis. Under large deflections, the links can have two inflection points close to both ends and the occurrence of inflection points has a large effect on the distribution of the internal moment along the link. Stress checking confirms that the deformations of the links are still within their elastic region.},

  abstract     = {In collaborative robotics the manipulator trajectory has to be planned to avoid collisions, yet in real-time. In this paper we pose the problem as minimization of a quadratic functional among piecewise linear trajectories in the angular (joint) space. The minimization is subjected to novel nonlinear inequality constraints that simplify the original non-penetration constraints to become cheap to evaluate in real time while still preserving collision-avoidance. The very first and most critical step of the computation is to find an initial trajectory that is free of collisions. To that goal we minimize a weighted sum of the violated constraints until they become feasible or a maximal number of steps is reached. Sometimes an incremental growing of the obstacle helps. By incremental growing we mean that we sequentially solve auxiliary subproblems with obstacles growing from ground or falling from top and use as the initial trajectory the one optimized in the previous step. The initial trajectory is then optimized while preserving feasibility at each step. We solve a sequence of simple-bound constrained quadratic programming problems formulated in the dual space of Lagrange multipliers, which are related to the original linearized inequality constraints that are active or close-to-active. Finally, we refine the trajectory parameterization and repeat the optimization, which we refer to as an hierarchical approach, until an overall prescribed time limit, being well below a second, is reached.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel stride management strategy for rehabilitation exoskeletons. This method incorporates a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) into an Assist-As-Needed (AAN) controller to induce an optimal stride length for the wearers and optimize the energy consumption. Most AAN controllers rely on a predefined and fixed trajectory to measure the required amount of assistance. However, for a stride management approach, the trajectory should be updated regularly according to the wearer’s performance to induce the optimal stride length eventually. The proposed stride management strategy deals with this challenge by integrating a CPG into the control loop. The CPG updates the desired trajectory right after each swing phase. The AAN controller uses a recently introduced Strength Index (SI) for continuous measurement of the wearer’s ability in tracking the desired trajectory. A virtual tunnel around the desired trajectory is defined, and the tunnel boundaries are adjusted according to the SI. Then, an adaptive impedance controller determines the assistive force according to the distance between the actual trajectory of the user and the tunnel boundaries. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in OpenSim software, and reductions in the metabolic cost and muscles’ activity are observed.},

  abstract     = {Enabling robots to learn manipulation tasks by observing human demonstrations remains a major challenge. Recent advances in video captioning tasks provide an end-to-end method to translate demonstration videos into robotic commands. Compared with general video captioning tasks, Video to Command (V2C) task faces two key challenges: (1) How to extract key frames containing fine-grained manipulation actions from demonstration videos that contain a large amount of redundant information; (2) How to significantly improve the accuracy of generated commands so that the V2C method can be applied to real robot tasks. In response to the above problems, we propose a multi-modal framework for robots to learn manipulation tasks from human demonstrations. This framework consists of five components: Text Encoder, Video Encoder, Action Classifier, Keyframe Aligner and Command Decoder. In this framework, we have mainly done two aspects of work: (1) The key frame information of the video is extracted, and the effect of key frame information on improving the translation accuracy of robot commands is analyzed; (2) Based on the video and caption text information, we explore the effect of multimodal information fusion on improving the accuracy of the command generated by the model. Experiments show that our model is significantly superior to the existing methods on the standard metrics of video captioning tasks, such as BLEU_N, METEOR, ROUGE_L, and CIDEr. Among them, the performance of the variant model CGM-V using only video information on BLEU_4 is increased by 0.8%, and that of the variant model CGM-M using multi-modal information on BLEU_4 is significantly increased by 43.7%. Furthermore, our framework, when combined with an affordance detection network and a motion planner, can enable the robot to reproduce the tasks in the demonstration. Our source code and expanded annotations for the IIT-V2C dataset are at https://github.com/yin0816/CGM-M .},

  abstract     = {Robot calibration is crucial in multi-robot cooperative systems where the inaccuracy of robots can add up and cause large errors in the final trajectory of handled parts or process tools. In this work, a two-step calibration approach is proposed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and definition of compensated pose for a master–slave cooperative robot system. Measuring the pose of master and slave robots at different locations in their shared workspace is required to create pairs of joint angles and output pose errors as training data. The generated data is used to train two ANN models for compensating the master–slave relative error and the master robot errors. The master–slave relative error is corrected by introducing a compensated pose for the slave robot with respect to the master robot. A neural network is then trained to predict the error parameters of the compensated pose for the joint angles of both robots as the input. The master robot is then corrected individually using another ANN model to address the absolute accuracy of the cooperative system. Measurements and simulations have been performed on a dual-robot cooperative system before and after geometric calibration. The process of cross validation is carried out to find the best network architecture for the optimal performance in correcting the robots’ errors. It has been shown that even after pre-existing model-based calibration of each robot, both the absolute accuracy of the master robot and the relative tracking accuracy can be further improved by the proposed implementation of ANN calibration.},

The main contribution is a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art open-source Visual SLAM methods in terms of localization precision for versatile environments.

  abstract     = {Mobile robot localization is a complex task, specially in unstructured indoor environments, due to noise and wrong scan-to-map association. The localization procedure becomes critical when the vehicle has low confidence about its last pose estimate, situation that requires a global localization procedure. An intuitive approach to solve the Global Localization Problem (GLP) is to distribute several pose hypotheses all over the map and select the most likely one according to an optimization heuristic such as Monte Carlo, Swarm Intelligence or Evolutionary Algorithm. However, hardware limitations and environment characteristics may affect the localization efficacy. Furthermore, we found relatively few studies exploring the effectiveness and the computing cost of different localization methods under different scenarios e.g. offices, corridors and big warehouses. In this work, we analyze different global localization methods based on multi-hypothesis optimization metaheuristics. We use the scan-to-map matching error computed by a pose tracking algorithm, the Perfect Match (PM), as the metric to score the hypotheses. Our main contribution is to propose an enhanced localization system by integrating a multi-hypothesis global localization method with the PM. We also analyzed different optimization heuristics applied to the GLP under typical and special conditions. Using simulations and real-world experiments, we measured the success rate and computing cost using several population sizes. Results show that studied methods perform differently in distinct scenarios, but our proposals based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) showed an average success rate above 83%, while other methods did not achieved 80%. Furthermore, PM-based methods exhibit lower computing cost when compared to the traditional Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) after the 100th iteration. In summary, our study shows that the GA-based proposal, which performed slightly better than the PSO-based, represents the best candidate to integrate a robust localization system.},

  abstract     = {The key constituent of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the joint optimization of sensor trajectory estimation and 3D map construction. The multivariable optimization process in SLAM is mainly carried out through bundle adjustment (BA). However, the method of handling outliers in actual data directly affects the accuracy of BA optimization and further affects the tracking performance of the system. In addition, in monocular initialization process, when the feature points are coplanar or have low parallax, their fundamental matrix will degrade and greatly affects the initial pose estimation results. To further surmount the above challenges, this paper presents a real time monocular visual SLAM optimization based on BA with adaptive robust kernel (ARK-SLAM): 1) a model selection mechanism with geometric robust information content is designed to improve the robustness of monocular initialization; 2) an adaptive robust kernel based BA is proposed to reduce the interference of outliers and improve the accuracy of optimal pose estimation; 3) a loop closure candidate verification scheme based on adaptive robust kernel is introduced to jointly minimize the geometric error term and the relative pose constraints. The position tracking performance of developed ARK-SLAM method is verified using TUM RGB-D benchmark dataset and KITTI dataset, and experimental results illustrate the favorable performances of ARK-SLAM by comparing with ORB-SLAM, ORB-SLAM3, LSD-SLAM and PTAM.},

  abstract     = {The use of underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS) equipped with cameras has gained significant attention due to their capacity to perform underwater tasks autonomously. However, controlling both the manipulator and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) based on the vision system information is not an easy task, especially in situations where the vehicle cannot be parked/held stationary. Most of the existing approaches work based on complex matrix calculations for the inverse kinematics (IK), which can lead to high computational costs and the need to deal with singularity problems. A problem arises when the amount of time needed to calculate the UVMS configuration can result in reduced frequency of target pose estimation, beyond the point where the target has moved out of the camera field of view. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous visual servoing approach for UVMS, including an extension of a heuristic technique named M-FABRIK (Mobile - Forward and Backward Reaching IK) to calculate the UVMS inverse kinematics in a simple and fast way. This approach aims to control both the configuration of the manipulator and ROV position in order to allow underwater intervention in situations where the ROV cannot be parked/held stationary. This solution allows the vehicle to be positioned according to additional criteria, besides avoiding matrix inversion and being robust to singularities. Trials have been performed with a manipulator mounted on a work-class ROV for an autonomous underwater monitoring task and results demonstrate a simple and fast approach, which is able to set the configuration of the manipulator as well as the ROV for visual servoing applications in real-time, such as for monitoring, tracking and intervention tasks underwater.},

  abstract     = {In the unstructured real-world, general object grasping with multi-fingered robot hands requires robots to plan stable and reachable grasps for a plethora of unknown objects and be efficient in arbitrary workspace. Motivated by these rigorous demands, we propose a reachability-aware multi-fingered grasp planning framework that can synthesize feasible high-DOF grasps for novel objects in unrestricted workspace. The framework includes an end-to-end voxel-based Grasp Prediction Network (GPN) for generating stable multi-fingered grasp configurations and a learned Grasping Reachability Evaluator (GRE) to estimate kinematic reachability. The GPN takes as input a voxel representation of the scene and directly outputs the predicted collision-free multi-fingered grasps and the associated grasping stability. The GRE then evaluates the grasping reachability of each generated grasp configuration. Based on the predicted grasping reachability and stability, the most feasible grasp is ultimately executed by the robot. In contrast to previous methods that plan successful grasps within restricted workspace solely based on grasping stability, our approach further incorporates a concept of reachability into the online multi-fingered grasp planning via neural networks. The real-world experiments show that our approach outperforms several comparable methods and achieves an average completion rate of 82.2% for unseen cluttered objects in unrestricted scenarios. All these results indicate that the proposed approach can facilitate general multi-fingered robotic grasping in unstructured environments.},

This complex and challenging task includes several aspects: creating algorithms for rendering brushstrokes, reproducing the exact shape of a brushstroke, and developing the principles of mixing paints. This work contributes to the previously unsolved problem of accurately reproducing colors of brushstrokes by means of artistic paints. The main contributions of this paper include: the development of a novel 4-component data-driven mathematical model for artistic paint mixing; the design and implementation of a novel robot capable of accurately dosing and mixing acrylic paints thanks to the improved syringe pumps and the innovative paint mixer; the development of a novel pneumatic system for paint release with a build-in clogging detection mechanism. The capabilities of the designed robotic system are demonstrated by painting four artworks: replicas of Claude Monet’s and Arkady Rylov’s landscapes, a synthetic image generated using the StyleGAN2 neural network trained on Vincent van Gogh’s artistic heritage, and a synthetic image generated using the Midjourney neural network. The obtained results can be useful in various applications of computer creativity, as well as in artistic image replication and restoration, and also in colored 3D printing.},

This ramp signals’ recognizer increases the autonomy of unmanned vehicles and prevents errors caused by visual misinterpretations or lack of attention from the pilot of manned vehicles. This system is based on supervised machine learning techniques, developed with our own training dataset and two models. The first model is based on a pre-trained Convolutional Pose Machine followed by a classifier, for which we have evaluated two possibilities: A Random Forest and a Multi-Layer Perceptron based classifier. The second model is based on a single Convolutional Neural Network that classifies the gestures directly imported from real images. When experimentally tested, the first model proved to be more accurate and scalable than the second one. Its strength relies on a better capacity to extract information from the images and transform the domain of pixels into spatial vectors, which increases the robustness of the classification layer. The second model instead is more adequate for gestures’ identification in low visibility environments, such as during night operations, conditions in which the first model appeared to be more limited, segmenting the shape of the operator. Our results support the use of supervised learning and computer vision techniques for the correct identification and classification of ramp hand signals performed by airport marshallers.},

  abstract     = {Search-and-rescue (SaR) in unknown environments is a crucial task with life-threatening risks. SaR requires precise, optimal, and fast decisions to be made. Robots are promising candidates expected to execute various SaR tasks autonomously. While humans use heuristics to effectively deal with uncertainties of SaR, optimisation of multiple objectives (e.g., the mission time, the area covered, the number of victims detected), in the presence of physical and control constraints, is a mathematical challenge that requires machine computations. Thus including both human-inspired and mathematical capabilities in decision making of SaR robots is highly desired. However, developing control approaches that exhibit both capabilities has been significantly ignored in literature. Moreover, coordinating the decisions of the robots in large-scale SaR missions with affordable computation costs is an open challenge. Finally, in real-life, due to defects (e.g., in the sensors of the robots) or environmental factors (e.g., smoke) data perceived by SaR robots may be prone to uncertainties. We introduce a hierarchical multi-agent control architecture that simultaneously provides the following advantages: exploiting non-homogeneous and imperfect perception capabilities of SaR robots; improving the global performance as it is provided by centralised controllers; computational efficiency and robustness to failure of the central controller as offered by decentralised control methods. The integrated structure of the proposed control framework allows to combine human-inspired and mathematical decision making methods, via respectively fuzzy logic and model predictive control, in a coordinated and computationally efficient way. Our results for various computer-based simulations show that while the area coverage with the proposed control approach is comparable to existing heuristic methods that are particularly developed for coverage-oriented SaR, our approach has a significantly better performance regarding locating the trapped victims. Furthermore, with comparable computation times, the proposed control approach successfully avoids conflicts that may appear in non-cooperative control methods. In summary, the proposed multi-agent control system is capable of combining coverage-oriented and target-oriented SaR in a balanced and coordinated way.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous delivery by aerial robots inside urban environments is getting closer to be operational everyday, but several concerns about proper navigation sources are to be addressed. As lot of GPS glitches are observed in urban environments, hereon a fully vision-based navigation framework is developed. The platform is assumed to have the ability to get into a vicinity of its destination using available “imperfect” navigation methods like GPS. Hereupon, the autonomous execution of mission is divided into four consecutive phases, all relying on a forward-looking camera: I) A novel vision-based method for detecting and confirming the target facade in the batch of neighboring buildings is introduced that performs matching using neural networks exploiting the texture features of facade segments; II) The intended window among the facade windows array is detected in real-time; III) The robot is guided to autonomously approach the intended window by a proper visual tracking algorithm; IV) Finally, a collision-free passage through the portal section of window based on visual Time-To-Contact estimation is commanded for the safe entrance. The network is trained using approximately 34,000 feature samples from a set of real-world building facades. As a result, a 95.4% accuracy along with 81.4% classification precision and 87.6% recall are achieved for the trained network in correct facade detection and confirmation. Also, the success rate of overall entrance mission is found to be 13 out of 15 in real world experiments, provided the initial distance being less than 20 meters.},

Undoubtedly, as in every technological innovation, in parallel with the increase in the use of UAV systems for the benefit of humanity, there is also an increase and diversification in illegal activities. Due to the fact that UAV systems offer cheaper, risk-free and cost-effective solutions, there is a global increase in the frequency and diversity of the use of them by terrorist organizations. It would not be an exaggeration that the airspaces, which have been under the sovereignty of states until today and where terrorist organizations did not exist much, are now used by them. Despite the complex and expensive detection, identification, warning and prevention systems that states continue to develop to prevent air threats, the fact that terrorist organizations can carry out attacks with simple and inexpensive UAV systems confirms this determination. Based on the assumption that an UAV-based method can be developed for the solution of the identified problem, in this study an autonomous system has been tried to be developed that can perform control, surveillance and safety flight in a certain airspace, detect intruder systems during flight and lock on them with its software.},

The proposed system is capable of designing coverage missions for any type of UAV, integrating field characteristics into the resulting trajectory, such as irregular field shape and obstacles. The collected images are automatically processed to create detailed orthomosaics of the field and extract the corresponding vegetation indices. A novel mechanism is then introduced that automatically extracts possible problematic areas of the field and subsequently designs a follow-up UAV mission to acquire extra information on these regions. The toolchain is finished by using a deep learning module that was made just for finding weeds in the close-examination flight. For the development of such a deep-learning module, a new weed dataset from the UAV’s perspective, which is publicly available for download, was collected and annotated. All the above functionalities are enclosed in an open-source, end-to-end platform, named Cognitional Operations of micro Flying vehicles (CoFly).

To enable efficient operation, the aircraft flight performance is integrated into the process of multi-resolution airspace design, trajectory generation, conflict management, and MARL learning. The demand and capacity balancing (DCB) issue, separation conflict, and block unavailability introduced by wind turbulence are resolved by the proposed the multi-agent asynchronous advantage actor-critic (MAA3C) framework, in which the recurrent actor-critic networks allow the automatic action selection between ground delay, speed adjustment, and flight cancellation. The learned parameters in MAA3C are replaced with random values to compare the performance of trained models. Simulated training and test experiments performed on a small urban prototype and various combined use cases suggest the superiority of the MAA3C solution in resolving conflicts with complicated wind fields. And the generalization, scalability, and stability of the model are also demonstrated while applying the model to complex environments.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on investigating a parallel camera stabilizing manipulator with three angular degrees of freedom controlled by three linear actuators. An experimental setup is designed and manufactured to actively isolate the host vehicle&#39;s disturbing motions. The kinematic analysis of the manipulator combined with a controller is used to disturbance rejection coming from the base platform. Two inertia measurement units (IMU) are used for real-time feedback from the base and up-per platforms&#39; orientation. A Kalman filter is implemented for handling the noises and drifts of the IMUs data. Inverse kinematics of the manipulator is used for calculating the actuating commands and velocity control of the linear motors. The experimental results of the proposed camera stabilizing system are shown. The results indicate its good capability in following the reference input of the controller. Considering the closed kinematic chain of the system and its stiff parallel architecture, this system can be a good choice for the stabilizing system of ground and aerial vehicles.},

The advantage of the developed controller is to enhance the robustness of the control structure, while managing the computation costs, making it appropriate for real-time control developments. The developed controller is applied to the attitude control of a UAV, which is relatively a fast dynamical system. The effectiveness of the proposed IT2 TSK FLC is verified through a developed software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulator for a quadcopter UAV. Then, actual flight experiments are conducted. The performance of the UAV when using the developed IT2 TSK FLC iscompared with its performance when using a classical PID controller.},

The objective is the optimization of monitoring patrols with automated mobile agents that are responsible for the surveillance. Such agents are formed by automated guided vehicles or unmanned aerial vehicles that carry various sensors. Apart from the specificities of each class of agents, the proposed approach is motivated by the need to inspect sites that may be dangerous or difficult to access. The optimization of the missions is carried out in compliance with functional (e.g., precedence of the operations) and operational (e.g., the travel time reserve of the agents) constraints in the double perspective of patrol configuration and trajectory planning as far as these aspects are strongly correlated. The questions that should be answered are as follows. How many mobile agents are required to perform a given set of measurements? How many sensors and what types of sensors must each of these agents equip? How to define the mission and trajectory of each agent? Such questions are studied as a multi-robots / multi-tasks problem, and an approach based on the hybrid filtered beam search is proposed for that purpose.},

These papers are further analyzed in relation to several aspects besides teacher continuing education. We observe that project continuity is one of these aspects that is present in about half of the works. Nowadays, a growing on the pedagogical use of robotics is also observed in the education system of several countries. The works that are based on public policies supported by institutions at local or national levels turn out to be the ones that have more continuity as an effective training proposal. Further, from the observed projects, those that have implemented more consolidated educational practices for Educational Robotics are the ones that have a longer-term existence. Finally, our findings indicate that a focus on the use of robotics as a tool for trans-disciplinary contents is fast growing, overall. Roboticists allied with Educators play an important role in the process, as they are developing methodologies that allied with cutting edge techniques and materials are turning educational robotics into a very useful resource for enhancing the learning-teaching process.},

The device is composed of aluminous hubs, rubber tyres, and high-speed brushless motors. Besides, a ball-spin control method is implemented to pitch balls with target self-spins, which is based on the combined effects of three pitching wheels rotating at different speeds. In view of the device’s vibration caused by high-speed rotors, a vibration reduction method applicable to pitching wheels is proposed through correcting the position of the center of mass. The method weakens vibration easily with twice drilling operations. Furthermore, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

The following elements of the architecture are described, the connection with the environment, monitoring, the planning system, and the knowledge base of the system. In the main part, the article analyzes how the architecture generates plans from pre-established knowledge through ontologies and how it prioritizes certain plans over others. In this context, the structure within the ontologies is detailed, as well as their operation, how they can include relevant user information, and their assistance in generating plans. For the purpose of evaluating the architecture, the outcomes of two cases are presented in a virtual scenario and through a series of activities whose performance is examined in terms of time and priority.},

  abstract     = {Despite great achievements of reinforcement learning based works, those methods are known for their poor sample efficiency. This particular drawback usually means training agents in simulated environments is the only viable option, regarding time constraints. Furthermore, reinforcement learning agents have a strong tendency to overfit on their environment, observing a drastic loss of performances at test time. As a result, tying the agent logic to its current body may very well make transfer unefficient. To tackle that issue, we propose the Universal Notice Network (UNN) method to enforce separation of the neural network layers holding information to solve the task from those related to robot properties, hence enabling easier transfer of knowledge between entities. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method on a broad panel of applications, we consider different kinds of robots, with different morphological structures performing kinematic, dynamic single and multi-robot tasks. We prove that our method produces zero shot (without additionnal learning) transfers that may produce better performances than state-of-the art approaches and show that a fast tuning enhances those performances.},

This paper combines insights from the super-twisting algorithm and robot momentum observer to introduce an improved adaptive super-twisting momentum observer. It is for efficient external torque estimation in the case of a proprioceptive sensor (encoder) based only. The observer is based on a super-twisting momentum observer that first uses a Sigmoid function to reduce jitter. Then a proportional-integral observer structure is adopted to increase the observation speed. Finally, coping with real-time changeable external torque input through a constructed parameter adaptive law. The observer provides a quick and reliable estimation of external torque.

With the proposed approach, we accomplish tasks of detecting a touch between the actuator and an object, keeping the actuator in the compliant touch with the object and creating a map that visualizes objects in the operating space without any visual information.

However, existing path searching approaches overlook the influence of the tortuosity of the path, and trajectory generation methods usually ignore optimizing the time allocation. They both threaten the security and limit the efficiency of autonomous navigation. In this paper, we propose a SpatioTemporal motion planner with UNbending and conSistent awareness (STUNS-Planner) to generate a safe, feasible and efficient trajectory by reducing the tortuosity of the path and improving time allocation of the trajectory. At the path searching stage, the unbending-aware path searching algorithm is proposed to search a local safe and unbending path before the trajectory generation. At the trajectory generation, we propose a fast scaling time adjustment method that can rapidly improve the efficiency of the trajectory while ensuring feasibility. In addition, to ensure the consistency between sequential replanning trajectories, a consistency-aware trajectory preserving and connecting mechanism is designed. The planner is integrated into a fully autonomous navigation system on a quadrotor. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments verify the performance of our system in terms of safety, tortuosity (about 8%-13% lesser) and trajectory time (about 3%-8% shorter) compared with existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Generally unmanned aerial vehicles are currently equipped with multiple sensors to help them in their navigation. However, the acquisition of the position at every moment is a hard task to be achieved mainly in crowded scenarios where multiple obstacles make difficult the reception of signal coming from satellites (for global navigation systems) or base stations which perform the functions of anchors in some localization systems. Another issue in this kind of scenarios is the low probability to obtain redundancy systems due to the poor received signal associated to obstructions. For the case where there is only the minimum information required to estimate the position, the named radical axis Gauss Newton (RA-GN) algorithm was previously proposed and successfully evaluated by simulation. Now, in this paper, the RA-GN algorithm is applied to a localization system and evaluated experimentally from a measurement campaign conducted in a semi-forest test field. Moreover, we assess the effect of rotating the tag taken as the representation of the vehicle and found that this rotation introduces changes in the position estimation. All our results in terms of root mean square error are compared with those given by a commercial system. Results reported here show that the RA-GN algorithm is able to improve the accuracy of estimation of the commercial system in real conditions of crowded environments, even under complicated situations where the signal is perturbed by the obstacles and under different angular positions of the tag relative to the anchors.},

  abstract     = {Assistive robots have the potential to support older people and people with disabilities in various tasks so that they can live more independently. One of the research challenges is the appearance of assistive robots so that they are accepted by prospective users and encourage interaction. This scoping review aims to identify studies that report preferences in order to derive indicators for the embodiment of a robot with assistance functions. A systematic literature research was conducted in the three electronic databases IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and PubMed Central (PMC). Included papers date back not further than 2015 and report empirical studies about the preferred appearance of service robots. The search resulted in 1,760 papers. 29 were included, of which 20 papers reported quantitative studies, three described a qualitative and six a mixed-methods design. Out of these papers, seven categories of robot appearances and design components could be extracted. Most papers focused on humanoid or humanlike robots and components like facial features or gender aspects. Others relied on design that reflects the robot’s function or simulated emotions through light applications. Only eight studies focused on older adults, and no study on people with disabilities. The appearance of a humanoid robot is often described as favorable, but the definition of ‘humanoid’ varies widely within all analyzed studies and an explizit allocation of features is not possible. For their practical work, robot designers can extract various aspects from the papers; however, for generalization more research is necessary.},

  abstract     = {The aircraft conflict detection and resolution problem has been addressed with a wide range of centralised methods in the past few decades, e.g. constraint programming, mathematical programming or metaheuristics. In the context of autonomous, decentralized collision avoidance without explicit coordination, geometric methods provide an elegant, cost-effective approach to avoid collisions between mobile agents, provided they all share a same logic and a same view of the traffic. The Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm is a state-of-the art geometric method for robot collision avoidance, which can be used as a Detect &amp; Avoid logic on-board aircraft or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. However, ORCA does not handle well some degenerate situations where agents operate at constant or near-constant speeds, which is a widespread feature of commercial aircraft or fixed-winged Unmanned Airborne Systems. In such degenerate situations, pairs of aircraft could end up flying parallel tracks without ever crossing paths to reach their respective destination. The Constant Speed ORCA (CS-ORCA) was proposed in 2018 to better handle these situations. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of both ORCA and CS-ORCA, and introduce the Dual-Horizon ORCA (DH-ORCA) algorithm, where two time horizons are used respectively for short-term collision avoidance and medium-term path-crossing. We show that this new approach mitigates the main issues of ORCA and CS-ORCA and yields better performances with dense traffic scenarios.},

Our problem is comprised of two interconnected problems. In the first problem, we aim to find a reference density path for the multi-target system that the multi-agent network must track as a whole. In our proposed solution approach, the probability density of the multi-target system is represented as a Gaussian mixture density which is estimated by an adaptive Gaussian sum filter. The second problem seeks for the individual inputs that will make the agents follow the moving targets while avoiding collisions. To address the latter problem, we propose a control algorithm which is based on a variation of Lloyd’s algorithm that utilizes the Gaussian mixture density computed as part of the solution to the first problem and a modified Voronoi tessellation which is composed of the so-called Obstacle-Aware Voronoi Cells. Because the two sub-problems are interconnected, an iterative approach is proposed which combines their solutions to solve the multi-target tracking problem in a comprehensive and safe way. Finally, we provide simulation results to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In searching for the stable motion re-planning as required by autonomous quadrotors, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques play a vital role in balancing the reference trajectory tracking and flight safety. In this research, our intention amounts to improving the traditional DRL strategies in terms of the following two essential factors: 1). searching the best optimization without losing efficiency under the conditions of unstructured disturbances, e.g., continuously changing wind perturbation or slight collisions; 2). balancing the safety and flight aggressiveness according to the intensity of the wind disturbance and the complexity of the environment. To be specific, in caring about the prompt convergence, in the present study, the reference trajectory with a re-timing publication mechanism was well-adopted for providing reasonable initial parameters for the proposed DRL model, hence improving the optimization performance of DRL strategies and meeting the requirements of smooth flight actions. Furthermore, the problem of motion re-planning in different environments was formulated into a series of partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs). Correspondingly, a learned objective function was introduced into the model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework and a MAML algorithm with mixed objective function (OMAML) was proposed for solving raised POMDPs while simultaneously enhancing the present method with the ability to balance flight aggressiveness and safety. Finally, sufficient simulation experiments were conducted in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods both in trajectory tracking and collision avoidance tasks, so as to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This study shows specific benefits achieved for K-12 students in an individualized family service plan/resource teachers for the gifted model based on a review. A simulator is typically adopted for undergraduates students to increase their ability to make technical-based decisions and move smoothly between the real and virtual worlds, with a strong emphasis on the feedback from both. It enables students to develop abilities to build robots without needing commercial kits. In a sim-to-real approach, early simulation allows improved team integration and reduced reliance on skills, equalizing the abilities of students, regardless of their backgrounds.

The Gap Based Elastic Trees (GET) algorithm proposed in this paper, combines some features of popular algorithms in path planning, obstacle avoidance, and path smoothing, and outperforms popular obstacle avoidance approaches designed for cluttered environments, also paving the way for the use of path planners in real-time applications. The design steps of GET consists of the following steps: gap calculation, smooth path generation and trajectory planning. Even though the GET method is an obstacle avoidance method, to demonstrate its efficiency we compared with offline version of base planner (RRT) of GET and a well-known shortest path algorithm (A*). The results demonstrate that, in most cases, the GET method guides the robot on almost the shortest routes with no requirement of an environment map. The GET algorithm also outperforms the obstacle avoidance methods with proven success in cluttered environments in terms of speed and safety. Further analysis was done to see the performance of the GET method in real world scenarios. These tests both validated simulation results and revealed that GET algorithm has more smooth trajectories than the most successful alternative. Overall, the improved performance of GET can be attributed to its predictive feature, and capability to plan ahead. Additionally, GET method can be adapted both robotic and autonomous car navigation tasks.},

Due to the non-holonomic restriction in the kinematic model, a switched control scheme is designed with two control laws avoiding singularities and a smooth transition between the control inputs. The approach is the base for the coverage control needed for mobile sensor networks where the wireless nodes installed at the top of the robots must converge to desired power level values. Also, the RSSI measurement can be considered as an alternative to inter-robot distances avoiding the use of traditional sensors like LiDAR or onboard cameras.

  abstract     = {To simulate the complex and continuous undulation of fishtail in nature, the method of adopting the discrete Multi-Joint mechanism requires a certain number of degrees of freedom, which results in the complexities of mechanism and control necessarily. Compared with Multi-Joint, flexible tail is a better scheme due to continuum, robustness, and simpler control. Hence, this paper proposes a wire-driven elastic robotic fish with flexible tail, which simulates fish muscle through multi-wire drive and adopts a fishlike spine design based on elastic component. Due to these distinctive designs, our robotic fish not only realizes the compliant simulation of fishlike swimming gait, but also owns higher bionic degree. Further, the kinematics model and speed estimation model of the wire-driven elastic robotic fish are developed, and the error between the body wave and the desired fishlike swimming gait is further optimized so as to determine the appropriate parameters of central pattern generator. The results show that the optimized body wave of fishtail matches well with the desired fishlike swimming gait and the RMSE of the stable swimming speed between simulations and experiments is 0.045 m/s, which validates the proposed model and optimization method. Finally, the relationships between the frequency and swimming speed under small amplitude are explored, from which we find that amplitude has a greater impact on speed than frequency at high frequency, and the maximum swimming speed of about 0.54 m/s, i.e., 1.02 BL/s, is obtained.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, various thermal management designs are explored for robotic operation in extreme temperature environments, which includes options for component and chip level electronics heating/cooling like TIM’s, heat sinks, heat spreader, insulation material, and PCM’s. Furthermore, other active/passive thermal management systems are investigated, such as Heat pipes, Loop Heat Pipes (LHP), and Capillary Pump Loop (CPL) developed by NASA, Fuzzy Logic and PID temperature control methods. Some of the thermal management design challenges faced by the heat pipes, LHP, and CPL devices are decrease in the heating/cooling efficiency with abrupt drop in temperatures, costly equipment, high power consumption, and increase in the overall weight of the robot due to several components. With the limited space available inside the robot design, it requires the use of minimal hardware. A Fuzzy Logic temperature controller is considered for the mobile robot to overcome all the aforementioned thermal challenges. A Fuzzy Logic control system is designed and tested in a simulation environment using a flow simulation software; Ansys Fluent, to authenticate its ability to minimize power consumption by controlling the amount of power supplied to the fan/heater based on the current temperature reading from the sensor, a set-point temperature, and if–then based logical rule-base. The heating/cooling simulation setup consists of four heating units located at different locations inside the robot body and two miniature fans. Moreover, three outlets are included on the wall opposite to the fans for the cooling setup. The opening/closing of the outlets is contingent to the temperature inside the robot and will allow the excess heat to escape the robot&#39;s body. Based on the internal flow simulation results, the Fuzzy Logic controller setup was able to increase the extreme low temperature of – 40° C to the desired temperature of 8° C in a total time of 80 s and with a maximum power of 10 W for each heating unit and fans rotating at 1800 rpm for air circulation. However, the power output was minimized by the Fuzzy Logic controller as the internal temperature approached closer to the desired temperature. Moreover, an extreme high temperature of 50° C was decreased rapidly to 8° C in a total time of 12 s with the pressure outlet and inner wall temperatures lower than 15° C. However, in a situation where the initial temperature of the pressure outlet and inner wall are the same as the internal air temperature, the electronics can be cooled by the fans through the forced convection method.},

In this regard, knee orthosis plays a vital role to enliven the patients having issues related to knee movements. There exist a few designs of orthotic devices in the literature. However, these are yet to be made more compact and energy efficient. In this study, a novel optimal design of an energy-economic knee orthosis has been obtained. To serve this purpose, an efficient and intelligent optimization algorithm, namely Self-adaptive Bonobo Optimizer (SaBO), has been developed with the inclusion of memory, past experiences, and novel repulsion-based learning for the parameters’ updating. To examine the performance of the proposed SaBO, initially, thirty difficult-to-solve CEC’14 benchmark functions have been solved and the obtained results are found to be the better compared to that of other six recently developed optimization techniques. Next, it has been applied to solve the complex knee-orthosis design problem. Here, the optimal design of knee-orthosis yielded by the developed SaBO is seen to be the most energy-efficient one. It is to be noted that the required maximum motor torque is found to be decrease up to 22% compared to that obtained using other optimization tools.},

We focus on three main aspects: (i) egocentric computer vision based motion control to provide a natural human-robot interface to wheelchair users with impaired hand usage; (ii) techniques that enable user to initiate autonomous navigation to a location, object or person without use of the hands; and (iii) a framework that learns to navigate the wheelchair according to its user’s, often subjective, criteria and preferences. These contributions are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in user studies with several subjects demonstrating their effectiveness. These studies have been conducted with healthy subjects, but they still indicate that clinical tests of the proposed technology can be initiated.},
