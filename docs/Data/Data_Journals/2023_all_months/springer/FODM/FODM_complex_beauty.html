  abstract     = {In recent years, the researches on parameter estimation of uncertain differential equations have developed significantly. However, when we deal with some nonparametric uncertain differential equations, the parameter estimation may not be used directly. To deal with these uncertain differential equations, it is important to consider the nonparametric estimation with the help of the observations. As an important branch of uncertain differential equation, autonomous uncertain differential equation may be properly applied to model some uncertain autonomous dynamic systems. In this paper, we propose a Legendre polynomial based method for the nonparametric estimation of autonomous uncertain differential equations. After that, some numerical examples are given and the residuals as well as uncertain hypothesis tests are used to prove the acceptability of these estimations. In application, we consider an atmospheric carbon dioxide model by the proposed method of nonparametric estimation.},

Some people believe that vaccination is the best way to prevent this disease, while others disagree. Society’s attitudes toward vaccination can be influenced by a variety of factors such as misunderstanding, ambiguity, lack of knowledge. The proposed study’s goal is to better understand people’s attitudes regarding vaccination by focusing on key topics related to COVID-19 anti-vaccine tweets. Tweets are obtained over a period based on the number of COVID-19 cases by utilizing the “anti-vaccine” keyword rather than the “vaccine” keyword. Furthermore, in addition to people perceptions and attitudes toward anti-vaccination, the causal relationship between each topic is investigated. As a result, latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), fuzzy association rule mining (FARM), fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), and fuzzy c-means are used to conduct a complete study. Topics are analyzed independently using clustering and scenario analysis. The findings demonstrate the most common topics in anti-vaccination tweets, as well as the influence of each topic on the others.},

To this goal, we present in this paper a two-steps EMS in order to control the different operations of a micro-grid (MG). In the first step, we exploit the advantages of the Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) deep learning model to predict the next daily electricity price based on time series. In the second step, we use a type-2 fuzzy logic controller to decide which energy source will exploit the excess energy produced or meet the MG need. Real data is used in this paper to test the effectiveness of the proposed EMS whose superiority is proved through the test period. The BiLSTM forecasting model better performs compared to other related algorithms designed to the electricity price prediction. In addition, the proposed decision-making process can reduce the total MG cost and protect the batteries against the deep discharge and maximum charge in order to prolong their lifespan. We expect that this work can contribute to meet the real-world needs in the management of the electrical system.},

However, the data obtained in practice are sometimes imprecise, in which classical support vector machines fail in these situations. In order to handle such cases, this paper employs uncertain variables to describe imprecise observations and further proposes a hard margin uncertain support vector machine for the problem with imprecise observations. Specifically, we first define the distance from an uncertain vector to a hyperplane and give the concept of a linearly α-separable data set. Then, based on maximum margin criterion, we propose an uncertain support vector machine for the linearly α-separable data set, and derive the corresponding crisp equivalent forms. New observations can be classified through the optimal hyperplane derived from the model. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the uncertain support vector machine.},

To this matter, suitable technology and formulation for the DEA are proposed using arithmetic and partial orders for interval numbers. The inverse DEA is discussed from the following question: if the output of $$DMU_o$$ increases from $$Y_o$$ to $$\beta _o$$ , such the new DMU is given by $$(\alpha _o^*,\beta )$$ belongs to the technology, and its inefficiency score is not less than t-percent, how much should the inputs of the DMU increase? A new model of inverse DEA is offered to respond to the previous question, whose interval Pareto solutions are characterized using the Pareto solution of a related multiple-objective nonlinear programming (MONLP). Necessary and sufficient conditions for input estimation are proposed when output is increased.

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges in the security of energy supply in modern power systems is the frequency deviation. Appearance of an imbalance between the demand and supply of electrical energy is the main reason for any change in the frequency level of the grid. Thus, the Load Frequency Control (LFC) operation is usually performed automatically to restore the stability in the frequency level of the system. LFC has been studied with different controllers previously. However, this study concentrates on proposing a new configuration for the Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to be implemented in the modeling of a test two-area power system under two different operational conditions and challenges to analyze its performance. A Third-Order Fermat Curve-based Fuzzy Inference System (TOFC-FIS) is designed for the FLC with the aim of optimizing the performance of type-I FLCs in the LFC application. The motive for this study was to mathematize the FIS of FLC to prepare a basis for further performance enhancement using optimization algorithms. Thus, the proposed FIS is optimized using a Neural Network (NN) to create an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System for the FLC in the studied scenarios. The results of typical and NN-trained TOFC-FIS-based FLC illustrate the considerable improvement in performance indexes of LFC in two-area power systems compared to both conventional and intelligent control methods.},

The increasing rise of infectious medical waste has now become a serious problem. This paper presents a multi-period multi-objective model for designing a medical waste management system during the COVID-19 pandemic. The model aims to reduce total costs of infectious medical waste management while also reducing the environmental impact of treatment centers, disposal centers, and transportation. It also aims to maximize the suitability of treatment technology based on social considerations and reduce the risk associated with processing and transporting COVID-19 waste. Different strategic and operational decisions are taken into account that include the selection of treatment technologies, the location of treatment and disposal centers, the flow of generated medical waste between facilities, and the number of vehicles required for the medical waste transport. The model tackles the uncertainty associated with model parameters, and it uses a credibility-based possibilistic programming method to deal with uncertainties. The suggested model is solved using an interactive fuzzy programming method and the importance of social indicators for selecting treatment technology is determined using the fuzzy best–worst approach. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated by a practical case study in Shiraz, Iran. The numerical results can help system designers to achieve the most suitable trade-off between the sustainability goals and the safety viewpoint.},

Retrieving 1004 journal articles from the Web of Science database between 2008 and 2019, and utilizing CiteSpace and Pajek software, we analyze the publications per year and by geographical distribution, productive scholars and their cooperation, key journals, highly cited articles and main paths of the field. In this way, seven key sub-fields of uncertainty theory and their research potential are derived. The results show the following: (1) The literature on uncertainty theory follows a linear growth trend, involves an extensive network of 1000 scholars worldwide and is published in 300 journals, indicating thus that uncertainty theory has become increasingly attractive, and its academic influence is gradually expanding. (2) Seven key sub-fields of uncertainty theory have clearly been identified, including the axiomatic system, uncertain programming, uncertain sets, uncertain logic, uncertain differential equations, uncertain risk analysis, and uncertain processes. Among them, uncertain differential equations and programming are the two main sub-fields with the largest numbers of published papers. Furthermore, for evaluating the research potential of sub-fields, maturity and recent attention indicators are calculated using the citations, total number of publications, quantity of most cited literature and half-life. Based on these indicators, uncertain processes shows the greatest development potential, and has remained a hot topic in recent years, being mainly concentrated on the uncertain renewal reward process, optimal control of discrete-time uncertain systems, and uncertain linear quadratic optimal control. Additionally, uncertain risk analysis is ranked second, and focuses on the analysis of expected losses, investment risk, and structural reliability of uncertain systems.},

As the uncertainty measures of PLTSs, entropy and cross-entropy are the important decision-making tools. Generally speaking, the uncertainty of PLTSs can be studied from two facets, which are known as hesitancy and fuzziness. To better reflect these uncertainties, some hybrid entropy and cross-entropy measures of PLTSs are developed in this work. It is shown that the hybrid entropy measures are simple in structure, clear in physical meaning and strong in discriminating ability, while the hybrid cross-entropy measures can avoid the design flaws of existing measures and possess natural symmetry. It is also shown that the hybrid entropy and cross-entropy measures can be designed in pairs, mutually supportive and inherently unified as the uncertainty measures. In the ends, a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) model, based on these uncertainty measures of PLTSs, is developed within the famous TOPSIS framework to select the best cloud computing platform.},

The influence of external environmental disturbance on the system is considered by means of a special uncertain process (Liu process). Then based on uncertainty theory and Hurwicz criterion, the optimization model is built, where control variables are restricted to an admissible control set. In addition, uncertain differential equation is used to describe the changes of inventory. By applying the optimality equation, we determine the optimal price and production strategy to maximize profit. Besides, both the optimal price and production rate are linearly decreasing with inventory. Afterwards, two numerical examples are given, the results reveal that reducing the uncertain disturbance of inventory and expanding the potential market size are beneficial to improving the optimal profit. Moreover, risk-loving decision makers can gain more profits while facing large risks.},

  abstract     = {In Bayesian rule an unknown parameter is thought to be a quantity whose variation can be characterized by a prior distribution. Then some data are observed from a population whose distribution function is indexed by the unknown parameter and then the prior distribution is updated according to the observed data. The updated prior distribution is named as the posterior distribution. Based on uncertainty theory, this paper first makes a connection between posterior uncertainty distribution and likelihood function, and proposes a new method to obtain the posterior uncertainty distribution from the prior uncertainty distribution with given observed data. Some examples with special uncertainty distributions are employed to explain the calculation. Furthermore, an uncertain urn problem is provided to illustrate the application of the new method.},

  abstract     = {Interval linguistic term (ILT) is highly useful to express decision-makers’ (DMs’) uncertain preferences in the decision-making process. This paper proposes a new group decision-making (GDM) method with interval linguistic fuzzy preference relations (ILFPRs) by integrating ordinal consistency improvement algorithm, cooperative game, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) cross-efficiency model, and stochastic simulation. Firstly, the ordinal consistency of ILFPR is developed. For improving the ordinal consistency of an ILFPR, a two-stage integer optimization model is presented to derive an ILFPR with ordinal consistency. Then, a weight-determination method for obtaining DMs’ weights is presented based on cooperative games. Moreover, a DEA cross-efficiency model is presented to obtain the priorities of linguistic preference relation derived from ILFPR. Meanwhile, the expected ranking vector of ILFPR is obtained based on the DEA cross-efficiency model by integrating stochastic preference analysis and Monte Carlo stochastic simulation. Finally, a numerical example of emergency logistics selection illustrates the applicability and credibility of the proposed method.},

Compare to traditional multi-input single-output in the T–S fuzzy model, we extend single-output fuzzy rules to multi-dimensional output fuzzy rules, which has the advantage that all multi-dimensional outputs share the same premise parameter; Then the joint block structure sparse ridge regression model is used to realize the identification of the consequent parameter, which provides a regression model. In this model, some regression coefficient blocks with small contribution will be reduced to zero accurately, while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Otherwise, the Fuzzy Expectation Maximization (FEM) is proposed to coarse fine the premise parameter. Finally, the variable structure T–S fuzzy model is applied to the maneuvering target tracking without filter. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is more accurate and stable than the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM), Interacting Multiple Model Unscented Kalman Filtering (IMMUKF), Interacting Multiple Model Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filtering (IMMRBPF) and T–S Fuzzy semantic Model (TS-FM) algorithms in dealing with uncertain problems in nonlinear maneuvering target tracking systems.},

In this paper, we propose an integrated two-stage multiple criteria programming approach to solve them systematically. The approach includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses. In the first stage, an MULTIMOORA method based on linguistic Z-Numbers is employed to rank the green suppliers under multiple qualitative criteria (but that is not the final decision). In the second stage, the ranking result is input to a bi-objective non-linear integer programming model. The model then determines the suppliers selected and the quantity of order allocated to them. Furthermore, the model should determine the configuration of the productions because different configuration implies different resource needed. We present the comparative result with other quantitative methods. An illustrative example proves that our proposed model can achieve the desired consistency among objectives.},

Then the servers could be ordered according to their evaluation scores. Some interesting properties of the evaluation score vector are investigated. Applying our proposed evaluation model, we further construct an equivalence relation, based on which the complete solution set of the fuzzy relation inequalities could be divided into several equivalence classes. In such classification, each equivalence class corresponds to a unique evaluation score vector.

The three-way decisions offer a novel study perspective to solve this problem. Then the developed model is applied to select the investment projects. Firstly, some relevant attributes of the project are described with the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. And a double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic information system is constructed for each project. Secondly, the weights of attributes are determined with the Choquet integral method. And the closeness degree calculated by Choquet-based bi-projection method is taken as the conditional probability that the project will be profitable. Next, considering the influence of the bounded rationality of decision makers, the threshold parameters are calculated based on prospect theory. Finally, the decision results about investment projects during four stages are deduced based on the principle of maximum-utility, which demonstrates the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

In this paper, we propose a novel method to form the hierarchical Choquet integral (HCI) as an explainable AI to retain the model&#39;s accuracy and explainability. To achieve this purpose, we first adopted neuroevolution, which combines a genetic algorithm (GA) and a neural network (NN), and pruned weights to obtain information about the hierarchical decomposition of the Choquet integral. We then fine-tuned the weights of the HCI model for the classification problem. In addition, we use four datasets to illustrate the proposed algorithm and compare the results with the conventional classifiers: decision tree, deep learning, and support vector machine (SVM). The empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms others in terms of accuracy, and keeps the Choquet integral&#39;s explainable property, justifying this paper&#39;s contribution.},

  abstract     = {It is very common to use linguistic information to solve decision-making problems in real life, and the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (DHHFLTS) has been widely used because of its powerful ability of expressing complex linguistic information. There is no doubt that the comparison method of double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements (DHHFLEs) not only occupies an important theoretical and practical position, but also is the basis for further study of DHHFLTSs. However, the existing comparison methods of DHHFLEs still have some limitations. Therefore, this paper proposes a new DHHFLE comparison method, which is an improvement and perfection of the existing DHHFLE comparison methods. In addition, considering that the current research on distance and similarity measures of DHHFLEs is mostly based on the algebraic point of view, this paper proposes a cosine similarity measure of DHHFLEs, which fills the gap in the study of distance and similarity measures from the geometric point of view. Then, the cosine similarity-based DHHFL-ELECTRE II method is proposed to solve the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem in the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic environment. Finally, this method is used to solve a MADM problem in the performance evaluation of financial logistics enterprises. The results show that the proposed method has certain applicability and feasibility.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the definitions of Clarke generalized directional $$\alpha $$ -derivative and Clarke generalized gradient are introduced for a locally Lipschitz fuzzy function. Further, a nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem with fuzzy objective function and both inequality and equality constraints is considered. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions are established for such a nonsmooth extremum problem. For proving these conditions, the approach is used in which, for the considered nonsmooth fuzzy optimization problem, its associated bi-objective optimization problem is constructed. The bi-objective optimization problem is solved by its associated scalarized problem constructed in the weighting method. Then, under invexity hypotheses, (weakly) nondominated solutions in the considered nonsmooth fuzzy minimization problem are characterized through Pareto solutions in its associated bi-objective optimization problem and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the weighting problem.},
