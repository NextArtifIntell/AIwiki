  abstract     = {Hand gestures are widely used in human-to-human and human-to-machine communication. Therefore, hand gesture recognition is a topic of great interest. Hand gesture recognition is closely related to pattern recognition, where overfitting can occur when there are many predictors relative to the size of the training set. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors through feature selection techniques. In addition, the need for portability in hand gesture recognition systems limits the use of deep learning algorithms. In this sense, a study of feature selection and extraction methods is proposed for the use of traditional machine learning algorithms. The feature selection methods analyzed are: maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (MRMR), Sequential, neighbor component analysis without parameters (NCAsp), neighbor component analysis with parameters (NCAp), Relief-F, and decision tree (DT). We also analyze the behavior of feature selection methods using classification and recognition accuracy and processing time. Feature selection methods were fed through seventeen feature extraction functions, which return a score proportional to its importance. The functions are then ranked according to their scores and fed to machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT). This work demonstrates that all feature selection methods evaluated on ANN provide better accuracy. In addition, the combination and number of feature extraction functions influence the accuracy and processing time.},

  abstract     = {Redundant nodes in a kernel incremental extreme learning machine (KI-ELM) increase ineffective iterations and reduce learning efficiency. To address this problem, this study established a novel improved hybrid intelligent deep kernel incremental extreme learning machine (HI-DKIELM), which is based on a hybrid intelligent algorithm and a KI-ELM. First, a hybrid intelligent algorithm was established based on the artificial transgender longicorn algorithm and multiple population gray wolf optimization methods to reduce the parameters of hidden layer neurons and then to determine the effective number of hidden layer neurons. The learning efficiency of the algorithm was improved through the reduction of network complexity. Then, to improve the classification accuracy and generalization performance of the algorithm, a deep network structure was introduced to the KI-ELM to gradually extract the original input data layer by layer and realize high-dimensional mapping of data. The experimental results show that the number of network nodes of HI-DKIELM algorithm is obviously reduced, which reduces the network complexity of ELM and greatly improves the learning efficiency of the algorithm. From the regression and classification experiments, its CCPP can be seen that the training error and test error of the HI-DKIELM algorithm proposed in this paper are 0.0417 and 0.0435, which are 0.0103 and 0.0078 lower than the suboptimal algorithm, respectively. On the Boston Housing database, the average and standard deviation of this algorithm are 98.21 and 0.0038, which are 6.2 and 0.0003 higher than the suboptimal algorithm, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Since the advent of $$\textit{JSON}$$ as a popular format for exchanging large amounts of data, a novel category of NoSQL database systems, named $$\textit{JSON}$$ document stores, has emerged for storing $$\textit{JSON}$$ data sets; in fact, these novel databases are able to natively manage collections of $$\textit{JSON}$$ documents. To help analysts and data engineers query and integrate $$\textit{JSON}$$ data sets persistently saved in $$\textit{JSON}$$ document stores, the J-CO Framework has been developed (at the University of Bergamo, Italy): it is built around a novel query language, named J-CO-QL $$^{+}$$ , that provides sophisticated features, including soft-querying capabilities. However, J-CO-QL $$^{+}$$ (as the other languages for querying $$\textit{JSON}$$ data sets) is designed to be general purpose; consequently, it can be cumbersome for users to apply it on specific data formats. This is the case of GeoJSON, a specific and popular $$\textit{JSON}$$ data format that is designed to represent geographical information layers. This paper presents the latest evolution of GeoSoft, a novel high-level “domain-specific language” that is specifically designed to express complex queries on the GeoJSON documents, including soft-queries. GeoSoft is inspired to the classical SQL language, so as to reduce the learning curve of potential users. GeoSoft queries are translated into J-CO-QL $$^{+}$$ scripts, to be actually executed.},

Brain storm optimization (BSO) is a relatively new paradigm of swarm intelligence algorithm that has been shown to be effective in solving global optimization problems, but it has not been fully exploited for multimodal optimization problems. A simple control strategy for the step size parameter in BSO cannot meet the need of optima finding task in multimodal landscapes and can possibly be refined and optimized. In this paper, we propose an adaptive BSO (ABSO) algorithm that adaptively adjusts the step size parameter according to the quality of newly created solutions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a set of multimodal optimization problems to evaluate the performance of ABSO and the experimental results show that ABSO outperforms existing BSO algorithms and some recently developed algorithms. BSO has great potential in multimodal optimization and is expected to be useful for solving real-world optimization problems that have multiple optimal solutions.},

Heap-based optimizer (HBO) is a modern human social behavior-influenced algorithm that has been presented as an effective method to solve nonlinear programming problems. One of the difficulties that faces HBO is that it falls into locally optimal solutions and does not reach the global solution. To recompense the disadvantages of such modern algorithm, we integrate a heap-based optimizer with a chaotic search to reach the global optimization for nonlinear programming problems. The proposed algorithm displays the advantages of both modern techniques. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is inspected on a wide scale of different 42 problems including unimodal, multi-modal test problems, and CEC-C06 2019 benchmark problems. The comprehensive results have shown that the proposed algorithm effectively deals with nonlinear programming problems compared with 11 highly cited algorithms in addressing the tasks of optimization. As well as the rapid performance of the proposed algorithm in treating nonlinear programming problems has been proved as the proposed algorithm has taken less time to find the global solution.},

In this study, a method for simulating anomalous samples is designed. First, for the object category, patch extraction and patch paste are designed to ensure that the extracted image patches come from the objects and are pasted to the objects in the image. Second, based on the statistical analysis of various anomalies’ presence, a combination of data augmentation is proposed to cover various anomalies as much as possible. The method is evaluated on MVTec AD and BTAD datasets; the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an overall detection AUC of 97.6% in MVTec AD datasets, outperforming the baseline by 1.5%, and the improvement over VT-ADL method is 4.3% on the BTAD datasets, demonstrating our method’s effectiveness and generalization.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused drastic fluctuations in the economies of various countries. Meanwhile, the governments’ ability to save the economy depends on how banks provide credit to troubled companies. Therefore, the impact of the epidemic on bank credit and inclusive finance are worth exploring. However, most of the existing studies focus on the reform of the financial and economic system, only paying attention to the theoretical mechanism analysis and effect adjustment, scant data support, and insufficient scheme landing. At the same time, with the rise and rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, all walks of life have introduced it into real scenes for multi-source heterogeneous big data analysis and decision-making assistance. Therefore, we first take the Chinese mainland as an example in this paper. By studying the impact of the epidemic on bank credit preference and the mechanism of inclusive finance, we can provide objective decision-making basis for the financial system in the post-epidemic era to better flow credit funds into various entities and form a new perspective for related research. Then, we put forward a model based on Bi-directional Long Short-term Memory Network (BiLSTM) and Attention Mechanism to predict the number of newly diagnosed cases during the COVID-19 pandemic every day. It is not only suitable for COVID-19 pandemic data characterized by time series and nonlinearity, but also can adaptively select the most relevant input data by introducing an Attention Mechanism, which can solve the problems of huge calculation and inaccurate prediction results. Finally, through experiments and empirical research, we draw the following conclusions: (1) The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will promote enterprises to increase credit. (2) Banks provide more credit to large enterprises. (3) The epidemic has different impacts on credit in different regions, with the most significant one on central China. (4) Banks tend to provide more credit to manufacturing industries under the epidemic. (5) Digital inclusive finance plays a (positive) regulating effect on bank credit in COVID-19 pandemic. Inspired by the research results, policymakers can consider further solving the information asymmetry and strengthening the construction of a credit system, and more direct financial support policies for enterprises should be adopted. (6) By adopting the COVID-19 prediction model based on the BiLSTM-Attention network to accurately predict the epidemic situation in the COVID-19 pandemic, it can provide an important basis for the formulation of epidemic prevention and control policies.},

The results showed that: (1) financial shared service centers can significantly promote the improvement of corporate value. (2) Digital transformation can promote the establishment and development of financial sharing service centers, thus promoting the improvement of corporate value. (3) The effects of FSSC and digital transformation are characterized by heterogeneity. The worth of financial shared service centers for non-state-owned and manufacturing companies is substantial. Digital transformation has a noteworthy positive moderating effect on them but has no considerable moderating effect on state-owned and non-manufacturing companies. The government ought to bolster policy direction, keep up the digital transformation of businesses, and aid them in achieving rapid financial transformation; senior executives should remain cognizant of their strategic position and strive to execute a satisfactory job of both internal and external coordination, as the research findings suggest.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the shortcomings of seagull optimization algorithm in the process of searching for optimization, such as slow convergence speed, low precision, easy falling into local optimal, and performance dependent on the selection of parameters, this paper proposes an improved gull optimization algorithm based on multi-strategy fusion based on the analysis of gull population characteristics. Firstly, L–C cascade chaotic mapping is used to initialize the population so that seagulls are more evenly distributed in the initial solution space. Secondly, to improve the algorithm’s global exploration ability in the early stage, the nonlinear convergence factor is incorporated to adjust the position of seagulls in the migration stage. At the same time, the group learning strategy was introduced after the population position update to improve the population quality and optimization accuracy further. Finally, in the late stage of the algorithm, the golden sine strategy of the Levy flight guidance mechanism is used to update the population position to improve the population’s diversity and enhance the local development ability of the algorithm in the late stage. To verify the optimization performance of the improved algorithm, CEC2017 and CEC2022 test suites are selected for simulation experiments, and box graphs are drawn. The test results show that the proposed algorithm has apparent convergence speed, accuracy, and stability advantages. The engineering case results demonstrate the proposed algorithm’s advantages in solving complex problems with unknown search spaces.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional network (GCN) is an effective tool for feature clustering. However, in the text classification task, the traditional TextGCN (GCN for Text Classification) ignores the context word order of the text. In addition, TextGCN constructs the text graph only according to the context relationship, so it is difficult for the word nodes to learn an effective semantic representation. Based on this, this paper proposes a text classification method that combines Transformer and GCN. To improve the semantic accuracy of word node features, we add a part of speech (POS) to the word-document graph and build edges between words based on POS. In the layer-to-layer of GCN, the Transformer is used to extract the contextual and sequential information of the text. We conducted the experiment on five representative datasets. The results show that our method can effectively improve the accuracy of text classification and is better than the comparison method.},

  abstract     = {Fetal heart monitoring during pregnancy plays a critical role in diagnosing congenital heart disease (CHD). A noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) provides additional clinical information for fetal heart monitoring. To date, the analysis of noninvasive fECG is challenging due to the cancellation of maternal QRS-complexes, despite significant advances in electrocardiography. Fetal QRS-complex is highly considered to measure fetal heart rate to detect some fetal abnormalities such as arrhythmia. In this study, we proposed a deep learning (DL) framework that stacked a convolutional layer and bidirectional long short-term memory for fetal QRS-complexes classification. The fECG signals are first preprocessed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to remove the noise or inferences. The following step beats and QRS-complex segmentation. The last step is fetal QRS-complex classification based on DL. In the experiment of Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013, this study achieved 100% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. A stacked DL model demonstrates an effective tool for fetal QRS-complex classification and contributes to clinical applications for long-term maternal and fetal monitoring.},

  abstract     = {The success requirement of managers’ progress, development and performance improvement lie in their attention to product variety and company effectiveness. Economies of scope (ES) examine the advantages of production or the services diversification of a company based on cost versus production by companies that produce the same products or services separately. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is known as a suitable method for evaluating ES and cost effectiveness. DEA models are introduced with certain input and output costs, while many companies and manufacturing industries in different sectors of production and service provision may not have accurate information on available costs and outputs because of calculation errors, old information, and multiple repeated measurements. The estimation DEA for ES and cost effectiveness are sensitive to changes, also some parameters, such as cost and price, are fluctuated. Therefore, it is a requirement to focus on the interval DEA. Our most important goals in this article are: (1) we develop new DEA models to measure the ES and cost effectiveness of decision-making units (DMUs) under data uncertainty. These models will become non-linear and non-convex models; hence, (2) we identify an appropriate range for ES and cost effectiveness of DMUs from the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints, allowing decision-makers can use the upper and lower limits or their combination depending on the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints, (3) we apply our developed models to assess the ES and cost-effectiveness performance of 24 institutions, considering data uncertainties that may affect the quality and reliability of the results. (4) The proposed models’ features have been analyzed, and the impact of interval data on cost effectiveness and ES has been evaluated. The application description of the proposed models for determining ES and cost effectiveness shows that a company can exhibit economies of scope without necessarily being Cost Effectiveness.},

With the huge growth of complex datasets from different sources in the last decade, new paradigms have emerged. Multiclustering is a new concept within clustering that attempts to simultaneously generate multiple clusters that are bound to be different from each other, allowing to analyze and discover hidden patterns in the dataset compared to single clustering methods. This paper presents a hybrid methodology based on an evolutionary approach with the concepts of hyperrectangle for multiclustering, called MultiCHCClust. The algorithm is applied in a post-processing stage and it improves the results obtained for a clustering algorithm with respect to the partitioning of the dataset and the optimization of the number of partitions, achieving a high degree of compactness and separation of the partitioned dataset as can be observed in a complete experimental study.},

This study focuses on extracting both basic and semantic textual features to supplement the traditionally used financial indicators. The main is to improve Chinese listed companies’ financial distress prediction (FDP). A unique paradigm is proposed in this study that combines financial and multi-type textual predictive factors, feature selection methods, classifiers, and time spans to achieve the optimal FDP. The frequency counts, TF-IDF, TextRank, and word embedding approaches are employed to extract frequency count-based, keyword-based, sentiment, and readability indicators. The experimental results prove that financial domain sentiment lexicons, word embedding-based readability analysis approaches, and the basic textual features of Management Discussion and Analysis can be important elements of FDP. Moreover, the finding highlights the fact that incorporating financial and textual features can achieve optimal performance 4 or 5 years before the expected baseline year; applying the RF-GBDT combined model can also outperform other classifiers. This study makes an innovative contribution, since it expands the multiple text analysis method in the financial text mining field and provides new findings on how to provide early warning signs related to financial risk. The approaches developed in this research can serve as a template that can be used to resolve other financial issues.},

Further, some reliable and feasible properties and results for derived work are also invented. Additionally, we also illustrate an application, called multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) scenario for evaluating some real-world problems with the help of discovered operators for showing the reliability and stability of the evaluated operators.

Also, in the design model, the first steps are taken by limiting the procedure to specific heights, and the input thrust that is provided for take up operation is kept to a minimum. Due to the improved altitudes, the velocity and acceleration units have been cranked up on purpose, making it possible to sidestep intact objects. In addition, Advanced Image Mapping Localization (AIML) is used to carry out the implementation process, which identifies stable sites at the correct rotation angle. Besides, Cyphal protocol integration improves the security of the data-gathering process by transmitting information gathered from sensing devices. The suggested system is put to the test across five different case studies, where the designed Unmanned aerial vehicle can able to detect 25 obstacles in the narrow paths in considered routs but existing approach can able to identify only 14 obstacle in the same routes.},

That is, questions can perceive context information in both directions, while reply sentences can only output one-way autoregressive. The above system improvements make the one-way generation of dialogue tasks more logical and reasonable, and the performance is better than the traditional dialogue system scheme. In consideration of the long-distance information weakness of absolute position coding, we put forward the improvement of relative position coding in theory, and verify it in subsequent experiments. In the transformer module, the calculation formula of self-attention is modified, and the relative position information is added to replace the absolute position coding of the position embedding layer. The performance of the modified model in BLEU, embedding average, grammatical and semantic coherence is ideal, to enhance long-distance attention.},

A representative HHA consists of two parts: the low-level and the high-level components. In the low-level component, we regard the surrogate-assisted technique as a type of search strategy and design the four search strategy archives: exploration strategy archive, exploitation strategy archive, surrogate-assisted estimation archive, and mutation strategy archive as low-level heuristics (LLHs), each archive contains one or more search strategies. Once the surrogate-assisted estimation archive is activated to generate the offspring individual, SEA-HHA first selects the dataset for model construction from three principles: All Data, Recent Data, and Neighbor, which correspond to the global and the local surrogate model, respectively. Then, the dataset is randomly divided into training and validation data, and the most accurate model built by polynomial regression (PR), support vector regression (SVR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR) cooperates with the infill sampling criterion is employed for solution estimation. In the high-level component, we design a random selection function based on the pre-defined probabilities to manipulate a set of LLHs. In numerical experiments, we compare SEA-HHA with six optimization techniques on 5-D, 10-D, and 30-D CEC2013 benchmark functions and three engineering optimization problems with only 1000 fitness evaluation times (FEs). The experimental and statistical results show that our proposed SEA-HHA has broad prospects for dealing with EOPs.},

The logistics distribution of the cold chain supply chain involves multiple distribution points, and the distance and time relationship between the distribution points are often not fully considered in the route planning, resulting in low distribution efficiency. The hierarchical algorithm model based on machine vision can solve the above problems to a certain extent. This paper takes two cold chain supply chain enterprises as the main research body, analyzes how to choose two kinds of COD and CCD sensors using machine vision, and the number of distribution vehicle scheduling. The simulation experiment was performed and at the end of the article it is summarized and discussed. According to the data sample, the two enterprises have the largest number of people satisfied with the supply chain logistics and distribution vehicle scheduling, but the number of people dissatisfied with enterprise A is 6 and 12% of the total. The number of people dissatisfied with enterprise B is 16 and 32% of the total number, It can be seen that although the number of people satisfied with the two enterprises is large, the number of people dissatisfied with enterprise B far exceeds that of enterprise A.

  abstract     = {It is a challenge to assemble an enormous amount of metagenome data in metagenomics. Usually, metagenome cluster sequence before assembly accelerates the whole process. In SpaRC, sequences are defined as nodes and clustered by a parallel label propagation algorithm (LPA). To address the randomness of label selection from the parallel LPA during clustering and improve the completeness of metagenome sequence clustering, Spark-based parallel label diffusion and label selection community detection algorithm is proposed in the paper to obtain more accurate clustering results. In this paper, the importance of sequence is defined based on the Jaccard similarity coefficient and its degree. The core sequence is defined as the one with the largest importance in its located community. Three strategies are formulated to reduce the randomness of label selection. Firstly, the core sequence label diffuses over its located cluster and becomes the initial label of other sequences. Those sequences that do not receive an initial label will select the sequence label with the highest importance in the neighbor sequences. Secondly, we perform improved label propagation in order of label frequency and sequence importance to reduce the randomness of label selection. Finally, a merge small communities step is added to increase the completeness of clustered clusters. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the randomness of label selection, improve the purity, completeness, and F-Measure and reduce the runtime of metagenome sequence clustering.},

  abstract     = {The traditional physical education (PE) teaching management system is usually controlled and managed by a single center, which cannot meet the diversified and personalized teaching needs. Therefore, the research of PE teaching management system based on multi-agent mode has become an important direction. The purpose of this paper was to discuss how to improve the effect and quality of PE teaching and enhance students&#39; learning enthusiasm and initiative through the design of multi-agent mode PE teaching management system. The PE teaching management system based on multi-agent mode provides more flexible and personalized teaching management services by utilizing the cooperation and interaction between agents, realizes the information exchange between teachers and students, provides real-time teaching feedback and evaluation, and promotes the sharing and collaboration of teaching resources. Therefore, the operating efficiency of the conventional physical education management system was the highest at 75% and the lowest at 67%, according to the experimental findings of this paper. The multi-agent model-based management system for physical education had a 95 percent maximum operating efficiency and an 88% minimum operational efficiency. The minimum difference between the two was 21%, and the maximum difference was 20%. It can be seen that the operation efficiency of the physical education management system based on the multi-agent model is more advantageous and more stable.},

  abstract     = {The sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is widely recognized for its efficacy in solving optimization problems, although it encounters challenges in striking a balance between exploration and exploitation. To improve these limitations, a novel model, termed the novel sine cosine algorithm (nSCA), is introduced. In this advanced model, the roulette wheel selection (RWS) mechanism and opposition-based learning (OBL) techniques are integrated to augment its global optimization capabilities. A meticulous evaluation of nSCA performance has been carried out in comparison with state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, including multi-verse optimizer (MVO), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), moth-flame optimization (MFO), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA), in addition to the original SCA. This comparative analysis was conducted across a wide array of 23 classical test functions and 29 CEC2017 benchmark functions, thereby facilitating a comprehensive assessment. Further validation of nSCA utility has been achieved through its deployment in five distinct engineering optimization case studies. Its effectiveness and relevance in addressing real-world optimization issues have thus been emphasized. Across all conducted tests and practical applications, nSCA was found to outperform its competitors consistently, furnishing more effective solutions to both theoretical and applied optimization problems.},

We propose a 3D human motion pose recognition method using deep contrastive learning and an improved Transformer. The improved Transformer removes noise between human motion RGB and depth images, addressing orientation correlation in 3D models. Two-dimensional (2D) pose features are extracted from de-noised RGB images using a kernel generation module in a graph convolutional network (GCN). Depth features are extracted from de-noised depth images. The 2D pose features and depth features are fused using a regression module in the GCN to obtain 3D pose recognition results. The results demonstrate that the proposed method captures RGB and depth images, achieving high recognition accuracy and fast speed. The proposed method demonstrates good accuracy in 3D human motion pose recognition.},

However, the positioning system is susceptible to interference from a variety of factors, which leads to increased positioning errors, thereby affecting the accuracy of unmanned vehicle positioning. An unmanned vehicle fusion positioning technology based on the &quot;5G + Beidou&quot; integrated positioning system was proposed. While using the &quot;5G + Beidou&quot; base station for positioning, the 3D point cloud image was fused, and the high-precision real-time positioning was carried out through the vehicle&#39;s autonomous navigation algorithm. This paper first analyzed the current situation and characteristics of GNSS technology and studied the key technologies and principles of the &quot;5G + Beidou&quot; integrated positioning system. Then, aiming at the difficulty of 5G base station deployment, the GNSS system parameter optimization scheme based on a multidimensional fusion structure was designed. Finally, in the experiment, it was verified that the fusion system could achieve higher precision positioning results compared with traditional single-dimensional GNSS and multi-dimensional GNSS. The technical advantages of &quot;5G + Beidou&quot; were used for data fusion processing of unmanned vehicles, and a positioning method based on the combination of 3D point cloud image and high-precision map was proposed. Through some experiments, it was concluded that the fusion location method could control the error below 0.1, which showed the accuracy of the fusion location.},

This newly proposed PF distance measure not only satisfies the four properties of metric space, but also has good differentiation. Numerical example and pattern recognition are used to compare the proposed PF distance measure with some existing PF distance measures to illustrate that the new PF distance has effectiveness and superiority. Then, we develop a maximum deviation method in association with the proposed distance measure to evaluate the weight of the attribute with picture fuzzy information in the MADM problem. Subsequently, a new MADM method is proposed under picture fuzzy environment, which is on the basis of new PF distance measure and the compromise ranking of alternatives from distance to ideal solution (CRADIS) method. Finally, we furnish an illustrative example and perform a comparative analysis with various decision-making methods to confirm the validity and practicability of the improved MADM method.},

This study aimed to propose a radial load identification method for rubber-tired vehicles based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). Considering a priori information of the radial load data of tires and based on the observability of the vehicle vibration system, the proposed method selected feature sets and then retained the effective feature subsets through feature selection to construct samples with multiple time steps as input and with a single time step as output for network training. In doing so, the load prediction results were obtained, and the theoretical model was modified by integrating prediction accuracy, generalization performance, and robustness. Compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed method could effectively reduce the error of load identification, improve adaptability under different operating conditions, and handle the measurement error of different noise levels, which are of practical application value in the engineering field.},

  abstract     = {Due to environmental conditions, such as rainy days, foggy days, and dim lighting, objects in visible light images are not prominently displayed, leading to an easy loss of targets during tracking. In recent years, many RGB visible light trackers have achieved significant success in addressing visual tracking challenges. However, these trackers perform poorly when tracking targets under special conditions, such as occlusions and low-light scenarios. In contrast, objects in thermal infrared images are more distinct in poor lighting conditions. Given this characteristic, researchers have shown increased interest in the development of trackers that combine thermal infrared and visible light imagery. However, some mainstream RGBT (red–green–blue and thermal) algorithms, such as MANET and ADNET, are based on the anchor-based theory, requiring consideration of anchor box sizes and introducing a substantial number of hyperparameters. This can lead to suboptimal performance when tracking dynamically changing targets. Moreover, these models rely on convolutional neural networks for feature extraction, which have limitations in capturing global features. In this paper, we introduce a novel training network model called DAPAT, which combines the anchor-free concept with Transformer theory. DAPAT differs from previous models in several ways. Specifically, we have designed a straightforward model to extract precise global features from template and search images. We have also incorporated two enhancement modules into the model to improve template and search images of different sizes while suppressing the impact of non-target images. We employ a dual-stream feature fusion network to reduce the loss of image feature information due to feature correlation operations. Finally, we compare the performance of the tracking model proposed in this paper with some advanced RGBT trackers on three data sets (RGBT234, RGBT210, and GTOT). The test results demonstrate that our tracker exhibits improvements in robustness and success rate, among other performance aspects.},

  abstract     = {Sleep apnea is a common disorder that can cause pauses in breathing and can last from a few seconds to several minutes, as well as shallow breathing or complete cessation of breathing. Obstructive sleep apnea is strongly associated with the risk of developing several heart diseases, including coronary heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. In addition, obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk of developing irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), which can lead to low blood pressure. To prevent these conditions, this study presents a novel machine-learning (ML) model for predicting sleep apnea based on electronic health data that provides accurate predictions and helps in identifying the risk factors that contribute to the development of sleep apnea. The dataset used in the study includes 75 features and 10,765 samples from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care (SNAC). The proposed model is based on two modules: the XGBoost module assesses the most important features from feature space, while the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM) module classifies the probability of sleep apnea. Using a cross-validation scheme, the proposed XGBoost_BiLSTM algorithm achieves an accuracy of 97% while using only the six most significant features from the dataset. The model’s performance is also compared with conventional long-short-term memory networks (LSTM) and other state-of-the-art ML models. The results of the study suggest that the proposed model improved the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea by identifying the risk factors.},

  abstract     = {To guarantee stable power system operation, a synchronous condenser (SC) is configured in an ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) converter station to provide dynamic reactive power support to the power system. The research on the reactive power output modelling of a SC in an UHVDC converter station has important theoretical significance and practical value for the reactive power control of a SC in an UHVDC converter station. Focusing on the reactive power regulation system of the SC with strong coupling, multivariable, and nonlinear features, it is difficult for the universal analytic method to build the SC reactive power output model. A novel reactive power output model of the SC in the UHVDC converter station based on interlaced superposition convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) is proposed, in which a novel interlaced superposition CNN composed of convolution units with two different structures is built to increase the depth of the network and avoid over-fitting. Particularly the branch channels of convolution units with two different structures are connected by a convolution layer and a skip connection respectively. The interlaced superposition CNN-BiLSTM model is that the combination of the interlaced superposition CNN model and BiLSTM model for improving the model accuracy and generic capability. The Bayesian optimization method is used to optimize its hyperparameters. The application of interlaced Superposition CNN-BiLSTM in SC reactive power output modelling is a new technology. The excitation voltage and excitation current of the SC are used as inputs for the training and testing sampled data, and the reactive power of the SC is used as outputs for the training and testing sampled data. Therefore, the reactive power output model of a SC in an UHVDC converter station based on interlaced superposition CNN-BiLSTM is obtained, and it attains a low root mean square error (RMSE = 0.126750) and a high determination coefficient (R2 = 0.999999).},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images has emerged as one of the foci of research in the remote sensing field, which can accurately identify objects on the ground and determine their localization. In contrast, the traditional deep learning-based semantic segmentation, on the other hand, requires a large amount of annotated data, which is unsuitable for high-resolution remote sensing tasks with limited resources. It is therefore important to build a semantic segmentation method for high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, it is proposed an improved U-Net model based on transfer learning to solve the semantic segmentation problem of high-resolution remote sensing images. The model is based on the symmetric encoder–decoder structure of U-Net. For the encoder, transfer learning is applied and VGG16 is used as the backbone of the feature extraction network, and in the decoder, after upsampling using bilinear interpolation, it is performed multiscale fusion with the feature maps of the corresponding layers of the encoder in turn and is finally obtained the predicted value of each pixel to achieve precise localization. To verify the efficacy of the proposed network, experiments are performed on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset. The experiments show that the applied method has achieved high-quality semantic segmentation results on the high-resolution remote sensing dataset, and the MIoU is 1.70%, 2.20%, and 2.33% higher on the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, and the IoU is 4.26%, 6.89%, and 5.44% higher for the automotive category compared to the traditional U-Net.},

This problem is of extreme importance in natural language processing (NLP) when applying existing trained models to user-generated text on social media. Users of social media tend to use non-standard language. They heavily use abbreviations, phonetic substitutions, and colloquial language. Nevertheless, most existing NLP-based systems are often designed with the standard language in mind. However, they suffer from significant performance drops due to the many out-of-vocabulary words found in social media text. In this paper, we present a new (LN) technique by utilizing a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) to build a multilingual characters-to-words machine translation model. Unlike the majority of current methods, the proposed model is capable of recognizing and generating previously unseen words. Also, it greatly reduces the difficulties involved in tokenizing and preprocessing the nonstandard text input and the standard text output.

  abstract     = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of AI in the diagnosis of early cervical cancer using a systematic evaluation/meta-analysis approach and a comprehensive search of published literature. A comprehensive computer search of foreign language databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and IEEE; and Chinese databases such as China Knowledge Network, Wan fang Data Knowledge Platform, and Wipu.com (VIP) was conducted to retrieve reports on diagnostic accuracy of AI in early cervical cancer included between 1946 and December 2022. The literature was screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the quality of the included literature was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 quality evaluation chart. 2 × 2 diagnostic data in text were extracted and complete data were calculated using Review Manager 5.3. Heterogeneity between studies was analyzed using Stata SE 15.0 software with Meta Di Sc 1.4 and causes of heterogeneity were sought. A total of 42 data sets were included in the study of AI for the identification of benign and malignant cervical vitreous nodules, with a combined Sen value of 0.90; a combined Spe value of 0.90; a combined + LR value of 9.0; a combined −LR combined value was 0.11; DOR combined value was 83; and AUC was 0.96. The Fagan plot suggested a 50% pre-test probability and a 90% post-test probability of confirming diagnosis when the AI model diagnosed a glassy nodule positively, and a 10% probability of misdiagnosing the nodule when the result was negative. A total of 34 data sets were included in the study to determine benignity and malignancy of solid cervical nodules by AI, showing a combined Sen value of 0.92; a combined Spe value of 0.93; a combined + LR value of 13.37; a combined −LR combined value of 0.08; DOR combined value of 164; AUC of 0.97. The Fagan plot suggested a 50% pre-test probability and a 93% post-test probability of confirming the diagnosis of a solid cervical nodule when the AI model was positive, and an 8% probability of misdiagnosing the nodule when the result was negative. The results of likelihood ratio dot plots suggest that the use of an AI model for cervical detection in the clinical setting has a good exclusionary diagnostic power. Summing up the accuracy and specificity of the A1 model for diagnosis of early cervical cancer, accuracy for diagnosis of solid cervical nodules (0.90) &gt; diagnosis of cervical nodules (0.92), and specificity for diagnosis of solid cervical nodules (0.90) &gt; diagnosis of cervical nodules (0.93). The AI model is highly accurate in diagnosing early cervical cancer and has high clinical diagnostic value. The accuracy of the AI model in diagnosing solid nodules in the cervical region was higher than diagnosing ground glass nodules in the cervical region. The labeling method, image pre-processing method, and feature learning method affected the accuracy of the AI model in diagnosing early cervical cancer, while the choice of learning image library and validation database did not usually affect the accuracy of the model.},

The aim is to detect known attacks based on vulnerabilities and attack contexts. We extract organization-vulnerability relationships from publicly available APT threat intelligence, along with the names and relationships of software security entities from CVE, CWE, and CAPEC, to generate triple data and construct a knowledge graph of APT attack behaviors. This knowledge graph is transformed into a homogeneous graph, and GCNs are employed to process graph features, enabling effective APT attack detection. We evaluate the proposed method on the dataset constructed in this paper. The results show that the detection accuracy of the GCN method reaches 95.9%, improving by approximately 2.1% compared to the GraphSage method.

This study attempts to first develop the long short-term memory networks (LSTM) with a seasonal wavelet transform forecasting model for practical long-term wind power forecasting problems with seasonal and regional influences on wind power and the instability of data signals. This model encapsulates wavelet transformation and seasonal decomposition, and employs LSTM for forecasting. The new prediction model adopted seasonal decompositions and two LSTMs to approach low- and high-frequency series datasets, as well as the wavelet synthesis prediction values. Furthermore, the parameters of the LSTM models are selected using stochastic optimization. For a comprehensive evaluation, the proposed LSTM with seasonal wavelet transform is compared with seven methods, including seasonal LSTM (SLSTM), wavelet LSTM (WLSTM), and the seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), back propagation neural network (BPNN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), least square support vector regression (LSSVR), and support vector regression (SVR) were employed for long-term wind power output forecasting of wind farms. The empirical results underscore that the performance of the proposed forecasting model is better than other methods in terms of forecasting accuracy, which could efficiently provide reliable long-term predictions for long-term wind power output forecasting.},

  abstract     = {Ballistic missile defense systems require accurate target recognition technology. Effective feature extraction is crucial for this purpose. The deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has proven to be an effective method for recognizing high-resolution range profiles (HRRPs) of ballistic targets. It excels in perceiving local features and extracting robust features. However, the standard CNN&#39;s fully connected manner results in high computational complexity, which is unsuitable for deployment in real-time missile defense systems with stringent performance requirements. To address the issue of computational complexity in HRRP recognition based on the standard one-dimensional CNN (1DCNN), we propose a lightweight network called group-fusion 1DCNN with layer-wise auxiliary classifiers (GFAC-1DCNN). GFAC-1DCNN employs group convolution (G-Conv) instead of standard convolution to effectively reduce model complexity. Simply using G-Conv, however, may decrease model recognition accuracy due to the lack of information flow between feature maps generated by each G-Conv. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a linear fusion layer to combine the output features of G-Convs, thereby improving recognition accuracy. Additionally, besides the main classifier at the deepest layer, we construct layer-wise auxiliary classifiers for different hierarchical features. The results from all classifiers are then fused for comprehensive target recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFAC-1DCNN with such simple and effective techniques achieves higher overall testing accuracy than state-of-the-art ballistic target HRRP recognition models, while significantly reducing model complexity. It also exhibits a higher recall rate for warhead recognition compared to other methods. Based on these compelling results, we believe this work is valuable in reducing workload and enhancing missile interception rates in missile defense systems.},

  abstract     = {Learning from only positive and unlabeled (PU) data has broad applications in fields such as web data mining, product recommendations and medical diagnosis, which aims to train a binary classifier in the absence of negative labeled data. However, due to the lack of negative label information, prevailing PU learning methods usually rely on prior knowledge of unknown class distributions heavily. In fact, without additional constraints imposed by the prior knowledge, a direct learning strategy to coordinate the underlying clustering information in unlabeled data with the label information from positive training data is often considered challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose a direct PU learning strategy using quantum formalization. By employing neural networks as backends, the samples are mapped into two-qubit composite systems, which should be understood here as mathematical entities encapsulating various classical distributions of two classical bits. Subsequently, the two qubits within the systems are trained to be as independent as possible from each other, capturing patterns of different classes. At the same time, their measurement results serving as the model outputs are encouraged to be maximally dissimilar. These characteristics enable effective training of classifiers on PU data. After formulating an appropriate discriminant rule, we introduce a quantum-inspired PU method named qPU using the direct learning strategy. This method not only has the potential to alleviate parameter sensitivity issues caused by prior estimation in other methods but is also straightforward to implement. Finally, experiments conducted on 13 classical datasets validate the effectiveness of qPU.},

  abstract     = {Arrhythmia is a heart condition that poses a severe threat to life and requires prompt medical attention. One of the challenges in detecting arrhythmias accurately is that incorrect diagnoses can have severe consequences. In light of this, it is critical to develop a solution that is both effective and reliable. In this study, we propose a residual Convolution Neural Network Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepResidualBiLSTM) model for classifying Arrhythmia types, which addresses the vanishing gradient problem and captures the relevant features in the signals’ long dependencies. The model is characterized by its simplicity, stability, and ability to extract meaningful features effectively. Using two well-known datasets, the experimental results demonstrate exceptional accuracy, precision, and recall values of approximately 99.4% at the early stage of 20 epoch training. Furthermore, the model demonstrates a remarkable ability to discriminate between Arrhythmia classes under varying thresholds using the ROC curve metric, with a high value, in most cases, of 100% for accurately detecting positive cases.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where adversarial facial images are generated without awareness of the intrinsic attributes of the images in existing works. They change only a single attribute indiscriminately. To this end, we propose a new Semantic Adversarial Attack using StarGAN (SAA-StarGAN), which manipulates the facial attributes that are significant for each image. Specifically, we apply the cosine similarity or probability score to predict the most significant attributes. In the probability score method, we train the face verification model to perform an attribute prediction task to get a class probability score for each attribute. Then, we calculate the degree of change in the probability value in an image before and after altering the attribute. Therefore, we perform the prediction process and then alter either one or more of the most significant facial attributes under white-box or black-box settings. Experimental results illustrate that SAA-StarGAN outperforms transformation-based, gradient-based, stealthy-based, and patch-based attacks under impersonation and dodging attacks. Besides, our method achieves high attack success rates on various models in the black-box setting. In the end, the experiments confirm that the prediction of the most important attributes significantly impacts the success of adversarial attacks in both white-box and black-box settings and could improve the transferability of the generated adversarial examples.},

  abstract     = {Occupation profiling is a subtask of authorship profiling that is broadly defined as an analysis of individuals’ writing styles. Although the problem has been widely explored, no previous studies have attempted to identify Chinese classical poetry. Inspired by Trudgill’s seminal work on stylistic variation as a function of occupation, we present a novel Domain-Knowledge Transformer model to predict a poet’s occupation through their poems’ writing styles. Different from other Indo-European languages, Chinese has rarely used characters and two types of writing forms: traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese. To tackle these problems, we use the language-related component to standardize our input. We also use alphabetization to satisfy the restrictions on rhyming rules and tonal styles. As a special literal form, traditional domain knowledge, for example, named entities, themes, ages and the official career path, is valuable for poet occupation profiling. However, due to the lack of appropriate annotation datasets, it is difficult to recognize these features. Therefore, we proposed the domain knowledge component employing the latent Dirichletal location model to capture the extra theme information and establish named entity dictionaries to recognize the named entity of the datasets in this study. Finally, in the deep learning component, we combine Transformer with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to perform occupation profiling. The experimental results suggest that our model is effective in this task. Moreover, the results demonstrate an account of other social attribution features of poetry style that are predictive of occupation in this domain.},
