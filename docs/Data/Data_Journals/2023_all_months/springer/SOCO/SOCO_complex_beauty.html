  abstract     = {Multimedia content delivery in advanced networks faces exponential growth in data volumes, rendering existing solutions obsolete. This research investigates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for autonomous optimization without extensive datasets. The work analyzes two prominent DRL algorithms, i.e., Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) for multimedia delivery in simulated bus networks. DDQN utilizes a novel “dueling” architecture to estimate state value and action advantages, accelerating learning separately. DQN employs deep neural networks to approximate optimal policies. The environment simulates urban buses with passenger file requests and cache sizes modeled on actual data. Comparative analysis evaluates cumulative rewards and losses over 1500 training episodes to analyze learning efficiency, stability, and performance. Results demonstrate DDQN’s superior convergence and 32\% higher cumulative rewards than DQN. However, DQN showed potential for gains over successive runs despite inconsistencies. It establishes DRL’s promise for automated decision-making while revealing enhancements to improve DQN. Further research should evaluate generalizability across problem domains, investigate hybrid models, and test physical systems. DDQN emerged as the most efficient algorithm, highlighting DRL’s potential to enable intelligent agents that optimize multimedia delivery.},

Evaluating their ecological effectiveness and economic value is vital for sustainable forest management. Due to the ecological benefits of the forest ecosystem, China has introduced reforms in its ecological system and incorporated them into its national economic accounting system. This research study selects different types of forests based on their locality and species. It formulates a classifier using Convolution Neural networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) data mining techniques. First, this paper briefly discusses data mining methods used to determine the impact of different factors on forest health, quality, and its importance in terrestrial ecology. Second, this research study designs a classifier for labeling forests according to their ecological and economic worth. A confusion matrix was used to ascertain the performance of the classifier. Third, it illustrates an index system for evaluating forest ecosystem service function value and explores dynamic characteristics of forest resource variation and the change process of the forest ecosystem. Finally, a statistical analysis is performed among the proposed study and related studies. The proposed study outperforms its predecessors and depicts that the proposed technique is more accurate than traditional systems. The study showed that the amount of nutrients accumulated by trees and the amount of polluted gas absorbed have doubled, and the growth rate of other functions has also increased by more than 70\%.

  abstract     = {Football (soccer) stands as the world’s most popular sport, enthralling millions of fans globally. Within the dynamic sphere of modern football, gaining comprehensive insights into the nuanced technical and physical demands placed on players is pivotal for performance optimization. This paper introduces an innovative deep learning-powered image classification algorithm for recognizing football player activities directly from videos and images. Our pioneering approach harnesses the synergistic capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to decipher intricate spatial–temporal patterns in player poses and motions. The methodology employs a hybrid CNN and GCN architecture. The CNN leverages consecutive convolutional and pooling layers to automatically extract discriminative visual features from input frames capturing player poses. The GCN models’ skeletal joints as graph nodes with bones as edges, performing graph convolutions to aggregate spatial and temporal information from neighboring body parts. This enables capturing localized pose dynamics. The complementary CNN and GCN outputs are fused through fully connected layers to classify player activities based on both visual appearances and pose configurations. The model is trained end to end on richly annotated football video data using a multi-class cross-entropy loss. Data augmentation and regularization techniques enhance robustness. Extensive experiments validate the proposed architecture&#39;s effectiveness, achieving 97.4\% accuracy, 96\% precision, 95.5\% recall, 95.4\% F1-score, 0.90 Matthews correlation, and 93\% specificity in classifying 17 complex football activities significantly higher than previous benchmarks. Detailed ablation studies confirm the contributions of the CNN, GCN, and fused model components. The work represents a major advance in leveraging deep neural networks for accurate and granular analysis of sports performances.},

The assessment of teaching is a complex and dynamic process, but utilizing the cutting-edge technology of fuzzy neural networks can help navigate this complexity. This study aimed to improve the assessment of physical education classes. The first step towards creating a multi-index evaluation system for college physical education instructors’ performance is to use the analytical hierarchy technique. This technique evaluates the instructor’s teaching content, method, attitude, and influence. In this study, a system was developed for physical education using a fuzzy neural network model to evaluate faculty members in college-level physical education workshops. The input for the fuzzy neural network model is the assessment evaluation, and its output is a vector that indicates the quality of the college physical education received by the student, classified as great, good, average, or bad. Compared to other approaches for evaluating the quality of physical education courses in higher education, the fuzzy neural network model has shown higher accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1 score. After implementing the proposed methods for imparting physical education, there was a significant improvement in accuracy (95\%), specificity (94\%), sensitivity (92\%), and F1 score (93\%).

  abstract     = {The fast progress of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has significantly impacted the field of interpretation. Nonetheless, interpretation education at many Chinese schools and universities is poor quality. It strongly emphasizes theory while providing basic content, resulting in minimal pupil growth. Furthermore, existing interpretation assessment procedures must be revaluated to improve comprehensive instructional growth. Aiming at this problem, this paper systematically constructs the Automatic Interpretation Assessment System by integrating key components. Firstly, this paper explains the significance of interpretation as a cognitive bridge between AI and human cognition by emphasizing the critical relevance of interpretability in AI systems. Second, the research explores the intricacies of the internal workings of backpropagation (BP) neural networks. It explains their structural composition, signal propagation processes, and weight adjustment procedures, all of which are strategically employed to enable optimal learning within the context of the model. Third, it integrates genetic algorithms (GA) with BP neural networks in a unique way, combining the optimization capabilities of GA. This collaborative strategy employs selection, crossover, and mutation strategies to improve system performance and create a strong issue-detection feedback mechanism. Finally, utilizing interpretable AI theory, the study methodically creates the Automatic Interpretation Assessment System. This approach has a three-tier paradigm, with careful evaluation criteria including interpreter ability and skill. The requirements include bilingual competence, extra-lingual knowledge, interpreting abilities, professional excellence, and psychological quality. We comprehensively evaluated using essential parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and execution time. These results demonstrate that our proposed system excels with an accuracy of 95\%, a precision of 94\%, a recall of 96\%, and an F1-score of 0.95, showcasing its superiority over the other systems. These findings highlight our proposed system effectiveness in reliably assessing interpretation quality and efficient processing capabilities.},

Financial risk assessment is essential, because it affects not only a company&#39;s development but also the general economic progress of society. The backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used in this study to create a proactive financial risk pre-alarm system by recognizing the critical role that risk assessment plays in promoting financial reform, stability, and sustainable development within the financial ecosystem. In this paper, we utilized the capabilities of the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) as a way of creating a proactive financial risk pre-alarm system by realizing the crucial significance of risk assessment in supporting financial reform, stability, and sustainable development within the financial ecosystem. First, data on assessing financial risk is collected, including earnings reports, economic indicators, political developments that have an impact on the economy, and some previous financial data. After the data have been acquired, it is preprocessed by being cleaned, having extra attributes removed, missing values removed, and normalized. An initial set of random parameters is used to create a BPNN architecture, which is then trained using a fraction of the collected data. Next, a genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the parameters of BPNN, including learning rate, neuronal count, hidden layer count, etc. The remaining data from the collection is then used to test the optimized BPNN, and its performance is assessed. The result of the developed model is carefully assessed and compared with other methodologies and with previously published works, showing that this method’s accuracy is unquestionably superior to that of the other financial risk analysis algorithms. The mistake is reduced by 45.69\%, and our model’s accuracy is 97.94\%, which is 21.32\% greater than the accuracy of the comparison algorithm.},

On the other hand, selecting the proper HST set is a highly complex process since many conflicting criteria, and decision alternatives make it difficult for decision-makers. This paper suggests the fuzzy Grey Relational Analysis technique. In addition, the fuzzy technique proposed in the current paper has been implemented in two ways: using both the experts’ linguistic evaluations and crisp numbers to compare real numerical values and fuzzy evaluations. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was then conducted to assess the validation of the proposed fuzzy technique and its results in applying this method. The decision alternative of A8 Siemens is the best option for all scenarios, and it has been observed that there are slight differences, which cannot change the overall result in the ranking positions of the options. The analysis results prove that the fuzzy method can be applied to solve these complicated decision-making problems and that the obtained results are robust, accurate, applicable, and realistic.},

Coupling Evolutionary Algorithms with Discrete Event Simulation has been explored both in relation to systems design and their maintenance strategy. However, it was not simultaneously considered when both the corrective and the preventive maintenance—consisting of achieving the optimum period of time to carry out a preventive maintenance activity—are taken into account before being considered by the authors of the present paper. This work couples Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms with Discrete Event Simulation in order to enhance the knowledge and efficiency of the methodology presented, which consists of exploring and optimizing simultaneously systems design alternatives and their preventive maintenance strategies. The aim consists of finding the best set of non-dominated solutions by using the system availability (first maximized objective function) with taking into consideration associated operational cost (second minimized objective function), while automatically selecting the system devices. Each solution proposed by the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm is analyzed by using Discrete Event Simulation in a procedure that looks at the effect of including periodic preventive maintenance activities all along the mission time. An industrial application case study is solved, and a comparison of the performance of five state-of-the-art and three more recently developed Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms is handled; moreover, the gap in the literature reviewed about the analysis regarding the effect of the discrete event simulation sampling size is faced with useful insights about the synergies of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms and Discrete Event Simulation.

However, RS suffers from data sparsity issues over the newly launched system, and the lack of time to deal with the massive data is also a challenging factor. To acquire proper outcomes, cross-domain RS intends to transfer knowledge from the specific domain with quality enriched data to help recommendations to the target domains. The entities may or may not be overlapped, and it is common for the entities of two domains to be overlapped. These overlapping entities may show variations in their target domain, and avoiding these issues leads to distorted prediction outcomes over the cross-domain RS. To address these issues, this research concentrates on modeling and efficient cross-domain RS using the generative and discriminative adversarial network (CRS-GDAN) model for kernel-based transfer modeling. Domain specific is considered to handle the feature space of overlapped entities, and transfer computation is adopted to handle the overlapping and non-overlapping entity correlation among the domains. Based on the anticipated concept, knowledge transfer is achieved rigorously even in the case of overlapping entities, thus diminishing the data sparsity issues. The experimentation is performed using an available online dataset, and the model attains a 20\% better outcome than other approaches. The outcomes specify that the knowledge transfer from source to destination target is advantageous even in overlapping issues.},

  abstract     = {The relationship between the tourism economy and the ecological environment has always been a hot issue in tourism research today. Because increasing tourism in rural regions frequently endangers the environment and rural culture, this study uses the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine the best policy balance between environmental preservation and tourism infrastructure. First, this research describes the methods used to incorporate a decision-making framework based on MDP into rural ecotourism, with a particular emphasis on the Zibo region of China. To navigate this complex game interplay, we proposed a Markov Decision Process MDP model bearing three pivotal states for this problem. These states are the Economic State, Ecological State, and Environment State. In this model, we also identified three distinct actions. Each action carries its significance. These actions include Promoting Tourism, Environment Protection, and Infrastructural Investment. We relied on data spanning a decade in Zibo of China to calculate the likelihood and real-world dynamic probability. The optimum policy is driven after the MDP simulation. Second, to validate the optimum policy, the policies were also iterated. In the last phase, the Sequential Markov Decision Process is simulated. This simulation not only shows the current state and policy for the area but also predicts the future strategies and policies for Tourism Economy and Rural Environment protection. The experimental results show that the model achieved the best policy and strategy. The experimental results show that the model successfully achieved the best policy and strategy. After 10,000 iterations, the score of γ = 0.9 is achieved, and the iteration of policies provides a better insight into the chosen strategy. The results are optimistic, with our method achieving an accuracy of 85\%, recall of 88\%, precision of 82\%, F1-Score of 85\%, sensitivity of 88\%, and consistency of 90\%. Our approach outshines the competition when assessing performance in specific geographic areas, achieving the highest accuracy in Area A (92\%) and Area C (94\%).

  abstract     = {In recent years, the rapid development of the Internet has promoted the continuous expansion of the scale of China’s tourism industry, and the amount of tourism data has surged. However, tourists need help bringing personal interest and high-value data from the plethora of tourism information. The rise of artificial intelligence has transformed traditional tourism into an intelligent, data-driven industry. This shift has generated vast tourism data, offering both opportunities and challenges. The paper discusses an AI and IoT-based Intelligent Tourism Recommendation System (ITRS) that offers travelers predefined itineraries, personalized suggestions, and tourism insights. This system simplifies attraction discovery, unveiling hidden value within tourism data at the intersection of AI and IoT. The present study thoroughly investigates AI-based recommendation algorithms before delving into the system’s architecture. It categorizes user-based, project-based, and article-based collaborative filtering methodologies tailored to specific goals. First, thoroughly examine AI-based recommendation algorithms before delving into the system architecture. Second, categorize collaborative filtering methods as user-based, project-based, and article-based, each tailored to specific objectives. Third, delve into the Apriori algorithm’s complexity within the context of weighted association rules and introduce an enhanced iteration for improved efficiency. The proposed scheme encompasses an elaborate ITRS plan featuring a user interest model and a client module, crucial for the computation and analysis of users’ long-term and short-term interests. Rigorous performance testing confirms the ITRS’s superiority across varying support levels, with experimental results demonstrating the Apriori algorithm’s exceptional accuracy, achieving a 94.3\% improvement over other methods. The Apriori algorithm is better than traditional recommendation algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost.},

  abstract     = {Ethnic music portrays a particular group&#39;s identity, customs, history, and traditions. Its preservation and dissemination are of core importance and are crucial for upholding society&#39;s values and maintaining cultural diversity and heritage. The fame of ethnic music is diminishing daily, and to preserve its features like patterns, sequences, melody, lyrics, and tones, Deep Learning (DL) could be utilized. These techniques comprised Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), etc. This study uses RNN techniques to extract features of ethnic music and preserve it using a data table for future generations and reference. The RNN is used, because it is best fitted for evaluating and extracting features of sequential data like music. The research study commences with the importance of ethnic music and the tools used to preserve its patterns and features. Second, it demonstrates an RNN model for extracting features of ethnic music. These features are extracted by collecting data from different sources and then defining a training dataset for validation and testing. Third, this study incorporates ethnic music education and the availability of instructions to students in schools and colleges. It collects data from students studying ethnic music and divides it into six different groups for evaluation. Finally, the proposed model is compared with its predecessor techniques and evaluated using a confusion matrix. The study found that the accuracy of the proposed method has increased by 18.67\% compared to its predecessors. Similarly, the impact values’ comparison shows that ethnic music and class ecosystem significantly improve students’ behavior and performance.},

  abstract     = {The development of the Internet and broadcasting technologies has made it possible to access a huge amount of multimedia content. Several cutting-edge technologies are working in parallel to make electronic gadgets automatic. The Internet of things (IoT) has become the main player in this race due to its significance in data collection and smart control. However, with rapid data generation from IoT devices, it has become difficult to manage such a huge volume of data and ensure its security and privacy. Among other fields, the music industry is also going to benefit from the power of these cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning and IoT. Music can be created by utilizing several tools and instruments; the piano is one of them. The piano, as a representative of stringed instruments, is rapidly spreading to millions of households with its wide range, beautiful melodies, and strong aural complex. As existing keyword-based music recognition methods are increasingly limited in their application to large-scale song searches on the Internet, more and more researchers are turning to the study of content-based music recognition techniques. In this paper, we propose a musical identification system for piano performance evaluation by utilizing the power of IoT and support vector machine (SVM). The data from the piano was collected by utilizing different IoT devices and microphones. After the data was collected, we performed several preprocessing steps to prepare the collected data for SVM. To concentrate on the important information, key features were extracted from the input data, which include the Mel frequency cepstral coefficient and other piano-relevant features such as pedal usage patterns, pressure fluctuations, and keypress timings. These features were given as input to the SVM model for music recognition. The results of the experiment indicate that the average recognition rate of SVM for five songs is 61.2\%, and the average recognition rate of HMM is 47.44\%. The average recognition rate of SVM is 13.76\% higher than that of HMM. Therefore, the SVM-based piano performance musical identification system is the basis of automatic music annotation and plays a very important role in the fields of computer music accompaniment, massive search of cover songs, and audio signal segmentation and matching.},

As the proposed antenna design is compact, ultra-thin, and optimized in size, it can be used for microwave imaging and wearable applications. Innovation has been used to design the UWB microstrip antenna, which has increased the efficiency and performance of the antenna. This innovation has considered the feed structure, geometry, modifications in the slots, and the use of an ultra-thin dielectric substrate with a thickness of 0.25 mm. The proposed technique is a unique tuning mechanism located under the feed line of the proposed UWB microstrip antenna. The antenna&#39;s compact and ultra-thin design is desirable for reducing the complexity of the physical array structure and achieving a degree of body fit. Parametric studies are performed to compare this performance after changes in patch and ground plane length. Finally, the simulated performance parameters were analyzed and compared with the measured results. Due to its small size, new shape, and impressive functions, the proposed antenna is well suited to multifunctional healthcare applications and sports performance monitoring.},

  abstract     = {With the increasingly severe unemployment situation, the competition among undergraduates in employment is becoming more and more fierce, and the psychological pressure of undergraduates in employment is also growing. Undergraduates have a huge psychological gap because of the conflict between their ideals in employment and the specific social reality. This gap puts undergraduates in a state of psychological imbalance, often accompanied by anxiety, inferiority, self-denial, and other mentalities. It is very necessary to deeply explore the internal relationship between the position of the enterprise and the comprehensive quality of the employed students, and on this basis, it is necessary to construct an analysis mechanism for the matching of people and posts based on the portrait of students and the information of job requirements. Taking these points into account, in this study, we investigated the use of fuzzy clustering algorithms in the evaluation of psychological health in undergraduate students. Student psychological pressure is on the rise as a result of the increasingly competitive work landscape, prompting the development of novel early detection and intervention strategies. We proposed using fuzzy clustering methods to efficiently classify students according to their mental health. For this purpose, we collected many psychologically relevant characteristics, from different students using a SCL-90 symptom checklist. After the data collection, the preprocessing and feature extraction were carried out. The preprocessed data is then used for the students&#39; psychological health analysis. The students are given degrees of membership based on their distance from cluster centroids, allowing them to simultaneously belong to many clusters (good, normal, mild abnormality, and severe abnormality). To maximize the performance of our proposed model to divide students into various mental health groups with flexible and exact membership degrees, we fine-tuned the membership function by iteratively adjusting parameters. The resulting our proposed method offers a flexible and precise way to grasp the mental health landscape, opening up a promising new direction for specialized assistance and interventions. Our research adds to the expanding body of knowledge on data-driven approaches to mental health evaluation by presenting a novel application of fuzzy clustering in the context of student well-being assessment.},

  abstract     = {Because of the advent of new technologies like machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data, nearly every electronic device in the modern era of digitization is now capable of making intelligent decisions. To transform instructional management in the big data and educational informatization era, institutions are using digital technologies. Though there has been significant progress in this area, there are still numerous issues with the informatization of instructional management in universities, which have an impact on both the quality of construction and the effectiveness of the application. To improve effectiveness, efficiency, and data security, we investigated in this study how to integrate IoT devices and big data analytics methods into university instructional management systems. Universities can handle security and data integrity concerns while extracting insights from complex data streams by utilizing IoT devices with big data analytics. To achieve the stated goal, we first carefully examined the current university instructional management system to identify its shortcomings. After that, we presented our proposal for an instructional management system for universities that collects data using IoT devices, and it undergoes preprocessing to get it ready for big data analytics. Some of the data mining and big data analytics algorithms such as K-mean clustering, PCA, and Apriori algorithms were applied to get a thorough insight from the collected data. Students were grouped according to their academic activities using the K-mean clustering algorithm. By lowering the dimensionality, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is utilized to determine the relationship between a student&#39;s library visit and their final grade. The result of our proposed system is carefully analyzed to display the various levels of student interaction, their study habits, and their final grade.},

Traditional methods, such as quadratic programming, are not computationally effective for solving complex portfolio models. For example, portfolio models with constraints that introduce nonlinearity and non-convexity (such as boundary constraints and cardinality constraints) are NP-Hard. As a result, researchers often use meta-heuristic approaches to approximate optimal solutions in an efficient manner. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of over 140 papers that have applied evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms to the portfolio optimization problem. These papers are categorized by the type of portfolio optimization problem considered, i.e., unconstrained or constrained, and are further categorized by single-objective and multi-objective approaches. Furthermore, the various portfolio models used, as well as the constraints, objectives, and properties in which they differ, are also discussed in a detailed analysis. Based on the findings of the reviewed work, guidance for future research in portfolio optimization is given. Possible areas for future work include dynamic portfolio optimization, predictive pricing, the further investigation of multi-objective approaches.},

  abstract     = {Recently, image thresholding methods based on various entropy functions have been found popularity. Nonetheless, entropic-based methods depend on the spatial distribution of the grey level values in an image. Hence, the accuracy of these methods is limited due to the non-uniform distribution of the grey values. Further, the analysis of the COVID-19 X-ray images is evolved as an important area of research. Therefore, it is needed to develop an efficient method for the segmentation of the COVID-19 X-ray images. To address these issues, an efficient non-entropy-based thresholding method is suggested. A novel fitness function in terms of the segmentation score (SS) is introduced, which is used to reduce the segmentation error. A soft computing approach is suggested. An efficient optimizer using the chance-based birds’ intelligence is introduced to maximize the fitness values. The new optimizer is validated utilizing the benchmark test functions. The statistical parameters reveal that the suggested optimizer is efficient. It shows a quite significant improvement over its counterparts—optimization based on seagull/cuckoo birds. Precisely, the paper includes three novel contributions—(i) fitness function, (ii) chance-based birds’ intelligence for optimization, (iii) multiclass segmentation. The COVID-19 X-ray images are taken from the Kaggle Radiography database, to the experiment. Its results are compared with three different state-of-the-art entropy-based techniques—Tsallis, Kapur’s, and Masi. For providing a statistical analysis, Friedman’s mean rank test is conducted and our method Ranked one. Its superiority is claimed in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) and Structure Similarity Index (SSIM). On the whole, an improvement of about 11\% in PSNR values is achieved using the proposed method. This method would be helpful for medical image analysis.},

In this paper, we proposed an approach based on a fuzzy cloud cognitive diagnosis framework (FC-CDF) to predicting examinees’ performance in e-learning environment. In this approach, the normal cloud models (NCMs) are utilized innovatively to measure the expectation, degree of variation and variation frequency of learners’ skill proficiency, and each NCM is transformed into an interval fuzzy number to characterize the uncertainty of the skill proficiency for every learner. Combining the educational psychology hypothesis with the parameter estimation method, we could obtain the learners’ skill proficiency level and the slip and guess factors relevant to each test item, based on which the learners’ scores could be predicted in a future test. Finally, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach provides good accuracy and significantly reduces execution time for predicting examinee performance, compared with the existing methods.},

Third, the paper focuses on the development of a complete Economic Protection Evaluation Index System using the DT Algorithm. To provide a robust, scientifically sound, and practicable framework for evaluating economic protection, this approach integrates scientificity, comparability, systematization, hierarchy, relative decoupling, and data availability principles. Finally, the study constructs the suggested ML Algorithm using the insights from the preceding parts. This algorithm combines the Decision Tree and Random Forest models to generate a single, effective tool for evaluating economic development levels. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed hybrid assessment technique is effective across several dimensions. The proposed CBDT demonstrated its capacity to adapt to changing data circumstances in evaluating low-carbon efficiency using real-world data from 30 major Chinese cities. Furthermore, the algorithm regularly beats rival techniques regarding efficiency improvements, with an average improvement of 12.5\% across all cities. Notably, it outperforms other algorithms regarding computational efficiency, with a quicker execution time and an exceptional accuracy rate of 93.2\%. The proposed ML Algorithm improves decision-making in the economic protection development level field by effectively balancing cost and benefit considerations. It will improve accuracy and efficiency to outperform existing approaches, thereby advancing economic protection evaluation and decision-making processes in this domain.},

This paper uses the real-time dataset of CKD patients collected from reputed medical dialysis unit in Chennai, India. We measure the inter and intra class variations between the clinical and non-clinical attributes. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied on twelve clinical (biomarkers) and eight non-clinical (comorbiditity) attributes to find salient among them. ANOVA is applied only on reduced attributes to calculate the correlation between the target variables such as mortality, age and gender. The characteristics of the attributes and its discriminating nature is evaluated using various well known classifiers such as Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, Neive Bayes, decision tree, random forest and artificial neural network. The performance of the classifiers are evaluated using parameters such as confusion matrix, accuracy, F-measure, precision and recall. It is found that, the covariance of the attributes linearly separates the output space of target variables that are considered and the performance is encouraged.},

Based on the above, this research work dives into the delicate link between changes in China&#39;s peripheral diplomatic relations and their resultant consequences on export commerce in China&#39;s quickly developing global environment. It provides a unique combined forecasting model that combines autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time-series analysis with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to answer the pressing demand for accurate forecasts in this dynamic setting. First, a forecasting model is established for the influencing factors and volume of import and export trade of ASEAN. Second, it establishes the regression equation with the econometrics method by analyzing the specific impact of each influencing factor on the forecasting target. Moreover, it uses data statistics to mathematically process the historical data of ASEAN&#39;s import and export volume by determining the correlation between ASEAN&#39;s trade volume and some influencing factors. Regression analysis is often used to find relationships between variables. Adding ARIMA time-series modeling improves the model&#39;s prediction capabilities, providing a comprehensive insight into China–ASEAN import and export trade volume dynamics. Finally, it compares the performance of the suggested forecasting model to existing approaches, which proves that the correlation rate is enhanced to above 90\%. In contrast, other error rates, including the average root, are decreased to the square error. These results show that the prediction model based on the combination of time series and LSTM produces the best short-term forecast of China and ASEAN import and export volume.},

  abstract     = {Renewable energy sources are seen as a sustainable solution to the problem of global energy security. Among the renewable energy sources, wave energy has great prospects for development in a few countries, including South Africa. However, South Africa’s wave energy projects are still underinvested in practice compared to wind energy and solar PV. This paper investigates several questions related to the influence of both quantitative and qualitative factors on the effectiveness of wave energy projects (WEPs) and the appropriate placement for WEP in South Africa. For this purpose, a novel two-phase framework novel two-phase data envelopment analysis (DEA) supporting integrated multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework is proposed. The first phase aims to identify potential locations for WEPs and calculate the technical advantage of these locations using the DEA model. In the second phase, other qualitative criteria, which affect the sustainable development of WEPs, are identified. Based on expert surveys, potential locations are analyzed and ranked by a novel integrated MCDM approach called OPA-EDAS. In the proposed approach, the advantages of the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) are utilized to simultaneously determine the weight of the criteria and prioritize the alternatives. However, the results of OPA depend on the priorities of the experts participating in the assessment. Therefore, this study attempted to overcome that by integrating the EDAS technique to assess the expertise. Furthermore, the DEA model is applied to increase the objectivity of the results. In addition, the robustness of the study&#39;s findings is validated by comparing the location with upcoming WEPs in South Africa. The result shows that the coast of Cape Nature Walker Bay has the most effectiveness for South Africa’s WEPs.},

Firstly, DEMATEL based on cloud model is used to establish the interaction model between the main criteria, determine the weighted cloud weight of the super matrix and the inner dependencies of the sub-criteria under the same main criteria. Then, the cloud-ANP model is used to determine the outer dependencies relationship and construct the cloud super matrix, so as to obtain the cloud weight of each evaluation criteria in maintenance strategy selection. By using the subjective and objective weighting method, the evaluation of different experts on different maintenance strategy criteria is integrated, and the priority of alternative maintenance strategies of MU is obtained.

Firstly, we regard the return rates of the risky assets as fuzzy numbers and use the value function in prospect theory to transform the return rate of a portfolio into perceived value, which can reflect investors’ loss aversion. Moreover, due to the fact that investors’ perception level toward risk may vary with the loss aversion degree, we propose a new risk measure based on the perceived value. Then, we formulate the objectives of maximizing the cumulative expected perceived value and minimizing the cumulative perceived risk and propose a multi-period portfolio selection model with diversification constraint. Furthermore, to solve the proposed model, we design a multiple particle swarm optimization algorithm with respect to its specific situation. Finally, using the data from real financial market, we construct a real case to illustrate the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. The results show that loss aversion has an important effect on investors’ investment decisions, and the proposed model could provide more reasonable strategies for investors with different loss aversion degrees.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the issue of fluctuations in the price of digital Bitcoin currency has a striking impact on the profit or loss of people, international relations, and trade. Accordingly, designing a model that can take into account the various significant factors for predicting the Bitcoin price with the highest accuracy is essential. Hence, the current paper uses market sentiment and multiple feature extraction to present several Bitcoin price prediction models based on convolutional neural network and long short-term memory. In the proposed models, several parameters, including Twitter data, news headlines, news content, Google Trends, Bitcoin-based stock, and finance, are employed based on deep learning to make a more accurate prediction. Such parameters are the input data used to predict the Bitcoin price. Besides, the proposed model analyzes the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner sentiments to examine the market’s latest news and cryptocurrencies. According to this study’s various inputs and analyses, several effective feature selection methods, including mutual information regression, linear regression, correlation-based, and a combination of the feature selection models, are exploited to predict the price of Bitcoin. Finally, a careful comparison is made between the proposed models in terms of some performance criteria like mean square error (MSE), root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, median absolute error, and coefficient of determination (R2). The obtained results indicate that the proposed hybrid model based on sentiments analysis and combined feature selection with MSE value of 0.001 and R2 value of 0.98 provides better estimations with more minor errors regarding Bitcoin price. This proposed model can also be employed as an individual assistant for more informed trading decisions associated with Bitcoin.},

It produces direct current (DC) electricity by converting sunlight. Power is produced using stationary solar panels. There is a small amount of efficiency loss in this system. To increase the efficiency of the sun-based board, a single-axis solar panel is then created and proposed that spins on a vertical axis (east–west) up to 180°. It is intended to increase the efficiency of the sun-based board, which will rotate in accordance with the direction of the sun on both a horizontal (North–South) and vertical (East–West) axis, up to 180°, for greater exposure to the sun than the single hub sun-based global positioning system. Moreover, each solar panel loses some percentage of its effectiveness due to dust pollution. In the majority of power plants, cleaning is done by hand. In most plants, the cleaning cycle is carried out physically. Therefore, the goal of this research is to increase the efficiency of the sun-powered board by attaching a cleaning framework to the board to naturally remove residue from its exterior over time. The proposed framework combines a dual-hub solar-powered global positioning system with a scheduled cleaning system in a single module.

The study aims to find the best distribution and operational plans for the cross-docking satellites to minimize the total transportation cost of the materials. To solve the considered problem, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is developed, which integrates simulated annealing (SA) algorithm within a genetic algorithm (GA). In this way, a new individual with a low solution quality is rejected by using the stochastic solution acceptance feature of the SA. Moreover, the HGA is enhanced with an advanced two-dimensional loading-check procedure and a rule-based material placement procedure to obtain efficient solutions. The proposed loading-check procedure reduces the processing time of the HGA by avoiding duplicate examinations for the truck loading plans. Likewise, the rule-based material placement procedure prevents unnecessary searches for the assignment plans of the products in a temporary storage area. In computational studies, the performance of the HGA is tested on two different problem sets by comparing HGA with the SA and GA. Furthermore, the HGA is applied to a problem set that is formed by using real-life data of a logistics company. The computational results show that the HGA introduces effective solutions and outperforms both the SA and GA. In addition, the results of the real-life application denote that the HGA can be employed to find effective material flow plans in real situations of cross-docking operations.},

  abstract     = {Local search methods play an important role in several approaches to solving complex optimization problems. However, black-box local search methods for continuous optimization problems tend to be excessively time-consuming and their performance typically deteriorates when dealing with large-scale problems. In this context, we propose the Gray-Box Local Search with Groups of Step Sizes (GBO-LSGSS) algorithm. GBO-LSGSS explores the problem structure through partial evaluations and subcomponents for improving its efficiency. Thus, this proposed method implements an orchestrator module to learn and select the most promissory subproblems. Overall, an experimental study revealed the competitive GBO-LSGSS performance even compared to some of the main algorithms for solving large-scale continuous problems. The comparison between GBO-LSGSS and its original version provides evidence that the proposed method can find better solutions and save up to 90\% of processing time for fully and partially large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation in the internet of things (IoT), a variety of delay sensitive applications have emerged over the past few years. Fog computing acts a viable computing paradigm for meeting the requirements of IoT applications. However, heterogeneous IoT tasks, resource constrained fog nodes makes task scheduling a challenging task. Efficient task scheduling reduces the computation cost, latency, energy and enhances the utilization of resources. In this paper, we propose the improved version of the meta-heuristic algorithm spider monkey optimization (SMO). We propose greedy task scheduling SMO (gTS-SMO) and semi-greedy task scheduling SMO (sgTS-SMO) for efficient task scheduling in fog computing environment. The main aim is minimize delay and energy consumption while considering the constraints of deadline and violation time. The system is evaluated based on the parameters of deadline violation time, makespan, energy consumption, total cost, and degree of imbalance. The results shows gTS-SMO reduces the violation time by 13.86\%, 88.38\% on comparison with sgTS-SMO and particle swarm optimization (PSO) respectively. The results also depicts the outperformance of gTS-SMO in terms of makespan and energy consumption. Makespan is reduced by 6.28\%, and 57.75\% and energy consumption by 5.74\% and 53.65\% on comparison with sgTS-SMO and PSO respectively.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, mobile agents are becoming more commonly used in a variety of industries that require high reliability from their control systems. In an uncertain environment, if the mobile agent control system’s state transition includes only one plan, the system will enter the fault state immediately after the plan fails. Therefore, multiple alternative plans can be provided during the system design process to improve system reliability. First, this paper studies and describes the factors associated with the proposed multiple alternative plans, namely the success rate and plan implementation cost. Second, a Policy Generation Algorithm for identifying an appropriate execution sequence of those alternative plans is proposed. Furthermore, we propose a formal method-based pipeline framework for verifying the reliability of a mobile agent control system equipped with multiple alternative plans: we invoke the probabilistic model checking technique to create a Discrete-Time Markov Chain formal model of the mobile agent control system, convert the required properties into Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic formulae, and verify the model using the advanced probabilistic model checker PRISM. A case study is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the suggested methodological framework. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mobile agent control system with multiple alternative plans can improve system reliability while also meeting the least expected operational cost under the alternative plan set.},

  abstract     = {In simple assembly line balancing problems, it is assumed that the resources required to perform the tasks are available at the relevant station for task assignment. However, each task may need different resource types depending on the difficulty, complexity and technical requirements of the tasks in real life. For this reason, tasks and resources belonging to these tasks must be assigned to the relevant station while balancing the line. In this study, the resource-constrained U-shaped assembly line balancing problem (U-GRCALBP) is discussed. According to the literature research, there is no study dealing with U-GRCALBP. Two different constraint programming (CP) models that define the resource constraints as “and/or” constraint types with concurrent resource types have been developed. In these models, the sum of resource usage costs and station opening cost minimization is aimed. The models are explained with an illustrative example and the efficiency of the models is tested by deriving new resource constraints on five different data set each taking into account four different cycle times and the number of two and four resource types. The number of stations obtained, the total number of resources used, total station opening and resource usage costs, and CPU time are used as performance criteria The results are compared with the traditional U-type assembly line balancing problem results. The proposed CP models give superior performance on all data sets, especially in terms of total cost. The numerical results show that both CP models are effective in solving the problem. Furthermore, some managerial implications are presented to be useful for professionals, organizations, and society.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, attention to the goals of cost, quality, time, and risk is essential in every project. In this regard, the beneficiaries of each project seek to reduce the cost, time, and risk and increase the quality of the project simultaneously. As cost, risk, time, and quality are critical factors in project management, this study primarily focused on examining the trade-offs among these criteria to determine how increased costs and decreased risks can lead to reduced project implementation time and improved quality. To this end, in this research, a mathematical programming approach and metaheuristic algorithms have been suggested for PERT networks. The model is developed through a simulation process, and then the values of decision and response variables are obtained in each implementation. Finally, an artificial neural network model is designed, and several sample problems are generated on small, medium, and large scales to solve the model. This study has several contributions, including the development of a mathematical programming model for PERT networks that considers the cost–risk–time–quality trade-off. Additionally, an artificial neural network model is proposed for solving problems of various sizes. At the same time, NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms are utilized to handle NP-hard problems in the mathematical programming of PERT networks. Furthermore, the model considers multi-dimensional activities, with cost, quality, risk, and time as the four objective functions in the PERT network. Finally, AHP–TOPSIS methods are used to evaluate the effectiveness of NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms. The findings illustrated that the NSGA-II algorithm performed better than the MOPSO algorithm in all three designed problems. The proposed model became practical and closer to reality than the previous models by eliminating unrealistic assumptions.},

The hybrid flow shop scheduling problem is a scheduling problem with many applications in the industry. The problem has also attracted much attention from researchers due to its complexity. This study addresses the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP), which considers unrelated parallel machines at each stage and the machine eligibility constraints. HFSP is a well-known NP-hard problem with the aim of minimizing the makespan. Owing to the complexity of the problem, this study develops constraint programming (CP) models for the HFSP and its extensions: the no-wait HFSP, the blocking HFSP, the HFSP with sequence-dependent setup times, the no-wait HFSP with sequence-dependent setup times, and the blocking HFSP with sequence-dependent setup times. We also propose two mixed-integer linear programming models (MILP) for no-wait and blocking HSFPs with sequence-dependent setup times. The performances of the CP models were tested against their MILP counterparts using randomly generated instances and benchmark instances from the literature. The computational results indicated that the proposed CP model outperformed the best MILP solutions for benchmark instances. It is also more effective for finding high-quality solutions for larger problem instances.},

  abstract     = {Geoinformation from satellite images is used for a variety of earth science applications. Because of the limitations of optics and sensor technology and the high cost of Earth observation satellites, spatial and spectral resolution are not always at the desired high level. In instruction to recover the spatial and spectral values of satellite images, optimization algorithms need to be developed. For satellite image super-resolution, several deep learning techniques have been proposed recently. The drawback is that these models may not perform adequately in a wide range of real-world situations because they are trained using synthetic data generated through a limited amount of real data collected from satellites. Due to the one-dimensional structure of the convolutional kernels in the existing learning technique, diversity is lacking and the propagation of information is affected. As satellite images are being archived continually along with their increasing use in various applications, there is an increasing need for effective compression methods. In this study, we address the joint optimization problems, i.e., satellite image denoising and compression. We propose optimal lossless compression and denoising technique (OptiLCD) using hybrid optimization and deep learning techniques for the satellite images. To remove unwanted artifacts from satellite images, hybrid teaching learning-induced Harris-hawks optimization (hybridTL-HHO) algorithm was used. For compression of satellite images, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A new method, improved beetle swarm optimization (IBSO), has been introduced to enhance the performance of CNNs that compute optimal weight parameters to construct encoder–decoder lattices. To conclude, using open-source benchmark datasets, we validate the performance of our OptiLCD model. As far as PSNR, SSIM, and compression ratio are concerned, OptiLCD model can be compared to the standing state-of-the-art replicas.},

The obstacle hazard identification technology is the core of the environment perception system, and it is also the basic condition for the autonomous driving of unmanned vehicles. In view of the complexity of obstacle danger identification, this research paper designs an improved Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) Algorithm for hazard recognition of obstacles in unmanned scenes through a systematic approach. First, it highlights the significance of morphological component analysis in identifying non-smooth regions within images where obstacles are likely to be present. Second, it introduces a novel approach for core point definition by identifying an optimal MinDensity value based on the curvature of the density distribution curve. Third, it addresses variations in density sequences through smoothing and normalization. Finally, it constructs an improved DBSCAN Algorithm for hazard recognition of obstacles in unmanned scenes. It addresses limitations in the traditional DBSCAN by refining the core point definition using an adaptive density threshold. It identifies the “elbow point” in density distribution, enhancing its ability to distinguish density states. Additionally, it incorporates density curve smoothing, normalization, and a merger step for handling stationary objects. The results show that it has high accuracy (95.6\%), precision (96.3\%), recall (94.5\%), and F-Score (95.4\%), as well as increased consistency (92.5\%) and dependability (93.2\%).

Firstly, we divide 349 ovarian cancer patients into two sets: one for learning model parameters, and the other for assessing prediction performance, and select 46 variables from 49 traits as the predictor vector to construct GLASSO/GSCAD/GMCP penalized logistic regressions with 11 groups. Secondly, we develop group coordinate descent (GCD) algorithm and its specific pseudo code to simultaneously complete group selection and group estimation, introduce the tenfold cross validation (CV) procedure to select the relatively optimal tuning parameter, and apply the testing set and Youden index to obtain class probability estimator and class index information. Finally, we compute the accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score and the area under ROC curve (AUC) to assess the prediction performance to the proposed group penalized methods, and found that GLASSO/GSCAD/GMCP penalized logistic regressions outperform three machine learning methods (ANN, artificial neural network; SVM, support vector machine; XGBoost, eXtreme gradient boosting) and three deep learning methods (CNN, convolutional neural network; DNN, deep neural network; RNN, recurrent neural network) in terms of accuracy, F1-score and AUC.},

  abstract     = {In the process of facial expression recognition, face detection is the prerequisite, image preprocessing is the foundation, facial expression feature extraction is the key, and facial expression classification is the target. Effective feature extraction in this process can improve the accuracy of facial expression classifications. On the other hand, traditional facial expression recognition methods are not only complicated in the feature extraction process, but also unable to obtain more in-depth high-semantic features and deep features from the original image. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a facial expression recognition method based on multi-channel fusion and lightweight neural network. First, a cascade classifier based on Haar features is used to detect the face region of the facial expression image. Second, the local binary pattern (LBP) is used to extract the local texture features from the face region. Third, face edge features are simultaneously obtained by performing edge detection in the face region based on the Canny edge detection algorithm. Fourth, the obtained face image, LBP texture feature image, and edge detection Canny image are fused, and the fused image is input into the constructed lightweight neural network for training and recognition. Experiments are carried out on the public image databases Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (Fer2013) and extended Cohn–Kanade (CK +) using the hold-out cross-validation method. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively extracts more complete image features by combining traditional feature extraction algorithms with deep learning feature extraction algorithms, improves the accuracy and robustness of facial expression recognition, and has better recognition rate and generalization ability compared to other mainstream methods.},

  abstract     = {Dual-resource-constrained scheduling problems (DRCSP) have been hotly debated during the last two decades. DRCSPs focus on the causes and consequences of problems arising from improper simultaneous planning of human resources and machines in various industrial sectors, yielding decreasing productivity of industrial factories. This research focuses on time-oriented problems (including makespan, setup, transportation), cost-oriented problems (including execution cost, workforce salary, raw material, maintenance, and repair), workforce-oriented problems (salary, homogeneous workers, overload workers, aged workers, mobile workers) and performance and energy problems in DRCSPs. To this end, special attention is given to the root and reasons for emerging significant issues, such as the lack of machines, system imbalance, material transferring, bottleneck machines, voids, and human resource over-allocation that usually happens during the scheduling of dual-resource-constrained systems. For this purpose, an in-depth analysis has been conducted by reviewing 122 dominant research papers available in the literature from 2006 to 2022. The advantages, limitations, and significant drawbacks of scheduling DRC problems have been discussed for each studied case. This study&#39;s results clarified gaps to be addressed in studied areas of DRCSP, showing that various aspects of workforce, energy, and performance should receive more attention in future research.

  abstract     = {Ensemble methods are advanced learning algorithm proposed for generating base classifiers and accumulating them all together to derive a new classifier which is expected to perform better than the constituent classifier. This study proposes a novel ensemble technique where a base learning classifier is trained repeatedly by using different weightings over the training samples or examples, and the process is governed by the conceptualization of evolutionary processes and the aggregation operators. We utilize the evolutionary technique that can efficiently search a large weighing space for enriching suitable weights (chromosome) to the training samples. For finding an appropriate weighting, the crossover and mutation processes are applied on the weighting space to get the optimized set of weights which is accomplished through different generations. The considered base learning classifier is trained over the training examples along with their respective weightings by utilizing a learning algorithm, and for the finite number of generations, the weights are evolved and optimized through the evolutionary process. All the classifiers obtained in different generations of the evolutionary process are utilized for efficiently building the final ensemble. The set of classifiers obtained in different generations are combined together by utilizing the concept of priority-based averaging aggregation operator by availing priority to different generations. The classifier ensemble is done with two forms of operators: one without priority degree and the other with the priority degree. The proposed classifier ensemble algorithm is tested over the UCI benchmark dataset. The results obtained through the experimental process are more accurate, consistent, and reliable while comparing to other state-of-the-art methods, which ensures the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The deep learning architectures&#39; activation functions play a significant role in processing the data entering the network to provide the most appropriate output. Activation functions (AF) are created by taking into consideration aspects like avoiding model local minima and improving training efficiency. Negative weights and vanishing gradients are frequently taken into account by the AF suggested in the literature. Recently, a number of non-monotonic AF have increasingly replaced previous methods for improving convolutional neural network (CNN) performance. In this study, two novel non-linear non-monotonic activation functions, α­SechSig and α­TanhSig are proposed that can overcome the existing problems. The negative part of α­SechSig and α­TanhSig is non-monotonic and approaches zero as the negative input decreases, allowing the negative part to retain its sparsity while introducing negative activation values and non-zero derivative values. In experimental evaluations, α­SechSig and α­TanhSig activation functions were tested on MNIST, KMNIST, Svhn_Cropped, STL-10, and CIFAR-10 datasets. In addition, better results were obtained than the non-monotonic Swish, Logish, Mish, Smish, and monotonic ReLU, SinLU, and LReLU AF known in the literature. Moreover, the best accuracy score for the αSechSig and αTanhSig activation functions was obtained with MNIST at 0.9959 and 0.9956, respectively.},

Due to the lack of a large amount of failure data, the reliability assessment of the equipment has to rely on the empirical data of experts in the field, which have artificial cognitive uncertainty, and uncertainty theory is an effective mathematical tool to analyze the artificial cognitive data. In the uncertain environment, this paper considers the competing failure processes where the failure threshold is an uncertain variable, calculates the reliability of the device under three different shock models, and compares the reliability of the uncertain thresholds with the reliability of the constant thresholds. The results show that in different periods of equipment operation, the reliability of the uncertain thresholds is different with the reliability of the constant thresholds. If the threshold is simply regarded as a known constant, it will cause inaccuracies in the reliability assessment of the system, miss the best maintenance time, and cause unnecessary losses. Taking the microelectronic mechanical system as an example, the superiority of the proposed model is illustrated.},

  abstract     = {Cross-efficiency (CE) evaluation is an extension of the data envelopment analysis approach that allows decision making units (DMUs) to assess their peers by means of their own appreciation weights. As a result, each DMU is presented with a vector of CE scores, which need to undergo an aggregation operation to yield the ultimate ranking score. The aggregation is commonly carried out through an appropriate aggregation operator. In this paper, we propose an induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator with dual preference setting (2-IOWA) as a new aggregation device. The 2-IOWA aggregation novelty resides in its twined order inducing variables, which are defined by exploiting exclusively the appreciative properties of the CE matrix. The first-order inducing variable is the voting rank order that characterizes the preference voting system embedded within the CE matrix. The corresponding IOWA-level 1 aggregation produces a composite vote for each DMU by employing as arguments the individual votes assigned to it. The second-order inducing variable is represented by these composite votes, which are adopted to induce a common order on the rows of the CE matrix as a part of the IOWA-level 2 aggregation. The 2-IOWA aggregation process is conducted with OWA weights that are generated through different minimax disparity models by using different optimism level values in order to corroborate the influence of subjectivity on the structure of the ranking patterns besides evaluating the robustness of the proposed methodological framework.},

Neural networks based on forgetting memristors can process two different data sets; however, the number of data sets processed is determined by the conversion rate of short-term memory to long-term memory neural network. In this paper, a forgetting memristor model with controllable decay rate is proposed, the short-term memory and long-term memory of the long-term and short-term memory (LSTM) network based on forgetting memristor is proposed, and the conversion speed from short-term memory network to long-term memory network is controllable. In the process of transformation from short-term memory to long-term memory of LSTM network based on forgetting memristor, the decay rate of forgetting memristor can be controlled, and the duration of short-term memory of LSTM network can be set. A reset signal mechanism is proposed so that the state of short-term memory of LSTM network with high recognition rate can be controlled. Based on the proposed controllable decay rate and reset signal, the state of the short-term memory network with high recognition rate can be set, so the LSTM network with two states can realize the recognition of different number of images under different data sets. Finally, two kinds of data sets are tested on the LSTM network based on the forgetting memristor, and the recognition rate is good, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose a automated hyperparameter tuning approach for crack image classification. For this, a public dataset with 40,000 images of walls and floors of several buildings was used. The images are divided into two classes: negative (non-crack) and positive (crack). In this aspect, statistical methods are used for hyperparameter tuning, such as analysis of variance, Scott–Knott method and HyperTuningSK algorithm. Moreover, three new automated machine learning algorithms are proposed: AutoHyperTuningSK, AutoHyperTuningSK-test and AutoHyperTu-ningSK-DA. CNN architecture from the literature (MobileNet) and three types of hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer and data augmentation) are analyzed. In general, the recommended configurations reached the best results in relation to unselected hyperparameters. In this regard, a selected combinations achieved a mean accuracy of around $$99\%$$ (test experiments) in binary crack classification.},

To boost network infrastructure and strong data connection between vehicles in wireless vehicle ad hoc networks, several node auto-configuration schemas and node address-related methodologies were applied. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Node Selection with Opportunistic Routing (DNSOR) a method for reducing the time it takes for information to be forwarded between vehicles in ad hoc networks by taking advantage of the inherent mobility of vehicle relationships. Each vehicle node in an ad hoc network uses a copy of the data from all the other vehicles to calculate the network&#39;s density. Extensive simulation findings show that the suggested methodology outperforms the standard mobility-based routing calculation approaches in vehicle ad hoc networks by increasing QoS while decreasing overhead.},

AI-powered image analysis has opened up new possibilities in healthcare diagnostics, autonomous navigation, and security surveillance, fuelling demand for sophisticated image-processing solutions. This paper describes an innovative approach to AI image processing that combines multi-sensor data fusion with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within a fuzzy neural network framework. This integration uses data from various sensors, including cameras, lidar, and radar, to improve the robustness and precision of image analysis and interpretation. The T–S model serves as the foundation for the information fusion strategy. A comprehensive investigation of deep learning algorithms reveals inherent strengths such as robustness and parallelism. However, it also identifies limitations, particularly in image segmentation tasks, characterized by challenges like premature convergence and prolonged computation times. The paper proposes a quantization technique for deep learning algorithms to address these issues and introduces chaotic optimization to expedite convergence rates. It also presents a novel three-dimensional Otsu threshold segmentation method based on CNNs, which overcomes noise susceptibility in traditional two-dimensional approaches. Integrating Gray morphology and this three-dimensional Otsu threshold segmentation method results in the development of a three-dimensional Gray Otsu model. This model is the basis for designing a fitness function for the CNN algorithm, optimizing its efficacy. Experimental validation demonstrates the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness, achieving an impressive 91\% accuracy rate while displaying robust noise resistance and versatility. Comparative assessments against other leading AI architectures, including multilayer perceptron, radial basis function network, recurrent neural network, and long short-term memory network, affirm the superior performance achieved by the proposed approach.},

Organic agriculture impacts 6 of the 17 Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Strategies to develop organic agriculture have used SWOT and MCDM techniques for analysis. However, the examination of the influence of one strategy over the other strategies has yet to be investigated. This paper proposes a model that combines the existing SWOT analysis with neutrosophic cognitive maps (NCM) models to analyze interconnections among the various strategies obtained from SWOT. This research deploys the proposed SWOT–NCM model to analyze the case study of developing organic farming in Tamil Nadu, India. It offers insights into the strategy’s influence over other strategies so that the best is given maximum importance while implementing organic farming. The framework captures the interconnections and ranks the strategies by order of influence, providing fresh insights by taking the farmers’ perspective while working with the strategies from the SWOT analysis to model an NCM. A comparative analysis of this SWOT–NCM model with other MCDM models that use SWOT to analyze the agriculture problem, and a sensitivity analysis of the proposed model, is performed. According to our study, the best possible strategy to encourage organic farming is minimum support price (MSP) and centralized procurement.

In Pakistan, public health is still a serious concern and the main contributor to morbidity and mortality is infectious diseases. The major issue is a resemblance in the clinical symptoms of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, COVID-19, dengue, and malaria. Early detection of infectious disease is crucial in order to start treatment with counseling and medication. This can only be done if several infections with similar clinical traits can be diagnosed depending on several criteria, including the availability of various kits, the ability to carry out diagnostic procedures, money, and technical staff. But woefully Pakistan’s economy is badly battered due to several circumstances. Therefore, we are unable to provide patients with enough diagnostic testing kits and broadly accessible therapy choices, which makes diagnosis more difficult and create hesitancy with fuzziness and randomness. For this purpose, we introduced the new concept of the complex probabilistic hesitant fuzzy N-soft set. We defined its fundamental operations (like restricted and extended union, restricted and extended intersection, weak, top and bottom weak complements, as well as soft max-AND or soft min-OR) with examples. We also discussed their many properties with their proofs and theorems. Furthermore, we developed the algorithms for decision-making where doctors use the complex probabilistic hesitant fuzzy N-soft information to identify a particular disease. Furthermore, we explained numerical illustration of two case studies. Moreover, a sensitive and comparative analysis is discussed. In the last, we conclude the whole study.},

  abstract     = {This study aimed to improve the truthfulness and efficiency of double auction mechanism in the cloud computing environment. In an auction, bidders have a high incentive to announce an unrealistic price, that is, each cloud user tends to announce a lower price and each cloud service provider tends to bid higher price than the actual one. This untruthful behavior will have catastrophic consequences to the market, leading to participants&#39; fear of being misused. Therefore, it seems vital to provide a mechanism for the realization of truthfulness involving no unrealistic offer by the users. On the other hand, it has been proven that it is not possible to achieve the characteristics of truthfulness, budget balance and economic efficiency at the same time. There is a weak budget balance in a truthful mechanism with a price difference greater than zero between the total price paid by the cloud users and that received by the cloud service providers. In this paper, a mechanism is proposed to encourage participants to offer truthful prices by rewarding honest participants. The proposed called the reward mechanism uses a repository to store bidders&#39; information, including the number of bids and the number of honest bids per auction as well as a ranked list of bidders based on their bidding history in offering honest prices. The results show that the proposed mechanism not only motivates the bidders to announce honest bids, but also solve the problem of weak budget balance by dividing the bid amount among the winning bidders.},

The weights of all levels of indicators were determined by coefficient of variation method, and 24 representative coastal cities in China were evaluated by multi-layer gray correlation method. The evaluation results showed that: the level of synergy in each dimension of 24 coastal cities is uneven, and the distribution level is not high. The level of synergy of marine disaster monitoring and early warning in coastal cities is positively correlated with the level of economic development. The level of synergy of monitoring and early warning of marine disasters in 24 coastal cities is not high, which is generally distributed in medium and low levels. Furthermore, according to the evaluation results and the current situation of marine disaster monitoring and early warning in coastal cities, a network organization structure is proposed to enhance the synergy ability of the monitoring and early warning of coastal cities, so as to provide practical basis for the construction of China&#39;s coastal cities in the global marine disaster monitoring and early warning synergy.},

  abstract     = {Load–frequency control for an islanded microgrid is very important. If a disturbance is applied to an islanded microgrid, the frequency of the system starts to fluctuate and these fluctuations must be damped by the load–frequency control system. The load–frequency control system uses different controllers to improve the damping of frequency fluctuations related to the islanded microgrid. In this article, the number of controllers used in the load–frequency control system related to an islanded two-area microgrid has been reduced, which means less complexity and less cost in the control structure of microgrids. Also, a new control method has been used in the load–frequency control structure related to the two-area microgrid, which is used to dampen the frequency fluctuations of each of the areas related to the two-area microgrid and to dampen the power deviations between the two microgrids. For this purpose, a hybrid Grey Wolf Optimizer and Pattern Search Algorithm (HGWO–PS)-based model predictive controller (new control method) is employed for load frequency control of an islanded two-area microgrid. The numerical simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the presented controller. Different scenarios such as changes in loads and/or variations in the generated power of the wind turbine generator and the photovoltaic system are studied in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, and the performance of the presented HGWO–PS-based MPC controller, the GWO-based MPC, and social-spider optimizer-based proportional–integral–derivative controller are compared using some criteria including the settling time, the peak overshoot and the peak undershoot.

  abstract     = {The study examines the POS tagger&#39;s precise usage of words that are used by Tamil lyricists in their poems. Many NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, and voice recognition, consider POS tagging to be a preparatory step. The POS labels for Tamil words have been determined through several investigations. The research does not look at the precision of the POS tagger for unrecognized keywords or words that do not occur in the lexicon. The practice of categorizing each word in a phrase according to its grammatical function is known as POS tagging. Since the NLP software will come across terms that are not in its lexicon in real-world applications, the presence of unfamiliar words is a common problem in POS tagging. Tamil&#39;s agglutinative structure makes language challenging for computers to understand. In-depth research on Tamil phrases has highlighted the need for more research on Dravidian languages, as well as the process of annotating syntactic categories aimed at apiece word in the corpus, and Tamil POS tagger is generating an annotated corpus for Tamil lyricist lyrics. The Friedman Two-way Analysis of Variance was employed by the writers to learn more about the lyricist&#39;s use of grammar in this context. Linear regression is a data analysis approach that establishes a causal association amid variables by fit a linear model toward the data.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles require accurate, and fast decision-making perception systems to know the driving environment. The 2D object detection is critical in allowing the perception system to know the environment. However, 2D object detection lacks depth information, which are crucial for understanding the driving environment. Therefore, 3D object detection is essential for the perception system of autonomous vehicles to predict the location of objects and understand the driving environment. The 3D object detection also faces challenges because of scale changes, and occlusions. Therefore in this study, a novel object detection method is presented that fuses the complementary information of 2D and 3D object detection to accurately detect objects in autonomous vehicles. Firstly, the aim is to project the 3D-LiDAR data into image space. Secondly, the regional proposal network (RPN) to produce a region of interest (ROI) is utilised. The ROI pooling network is used to map the ROI into ResNet50 feature extractor to get a feature map of fixed size. To accurately predict the dimensions of all the objects, we fuse the features of the 3D-LiDAR with the regional features obtained from camera images. The fused features from 3D-LiDAR and camera images are employed as input to the faster-region based convolution neural network (Faster-RCNN) network for the detection of objects. The assessment results on the KITTI object detection dataset reveal that the method can accurately predict car, van, truck, pedestrian and cyclist with an average precision of 94.59\%, 82.50\%, 79.60\%, 85.31\%, 86.33\%, respectively, which is better than most of the previous methods. Moreover, the average processing time of the proposed method is only 70 ms which meets the real-time demand of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the proposed model runs at 15.8 frames per second (FPS), which is faster than state-of-the-art fusion methods for 3D-LiDAR and camera.},

It necessitates adhering to the concept of sustainable development while pursuing economic development and social progress, improving the effective utilization rate of natural resources, and protecting and improving the ecological environment in which people live. This paper takes the e-commerce trade ecological industrial park in Dalian Economic Development Zone as an example to comprehensively evaluate its sustainable development ability using the state-of-the-art techniques of soft computing. Soft computing has recently gained appeal over traditional hard computing because it can cope with uncertainty just as easily as a human can. The basic aim of the study is to avoid excessive resource and environmental pressure hindering the coordinated development of various subsystems of the park. First, an evaluation index system containing four subsystem elements of the environment, society, economy, and resources was constructed, and the importance of each index in the evaluation index system was calculated. Second, the distance model and fuzzy logic of soft computing were used to comprehensively evaluate the sustainability of the selected industrial park. Six criteria were established to describe the sustainability of the industrial park based on the opinions of industry professionals, with references to the research findings of local and international forerunners. The finding of the paper shows that the development level index of each subsystem of the industrial park has continued to rise, except for a few cases. The result also demonstrates that the overall coordinated development degree of the park has increased year by year from 2010 to 2019. This means that the coordinated development level has improved from the initial barely coordinated level in 2010 to the high-quality coordinated development level in 2019; however, the overall coordinated development degree is still less than 0.9. Through this study, it is possible to judge the sustainable development ability of the four subsystems of the industrial park and whether it meets the relevant standards of resource consumption and environmental protection stipulated by the state. It is of great practical significance for promoting the formation of a good ecological chain between enterprises in the park, realizing resource recycling, and reducing waste discharge.},

Someone can monitor, alter, and divert communication through public infrastructure. Many mHealth applications did not utilize any encryption method for client–server communication, making it an imminent risk for patients&#39; data security and privacy.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to analyze the design and application of a robust learning environment using Chinese as a foreign language in the context of web-based teaching. The study employs a carefully planned environment with cutting-edge educational technology and pedagogical techniques for comprehensive language and cultural learning. It creates a browser/server (B/S) framework for teaching Chinese as a foreign language, including system structure, logical design, database integration, and operations, respectively. Specific features like the five-tier logical framework spanning representation and business logic levels are elaborated. The research also presents a resource model that optimizes user preferences and knowledge links using an adaptive multi-objective particle swarm optimization technique, resulting in an efficient and effective learning system. Finally, this study proposes a system for Teaching and Learning Chinese as a foreign language (TCFL) that uses a client-side browser and a server-side browser. Client-side browser provides access to educational materials. Interaction and navigation by the user lead to content presentation and rendering, which displays text, videos, and interactive features. Data management and retrieval manage user requests and business logic on the server side, drawing from a data repository. The scalability and performance of the proposed TCFL system assure smooth operation, while centralized control and governance manage courses and material. The experimental assessment demonstrates the remarkable performance of the suggested TCFL system across critical criteria. The suggested system outperforms other techniques by achieving outstanding results such as increased learning efficiency of 82.4\%, increased user engagement and interaction rates of 87.3\%, and tailored adaptability with a customization index of 0.865 and adaptive learning rate of 89.5\%. The system’s outstanding technical integration, excellent learning outcome enhancement of 82.4\%, and practical pedagogical techniques highlight its complete and revolutionary design. This work marks a crucial turning point in the history of learning environments for foreigners. It covers critical language acquisition, user engagement, personalization, and adaptation by pioneering a holistic and technology-infused TCFL system. These accomplishments can change foreign language learning and provide the groundwork for future research and innovation in building global optimum and immersive learning environments for learners.},

  abstract     = {These days, exploring information retrieval models is one of the most essential aspects of English sentence retrieval research. These models are driven by diverse retrieval mechanisms that offer varying similarity calculations and directly influence the final result ranking. However, despite decades of work due to technical constraints, deep semantic analysis has been challenging. This gap emphasizes the importance of a precise semantic understanding of information acquisition through learning approaches. Based on the above opening, this paper establishes a fast retrieval model of English sentences based on the statistical language model (SLM). First, the proposed method utilizes SLM to extract significant feature words from the corpus. These feature words are identified by analyzing co-occurrence patterns and frequency distributions within the standard. Second, it employs the N-gram model to calculate the probabilities of word occurrences based on their contextual dependencies. This framework represents feature words and their associated probabilities in a structured manner by capturing the intricate nuances of language semantics. Third, the model integrates ontology to bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding by enabling the mapping natural language expressions to conceptual entities. Finally, the suggested model retrieves English sentences through semantic matching by leveraging the comprehensive semantic framework and ontology-based search. The experimental study revealed that the proposed model demonstrated an impressive retrieval ratio of 98.5\% by outperforming existing models in the comparison. Moreover, these results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, and the accuracy of this algorithm is improved by 7.52\% compared with TF-IDF. When the labelled corpus is very small and the unlabeled corpus is relatively large, the algorithm enhances the classifier’s performance by 12.6\%. This shows that the algorithm used in this paper reduces the influence of the synonym processing stage on the overall performance while retaining the advantages of high precision and accuracy of calculation results.},

In addition, it conducts relevant research on the high-quality simplified representation of computer network graphs based on the effective extraction of structural features and combined with graph sampling techniques. An iterative learning control algorithm based on reference trajectory update is proposed for the tracking control problem of discrete linear control system output subject to non-repetitive perturbation. First, the controller is parametrically optimized by constructing a performance index function to track the system output quickly and accurately at the desired point of reference trajectory update. Second, when the system output is affected by a batch of non-repetitive perturbations, a new performance indicator function is further constructed by introducing a Lagrange multiplier algorithm to establish multi-objective performance indicators to optimize the robust iterative learning controller. Finally, the algorithm is applied to a computer network graph design system, and the simulation results verify the reasonableness and effectiveness of the algorithm. These results show that the suggested technique surpassed the existing approaches with accomplishments such as an average degree of 12.5\%, a clustering coefficient of 65\%, network efficiency of 91\%, and higher modularity, community identification, and network embedding scores.},

  abstract     = {Tennis has gained global popularity, prompting a surge in interest towards 3D video-based tennis motion recognition. Early action recognition, which predates activity completion, is a critical classification task to preempt adverse outcomes. Prior research emphasizes effective feature extraction and modeling for swift, accurate classification, despite limited data availability. To establish a robust foundation, this study introduces an anticipatory action prediction module preceding the recognition component. The module forecasts subsequent motions based on observed ones, using an LSTM-GAN structure to mitigate motion blurring and generate predictions. This paper presents an innovative framework that leverages deep learning, particularly dilated neural networks, for real-time spatio-temporal tennis analysis on standard hardware, aiming to enhance player performance insights and action prediction through TensorFlow. The dilated RNN and CNN are integrated into the recognition module for comprehensive spatiotemporal feature modeling. To foster synergy between the prediction and recognition modules, a hard class mining mechanism is devised to enhance the learning capabilities of challenging class samples. As a result, the LSTM architecture combined with GAN provides an excellent 92.1 Precision, 91.2 Recall, 94.5 F-1 score and 95.0 Accuracy in action recognition and prediction of tennis sport, which is significantly higher than classical models i.e. GAN, Conv3DJ, Co-occurrence LSTM, and GAN + L1 + Mining.},

This paper used the capabilities of one of the powerful paradigms of ML called reinforcement learning (RL) and soft computing to improve the warehouse automation process while taking market demands into account. Since stackers and Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV) are the main participants in this automation process, we focused on these two in our research to enhance the warehouse logistic scheduling process as a whole. To accomplish this, we collected historical data related to warehouse operation from the warehouse environment, such as AGV and stacker moments, inventory level, job execution time, and other pertinent factors. We first created an RF-based model using the Q-learning technique, one of the RF approaches, before using these data for the model training. The model designing is accomplished by first formulating the logistic scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the warehouse system changes between states and takes actions to maximize a cumulative reward over time. After that, we performed a number of operations, including state representation, action space definition, and reward design, to transform the problem into a format that the Q-learning approach can handle. In four experiments, the design model is trained using the data that has been collected up to 100 episodes. The proposed model is further improved with soft computing approaches such as fuzzy control methods. We utilized MATLAB and Plant simulation software to conduct the experiments. The results of the proposed model are thoroughly evaluated and compared with already existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of technology, institutes are now managing police records by using digital systems. These systems collect data from numerous individuals and create big-data repositories. However, the risks associated with data tampering or leakage highlight the need for strong management strategies. Existing electronic archives have experienced data loss, tampering, and unauthorized disclosure, emphasizing the urgency of reforming police data management practices. Blockchain technology offers promising solutions for securing employer information owing to its traceability and resistance to tampering. However, the application of blockchain technology in police data management poses challenges. The limitations of blockchain in storage capacity and processing speed hinder the handling of vast datasets. We propose a police–data management system that utilizes blockchain technology. Our innovative approach integrates both on-chain and off-chain storage mechanisms, effectively eliminating concerns related to data security and insufficient storage capacity. We created a prototype system to validate the feasibility of using a blockchain for managing information. With this system, users can easily perform operations, such as data queries, additions, modifications, and data tracking. We are also exploring the synergies between blockchain and big data and envision a powerful combination of technologies that can further improve the security and efficiency of police data management. The proposed system represents a strategic response to the challenges of contemporary data management. By innovatively combining the blockchain&#39;s strength with a nuanced storage model, we formulated a robust system to transform police information management and security. We have compared our proposed framework with different schemes that demonstrate that our scheme is highly secure to deal with different attacks that can be deployed in different environments.},

  abstract     = {Cold-chain logistics presents significant challenges to sustainable development in terms of economics, society, and the environment. To address this issue, this paper focuses on solving a real-world problem—the multipath location-routing problem-based cold-chain logistics (MPLRPCCL), which considers soft time windows and heterogeneous fleets. The mathematical model aims to optimize the total logistics costs, including fuel consumption, carbon emissions, cargo deterioration, penalties, operating depots, and renting fleets. To effectively solve this problem, the paper proposes three versions of a memetic algorithm (MA) that incorporate control modules for monitoring the MA’s performance and improving its global optimization performance. Computational evaluations were conducted, and the results show that the proposed algorithms are effective and outperform the classic MA framework. Furthermore, the proposed model and algorithms were applied to real-world cases in Hangzhou city, China, demonstrating their practical applicability. Overall, this paper offers a promising approach to tackling the complex challenges posed by cold-chain logistics and contributes to the sustainable development of this important field.},

With many causes of human fastest lifestyle, different metro cities of India are polluted daily. Air pollution is the most significant societal problem in metropolitan cities in India. People have various health issues due to the air pollution problem in the metro cities. Kolkata is not an exception because Kolkata is India’s second most polluted metro city. With decision-making approaches, we can reduce air pollution in a city. So making the proper decision is the primary focus of reducing air pollution problems. We can easily discover the most affected causes of air pollution in this city through the decision-making approaches. Therefore, we have developed a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique and applied it to the air pollution model in Kolkata city. The main contribution of this research is that we invented a possibilistic ranking index of bipolar fuzzy (BpF) numbers based on the possibilistic mean and variance and applied it to the air pollution model. Using the possibilistic ranking index determined the criteria weight of air pollution MCDM model under BpF environment. Due to many uncertainty and negative aspects, the alternative information BpF numbers consider the air pollution MCDM model. The BpF numbers deal with both positive and negative aspects of the causes of pollution in the air pollution MCDM model. By BpF environment, the possibilistic index ranking method efficiently solves the air pollution MCDM model. Finally, a numerical illustration has been presented to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of our suggested approach.},

This paper discusses the shelf display space partition assignment decision for low-temperature dairy items with two-phase demand in remaining shelf-life to maximize the profit of the shelf. Two-phase demand is assumed for the first time based on the knowledge that consumers’ perception on the quality of the dairy item is unequal to its true shelf-life. Moreover, considering shelf partitions in different heights carry different sale gaining potentials, three profit weights are given to the partitions. Herein, a new research model named as SPSPA of shelf profit space partition assignment for the low-temperature stored dairy items is constructed. To effectively solve the proposed SPSPA, a hybrid firefly particle swarm optimization (HFPSO) is developed combing the superiority of particle swarm optimization (PSO) in coarse search and firefly algorithm (FA) in fine search. Numerical experiments have been performed on small- and large-scale cases to verify the performance of the proposed HFPSO algorithm by comparing with genetic algorithm, differential evolution (DE), PSO, and FA based on which management insights are obtained for the shelf space assignment decision.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is the greatest threat to humanity, with harmful broad-spectrum impacts to human health and the natural environment. One of the main causes of this change is the greenhouse effect caused by greenhouse gases (GHG). To limit the impact of GHG to the environment, it is necessary to control emissions from human-produced sources. To date, 192 out of 197 parties at the Paris Agreement have approved ratification to reduce GHG in their countries. However, to properly control the emissions of GHG, accurate and precise forecasts of emissions are necessary. A wide variety of statistical models, computational intelligence and experience curves have been applied in an attempt to provide both accurate and precise forecasts. In this paper, a hybrid model is proposed that combines a fuzzy autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA), a probabilistic neural network (PNN), and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), where the first two models seek to exceed both the limitations of the ARIMA models (linear behavior and great need for data) and FARIMA (wide forecast ranges) alone. The ANFIS model is applied to the results of the first two to improve the overall accuracy of the models. We apply the proposed model in the context of eight Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay). The results show improvement with MAE, RMSE and RMSRE reduced by more than 90\% against comparison models. Additionally, when using performance indices such as the Willmott index of agreement, values close to 1 are obtained. It is concluded that the proposed hybrid model reduces the forecast interval width and increases the accuracy of the forecast by applying ANFIS, overcoming the results of FARIMA and PNN alone which delivered precise but not accurate results. Finally, emissions are forecast for 2025 and 2050 in the aforementioned countries, observing that GHG emissions increase in the region without adhering to the Paris Agreement commitments, which indicates the importance of these countries taking measures in order to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases.},

  abstract     = {Due to the multimodal nature of real-world optimization problems, in recent years, there has been a great interest in multi-modal optimization algorithms. Multimodal optimization problems involve identifying multiple local/global optima. Niching techniques have been widely used to tackle multi-modal optimization problems. Most of the existing niching methods either require predefined niching parameters or extra information about the problem space. This paper presents a novel multimodal algorithm based on Butterfly Optimization Algorithm, which is constructed using the Fitness-Distance Balance (FDB) selection method. The purpose of applying the FDB selection method is to discover local/global optima with high potential as a fitness value along with the appropriate distance from solution candidates. Also, a local search scheme is used to enhance the convergence speed of the algorithm. Niching is a technique used in multimodal optimization to maintain diversity among multiple solutions in the population. The minimum distance between the solutions is called a “niche”. The proper niching radius is the main challenge for existing approaches. Knowing the problem space helps determine the niche radius. This paper proposes a new multimodal optimization scheme that does not require prior knowledge of the problem space or the niching parameter. Seven state-of-the-art multi-modal optimization algorithms are compared to the multi-modal butterfly optimization algorithm (MBOA) on 16 benchmarks from the CEC 2013 and CEC 2015 competitions to evaluate its performance. Success rate, Number of function evaluations, Success performance, average number of optima found, Success accuracy, Maximum peak ratio, and Run-time performance criteria were measured over 25 runs to assess the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that MBOA outperforms other algorithms according to most of the performance criteria.},

  abstract     = {The basic salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is a novel nature-inspired swarm intelligence optimization algorithm based on the foraging behavior of salp individuals in the deep sea. Since its development, the salp swarm algorithm has attracted widespread interest from scholars both at home and abroad for solving complex real-world practical problems. With continuous research, the SSA algorithm has revealed some shortcomings such as slow convergence speed and low accuracy. To enhance the optimization capability of the algorithm, in this paper, we propose an improved hybrid algorithm called TLSSA based on two phases of the teaching–learning-based optimization method: the teaching phase and the learner phase. In the teaching phase, students&#39; ability is improved by updating the difference between the teacher and the class average level, which helps to improve the overall learning ability of the salp population, resulting in higher quality solutions. In the learning phase, by simulating the discussion, statement, and communication between students, the average level of the individual is improved, and the global search speed of the algorithm is accelerated. To verify the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method, it is first tested on 30 IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark functions. The test results demonstrate that the proposed TLSSA method obtains better overall performance compared to 8 mainstream meta-heuristics and 8 advanced algorithms. After that, we applied the proposed method to solve two classical real-world engineering design problems and feature selection. Again, the experimental results show that our method has significant advantages over the traditional methods in solving these practical problems. The remarkable performance of our proposed improved TLSSA algorithm in solving theoretical and practical complex optimization problems also provides potential possibilities for applying more intelligent optimization algorithms to solve complex optimization problems in real-life situations in the future.},

In many projects, the amounts of the work content for the activities are specified, while the activities are executed in different modes of discrete duration and resource consumption per time. This paper focuses on this specific generalization of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem, known as the discrete time/resource trade-off problem (DTRTP). An efficient mathematical model for the DTRTP with renewable resource types is presented. Since this problem is NP-hard, a hybrid heuristic/meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the deterministic model in large sizes. Then, a critical chain project management approach is employed to handle the uncertainty of activities’ work contents. Finally, several numerical examples based on the previous studies and generated examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed procedure. The proposed hybrid algorithm for deterministic cases is statistically compared with an existing exact optimization tool. The simulation-based statistical analyses showed that the proposed hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm could find global optimums for small-sized cases in shorter run times. While the exact solver cannot solve medium- and large-sized problems, the proposed nested algorithm reaches high-quality local solutions in suitable run times. Also, the simulations indicated that the proposed project scheduling can face uncertainty, at least in 77\% of the cases.},

  abstract     = {Classification of medical data is largely dependent on the effective identification of key features of the data that can be used to aid in the diagnosis of related diseases. This goal can be achieved through feature selection methods that endeavor to get rid of redundant and irrelevant features to ameliorate classification accuracy. This is the aim of this work where a new meta-heuristic, referred to as snake optimizer, was adopted for the purpose of boosting the performance of existing feature selection methods. This optimizer may smoothly fall into local optimal solutions, which may present weak search performance and slow convergence speeds in handling feature selection problems. On this basis, this paper presents three improved adaptive versions of this optimizer, each of which has increased search performance over the basic optimizer. This optimizer was improved using three mathematical models named exponential, power, and delayed S-shaped, to create three methods, referred to as exponential, power, and delayed S-shaped snake optimizers, respectively. These proposed versions were also matured to have more balance between exploration and exploitation aspects. Then, binary variants of these optimizers were evolved to solve feature selection problems using the k-nearest neighbor classifier. To verify the efficacy of these binary optimizers, 24 datasets were used, and then compared with other feature selection optimizers. The experimental results obviously manifested the efficiency of the proposed optimizers in realizing the optimal feature set by achieving utmost accuracy and minimal number of features in the majority of the studied datasets. The proposed binary power snake optimizer outperformed all other competitors in 13, 10, 8, 8, and 12 datasets in respect of classification accuracy, number of chosen attributes, specificity, sensitivity, and fitness scores, respectively. Out of the 24 datasets taken into consideration, the results on 12, 6, and 8 datasets, respectively, showed that this proposed optimizer presented performance scores of more than 90\% in respect of sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity metrics.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs), multiple conflicting objectives and hundreds even thousands of decision variables are contained. Therefore, it is a great challenge to address LSMOPs due to the curse of dimensionality. To tackle LSMOPs, this paper proposes a resource allocation-based multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, decision variables are firstly divided into convergence-related variables and diversity-related variables by the proposed layer thickness-based variable classification (LTVC) method. Then, a resource allocation-based convergence optimization strategy is introduced for the convergence-related variables, which can allocate more computational resource to the sub-component with the best contribution. For the diversity-related variables, diversity optimization technique is adopted. Finally, the experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm has a competitive performance compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Government intervention (e.g., subsidy for green production, Cap-and-Trade Policy (CTP)) is a crucial component for diminishing carbon emissions due to manufacturing of new products and recycling of used products. In this study, we investigate the long-term decentralized behavior of supply chain members and the evolutionary stable decision of the government to intervene in price and sales effort competition among retailers. More precisely, through an evolutionary game theoretic framework, we look for the non-cooperative behavior of the population of retailers investing in sales efforts towards the manufacturer who invests in green level of the products, under government intervention and CTP. The model is further extended to analyze the evolutionary behavior of the population of government whether it intervenes or not in the same situation. Our study demonstrates that the whole population of retailers adopts the retailer-led Stackelberg strategy to deal with the manufacturer, and the most significant finding is that, in such a situation, government intervention is always favorable regardless of what the supply chain decides. Numerical results exhibit that whenever retailers dominate the market, it becomes beneficial for both retailers as well as the entire supply chain, and the environmental performance of the product also increases compared to the vertical Nash scenario.},

Traffic sign recognition is a difficult task due to their multiple shapes, sizes, color, occlusions and complicated driving scenes. For automatic traffic signs and classification, a robust and efficient system is needed with a highly accurate prediction rate. Therefore, a novel goat-based convolutional neural–Kalman framework (GbCN-KF) is proposed to detect the traffic signs for smart cities. Primarily, the input traffic sign images are noise-filtered by the Kalman function and the relative features for the recognition process were extracted. Further, traffic signs are recognized by matching the features with the trained set and classified using the goat fitness function. The system is tested with the BTSC and GTSRB database. The performance score was evaluated for the datasets and compared with the prevailing recognition models. The model recorded a high accuracy percentage of 99.89\% and 99.94\% for the tested BTSC and GTSRB datasets.},

  abstract     = {The function of most multi-objective algorithms (MOEAs) is to provide an overall trade-off Pareto front to the decision makers (DMs). But DMs actually tend to have a preference for a specific subset of the Pareto front. So combing decision makers’ preference information with many-objective optimization methods has recently been a hot survey topic in the research field of many-objective optimization. The preference-inspired coevolutionary algorithms using goal vectors (PICEA-g) coevolve a family of decision makers’ preferences called preference set together with a population of candidate solutions. It is a classic and effective algorithm, but it has shortcomings in distribution and there is a waste of computing resources. So we use a sparse autoencoder as a controller to perform feature processing on the target solution set in the process of coordinated evolution and modify the fitness assignment formula to improve the diversity. The combination of PICEA-g and sparse autoencoder framework enhance the convergence and expand the ability of the PICEA-g algorithm. The preference-inspired coevolutionary algorithm with sparse autoencoder (PICEA-g/SAE) is evaluated by three widely used benchmark suites and compared with nine classic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to prove the advantages of the sparse autoencoder framework. The experimental results show that PICEA-g/SAE could have a good performance on many DTLZ test problems. Moreover, PICEA-g/SAE on UF1-9 and WFG1-9 test problems in low dimensions could have good convergence, diversity, and spread compared with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multi-objective optimization is a field that has experienced a rapid growth in the last two decades. Although an important number of new multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been designed and implemented by the scientific community, the popular Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) remains as a widely used baseline for algorithm performance comparison purposes and applied to different engineering problems. Since every evolutionary algorithm needs several parameters to be set up in order to operate, parameter control constitutes a crucial task for obtaining an effective and efficient performance in its execution. However, despite the advancements in parameter control for evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II has been mainly used in the literature with fine-tuned static parameters. This paper introduces a novel and computationally lightweight self-adaptation mechanism for controlling the distribution index parameter of the polynomial mutation operator usually employed by NSGA-II in particular and by multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in general. Additionally, the classical NSGA-II using polynomial mutation with a static distribution index is compared with this new version utilizing a self-adapted parameter. The experiments carried out over twenty-five benchmark problems show that the proposed modified NSGA-II with a self-adaptive mutator outperforms its static counterpart in more than 75\% of the problems using three quality metrics (hypervolume, generalized spread, and modified inverted generational distance).},

  abstract     = {In order to solve the problems of insufficient optimization accuracy, slow convergence speed and easy to fall into local optimum in the whale optimization algorithm, this paper proposes a whale optimization algorithm with improved neighborhood search strategy. First, the algorithm generates a more evenly distributed and higher-quality initial population through an initialization strategy based on the opposite-based learning of pinhole imaging to expand the early search space of the algorithm. Secondly, it adopts improved neighborhood search strategy based on similarity and uses Mahalanobis distance and the law of universal gravitation to calculate and rank the similarity of solutions. At the same time, the algorithm counts the times of convergence oscillation. According to the algorithm iteration process, it selects the corresponding similarity ranking solution as the object to update the position and performs the second position update for the solution with most times of oscillation, so as to implement the space exploration of the target population to speed up the convergence of the algorithm and enhance the ability to jump out of the local optimum. Finally, an adaptive step size adjustment strategy is introduced, and the population convergence is adjusted using adaptive step size parameters according to the algorithm optimization process to improve the algorithm’s global search performance and avoid premature convergence of the algorithm. The improved algorithm proposed in this paper is analyzed and compared with the sine–cosine optimization algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm and three improved whale algorithms on a set of 20 test functions in low-dimensional and high-dimensional, respectively, and perform ANOVA and T-test on the simulation results. The results show that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper effectively improves the convergence accuracy and convergence speed. In addition, the improved optimization algorithm proposed in this paper is applied to the engineering optimization design. The solutions show that the improved algorithm can obtain the optimal value with higher accuracy and more stability than other algorithms, and can effectively solve the engineering design problem.},

  abstract     = {In the last few decades, technological improvements have had a considerable impact on education, much like many other fields of society and human endeavor. The applications of today’s cutting-edge technology are numerous in education, but recently researchers focused on using these technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), for students’ performance prediction prior to the exam. It makes perfect sense to forecast student success to help all participants in the educational process. Student performance prediction may assist them in the selection of suitable courses and in creating their academic schedules. Keeping in mind the importance of student performance evaluation, this paper analyzes the prediction rate of college English level 4 by using one of the powerful ML algorithms called random forest (RF). RF uses numerous classifiers, or “ensembles”, rather than just one classifier, and is based on the decision tree technique. To do this, we constructed input and output variables and collected data for these variables, including basic student information (gender, ethnicity, major), English scores on college admission exams, college English scores (total of four semesters), and extracurricular activities of college students. Preprocessing was performed on the collected data, which included the removal of unnecessary attributes, handling outliers, normalization, and data cleaning. After the preprocessing, the features were extracted and transformed into reduced dimensionality by the local-preserving projection (LPP) algorithm. From the extracted features, we selected only the most relevant in order to feed them as input to the RF model. The model is implemented in MATLAB in order to evaluate its performance. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated with the help of experiments in order to verify the effectiveness of the model. The performance of the RF algorithm-based college English IV pass rate prediction model is evaluated by computing the prediction accuracy, recall rate, and hit rate of the classification results. We achieved a prediction accuracy of 96.5\%, a recall rate of 89.5\%, and a hit rate of 93.3\%. The results show that the random RF-based prediction model for college English level 4 has a good classification effect and that the prediction results are more accurate.},

  abstract     = {Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about underlying population(s) using sample data to either confirm or falsify hypotheses. However, the complexity of real-life problems often makes the underlying statistical models inadequate, as information is often imprecise in many respects. To address this common problem, some papers have been published on modifications and extensions of test concepts by employing tools of fuzzy statistics. In this paper, we present a non-parametric test for the difference between quantiles of two independent populations based on fuzzy random variables. For this purpose, we consider the fuzzy quantile function and its estimation based on $$\alpha $$ -values of fuzzy random variables. We then provide a fuzzy test based on the fuzzy empirical distribution function for the difference of fuzzy order statistics from these independent populations. We also suggest a specific degree-based criterion to compare the fuzzy test statistics at a specific significance level to decide whether the underlying fuzzy null hypothesis can be rejected or not. The effectiveness of the proposed two-sample test on quantiles is investigated via numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a new aggregation operator, called the continuous triangular fuzzy generalized ordered weighted averaging (CTF-GOWA) operator, is proposed for aggregating triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). In order to adapt to the uncertainty and complexity of prediction, a differential polymerization method is used, and a special form of CTF-GOWA operator is generated. In particular, the special cases of control parameters and basic unit monotone functions introduced in information aggregation are discussed and its credibility is verified. In addition, the CTF-GOWA operator is applied to the aggregation of multiple TFNs, and various aggregation operators are obtained, including the weighted CTF-GOWA (WCTF-GOWA) operator, the ordered WCTF-GOWA (OWCTF-GOWA) operator, and the combined CTF-GOWA (CCTF-GOWA) operator. Later, the induced variables are added to the OWCTF-GOWA operator to obtain the induced OWCTF-GOWA (IOWCTF-GOWA) operator, which is combined with the cosine similarity degree to construct a combined prediction model about the TFNs. The proposed model has the advantages of less computation, high accuracy, and more adaptability to the actual situation. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is verified by illustrative examples. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are also implemented to assess the stability and validity of our method.},

  abstract     = {The world has seen a ground-breaking development in the utilization of digital images and their applications in modern society. Practically, digital images which are captured in hazy weather and the variable smoke concentration in the industrial scene cause blurring in the observed digital images. In this paper, a smoke removal algorithm based on dark channel prior (DCP) which study the issue of medium transmission inaccuracy is proposed. According to the traditional DCP, atmospheric light in the entire digital image as a global constant and suggested by DCP is further enhanced by utilizing second-generation wavelets filter (SGWs) and as a result, more accurate model is achieved. Consequently, the SGWs filtering is used to improve the solution of atmospheric light and combining the concentration evaluation to obtain the weight of smoke. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against several state-of- the-art smoke removal methods. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method restores clear images with richer details and more natural colors for smoke free images in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio PSNR, the structural similarity index SSIM and the average gradient assessments. Moreover, the execution efficiency of the proposed algorithm is compared with several smoke removal methods where the proposed method has very low computational latency and increased slowly with the improvement of image resolution.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications has increased the demand for efficient and energy-aware task scheduling in fog-cloud environments. This paper presents a novel multi-objective energy efficient task scheduling based reinforcement learning (MEETS-RL) model for fog-cloud IIoT-based systems. The IIoT, fog, and cloud are the three layers obtained in the proposed method. Tasks are captured from various industries through industrial devices such as actuators, sensors, and control systems placed near fog nodes. The task classification stage utilizes the ID3 algorithm to classify tasks based on their priority, Quality of Service (QoS), and processing requirements. After classification, appropriate fog nodes are selected for task execution considering factors such as energy consumption, processing capabilities, and proximity to IIoT devices. The unhandled task in fog nodes is offloaded to cloud data centers using the first fit (FF) algorithm, based on available resources, QoS requirements, and fog node location. Once the suitable fog nodes or cloud data centers have been identified, the tasks are scheduled for execution using a reinforcement learning-based task scheduling algorithm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed MEETS-RL model outperforms existing task scheduling models, including first come first serve (FCFS), greedy for energy (GfE), shortest job first (SJF), round Robin (RR), and Laxity based priority with Ant colony system (LBP-ACS). The experimental results of the proposed architecture showed an accuracy rate of 98.8\%, task completion rate of 95\% and energy consumption of 0.4 J. The proposed architecture offers a comprehensive solution for modern IIoT systems demanding flexibility, scalability, and efficient resource management while enhancing energy efficiency through the application of reinforcement learning in task scheduling.},

Numerous linguistically valued facts from the actual world have been modeled using the fuzzy linguistic approach. To solve the problem of association rule mining with fuzzy linguistic information, this paper proposes an association rule mining approach based on fuzzy linguistic attribute partial ordered structure diagram (FL-APOSD). First, complex relationships between linguistic values in association rule mining are represented by fuzzy linguistic association nodes and association paths via FL-APOSD. On this basis, the maximum frequent attribute set is mined from the FL-APOSD, and then the non-redundancy association rules are extracted. Second, to show the information hidden in the rules and help users to deeply understand the mining results, a fuzzy linguistic association rule visualization approach is proposed to convert the association rules into the FL-APOSD-based knowledge representation. Finally, experimental results on real-world datasets show the proposed approach’s high efficiency, outperforming two relevant state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {The relevance of data fusion in handling big data in blockchain-enabled healthcare systems is of utmost importance in today&#39;s data-driven healthcare landscape. As healthcare systems continue to generate vast amounts of data from various sources, the need to effectively manage and analyze this data becomes crucial for informed decision-making, improved patient outcomes, and efficient healthcare operations. The gaps for time complexity and inaccuracy of feature fusion in the existing algorithms have been identified by surveying the existing literature and this article is proposing a multi-attribute feature fusion algorithm blockchain communications based on ant colony neural networks (ACNN) to overcome the problems in the state-of-the-arts. This article applies the feature decomposition method for communication between blockchain-based healthcare transactions, and optimizes the information based on the data characteristics. The proposed algorithm identifies the properties and attributes of the data by making use of rough set theory. A genetic algorithm is also used to improve the ACNN which enhances the search ability by minimizing the space complexity of the solution space. The multi-attribute fusion mechanism extracts the information from the blockchain transactions and filters out the characteristics of data using the proposed method, and achieves better accuracy. The empirical results show that the fusion error of the blockchain communications based on multi-attribute feature fusion algorithm is relatively small and stable. The outcomes of the proposed fusion mechanism are promising and it has been found that the proposed mechanism produces accurate results with minimal errors. The average energy consumption rate during the transition of data is below 2\% which reflects the viability of the proposed fusion mechanism for blockchain-based healthcare transactions.},

  abstract     = {Music expresses thoughts and emotions in artistic form and is made up of different components including harmony, rhythm, and melody. Several musical elements are tied together during the songwriting process in order to generate melodies that are harmonic. A music melody is the essential element of any music to generate strong feelings from listeners and capture their interest. In the process of music appreciation, melody controls the emotional changes of music. It is an efficiently perceived part and the tone of a song. In recent years, Sichuan unvoiced music has developed rapidly and attracted much attention. This paper selects Sichuan unvoiced music as the main research theme and constructs a melody generation algorithm by utilizing the state-of-the-art techniques of deep learning (DL) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) such as recurrent neural network-long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) and genetic algorithm (GA). Firstly, this paper briefly describes the concept of DL algorithms, the deep generation model, and sequence to sequence model, as they constitute the technological foundation for this research. Secondly, this paper proposes a melody generation algorithm that utilizes RNN-LSTM for melody generation and GA for melody optimization. More specifically, the melody is generated by preprocessing data, creating, and training the RNN-LSTM model. A GA was used to determine the melodic fitness function for eight songs as the fitness function directly affects the selected termination condition. The fitness function can be thought of as either a person or an evolutionary rule. Finally, the average score of these songs, before and after evolution, is calculated, which demonstrates that the analysis and rotation creation methods are more precise and that the song’s average melody score is higher. The method proposed in this study has been thoroughly compared to the existing approaches proposed in earlier studies, and it was found that the approach we propose is more effective in terms of accuracy and the average melody score.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides brand-new technical support and a broader resource platform for college oral English teaching and evaluation. The advancement of science, technology, and networks has resulted in significant educational changes. Because of these, the demand for English instruction is rising quickly, along with the level of cultural integration. However, due to the limits of conventional teaching techniques and the slow expansion of information technology, oral English classes have been discarded and discontinued for a long time. Based on the preceding, this paper first addresses the shortcomings of traditional college-level spoken English instruction by exposing content and timing deficiencies. It then describes how spoken English data are collected, preprocessed, and framed before being standardized for consistency. After that, this paper uses mapping recognition results using a DBN speech model and correlation coefficients in the evaluation. In addition, it uses the Pairwise Variability Index in rhythm evaluation to assess stress distribution differences between test and standard pronunciation. Besides the above, the proposed approach uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization inside statistical learning to improve phoneme recognition and reliability, especially when dealing with difficult-to-distinguish phoneme sets. Further analysis is carried out using neural networks, which include excitation functions and error computations. Finally, the complete design emphasizes user-centric functional characteristics such as practicability, user needs, and robust system management subsystems. Experiments suggest that the natural language processing-based oral English teaching mode can increase students&#39; overall oral English skills. These results reveal that students&#39; excitement increased by 33.3\%, their verbal fluency increased by 86\%, and their vocabulary learning increased by 16.1\%. The results show that this method can effectively assist students in learning oral English.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we presented a novel hybrid artificial intelligence method for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in the Kalaleh Watershed, Golestan Province, Iran. This method uses rotation forests (RF) as a Meta classifier based on Java decision trees (J48), as a base classifier named RF–J48. The created model was compared to some benchmark models, such as the J48, the open-source naive Bayes tree, and the reduced error pruning tree (REPTree). Locations of 260 different landslides were found and mapped. Additionally, it was split into training data (70\%) and testing data (30\%) for spatial modeling and validation analysis. Twelve landslide effective factors were chosen for the landslide susceptibility mapping process based on a literature review and the results of the multicollinearity evaluation (LSM). The approximate percentage of high LS over the Kalaleh Watershed catchment for four models is RF–J48 = 19.92\%, J48 = 15.87\%, NBTree = 20.13\% and REPTree = 16.76\%, respectively. The LS model is evaluated through the methods of TSS, efficiency, and kappa index methods on the training and validation datasets, shown in Fig. 8. Efficiency values computed using validation data/training data for each model is NBTree = 0.855/0.908, J48 = 0.868/0.911, REPTree = 0.862/0.877, and RF–J48 = 0.875/0.992, respectively. The Kappa index for each model has shown significant accuracy. The index values are maximum for the ensemble model RF–J48 of 0.537 and 0.88 for validation and training data.},

  abstract     = {Biomedical Event Causal Relation Extraction (BECRE) is a challenging task in biological information extraction and plays a crucial role to serve for knowledge base and knowledge graph construction. Here a biomedical cause-effect relation is defined as an association between two events and requires that the cause-event must occur before the effect-event. Some current advances tend to apply deep learning for the BECRE task and have achieved comparable performances. However, because most of event causal relations are implicitly stated, the performances of these works based on contextual semantics and syntactics might be limited. This fact suggests that it is necessary to introduce external cues to improve the performance of the implicit BECRE especially in the low source scenario. To improve the potential of the designed model, an intuitive idea is to introduce hierarchical knowledge from biological knowledge bases to supplement domain cues for the contexts. Nevertheless, it is difficult to learn the hierarchy and cause-effect direction of knowledge in the model and also few works focus on this issue. Thus, to better fuse knowledge, we propose a Graph Edge-Cluster Attention Network (GECANet) for the BECRE task. Specifically, we introduce external knowledge and build hierarchical knowledge graphs for the contexts. Also, the proposed GECANet effectively aggregates the context and hierarchical knowledge semantics under the guidance of cause-effect direction. The experimental results confirm that fusing external knowledge can effectively guide the model to identify event causal relations and facilitate our approach to achieve state-of-the-art performances respectively on the Hpowell and BioCause datasets.},

  abstract     = {Learning-centered emotions have a significant role in the cognitive process in learning. For this reason, it is relevant that virtual learning environments consider the cognitive and affective aspects of the student. Methods of artificial intelligence such as the recognition of facial expressions, and sentimental analysis have proven to be an excellent alternative in the automatic recognition of emotions. However, learning-centered emotions and opinion-based sentiment dataset commonly contain single modalities. At the same time, single modalities cannot effectively represent complex emotions in real life. This work presents three different fusion methods applied to three image-based and text-based dataset for learning-centered emotion recognition. Using some conventional deep learning architectures, the three new multimodal datasets showed promising results when compared with similar architectures trained in unimodal information. The improvement of one of the methods (embedding-based representation) was 4\% compared to single-modality hyperparameter optimization. The main objective of this study is to benchmark the viability of semantic fusion of multimodal learning-centered emotional data from the different datasets for intelligent tutoring system applications.},

  abstract     = {Increasing spectrum efficiency in new-generation communication networks is possible by raising the operating frequencies or increasing the number of serving cells. Both of the solutions indirectly lead to a decrease in the cell size. By shrinking the coverage area of the cells, the mobility management becomes a critical issue in order to provide seamless connectivity. The main tool for mobility management in connected mode is the handover procedure, which conventionally is triggered based on the user equipment’s (UE’s) measurements of serving and neighboring cells’ signal quality. The performance of the methods provided in the 3GPP standard for setting up the handover is based on a comparison between the quality of the received signal from the serving cell and the neighbor cells, which is severely sensitive to the appropriate setting of threshold values and waiting time for setting up the handover. The remarkable methods in the literature to improve the handover performance in the 3GPP standard either utilize positional information or are based on complex algorithms. Positional information parameters such as speed, location, direction of movement, etc., need extra measurement modules. Also, complex algorithms like deep learning are not suitable for a wide range of active devices in 5 G networks with limited resources. In this paper, a novel fuzzy logic-based method is proposed to trigger the handover procedure based on estimated serving cell’s and neighbor cells’ radio link quality (RLQ) values. The proposed system consists of two stages. A second-order regressor beside a simple fuzzy logic system is introduced to predict the serving cell’s and neighbor cells’ RLQ. The final handover trigger decision is made with the help of another cascade fuzzy logic system, which is responsible for eliminating too-early, too-late, and ping-pong handovers. Considering the uncertainty handling feature of the interval type II fuzzy logic systems versus type I, we implement both methods and compare their results. Finally, we simulate the proposed algorithm using the ns-3 LTE module with a very tight setting for detecting radio link failure to meet 5 G strict standards. Proposed method succeeded in improving the performance of the handover process at high-speed scenarios by 50\%, only with the help of radio link quality information. The main advantage of the proposed method is the proper management of the handover procedure, independent of UE’s velocity, as well as its simple structure with few rules, which makes it suitable for use in UAV and IoT devices.},

  abstract     = {Controlling complex nonlinear dynamical systems using traditional methods has always been a difficult task because the majority of systems seen in nature have intricate nonlinear mathematical relationships. Artificial neural network (ANN) models are a good option for handling such intricate nonlinear systems since they include a number of significant properties like faster learning, adaptation, parallel processing, and nonlinear mapping capabilities. Several recurrent neural networks (RNNs)-based controllers have been suggested in the literature for implementing adaptive control, but the majority of these models have extremely complex topologies and many of them are challenging to train. In this paper, an attempt is made to put forward the RNN model (called as higher-order recurrent neural network (HORNN)) which is based on a higher order Pi-Sigma neural network (PSNN) model and implemented for the indirect adaptive control of the nonlinear dynamical system. The parameters of the proposed controller are tuned using the gradient-descent-based asynchronous back-propagation (BP) method. The proposed controller consists of two additional internal feedback loop layers (denoted by $$FL_{1}$$ and $$FL_{2}$$ ) corresponding to the hidden and the output layer, respectively. The nodes present in $$FL_{1}$$ and $$FL_{2}$$ layers are having weighted connections with the hidden and the output layer neurons, respectively, and these feedback connections enrich the controller with a memory property. The second contribution of the paper is to improve the performance of the learning algorithm which is achieved by incorporating an adaptive learning rate scheme (that ensures the correct setting of the learning rate value in each iteration). Another advantage of the HORNN-based controller is that it is only provided with three inputs irrespective of the dynamics of the plant and only 3 hidden neurons are included in its hidden layer (this reduces the overall structural complexity of the proposed model). The performance of the HORNN-based controller is compared with some of the popular neural networks such as diagonal recurrent neural network (DRNN), Jordan recurrent neural network (JRNN), feed-forward neural network (FFNN), and PSNN. Through simulation experiments, it is observed that the response obtained from the plant under HORNN-based controller is found to be better as compared to responses obtained with other ANN-based controllers. Further, the instantaneous mean square error (IMSE) obtained with HORNN-based controller is quite less and is equal to 0.058 as compared to 0.077, 0.082, 1.74, 13.43, and 1.86 with DRNN, JRNN, PSNN, FFNN, and FFNN (with 30 hidden neurons)-based controllers, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Compressing the image causes less memory to be used to store the images. Compressing images increases the transmission speed of compressed images in the network. Vector quantization (VQ) is one of the image compression methods. The challenge of the vector quantization method for compression is the non-optimization of the codebooks. Codebook optimization increases the quality of compressed images and reduces the volume of compressed images. Various methods of swarm intelligence and meta-heuristics are used to improve the vector quantization algorithm, but using meta-heuristic methods based on mathematical sciences has less history. This paper uses an improved sine–cosine algorithm (SCA) version to optimize the vector quantization algorithm and reduce the compression error. The reason for using the SCA algorithm in image compression is the balance between the search for exploration and exploitation search by sine and cosine functions, which makes it less likely to get caught in local optima. The proposed method to reduce the calculation error of the SCA algorithm uses spiral trigonometric functions and a new mathematical helix. The proposed method searches for optimal solutions with spiral and snail searches, increasing the chances of finding more optimal solutions. The proposed method aims to find a more optimal codebook by the improved version of SCA in the VQ compression algorithm. The advantage of the proposed method is finding optimal codebooks and increasing the quality of compressed images. The proposed method implementing in MATLAB software, and experiments showed that the proposed method&#39;s PSNR index improves the VQ algorithm&#39;s ratio by 13.73\%. Evaluations show that the proposed method&#39;s PSNR index of compressed images is higher and better than PBM, CS-LBG, FA-LBG, BA-LBG, HBMO-LBG, QPSO-LBG, and PSO-LBG. The result shows that the proposed method (or ISCA-LBG) has less time complexity than HHO and WOA compression algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Monitoring control of industrial systems is essential for the good productivity and safety of installations and operators, with better performance that must be guaranteed. This is often challenging due to the nonlinearities and dynamic complexities of these systems, adding operating constraints and instability. Hence, the multi-models constitute then an adapted tool for the modeling of the nonlinear systems to characterize their dynamic behaviors. Indeed, this work proposes the implementation of a hybrid identification approach of the operating variables of a gas turbine, thus making it possible to interconnect the various linear sub-models with decoupled states in order to generate the global output of their nonlinear model, from the exploitation in real time of the turbine&#39;s input/output data. However, the suggested decoupled-state multi-model approach offers an interesting alternative to the optimization procedure of the estimated turbine parameters. By using gradient and Gauss–Newton algorithms, improved by genetic algorithms combined with NSGA-II in hybrid form, in order to converge toward the best solutions with an optimal cost function, the obtained implementation results show that this approach allows the convergence of the estimated turbine variables and describes its behavior in real time, with the guaranteed efficiency of the proposed decoupled state multi-model method.},

The peak detection method, implemented in LabVIEW, can be used to detect epileptic activity. Because it reduces erroneous detection, this method is more efficient than manual detection. This research demonstrates epileptic activity by detecting peaks in an EEG database that contains both epileptic and non-epileptic EEG waves from online websites such as the Child Mind Institute and pre-processed EEG datasets. A total of 150 EEG waves were examined, with 25 displaying epileptiform abnormalities and the remaining 125 being completely normal.

Different types of teachings and methods are envisioned and implemented to achieve this milestone. These methods include therapy and counseling, stress management, mediation, physical activities and creative activities. Music teaching is one of the methods that is used to improve the quality of human mental health. Initially, this research study defines the music teachings and the methods utilized for imparting music teachings. It elaborates on the importance of mental health, issues due to mental health, and their causes in college students. Second, it studies the relationship between music teachings and human physiology. It presents theories of human physiology and algorithms for measuring the quality of human mental health. Third, this study evaluates the impact of music teachings on the mental growth of adolescents and performs statistical analysis using big data in a three-tier fashion. It consists of the Assessment Session Check-In mental health test model, mental health analysis theory, and theory of favorable environment. The study also incorporates the 90-category symptom self-assessment analysis (SCL-90) and the self-measurement health rating analysis calculation method and uses SQL Server for statistical implementation. Finally, an evaluation study compares adolescents with and without music teachings using three parameters, i.e., physical health, mental health, and physiology. The statistical results are compared with results obtained from the existing statistical methods, which reveal that mental health gains are visible, with music study students outperforming ordinary students by 20\% on the SCL-90 and having 14\% higher mental health index scores. The comprehensive mental health score shows a significant 18\% improvement over time. After two years of music instruction, the number of psychologically unwell pupils dropped by 28\%, and extreme psychological issues has substantially decreased by 50\% or more. This study can significantly improve students’ understanding and approach to mental health, particularly in music education. It provides compelling evidence of the positive impact of music study on mental well-being, potentially influencing educational practices and policies.},

The monotonicity of the possibilistic mean and possibilistic variance are presented by the first-order derivative and illustrated with figures in detail. In addition, we discuss the investors’ attitudes by using different parameter values and their influences on the mean and variance. Then, we construct an equal-weighted model, a mean–variance model, and a regret minimization model with TPCFN, respectively. We carry out a sensitivity analysis to explore the parametric influence on the model’s solution. At the same time, we compare different models with the same parameter values. Finally, we use a numerical example to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed models. We compare the performance of the three models by five indexes (annual return, Sharpe ratio, beta value, unsystematic risk, and alpha value). The results show that optimistic investors can obtain more gains in the three models. Our minimization model considering the regret factor outperforms the mean–variance model and the equal-weighted portfolio in returns when the parameter values are the same.},

  abstract     = {Traditional mathematical models for supplier evaluation and selection have primarily focused on cost-oriented perspectives, neglecting non-cost factors such as strategic and relational measures. However, such models have often compromised the optimality of solutions. Additionally, the use of genetic algorithms in these models has resulted in similar objective function outputs with minimal differences, making it challenging to differentiate between potential suppliers. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach that employs multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques to evaluate suppliers without sacrificing optimality or imposing additional constraints. The proposed model utilizes hybrid algorithms and incorporates the weighted criteria obtained through the Best–Worst Method and the ranking and selection of alternatives using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. By applying MCDM methods in the post-evaluation phase, this research introduces a unique approach that preserves solution optimality. The findings highlight that while the objective function outputs from the genetic algorithm implementations may be nearly identical, they can vary significantly across other criteria. This study demonstrates the strength of multi-criteria evaluation in overcoming the limitations of genetic algorithms without compromising solution optimality.},

The properties of this new ranking function have also been extensively studied. We develop the Charnes–Cooper–Rhodes models in the context of SVTrNNs to measure the efficiency of homogeneous DMUs. Additionally, we propose a unique solution process by incorporating the newly developed ranking function, which allows for the conversion of the neutrosophic DEA model into a corresponding Crisp LP model. This approach offers an efficient and effective tool of measuring the DMU efficiency in a neutrosophic environment. The reference set or peer group is defined for inefficient DMUs, which enables them to improve their efficiency score by following their peers. Two different approaches are suggested as potential ways to completely rank the DMUs, i.e., the reference set- and the super-efficiency-score-based ranking approaches. The validity and existence of the proposed models are demonstrated by providing an illustrative example, and the results are compared to an existing approach. The proposed Neu-DEA model is employed to assess the efficiency of the 12 major seaports in India, and it yields superior outcomes compared to the currently existing models.},

Efficient scheduling strategies can help governments and production managers to control the raised environmental concerns resulting from this problem. The goal of this research is to address a green scheduling problem for unrelated parallel batch processes, as a group of highly energy-intensive machines, by considering the emission reduction regulation for the first time. To this aim, two new cases of unrelated parallel batch processing machine scheduling problems under the tax and cap-and-trade policies are defined. The problems are formulated using a mixed-integer linear mathematical model, where the goal is to minimize the makespan and total cost of the production system simultaneously. The total cost objective function includes the earliness and tardiness penalties, machine purchasing costs, and carbon emission costs. Also, several other features, such as setup time, release time, and the machines&#39; purchasing decisions, are considered to provide a more realistic framework. As a solution approach, an interactive fuzzy programming method is presented to establish the single-objective counterpart of the models. Moreover, regarding the complexity of the problem, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and multiobjective gray wolf optimizer (MOGWO) algorithms are utilized as two multiobjective metaheuristics algorithms for large-size instances, for which the parameters are calibrated using the Taguchi design of experiments. Extensive analyses are established by solving several numerical instances. The outputs prove the superiority of the presented framework compared to the traditional models. The results also demonstrate that the newly developed cases can reduce the total cost of the production system by about 5.87 and 0.56\% under the tax and cap-and-trade regulations, respectively. Besides, the statistical analysis of the results shows that NSGA-II outperforms the MOGWO algorithm for both cases.},

  abstract     = {The reliability of flip-chip packages is significantly impacted by the type of packaging materials, such as underfill, solder, flux, and solder mask. Underfill reduces the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the semiconductor chip and printed circuit board, thereby minimizing the chances of thermal fatigue failure of the package. There are a plethora of underfill suppliers and selecting the most suitable underfill for preparing a flip-chip package is critical as there are conflicting criteria. These criteria are limited to glass transition temperature (Tg), CTE, elastic modulus (E), coefficient of moisture expansion, fracture toughness (Kic), shear strength, and flowability. Choosing appropriate alternatives based on the above conflicting criteria is basically a multi-criteria problem. This research proposes a grey simplified best–worst method (GSBWM) to identify the criteria weight. The proposed method has less calculation complexity than the previous grey best–worst methods, and it does not need operations research and modeling knowledge, and optimization software to solve it. The accuracy of the GSBWM is investigated using three data sets. The results showed the high accuracy of the proposed method in all data sets. This study employed the combination of GSBWM and a grey possibility degree based method to select the most suitable underfill material for reliable flip-chip packages as a real-world problem.},

To address these concerning issues, this paper proposes a hybrid particle swarm-differential evolution algorithm (HPSDE). Firstly, to enhance the optimization performance, a modified updating scheme named particle-swarm mutation strategy is designed and an improved control parameters adaption is developed. Then, DE/rand-to-rand/1 mutation strategy is adopted to increase the population diversity and enhance the ability of particles escaping away from local optima. To achieve an improved DE variant with rapid convergence and fine stability, a random mutation framework is designed to combine the two mutation strategies mentioned above. To evaluate the efficiency of HPSDE algorithm, four different experiments have been taken on twenty-nine benchmark functions. The numerical results validate that HPSDE has better overall performance than the other competitors. Additionally, HPSDE is successfully applied to solve five typical engineering optimization problems.},

As is known to all, the degree reduction of ball NURBS ones is mathematically an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently by swarm intelligence algorithm. In this paper, an improved artificial rabbits optimization (ARO) is used to accomplish the optimal multi-degree reduction of the ball curves. Firstly, by incorporating mutation strategy, adaptive group strategy and Elite-feedback strategy to the ARO, the improved ARO named IARO is developed to increase the population diversity and enhance its capability of jumping out of the local minima. Secondly, the superiority of IARO is comprehensively verified by comparing with the original ARO and numerous celebrated and newly developed algorithms on the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC, for short) 2017 benchmark functions. Meanwhile, the statistical testing of IARO has been conducted to validate its significance. Finally, by minimizing the distance between the original curve and the approximate curve, the optimization models of multi-degree reduction for ball NURBS curves are established. The IARO is utilized to solve the optimization models, and the optimal approximate ball NURBS curves are obtained. Some representative numerical examples illustrate the ability of the proposed IARO in effectively solving the multi-degree reduction problem of ball NURBS curves in terms of precision, robustness, and convergence characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Recently, environmental concerns have drawn worldwide attention. As a result, the international communities have put pressure on both governments and industries to develop environmental conservation policies and green products, respectively. Also, the consumers’ environmental awareness has increased to the point that today’s consumers consider the greenness of the products in addition to the purchase price. In this study, we consider an industry consisting of two manufacturers that compete over selling price and carbon emissions, while the government levies a carbon emissions tax. We formulate the problem using a game-theoretic approach assuming the leader–follower relationship between the government and industry. The manufacturers maximize their profits, while the government maximizes three components: social welfare, environmental conservation, and revenues. We study the problem in two different settings: one in which the manufacturers have similar powers (Nash) and one in which one manufacturer is the leader in the market (Stackelberg). We find that superiority in production technology or a lower unit production cost does not necessarily lead to a lower selling price and that the outcome depends on the carbon emission tax rate. Based on a numerical experiment, government intervention reduces the total carbon emissions by more than almost half in both settings. We also found that an industry with Nash structure is preferred from the perspective of the consumers.},

  abstract     = {Renewable resources are a crucial component in power system research within contemporary intelligent power systems. It is imperative that they are given meticulous consideration. Microgrids (MGs) have emerged as a solution to facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources on a large scale. The incorporation of power production innovations that exhibit high levels of unpredictability in their generation would have a notable impact on the management of power resource planning within microgrids. Therefore, it is imperative to implement efficient power management mechanisms in microgrids. This study introduces a scheduling arrangement for a microgrid (MG) that includes a solar power unit (PV), which operates on a day-ahead basis. This paper explores the effects of various weather variables on the power generated by photovoltaic units and the optimum scheduling of microgrids. The present study employs the modified fluid search optimization algorithm to address the challenge of optimum management of energy in a microgrid connected to the grid that is characterized by a high level of unpredictability. The simulation results of the study indicate that the implementation of a photovoltaic model in an actual setting enhances the precision of the system for managing energy and reduces the overall operational costs of the interconnected microgrid. The algorithm under focus has been evaluated on a standard MG. The method under consideration has been executed on the MATLAB/Simulink computational environment and its efficacy has been evaluated.},

Due to the limitations of such methods, optimal problems have been commonly defined in single-objective and quadratic forms, leading to non-optimal solutions based on the main design requirements. In order to address these issues, this paper presents a new type of genetic programming (GP) called “multi-objective archived-based genetic programming (MAGP)”. The absolute forms of cost functions, which are unsolvable using the conventional methods, could be assessed herein through the suggested algorithm. It is shown that in addition to the possibility of obtaining optimal single-objective solutions, It is shown that in addition to the possibility of obtaining optimal single-objective solutions, some very fruitful non-dominant solutions on the Pareto fronts would be acquired, providing the designer with a set of optimal analytical solutions which could be selected depending on the design requirements. For example, in the case studies examined in this paper, around 30,000 and 14,000 non-dominant solutions were obtained for linear and nonlinear problems, respectively, indicating the high performance of the novel proposed MAGP algorithm in acquiring non-dominant solutions in optimization problems. Generally, it is observed that obtaining and comparing optimal solutions in the quadratic form are basically unreliable and as a consequence, an optimal control problem must be analyzed in its absolute form of indices.},

These problems can be thought of as nonlinear, non-convex, and highly constrained optimization problems with a large number of local minima. To cope with the above issues in solving such problems, a new meta-heuristic named capuchin search algorithm was adopted. To boost the search performance of this algorithm as well as to mitigate its early convergence and regression to the local optimum, it was hybridized with another algorithm and improved using several positive amendments. First, a memory element was added to this algorithm to ameliorate its position and velocity update mechanisms in order to exploit the most encouraging candidate solutions. Second, two adaptive parametric functions were used to manage the exploration and exploitation features of this algorithm and balance them appropriately. Finally, the hybridization was made using the gradient-based optimizer to strengthen the intensification ability of this algorithm and balance its searching ability to fulfill sensible search performance. The proficiency of the proposed algorithm was divulged by assessing it on computationally difficult economic load dispatch problems under 6 different tests with a generator of 3, 13, 40, 80, and 140 units, each with different constraints and load conditions. The proposed algorithm provided the best performance among many other competitors. Its superiority and practicality were revealed by obtaining optimal solutions for large-scale test cases such as 40-unit and 140-unit test systems.},

  abstract     = {Hyper-heuristic is a crucial answer to how problem-specific heuristics can be selected or generated automatically for solving different optimization problems. However, selecting a low-level heuristics algorithm has complicated designing for the efficient hyper-heuristic algorithm. This paper presents a new design of a hyper-heuristic (NHH) algorithm to address this limitation. In NHH, the population is divided into two different types of individuals. The first group is explorative, while the second group is exploitative. The NHH incorporates three components, which are a hybrid vector-based operator, an adaptive selection operator and a behavioral schema. In the hybrid vector-based operator, four low-level operators with different characteristics are incorporated which are divided into two groups explorative or exploitative operators. It enables NHH to apply different search strategies during the optimization process. An adaptive selection operator which is called an adaptive selection based on the individual situation (ASIS), assigns one of the four operators of hybrid vector-based operator to each individual based on their role (explorative and exploitative) and simplified Q-learning. The NHH’s behavioral schema is developed inspired by the human social behavioral schema. This supportive operator includes progress, hard-working, adventure, and changing. Individuals adopt them during the search process which helps the algorithm to better execute different problems. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 35 well-known benchmark functions and CEC 2017 test suite. The performance comparison with the other comparative 11 algorithms verified the reliability of the proposed algorithm.},

Recently, inertial technique has been widely used in various algorithms to accelerate its convergence speed and enhance the numerical performance. There are a lot of convergence analyses for solving the convex optimization problems by combining inertial technique with ADMM, while the research on the nonconvex cases is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose an algorithm framework of inertial regularized ADMM (iRADMM) for a class of two-block nonconvex optimization problems. Under some assumptions, we establish the subsequential and global convergence of the proposed method. Furthermore, we apply the iRADMM to solve the signal recovery, image reconstruction and SCAD penalty problem. The numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the iRADMM algorithm and also illustrate the effectiveness of the introduced inertial term.},

Green scheduling is acknowledged as an effective weapon to reduce energy consumption in the industrial sectors. Therefore, this paper is devoted to the green scheduling of flexible manufacturing cells (FMC) with auto-guided vehicle transportation, where conflict-free routing of the vehicles is considered. To deal with this problem, a bi-objective optimization model is proposed to achieve the minimization of the maximum completion time and the total energy consumption in an FMC. The studied problem is an extension of flexible job shop problem which is NP-hard. Thus, an improved bi-objective salp swarm algorithm based on decomposition (IMOSSA/D) is proposed and applied to the problem. The approach is based on the decomposition of the bi-objective problem. Salp swarm intelligence along with three stochastic-distribution-based operators are incorporated into the approach, to enhance and balance its exploring and exploiting ability. Computational experiments are performed to compare the proposed approach with two state-of-the-art algorithms. This study allows the decision makers to better trade-off between energy savings and production efficiency in flexible manufacturing cellular environment.},

Firstly, an enhanced HHO (EHHO) model is developed to solve single-objective optimisation problems (SOPs). EHHO is then further extended to a multi-objective EHHO (MO-EHHO) model to solve multi-objective optimisation problems (MOPs). In EHHO, a nonlinear exploration factor is formulated to replace the original linear exploration method, which improves the exploration capability and facilitate the transition from exploration to exploitation. In addition, the Differential Evolution (DE) scheme is incorporated into EHHO to generate diverse individuals. To replace the DE mutation factor, a chaos strategy that increases randomness to cover wider search areas is adopted. The non-dominated sorting method with the crowding distance is leveraged in MO-EHHO, while a mutation mechanism is employed to increase the diversity of individuals in the external archive for addressing MOPs. Benchmark SOPs and MOPs are used to evaluate EHHO and MO-EHHO models, respectively. The sign test is employed to ascertain the performance of EHHO and MO-EHHO from the statistical perspective. Based on the average ranking method, EHHO and MO-EHHO indicate their efficacy in tackling SOPs and MOPs, as compared with those from the original HHO algorithm, its variants, and many other established evolutionary algorithms.},

The interaction between players and the nonlinearity of the system make it difficult to solve the Hamiltonian function directly. From a linear regression perspective, this paper regards any admissible control and its corresponding value function as the input and output affected by perturbations. By using RLS to process the current data and store the historical data’s covariance matrix to adjust the weights, the calculation is greatly simplified by avoiding the space waste caused by a lot of historical data storage and the time waste caused by data collection. When calculating the cumulative error, a discount factor is introduced to avoid the total error value tending to infinity and the effect of historical policy evaluation, where the covariance matrix tends to zero and loses its adjustment effect. When the error of the Hamiltonian equation is zero, the proposed adjustment law will also tend to zero. After that, the stability of the covariance matrix was analysed as well as the convergence of the weight errors was proved. Finally, two simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm based on the RLS method for solving the Nash equilibrium solution online.},

The convergence of the search solutions in the NCA was also accelerated by the random, adaptive parameters and hyperbolic function. A set of 68 test benchmark functions with (30, 100, 500, and 1000) dimensions was used to examine the NCA&#39;s effectiveness in terms of exploration, exploitation, local optimality avoidance, population fitness enhancement, and convergence rate. Firstly, the proposed NCA&#39;s behaviour is examined using a collection of 23 standard well-known benchmark functions, including unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimensional functions. Secondly, the proposed NCA&#39;s superiority is examined using the IEEE CEC-2015 and IEEE CEC-2017 benchmark suites. In addition to qualitatively examine NCA&#39;s superiority over other metaheuristics, Friedman and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests are performed. In terms of performance metrics, NCA ranked first. For application perspective, the NCA is tested on eight real-world constrained and unconstrained engineering design problems from IEEE CEC-2020 real-world optimization benchmark suits.

  abstract     = {Automatic tooth arrangement and path planning play an essential role in computer-aided orthodontic treatment. However, state-of-the-art methods have some shortcomings: low efficiency, excessive cost of displacements or collisions and insufficient accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative orthodontic path planning method based on the improved gray wolf optimization algorithm, which is called OPP-IGWO. First, the tooth model is preprocessed to obtain initial pose in which each tooth is segmented and built up with an oriented bounding box. Next, the target pose of each tooth is determined through the ideal dental arch curve and the optimal jaw principle. Finally, the path from the initial pose to the target pose of each tooth is planned based on IGWO, which is improved mainly from three aspects: (1) The greedy idea is adopted to initialize the gray wolf population based on dental interpolation. (2) The linear convergence factor in the traditional gray wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) is replaced with a nonlinear convergence factor. (3) We propose a position update strategy based on a dynamic weighting approach, which introduces a learning rate for each gray wolf. The experimental results show that our OPP-IGWO method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Compared with improved genetic algorithm, multiparticle improved swarm optimization, normal simplified mean particle swarm optimization algorithm, improved artificial bee colony algorithm, chaotic gray wolf optimization algorithm, hybrid gray wolf optimization algorithm and differential evolution algorithm, random walk gray wolf Optimization algorithm and reinforcement learning gray wolf optimization algorithm, the OPP-IGWO has an improvement on performance by 15.46\%, 2.24\%, 7.18\%, 15.99\%, 7.67\%, 1.01\%, 1.42\%, 10.23\%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The active distribution network (ADN) integrated optimization is the optimization of the system using three optimization techniques: reconfiguration, reactive power optimization and optimal configuration of distributed generation. This study establishes an optimization model of the renewable energy ADN and proposes a novel multi-objective bald eagle search algorithm to optimize the model. This study integrates three techniques of network reconfiguration, reactive power optimization and optimal configuration of distributed power sources to establish a comprehensive optimization model of ADN, which aims to reduce ADN energy losses, improve active distribution network power quality and economic efficiency. The contributions are as follows: (1) a multi-objective bald eagle search algorithm is proposed to deal with the complex nonlinear ADN integrated optimization problem, and its superiority is verified; (2) an ADN integrated optimization model is established; and (3) multiple scenarios are established in the IEEE33 node system for comparison and validation to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can effectively improve the ADN operation with power loss, node voltage deviation and system cost reduced by 86.34\%, 83.12\% and 30.27\%. The proposed algorism improves the power quality of ADN and promotes economic production and sustainable energy development.},

However, the energy crisis and COVID-19 recovery (declined cases of COVID-19 infection, flight recovery, manufacturing restart, and increasing import and export trading) could affect carbon efficiency. Therefore, this paper combines the fuzzy regression discontinuity and random forest algorithm (RF-FRD method) to estimate the discontinuity of the energy crisis and COVID-19 recovery on carbon efficiency. The findings show that discontinuity points in carbon efficiency were induced by the energy crisis and COVID-19 recovery. The positive treatment effect at the first discontinuity point proves that the “zero-tolerance” policies effectively promote carbon efficiency. Besides, the negative treatment effect at the second discontinuity point proves that electricity rationing has not always improved carbon efficiency during the energy crisis.},

To address the limitations of DSP implementation, an alternative digital hardware programmable device called FPGAs are being largely used for digital implementation of algorithms with higher computational speed and accuracy. The proposed work is inspired by this quality of FPGAs and aims to take advantage of reliable performance of fuzzy PI controllers with its complexity and having no considerable impact on processing speed. Here, fast and novel design approach for rapid prototyping of fuzzy PI controller for stirred tank heater is presented thoroughly.

To accomplish this task, this study proposes a partial-consensus and unequal-authority fuzzy collaborative intelligence approach. In the proposed methodology, each evaluator first uses fuzzy geometric mean (FGM) to derive the fuzzy priorities of criteria for assessing the performance of each robotic application. Subsequently, considering the unequal authority levels of evaluators and the lack of an overall consensus, the partial-consensus fuzzy weighted intersection (PCFWI) operator is proposed to aggregate the derivation results. Finally, alpha-cut operations (ACO)-based fuzzy weighted average (FWA) is applied to evaluate the overall performance of each robotic application. The partial-consensus and unequal-authority fuzzy collaborative intelligence approach have been applied to assess the overall performances of four robotic applications amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the experimental results, the Xenex LightStrike robot was named the #1 robotics application during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the Brain Navi Nasal Swab Robot. Furthermore, the proposed methodology outperforms three existing methods by up to 21\% in preserving evaluators’ original judgments.},

A typical method to improve combination rule is to assign the conflict to the total ignorance set $$\varTheta $$ . However, it does not make full use of conflict information. A novel combination rule is proposed in this paper, which assigns the conflicting mass to the power set (ACTP). Compared with modifying data model, the advantage of the proposed method is the sequential fusion, which greatly decrease computational complexity. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, some numerical examples are given.

This paper suggests employing q-rung orthopair fuzzy number (q-ROFN) for improving the fuzzy QFD approach. The proposed q-ROFN based QFD method uses q-ROFN to adjust the importance degrees of CRs based the relationships between CRs and DRs with the help of the correlations and relationships of CRs and DRs. q-ROFN presents more information than numbers such as intuitionistic fuzzy number and Pythagorean fuzzy number about the correlations and relationships of CRs and DRs.

VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOm-promisno Resenje) approach based on q-ROFN is also used to rank DRs. The proposed integrated method provides a novel decision support model for the natural gas pipeline project (NGPP) risk assessment. There is no study about the integration of Fine-Kinney, q-ROFN-based QFD, VIKOR methods. The most significant DR and the second most important DR for NGPP risk assessment are electrical sparks and coating type factor, respectively.

The proposed adaptive fuzzy semi-parametric regression model comprises sub-model formulation and approximates the observed fuzzy outputs from the outside employing neural networks computation, such that the proposed adaptive fuzzy regression model better explains the inherent dependence and vagueness that exist in a given dataset. Using the cross-validation criterion and absolute deviation-based distance measures for LR-type fuzzy numbers, a target function optimization problem of constructing the adaptive fuzzy semi-parametric regression is performed by solving the smooth function, bandwidth of kernel function, and regression coefficients. This strategy significantly increases the goodness of fit for the proposed algorithm and offers a dependence framework among magnitude and uncertainty for the fuzzy regression model. We also use three formula measures to evaluate the fit quality of the regression results within each membership function as well as in the center or spread tendency property, respectively. The proposed algorithm is numerically evaluated on three experimental examples including a simulation study and two practical cases to prove its practicality and efficiency. Comparative analyses of our proposed method are provided to support its cogency, and the results show that our proposed model is more effective and stable than some other existing fuzzy regressions.},

When any client changes their document, designs present in help are altered, and it is imperative to refresh them in setup data handling frameworks. Considering the unchanging nature of the text, it is a mind-boggling undertaking to refresh the changed substance in web-related applications. Making computerized antiques is one of the significant issues to be evident and solid in updated content.

  abstract     = {Many highways are acquiring smart transportation systems to improve traffic efficiency, safety and management. Intelligent transportation systems can monitor traffic congestion by providing estimated time of arrival or suggesting a diversion route. However, due to the chaotic complexity of the highway traffic road network and the short-term mobility of the population, traffic flow prediction is affected by many complex factors, and the development of an effective traffic flow forecasting system is very challenging. This paper establishes a novel framework to enhance the prediction of highway traffic flow based on the integration of Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Gaussian Mixture Model (CEEMD-GMM). Firstly, the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose and reduce the noise of traffic flow data. The empirical modal components are combined by calculating the sample entropy (SE), which makes the time series stable and reduces the time cost of forecasting. Secondly, the histogram of oriented gradient (HoG) is computed to extract the distinct features of various traffic flows and enhance the traffic flow prediction. Furthermore, the highway traffic data is classified using Gaussian mixture model to realize the feature extraction of different types of highway traffics. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and average correlation. The model is extensively verified using traffic flow data under individual weather conditions and different traffic flow datasets. Compared with the traditional support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and Adaboost algorithms, the proposed model shows 2.90\% MAE, 6.07\% RMSE, 0.38\% MAPE and average correlation coefficient of 0.74 for traffic flow detection. It is concluded that the model can predict the highways traffic flow with high accuracy as compared to other contemporary models.},

It analyzes the efficacy of college students’ sports learning using data mining to clarify the Apriori and decision tree algorithms. It addresses students’ sports perceptions, cognitive interventions for sports health and health standards in college physical education. This paper evaluates the intervention’s success based on sports value cognition, sports need cognition and sports attitude recognition to improve student performance. The analysis of undergraduate students’ post-intervention scores revealed a considerable rise in these areas, with the experimental group scoring 14.2 and the control group scoring 11.53. The specific scores for sports value cognition were 17.86 and 15.7, while those for sports attitudes and cognition were 11.28 and 9.56, respectively. The impact of the cognitive intervention is further analyzed concerning body shape and physical fitness. The results reveal that a higher proportion of students in the intervention group engaged in physical exercise than the control group, especially with more than three weekly exercise sessions. The intervention and control groups’ participation rates were 20.2\% and 6.75\%, respectively. Notably, the intervention group demonstrated a higher proportion (5.78\%) of students engaging in five or more physical exercises per week than the control group (1.95\%).},

  abstract     = {These days, improving students’ learning and work efficiency needs a comprehensive approach to their physical and mental well-being, which emphasizes the critical role of teachers and institutions. To optimize the responsibilities of physical teachers and coaches, efficient administration of physical education, including sports activities, and a strong quality assurance system are required. Based on the above, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based sports management system to enhance work efficiency and ease of physical education teachers and coaches. It aims to make an in-depth study on the construction of sports performance management and physical analysis system based on data mining; later, it includes the construction of sports management systems. This paper operates in such a way that it first discusses the sports performance management and physical analysis system&#39;s construction. Second, it analyses the overall framework structure of the system by presenting a detailed description of the sports test management and test items management. In addition, it analyses sports performance management and sports performance, system management and physical performance and other functional modules contained in the system along with the database design in the system based on C4.5 that is then used as the Decision Tree (DT) Classifier for data mining. Third, it uses sports performance management of DT, and the physical analysis algorithm uses the data information gained to select the split attributes. Fourth, it divides the sports performance training data set into multiple sub-datasets to construct the performance management and physical analysis system based on data mining. Finally, the suggested system is compared with existing approaches and obtains an accuracy of 97\%, which is 27\% high than the selected approaches. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method has high accuracy in data mining related to sports performance and can effectively improve the efficiency and quality of physical education teachers. The proposed system will be an addition to intelligent task management with high feasibility and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The growing impact of ecological theories and environmental preservation has resulted in a movement towards people-oriented design approaches for ecological landscape creation. However, certain university campuses continue to suffer hardships due to underutilized terrains and severe damage caused by large-scale earthworks. Given the new waves of campus growth, there is an urgent need to address these difficulties and consider the planning and design of natural biological landscapes on various campuses of Jiangsu province. A more scientific approach to maintaining ecological balance, protecting biodiversity, and increasing landscape variation on campuses may be taken by combining ecological environment conservation with university landscape design. Based on summarizing and analyzing previous research, this paper takes the Nanjing Communications Institute of Technology as a case study and expounds on the research status and significance of university campus landscape design in Jiangsu Province. Firstly, this study elaborates on the background, current status and future challenges of the concept of ecological environment protection, introduces the study objects, indicators and constituent elements of landscape design of the university campus, and conducts the ecological analysis. Secondly, this paper uses regression analysis to investigate the complex interactions between ecological features and the Ecological Balance Index (EBI) in university campus landscape design. Our suggested design reveals links between various design aspects and overall ecological-aesthetic attributes Inspired by the Principle of Landscape Diversity Design. In addition, we quantified landscape diversity and spatial optimization using the Shannon Diversity Index and Space Utilization Efficiency. Third, this research analyzes the space and visual forms of the landscape on the university campus and proposes a landscape design model for it using ecological environment protection. Third, it explores the expression methods of ecological environment protection and conducts the space division and index selection of landscape design. Finally, this paper discusses the landscape design approaches for university campuses to protect the ecological environment. In experimental work, the paper evaluates and compares several landscape design methodologies. Our proposed design exceeded previous approaches in terms of ecological balance (83\%), aesthetic appeal (91\%), and sustainability (93\%). The proposed design is beneficial in protecting the environment and improving the overall quality of university campuses. These findings provide useful insights and references for future study in landscape design for university campuses in Jiangsu Province under the ecological environment preservation paradigm.},

This paper aims to conduct in-depth research on how customer behavior is affected by the perception of customers in a shared economic environment. This study develops a research model to examine the effect of customer-perceived value on consumer behavior using the shared car as an example and introduces the definition of customer-perceived value variables and variable measurement in detail. In this study, we proposed a questionnaire design and pre-test, after which the research model was modified accordingly. Following the development of the conceptual model of perceived value, a quantitative approach to user cognitive assessment based on fuzzy logic is recommended. The subjective nature of the perceptions collected from various consumers is transformed into fuzzy values using fuzzy logic, and using a membership function, these fuzzy values are linked to a fuzzy set. Then, these fuzzy values are deduced using a comprehensive evaluation model, which is part of our whole proposed model for customer-perceived value evaluation. A comparative analysis of the experimental results is carried out, which shows the method proposed in this paper has high reliability and innovation and can effectively enhance the user’s sense of experience.},

We have considered both parabolic reaction diffusion and parabolic convection diffusion type of problems in this paper. The solution of this class of problem is polluted by a small dissipative parameter, due to which solution often shows boundary and interior layers. A sequence of approximate analytic solution for the above class of problems is constructed using Lagrange multiplier approach. Within a general frame work, the Lagrange multiplier is optimally obtained using variational theory. The sequence of approximate analytical solutions so obtained is proved to converge the exact solution of the problem. To demonstrate the proposed method’s efficiency and accuracy, linear and nonlinear test problems have been taken into account. From numerical experiments, it is observed that the proposed method is highly accurate, straightforward.},

The model&#39;s precision is evaluated by comparing the results with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, the ANN model combined with the genetic algorithm (GA-ANN), particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-ANN), and the models existing in building code.

  abstract     = {This research study proposes a Q-learning-based metaheuristic algorithm framework for thermal design optimization of a shell-and-tube evaporator operating with different refrigerant mixtures, which is a highly complex real-world design problem and has not been investigated yet, in previous literature approaches before. The proposed method, called QL-HEUR, uses Q-learning as a high-level heuristic to iteratively guide the competitive recently emerged low-level metaheuristic algorithms. QL-HEUR is applied to 32 unconstrained optimization benchmark functions, and results are evaluated in statistical analysis. Moreover, three multidimensional constrained optimization problems will be solved. Respective solutions unravel that QL-HEUR is very effective in finding optimum solutions to constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. QL-HEUR is employed on the design optimization of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger running with different mixture pairs as a challenging real-world benchmark case. For the design case in which R134a–R1234yf (0.8:02) mixture is considered, 8.71\% of the total cost is saved compared to the preliminary design of a heat exchanger operated with pure R1234yf refrigerant. For the second design case, the application of QL-HEUR results in a decrease of 8.93\% for refrigerant composition R32–R134a (0.6:0.4) in comparison with the configuration running with pure R134a. It is also seen that the heat exchanger configuration running with pure R32 refrigerant yields the lowest total cost compared to the cases accomplished by varying mixture ratios of R290 and R32. It can be concluded that the optimum configuration of the heat exchanger operated with a refrigerant mixture can be conveniently employed for minimum total cost and global warming potential.},

In the case of our country Ethiopia, the effect of traffic accidents is even more by causing injuries, death, and property damage. Forecasting road traffic accident and predicting the severity of road traffic accident contributes a role indirectly in reducing road traffic accidents. This study deals with forecasting the number of accident and prediction of the severity of an accident in the Oromia Special Zone using deep artificial neural network models. Around 6170 road traffic accidents data are collected from Oromia Police Commission Excel data and Oromia Special Zone Traffic Police Department; the dataset consists of accidents in the Special Zone of Oromia Districts (Woredas) from 2005 to 2012 with 15 accidents attributes. 5928 or (80\%) of the dataset was used for the training model, and 1482 or (20\%) of the dataset was used for the testing model. This study proposed six different neural network architectures such as backpropagation neural network (BPNN), feedforward neural network (FFNN), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models for accident severity prediction and the LSTM model for a time serious forecasting of number accidents within specified years. The models will take input data, classify accidents, and predict the severity of an accident. Accident predictor GUI has been created using Python Tkinter library for easy accident severity prediction. According to the model performance results, RNN model showed the best prediction accuracy of 97.18\%, whereas MLP, LTSM, RBFNN, FFNN, and BPNN models showed the accuracy of 97.13\%, 91.00\%, 87.00\%, 80.56\%, and 77.26\%, respectively. LTSM model forecasted accident for three years which is 3555 where the actual accident number is 3561.

It is a quite challenging task to maintain the actual shape of character or matra during segmentation of text. However, this work proposes a segmentation-free approach to recognize the composite characters for Gurumukhi. A new dataset of composite characters has been designed with 307 classes for Gurumukhi script to evaluate the proposed methodology. Two-level classification with the help of two different CNN architectures is proposed to train the model with 307 classes. The pretrained deep network models like Vgg19 and ResNet50 with the help of transfer learning have been used to accelerate the classification of diverse training data. In feature extraction process, various kinds of handcrafted and deep learning features are extracted and classified using SVM and RF. For bilingual text recognition, script identification approach has been proposed using Vgg19 features and bagging-based ensemble classifier. Further, the efficiency of proposed work has been evaluated by comparing the results of composite dataset with those of presegmented dataset of individual characters and modifiers. To extend the scope of work to bilingual text recognition, four different kinds of datasets have been considered. The composite dataset has been able to achieve the highest accuracy of 99\% using proposed approach which stands quite close to the accuracy of presegmented dataset.},

  abstract     = {Due to the users’ mobility, new online applications, as well as low processing power and limited energy of smart devices, traditional cloud computing models could not provide new required services. Cloud service providers improve the quality of their services by moving some servers to the edge of the network and closer to mobile users. Considering the moving nature of users and the heterogeneous service demands in different areas, the optimal placement of servers plays an important role in increasing the quality of service provided to users. However, because of the large number of servers, finding the optimal location of these resources is a serious challenge. In the proposed method of this paper (MES-WG), in the first step, the geographical area of server deployment is divided into smaller sub-regions to reduce the complexity of the problem. Then, by using the WOA algorithm the search agent finds the optimal location of the servers. In the next step, a neural network is used for the local placement of all servers in each area. Finally, game theory is deployed for the convergence of resource placement in all sub-regions. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the network latency by 33.5\% and also improves the load balance on servers by 28.2\%, compared to some of the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In order to have a better control over the drilling process and reduce the overall cost of this drilling operation, engineers have tried to use soft computing (SC) techniques to conduct the pre-estimation of drilling events. It is critically important to estimate the annular pressure losses (APL) for non-Newtonian drilling muds within annulus in order to specify pump rates and also to be able to choose the most appropriate mud pump systems while conducting the drilling operations. To develop the vigorous and exact models to enable the prediction of APL, two popular models were employed, i.e., multilayer perceptron (MLP) [optimized by Levenberg–Marquardt (LM), Bayesian regularization (BR), scaled conjugate gradient (SCG), resilient back propagation (RB), and Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS)] and radial basis function (RBF). Subsequently, applying a committee machine intelligent system (CMIS), the four top models were combined into a unit paradigm. Several tools such as error distribution diagram, cross plot, trend analysis, and cumulative frequency diagram were used in conjunction with statistical calculation to assess the efficiency of models. Consequently, the CMIS model was introduced as the most exact technique which has the greatest coefficient of determination (R2 close to one) as well as the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE close to zero) for the tested dataset.},

For this purpose, fifteen different scenarios are considered as inputs to the models.

However, the class imbalance problem can affect the accuracy of defect prediction classification, which is a crucial issue to be solved urgently. We propose a novel software defect prediction model based on a twin support vector machine to address imbalanced data classification issues and optimize the prediction effect. The model embeds the within-class structure of the training samples as the regularization term into the objective function, considering the structural information hidden in the data, and obtains the class structure information through clustering. Moreover, by introducing within-class structure information to maximize the within-class distances and one class intervals, the model produces a superior classification hyperplane and enhances the generalization ability of the support vector machine. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher prediction accuracy, more robust adaptability, and optimized performance in classifying imbalanced data compared with existing algorithms.},

This paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm based on the snowdrift game to solve the MWVC problem. We use the evolutionary algorithm framework, and the snowdrift game is combined to construct and improve the initial solution. First, the network&#39;s vertex is regarded as an intelligent agent, and each vertex and its neighbors play a snowdrift game to form an initial solution. Then local search and global search are used to improve the initial solution. The solution is improved according to the proposed score function in the local search stage to obtain a better MWVC solution. The evolutionary algorithm is used in the global search stage to escape the local optimum. Experiments on different networks show that the proposed algorithm are effective on weighted networks.},

In this paper, we consider both of the diffusion direction information and the infection time information to locate the source. We introduce a relaxed direction-induced search (DIS) to utilize the diffusion direction information of the observers to approximate the actual diffusion tree on a network. Based on the relaxed DIS, we further utilize the infection time information of the observers to define two kinds of observers-based similarity measures, including the Infection Time Similarity and the Infection Time Order Similarity. With the two kinds of similarity measures and the relaxed DIS, a novel source locating method is proposed.

The super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) is an innovative architecture that integrates the concept of residual learning into the complex design of deep recursive neural networks. This integration is aimed at significantly improving the quality of generated images. To attain the intended improvement in image quality, a series of varied loss functions are used in progressive manner, incorporating the structural similarity index (SSIM) loss and the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which are grounded on the perceptual loss paradigm. The carefully crafted loss functions are designed to enhance and maintain the fundamental element of structural integrity in the generated images, which is a critical requirement for dependable image super-resolution. The proposed methodology encountered a thorough evaluation through a series of rigors assessments, using developed benchmark datasets that are frequently used in the relevant field. Through an evaluation of the model’s performance with respect to image quality and structural similarity, we have effectively determined its effectiveness and ability to enhance current efforts aimed at advancing the field of image super-resolution. The results obtained exhibit a high-level accuracy, with the rate of 99.04\%, and a less loss value of 3.19\%. by achieving SSIM score of 0.97, PSNR score of 34.6, and MSE score of 0.012.},

  abstract     = {Capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem in which a network of customers with specified demands is given. The objective is to find a set of routes which originates as well as terminates at the depot node. These routes are to be traversed in such a way that the demands of all the customers in the network are satisfied and the cost associated with traversal of these routes come out to be a minimum. In real-world situations, the demand of any commodity depends upon various uncontrollable factors, such as season, delivery time, and market conditions. Due to these factors, the demand can always not be told in advance and a precise information about the demand is nearly impossible to achieve. Hence, the demands of the customers always experience impreciseness and randomness in real life. The decisions made by the customers about the demands may also have some scope of hesitation as well. In order to handle such demands of customers in the network, fuzzy random variables and intuitionistic fuzzy random variables are used in this work. The work bridges the gap between the classical version of CVRP and the real-life situation and hence makes it easier for the logistic management companies to determine the routes that should be followed for minimum operational cost and maximum profit. Mathematical models corresponding to CVRP with fuzzy stochastic demands (CVRPFSD) and CVRP with intuitionistic fuzzy stochastic demands (CVRPIFSD) have been presented. A two-stage model has been proposed to find out the solution for the same. To explain the working of the methodology defined in this work, different examples of networks with fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy demands have been worked out. The proposed solution approach is also tested on modified fuzzy stochastic versions of some benchmark instances.},

This research aims to design such a system by optimizing the sites of cabinets, their capacity types, and the location–allocation scheme. In view of maximizing profits of the system, we formulate this design problem as a zero–one integer nonlinear programming model, where the demand of takeout is distance dependent and congestion dependent, rather than a fixed constant. On the basis of model property analysis, the original model is transformed into an integer linear programming problem such that it is solved by off-the-shelf solvers. By case study and sensitivity analyses, it is found that: The proposed method is valuable for providing an optimal strategy for a takeout system of ISPCs by optimizing the sites of the cabinets, the capacity types and the location–allocation strategy; With the optimal strategy derived from the proposed model and algorithm, the developed system is more applicable in the areas of intensively distributed users or the areas closer to canteens in view of creating significant effects of scale economy; For the groups of consumers with different distance-dependent or congestion-dependent sensitivities, it is suggested to implement distinct optimal strategies of building the takeout system even for those in the same service area; The takeout demand grows up with an increasing unit selling price in the developed system, rather than reduction as in an ordinary relation between the demand of products and the price. Thus, the designed self-pickup takeout system seems more applicable to be adopted for the high-quality takeout.},

This knowledge can accelerate metaheuristics and lead to better and promising solutions. This work provides a systematic literature review of machine learning enhancing metaheuristics and summarizes the current state of the classification of the research field, main techniques and machine learning models, validations strategies, and real-world optimization problems that the approach was applied. Our keyword search found 1.960 papers, published in the last 10 years. After considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria and performing backward snowballing procedure, we have analyzed 111 primary studies. The results show the predominance of the use of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) for improving the efficiency of the optimization, and the use of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to increase the effectiveness of the optimization. The objective function value is the mostly applied evaluating criteria to validate the algorithm with other methods. The developed techniques of the studies found are applied in diverse real-world applications such as developing machine learning models, physics simulations with expensive function evaluation, and the variants of the classical job shop scheduling problem.

  abstract     = {Effective denoising strategies are increasingly important for portfolio investors. Considering that the common ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-based stepwise denoising algorithms suffer from white noise interference and ignore the effect of low-frequency redundant noise components on the portfolio, a novel complete EEMD with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) denoising algorithm is proposed to improve the portfolio performance. Specifically, we apply CEEMDAN to decompose noisy prices into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, a series of tests based on the correlations between the original noisy prices and the decomposed IMFs are performed to identify which IMFs are noisy modes. If the tests accept the null hypothesis, the IMFs are considered as noisy components. Finally, we use the soft-threshold technique to process the noisy components and sum the non-noisy components to construct the denoised prices. The empirical results show that under the dynamic minimum-CVaR framework, the proposed CEEMDAN denoising algorithm is not affected by white noise and outperforms the EEMD denoising and stepwise denoising algorithms in improving out-of-sample portfolio returns. Overall, the proposed CEEMDAN denoising is the optimal denoising algorithm, which can help investors improve portfolio performance to the greatest extent.},

When solving the optimization problem of EGCS, a number of dynamic performance indices, including average waiting time, average journey time, energy consumption, etc., have to be taken into account. Until now, numerous optimization approaches have been utilized to solve the car-dispatching problem of vertical transportation. Among those methods, in this study, the authors concentrate on various metaheuristic techniques that were implemented to optimize the metrics of EGCS. While establishing a metaheuristic approach, all the previous authors recognized various factors and limitations, which ought to analyze to develop a new metaheuristic-based EGCS. Owing to this, EGCS implemented via metaheuristic techniques is summarized in this review study, together with the underlying contributions, fitness functions, computational time, and limitations. What is more, performance comparisons of different previously implemented metaheuristic approaches are depicted in this study. This research will not only assist to figure out optimal elevator group optimization algorithms, but also will shrink the technological gap by outlining a number of potential future research lines and methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) play a key role in manufacturing systems because of improving system efficiency and lowering the cost of production. To increase the efficiency and stability of AGVs, it is crucial to consider maintenance planning for them. To the best of our knowledge, there are rarely found studies related to maintenance planning and AGVs’ design and control. Accordingly, in this paper, a new integrated nonlinear mathematical model is developed for optimizing the AGV design (including AGV fleet sizing and AGV assignment to workshops) and preventive maintenance policy. The proposed model aims to determine the preventive maintenance cycles, the optimal number of employed AGVs in manufacturing, and the optimal assignment of AGVs to manufacturing workshops so that the total cost is minimized. To solve this model, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed, and its performance is compared with the global solver of LINGO software on 15 test problems, some of which are large dimensions. To tune the GA parameters, a Taguchi method is used. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is performed to represent the validity of the model and solution approach. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness of GA in terms of computational time and solution quality.},

  abstract     = {Most existing evolutionary algorithms encounter difficulties in dealing with multi-objective problems (MOPs) whose Pareto optimal solutions are sparse, especially when the decision space of the MOP is large. Most existing sparse evolutionary algorithms (EAs) lack the tricks specially for large-scale problems, and the existing tricks need some grouping/variable analysis methods to divide the large-scale variables, which severely affects the effect of optimization. To fill this gap, an evolutionary algorithm based on rank-1 approximation, suitable to reduce the dimensionality of sparse higher-order datasets, is proposed. First, canonical polyadic decomposition is introduced to divide the higher-dimensional set of decision variables into several lower-dimensional sub-sets. These sub-populations are alternatively optimized by a sparse evolution algorithm with special genetic strategies, to search for improved solutions in their respective lower-dimensional decision sub-space. Finally, the whole population is asymptotically optimized by all the sub-populations. The proposed algorithm first introduces the rank-1 approximation into the dimensionality reduction in sparse large-scale variables, combines it with the sparse EA, and proposes efficient alternative optimization strategy to solve the non-convex problem resulted from the multiple sub-problems. It is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale and sparse problems. The experimental results indicate that it outperforms other algorithms in terms of optimization performance and convergence rate.},

Additionally, warehouse capacity constraints can create logistical challenges when orders exceed a retailer&#39;s own storage space, requiring additional costs for rented warehouse. In addition, due to globalization in marketing strategy, supplier is now offering to the retailers’ order volume discount linked with price and trade credit. In addition to this, this study considers carbon emissions that occur during the production and storage of goods at the supplier inventory system, and the retailer is responsible for covering the costs associated with each emission that was generated during product transportation and storage. The unit production cost, which is reliant on the production rate, and shortages of the commodities are permissible which is partially backordered. The optimum production and replenishment practices for the both supplier and the retailer are determined after the establishment of a novel algorithm.

  abstract     = {Interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (IVq-ROFNs), as a generalization of the q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers, are a more robust and reliable tool when dealing with uncertain information during decision-making processes, and can therefore be applied to a broader range of situations. This paper presents an approach to a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem in an IVq-ROF environment. In decision-making, the most sensitive part is information fusion (information aggregation); for this purpose, we extend the Einstein geometric aggregation operator for IVq-ROFNs. Einstein operators are valuable in information fusion, as they consider the interrelationship between arguments. Thus, while dealing with the information fusion process, the interrelationship between arguments ensures that aggregated values do not lose information. We use the traditional grey relational analysis (GRA) approach to rank the alternatives based on the attributes. In the GRA approach, we use positive and negative ideal solutions to obtain the grey relational coefficient (GRC). The GRCs of alternatives are calculated based on a new distance measure, which utilizes the hesitancy or indeterminacy degree of IVq-ROFNs. Utilizing the hesitancy or indeterminacy degree in distance measures reduces information loss significantly. The proposed approach considers three cases of attributes’ weights: partially known, completely unknown, and known. Consideration of three cases of attributes’ weights allows the approach to be applied to any appropriate MAGDM problem. We establish an optimization model to compute partially known attributes’ weights; we use the entropy weight determination method to compute unknown attributes’ weights. Finally, we discuss a real-world case study to validate the proposed approach.},

Also, the growing population causes increased demand for edible vegetable oils. Edible oil is one of the main products in the home food basket, which shows the importance and attention to the supply chain network of edible vegetable oils. As a result, the present research aims to design a sustainable supply chain network of edible vegetable oils under uncertainty. A mixed-integer linear programming model has developed with three objective functions, including minimizing costs, minimizing environmental impacts, and maximizing social impact. The multi-objective mathematical model has been solved by the preemptive fuzzy goal programming method. In this study, the demand for final edible oil and meals is considered uncertain. A case study has been considered in the supply chain network design of Iranian edible vegetable oils to validate the proposed model. In order to collect the dataset of the input parameters, we considered the three aspects of big data, namely variety, velocity, and volume. Furthermore, some sensitivity analyses have been provided for the main parameters of the present research. The obtained results show that the most important component of the cost objective function is production costs. Furthermore, import tariff and its value have a significant impact on the objective functions and decision variables, including area under cultivation, water consumption, and number of workers.

  abstract     = {Solving the energy management (EM) problem in microgrids with the incorporation of demand response programs helps in achieving technical and economic advantages and enhancing the load curve characteristics. The EM problem, with its large number of constraints, is considered as a nonlinear optimization problem. Artificial rabbits optimization has an exceptional performance, however there is no single algorithm can solve all engineering problem. So, this paper proposes a modified version of artificial rabbits optimization algorithm, called QARO, by quantum mechanics based on Monte Carlo method to determine the optimal scheduling for MG resources effectively. The main objective is minimization of the daily operating cost with the maximization of MG operator (MGO) benefit. The operating cost includes the conventional diesel generator operating cost and the cost of power transactions with the grid. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed using different standard benchmark test functions. A ranking order for the test function based on the average value and Tied rank technique, Wilcoxon&#39;s rank test based on median value, and Anova Kruskal–Wallis test showed that QARO achieved best results on the most functions and outperforms all other compared technique. The obtained results of the proposed QARO are compared with those obtained by employing well-known and newly-developed algorithms. Moreover, the proposed QARO is used to solve two case studies of day-ahead EM problem in MG, then the obtained results are also compared with other well-known optimization techniques, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of QARO in reducing the operating cost and maximization the MGO benefit.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a multi-objective variant of the marine predators algorithm (MPA) called the multi-objective improved marine predators algorithm (MOIMPA), which incorporates concepts from Quantum theory. By leveraging Quantum theory, the MOIMPA aims to enhance the MPA’s ability to balance between exploration and exploitation and find optimal solutions. The algorithm utilizes a concept inspired by the Schrödinger wave function to determine the position of particles in the search space. This modification improves both exploration and exploitation, resulting in enhanced performance. Additionally, the proposed MOIMPA incorporates the Pareto dominance mechanism. It stores non-dominated Pareto optimal solutions in a repository and employs a roulette wheel strategy to select solutions from the repository, considering their coverage. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of MOIMPA, tests are conducted on various benchmark functions, including ZDT and DTLZ, as well as using the evolutionary computation 2009 (CEC’09) test suite. The algorithm is also evaluated on engineering design problems. A comparison is made between the proposed multi-objective approach and other well-known evolutionary optimization methods, such as MOMPA, multi-objective ant lion optimizer, and multi-objective multi-verse optimization. The statistical results demonstrate the robustness of the MOIMPA approach, as measured by metrics like inverted generational distance, generalized distance, spacing, and delta. Furthermore, qualitative experimental results confirm that MOIMPA provides highly accurate approximations of the true Pareto fronts.},

The results emphasize that MOP_MPS is effective and competitive in comparing with the other considered algorithms. In addition, it is shown that an optimal solution of a multiplicative programming problem is a properly Pareto optimal solution of an MOP. By considering this relation between MOPs and multiplicative programming problems (MPPs), another algorithm based on MOP_MPS, called MPP_MPS, is suggested for approximately solving non-linear MPPs in which functions multiplied are continuous and bounded from below. The computational results on seven problems of convex MPPs demonstrate that the algorithm is much better than a cut and bound algorithm presented by Shao and Ehrgott in terms of CPU time.},

  abstract     = {Meta-heuristics have been successfully applied to many complex optimization problems. One of the main reasons for its success is its ability to handle non-convex, nonlinear, multimodal, multi-variable, and multi-objective problems with easy implementation. However, the quality of the response of these algorithms to an optimization problem is highly susceptible to the control parameters, and few works aim to tune them or find tools that can improve the algorithms. The literature is rich in proposals for new algorithms, but not for improving existing ones. This paper presents different strategies for tuning and accelerating meta-heuristics using the first hybrid algorithm in the literature. The Lichtenberg algorithm is inspired by lightning and Lichtenberg figures and has been increasingly successfully applied to various optimization problems. However, a study of its best parameters has never been presented until now. After a discussion of the best tuning tools, its tuning parameters are performed using response surface methodology. Then, 14 versions are studied through 10 test functions using chaos theory and Lévy flights scenarios. After 13,500 simulations, the chaotic Lichtenberg algorithm equipped with the piecewise function and tuned parameters proved the best version with only 16\% similarity to the original algorithm. Then, it was compared to the genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, gray wolf optimizer, salp swarm optimization, whale optimization algorithm, and dragonfly algorithm. The proposed algorithm had both the best average accuracy, lower computational cost, and the smallest standard deviation.},

  abstract     = {Constraint optimization redundancy allocation problem (CoRAP) is a real-world, complex integer programming problem. Many researchers have used a variety of techniques to solve CoRAP. In the last two decades, evolutionary algorithms have been used by researchers to handle a variety of complex problems. Among these, the spider monkey optimization algorithm (SMO), which focuses on the behavior of monkeys, is one of the most promising and recent developments by researchers. In addition, no work has been undertaken in the context of solving CoRAP for water treatment plants so far. This paper proposed an integer programming problem, CoRAP for water treatment reverse osmosis (RO) plants subject to a cost constraint. The spider monkey optimization technique is applied to optimize the redundant units of the components of the plant, due to which the overall system reliability is maximized. A review of spider monkey optimization applications and modifications are also presented to investigate its performance. The same problem is solved by the heuristic algorithm, the branch and bound method and student psychology-based optimization technique to compare performance. The simulation work of spider monkey optimization, heuristic algorithms and student psychology-based optimization is implemented using MATLAB and the results for the branch and bound method are obtained using LINGO software. The findings demonstrate the better performance of spider monkey optimization.},

  abstract     = {Blind and visually impaired (BVI) face various problems during their navigation. Being unable to rely on sight greatly restricts their capacity to learn information about their surroundings. Scene recognition is crucial in improving life quality for BVI. Scene recognition systems can recognize and characterize the visual world using powerful artificial intelligence algorithms, allowing users to receive a critical overview. Indoor scene recognition systems are crucial for BVI to explore their environment. These systems are essential for increasing their independence, safety, and overall quality of life. Developing technology that allows BVI to perceive their environment and enable them to navigate and interact with the world on their own is extremely important. We propose in this paper a scene recognition system to assist BVI in their daily activities. The proposed work was developed on top of an efficient set of deep learning techniques called “Deep Evolutionary Algorithms (DEAs)”. DEAs are a type of algorithm that solves complicated search problems by combining the principles of evolutionary computing with deep learning. DEAs provide optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection. They iteratively develop a population of potential networks to identify optimum or near-optimal networks to solve complicated problems through genetic methods including mutation, crossover, and selection. To ensure the efficiency of the proposed work, extensive experiments have been conducted using two benchmark datasets the MIT 67 dataset and the Scene 15 dataset. New state-of-the-art results have been ensured by the proposed work in terms of recognition accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Around the world, lung disease is a prevalent cause of death and illness. In this article, we propose a lung disease detection system for the automated identification of critical lung diseases: 1. Tuberculosis 2. Regular Pneumonia 3. COVID Pneumonia and healthy individuals from chest X-ray (CXR) images. The proposed system incorporates a two-stage classification method using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We evaluated the performance of the proposed system using various evaluation metrics with a test set containing 200 normal, 100 Tuberculosis, 200 Regular Pneumonia, and 100 COVID Pneumonia (a total of 600) CXR images. The proposed system achieves an average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.99 and an accuracy of 0.99. The performance of the proposed system based on F1-Score (0.99) for three classes, namely Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, and COVID, is better than the following existing classification frameworks: ensemble of K-ResNets for the same three classes (F1-Score: 0.84), modified ResNet50 (F1-Score:0.89), KNN classifier with fractional multi-channel exponent moments (F1-Score: 0.89), VGG-16 (F1-Score: 0.89), and convolutional sparse support estimator network (F1-Score for COVID: 0.78). The proposed system can also determine the confidence associated with the challenging classification of Regular Vs. COVID Pneumonia. We also utilized visualization techniques like Grad-CAM and Saliency maps to analyze the features learned by the CNNs, to create transparency in the prediction.},

  abstract     = {Crop diseases can have a detrimental impact on crop growth, resulting in a significant reduction in crop yield. Therefore, accurate detection of these diseases is crucial for enhancing crop productivity. Despite notable advancements in deep learning techniques for disease identification, most experiments have been conducted under simplified laboratory conditions, posing challenges for accurately identifying crop diseases in complex real-world field environments. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the Transformer model’s ability to capture long-range global dependencies and handle occlusion. We propose a novel approach called Dense CNNs and Transformer Network (DCTN) for accurate detection of field crop diseases. Moreover, we introduce a new attention mechanism that utilizes multi-head self-attention via deep separable convolution projection and down-sampling, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Additionally, we have meticulously curated and cleaned a dataset of 45,547 images depicting healthy and diseased crops in real-field environments. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in terms of its robustness against background interference in crop disease detection. Notably, DCTN achieves accuracies of 93.01\% and 99.69\% on our dataset and a publicly available dataset, respectively. For those who are interested, the code for our approach will be made available on https://github.com/wh9704/DCTN .},

  abstract     = {In the arena of digital image processing, mixed noise is normally depicted. Nevertheless, the main limitation of the existing noise removal methods is the exploitation of the statistics of the original contaminated image. Concerns such as high computational complexity, halo artifacts and over-saturation issue are presented in the edges of the noisy images i.e. high-frequency components of the mixed noise digital images which lead to false guesstimate of noisy patches that negatively results on the task of recovery processes of the restoration images. This paper proposes a rapid and high accurate mixed noise removal method by combining pulse coupled neural networks (PCNN) and regularization of Perona–Malik equation (P-M equation) in order to remove unwanted contamination. In this regard, the locations of impulse noise are positioned using PCNN, the second-generation wavelet filter is used to suppress the mixed noise into small local neighborhood, and then the full noisy image is denoised by exploiting the regularization of P-M equation. The fine details and sharp edges are well preserved in the proposed method. In addition, subjective and objective analyses are showed that the visual quality of the proposed mixed noise removal technique outperformed state of the art noise removal methods. Extensive results show that the proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art mixed noise removal techniques, with PSNR improvements of (0.85 dB to 1.54 dB) and SSIM improvements range of (0.0132–0.1521). Moreover, improvements in running time of the proposed technique was the second best technique with improvements range of (0.33–0.56 s) on wide range of benchmark digital images.},

  abstract     = {Under the background of a green, low carbon economy, it is significant to accurately estimate the future CO2 emissions of countries with significant CO2 emissions for developing the world’s green economy. A new Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli and BP neural network combined model (BP-ONGBM (1,1) model) have been proposed to study the CO2 emissions of China, the USA, the European Union, India and Japan. Firstly, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is optimized using the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA). Then, the background value of the ONGBM (1,1) model is dynamically optimized. Based on the linearization of the model, the time response function is derived. Then, the ONGBM (1,1) model is combined with the BP neural network model. An improved PSO algorithm determines the combined weight and the background value coefficient. Finally, according to the observation data from 2010 to 2021 in the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research 2022, the model is established to calculate the CO2 emissions of the selected countries from 2022 to 2026 and compared with the prediction results provided by multiple competitive models. The empirical application shows that the proposed BP-ONGBM (1,1) model is significantly better than other competitive models.},

An Overall structure of the reinforced FRBFNN comprises the preprocessing part, the premise part and the consequence part of fuzzy rules of the network. In the preprocessing part, four types of preprocessing algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), combination of PCA and LDA (Hybrid PCA) and fuzzy transform are considered. To extract feature data suitable to characterize signal data, the feature extraction of information data is carried out through the dimensionality reduction done by the preprocessing technique, and then the reduced data are used as the input to the FRBFNN classifier. In the premise part of fuzzy rules of the network, the number of fuzzy rules is determined according to the number of clusters by fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. The fitness values of individual fuzzy rules are obtained based on data distribution. In the consequence part of fuzzy rules of the network, the parameters of connection weights located between the hidden layer and the output layer of FRBFNN classifier are estimated by means of the least square estimation. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is exploited for structural as well as parametric optimization in the FRBFNN classifier. The parameters to be optimized by PSO are related to six factors such as the determination of whether to use data preprocessing, the type of data preprocessing technique, the number of input variables reduced by the preprocessing technique, fuzzification coefficient and the number of fuzzy rules used in fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering, and the type of connection weights. By using diverse benchmark dataset obtained from UCI repository, the classification performance of the reinforced FRBFNN classifier was evaluated. Through a variety of classification algorithms existed in the Weka data mining software (Weka), the classification performance of the reinforced FRBFNN classifier was compared as well. The superiority of the proposed classifier is demonstrated through Friedman test. Furthermore, we assessed the classification performance of the reinforced FRBFNN classifier applied to black plastic wastes spectral data acquired from Raman and Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy equipment for the practical application of the material sorting system of the black plastic wastes.},

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has emerged as the most effective and efficient method of increasing the diversity of existing transportation networks during the past few decades. Because of its important contribution to effectively using network capacity while consuming little energy, vehicular data offloading will be required for emerging networking technologies like as 5G and D2D. Networking options such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and opportunistic communications are available to send data that would otherwise need the use of a cellular operator’s services. Data offloading can enhance the usage of network capacity by a large amount. Vehicular data offloading contributes significantly to the reduction of cellular network bandwidth use. It assists the network in increasing its throughput by allowing many users to receive the data simultaneously. To define the issue of Vehicular data offloading, we must first determine that it is an NP-hard target set selection (TSS) problem. TSS is the process of choosing a minimum set of nodes for exchanging duplicate data by combining Hybrid PSO with GWO to reduce the number of nodes required (Particle Swarm Optimization with Gray Wolf Optimization). Users and ISPs working together to discover efficient target sets may be able to offer improvements based on their combined opinions. The existence of malevolent users in the target set might also cause network activity to be hindered, either by spoofing or by limiting the offloading capability of the network, depending on the circumstances. Because of these malevolent users, the entire performance of the network may suffer because of their actions. In this proposed work, we offer a hybrid communication method for defining the set of users who should receive the message. To overcome the problem of overlapping community detection, we make advantage of the features of opinion dynamics between users. The target set’s security is handled via the use of trust-based metrics derived from the users’ actions. The proposed work also includes a technique for categorising the chosen offload parameters using radial bias neural network (RBNN) to reach the emergency number, among other things. Using the suggested work’s performance measures, it is possible to determine the following: latency, Entropy, and Accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant popularity through wearable technologies. Several IoT devices are used in educational institutions, smart homes, and security management. Their widespread use in sports training applications using IoT (WS-IoT)-based wearable sensors is noteworthy. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved rapidly, and its applications have expanded across many diverse fields. Over the past few years, China has placed greater emphasis on physical education to enhance students’ physical fitness and overall capabilities. A significant number of colleges and universities have adopted artificial intelligence to transform traditional single-mode sports training methods. This paper introduces a continuous monitoring system for sports individuals using the WS-IoT. The goal of coaches is to maximize the results of athlete training across various sports events using AI technology and their sports expertise. In this study, we examine the use of AI technology in sports and assess the practical implications of its implementation. To achieve the objective function, we used a Bayesian deep classifier and deep learning algorithms that utilize adaptive optimization. Utilizing artificial intelligence in Chinese educational institutions improves training efficiency and effectiveness. The system was then rigorously tested and analyzed in terms of the quality-of-service parameters, including communication collisions and packet loss rates. It is shown that packet loss rates increase with increasing packet numbers, but collision rates remain unchanged. Furthermore, a practical application of the system in colleges and universities showed that 14.4\% of the students were extremely satisfied with the use of teaching materials, 24.5\% were satisfied with the materials, 30.1\% were satisfied with the training methods, and 17.9\% were dissatisfied.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel healthcare services framework that leverages versatile distributed computing and mobile cloud computing to enhance the delivery of medical care data. The framework is designed to integrate with diverse cloud settings and distributed computing resources, utilizing a Virtual-Dedicated-Server with 5 VCPU and 32 GB storage of RAM to develop a prototype specifically tailored for stroke patients with cardioembolic and cryptogenic subtypes, using Android-based mobile phones as the primary devices. The proposed framework consists of two fundamental application components: flexible usage and server request. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module, the system effectively distinguishes between the two-stroke subtypes. Simultaneously, the server application securely stores patient data, ensuring accessibility, security, and adaptability for stroke patients. The CNN module performs computations using the Stroke dataset, providing valuable insights into subtype classification. Additionally, the GBRF (Gradient boosting random forest) algorithm has been employed for further analysis and accurate predictive modeling within the healthcare system. The research contributions of this work are significant. Firstly, it introduces a unique healthcare mechanism that harnesses the potential of distributed computing and mobile cloud computing in improving healthcare services. Secondly, the paper verifies the exceptional value of stroke-related data collected through smartphones, underscoring the uniqueness and reliability of such data sources. Lastly, the system enables the provision of health status information to patients through a CNN application programming interface (API), facilitating seamless communication and personalized healthcare services. By integrating machine intelligence based technologies, the framework enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of stroke identification and contributing to the overall well-being of patients in a meaningful way.},

For ensuring successful and secured communication in Blockchain databases, an accurate extraction of abnormal communication features is imperative and innovative mechanisms are required to achieve the seamless communication for Blockchain-enabled transactions. In order to achieve this objective, a novel feature extraction method for anomalous communication is proposed in this article for secured Blockchain-enabled transactions. In the proposed technique, wavelet transformation is employed to deconstruct the aberrant network communication signals in high and low frequency bands to detect the anomaly. The corresponding parameters for phase space reconstruction and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are devised based on the distribution features of the data in the frequency range. Using the KPCA approach (which combines principal component analysis and kernel learning), the wavelet packet decomposition coefficients are recreated after noise reduction to achieve nonlinear noise of abnormal signals as well as abnormal data. The high-dimensional feature space is mapped to the de-noised abnormal communication to protect the data in Blockchain-based transactions. The principal component is analyzed according to the nonlinear function in the mapped feature space, and the nonlinear function is resolved by using the self-organizing neural network. The results reveal that the proposed strategy works with 92 percent accuracy and have practical implication in real-time Blockchain-based transaction to find the anomalies in the data for safeguarding the Blockchain-based transactions.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of treatment for lung nodules is significantly impacted by early diagnosis of the nodules on CT scans. Radiologists are aided by the utilization of CAD technologies. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology for identifying lung cancer: “(i) pre-processing, (ii) segmentation, (iii) feature extraction, and (iv) detection.” The GF methods commence with the input image being pre-processed. To segment the pre-processed images, a “improved cross-entropy-based active contour segmentation model” is implemented. Then, using a CNN that has been optimized, features such as LBP, entropy, and contrast are computed. The self-adaptive tunicate swarm algorithm (SATSA) is used to optimize CNN weights. For this study, the LIDC-IDRI dataset was used, and Python was used for experimentation. Because pulmonary nodules can differ significantly in size, shape, texture, and appearance, it’s crucial to include a wide variety of patterns in the training dataset. The authors hope to improve the generalization and robustness of the CNN model in identifying lung nodules by incorporating a large number of patterns. Comparing the CNN + SATSA model to existing models allowed researchers to assess its effectiveness in identifying lung nodules. The suggested model’s correctness is demonstrated by its high recall, false discovery rate, FNR, MCC, FPR, precision, FOR, accuracy, specificity, NPV, FMS, and sensitivity values.},

  abstract     = {Video analysis of human motion has been widely used in intelligent monitoring, motion recognition, and virtual reality as a research hotspot in computer vision. Dance is a classic form of human motion that is usually performed as a reaction of expression to music. Dance requires a variety of complex motions that closely resemble each other in terms of body postures and hand gestures. It is essential to decompose and monitor the movements to improve the training quality in dance training. To reduce the intensity of professional work in dance and improve the level of dance art, this study proposes a dance recognition system based on the contour model. A Bluetooth-based system is used to collect dancers&#39; movement information. Then, the discrete cosine transform is used to extract distinct features of the contour images and establish the energy map of the national dance posture. The postures in the dance video sequence are combined with the Baum–Welch algorithm to train a hidden Markov model (HMM) with the optimal parameters. The forward and backward algorithms of the HMM are used to obtain the probability of observing the sequence postures. The maximum probability model is considered the posture of national dance recognition. Results show that the model achieved better results with 93.1\% accuracy. Through experimental verification, it is demonstrated that the method can effectively improve the level of dance art.},

  abstract     = {In computer vision, moving objects’ detection and tracking technology have become hot topics. With the continuous maturity of UAV technology, quadrotor UAV is increasingly widely used in the market, and their maneuverability and concealment are extreme. The application of computer vision technology on drones is a breakthrough and has been widely used in traffic control, crop protection, drone tracking and shooting, and other fields. Therefore, this paper proposed research on the location and tracking environmental pollution sources under the multi-UAV vision based on the target motion model. This article combines the target tracking technology of UAVs and the development and types of UAVs. Firstly, based on the diffusion model of pollutants in the river, a two-dimensional steady-state diffusion equation for pollutants in the river is established. Then, under the improved boundary conditions, the least squares method of the sum of squares of the measured data and theoretical values is used to model the target motion, and due to the increasingly serious pollution, this paper proposes to use UAV sensing technology to locate the pollution source. Finally, by combining pollution source location technology and drone tracking technology, the problem of not being able to quickly identify pollution sources leading to industrial waste discharge or accidental leakage during transportation poses a considerable threat to river safety. Finally, the use of pollution source positioning technology and drone tracking technology to solve the problem of failure to quickly identify pollution sources, resulting in industrial waste discharge or accidental leakage during transportation, poses a considerable threat to river safety. Experiments are carried out on the collected UAV data based on static and dynamic tests of UAV flight platforms, the experimental part, the UAV flight platform was tested, and the actual operation and positioning of the pollution source were carried out. The final experimental results showed that: within 0–360 s, the attitude angle obtained by the gradient descent method had no divergence phenomenon, which could effectively reduce the error caused by integration; the inclination angle deviation of the two groups of experimental equipment was within ± 2.5°, the roll angle deviation was within ± 3°, and the deflection angle was larger at certain moments, but the average deviation was only 0.8°. It also showed that the system could better adapt to the practical application requirements of quadrotor UAVs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel cryptosystem with just a multi-shuffling process which is highly interactive to differentiate initial conditions is developed. The proposed system replaces the fundamental and well known in cryptography, confusion–diffusion scheme, which uses two levels with just one confusion block. This algorithm is designed for protecting all personal or commercial data in real-time applications such as monitoring and transmission of multimedia information. The unique confusion stage has three-level shuffling processes, consisting of the flipping procedure, block shuffling, and permutation in a bit level. All of them were designed to drastically change data from a plain image to a cipher image. This not only destroys the relationship of adjacent pixels but also destroys patterns in the encryption process. The flipping procedure tries to combine parts of the image&#39;s top with the bottom and the right with the left. The selected columns and rows will change completely after this procedure due to the complement of each pixel being written during the process. The last levels use an automatically sliding window combined with a logistic sine wave and logistic map to drive the iteration of the cryptosystem and shuffle the position of pixels of the plain image as well as giving new statistical features to the image at the same time. The proposed algorithm was designed to be easily implemented by practitioners. Additionally, the main goal of the image encryption is to achieve an uncertain image that cannot be cracked. The results show that this novel cryptosystem with only the shuffling process is well performed and feasible to encrypt images with a high security level. Furthermore, the experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed encryption algorithm after being tested using the benchmark “Lena” image, &quot;The Wonder woman&quot; image, and the “Bruce Lee” image, the latter of which is completely different to the first one, statistically speaking.},

  abstract     = {Although a wide variety of background subtraction methods has been proposed in recent years, none has been able to fully address multi-scale moving objects and dynamic background in real surveillance tasks. In this paper, a novel and effective background subtraction method, named regional multi-feature-frequency (RMFF), is proposed to detect multi-scale moving objects under dynamic background. Unlike many existing methods construct background model using simple multi-feature combinations, RMFF exploits the spatiotemporal cues of multi-feature as well as superpixels at each scale, thus allowing for more robust information to be exploited for background modeling. Specifically, the spatial relationship between pixels in a neighborhood and the frequencies of features over time are first exploited, enabling accurate detection of moving objects while ignoring most dynamic background changes. Then, the use of multi-scale superpixels for exploiting the structural information existing in real-world scenes further enhances robustness to multi-scale objects and environmental variations. Finally, an adaptive strategy is employed to dynamically adjust the foreground/background segmentation threshold for each region without user intervention. This adaptive threshold is defined for each region separately, and can adjust dynamically based on continuous monitoring of the background changes, thereby effectively reducing potential segmentation noise. Experiments on the 2014 version of the ChangeDetection.net dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the 12 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of overall F-Measure and performs effectively in many complex scenes. Consequently, it is verified that the developed approach is feasible and useful for robust application in practical video surveillance.},

  abstract     = {This article discusses the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles for improved load frequency control mechanism of interconnected power system. This research also looks at the impact of communication latency on system stability and sustainability. The mathematical modelling and analysis of the studied proposed system, a two-area interconnected hybrid power system, includes a thermal plant, hydro plant, and gas plant in each area. Moreover, both control areas also incorporate sporadic solar and wind power plants as well as electric vehicles for case study purposes. A novel cascade fractional-order integral-derivative and tilt controller has been designed for the analysed system. A new modified Quasi-Opposition Reptile Search Algorithm (QORSA) is also proposed to optimise the different parameters of controller. To demonstrate its superiority, the QORSA is compared with some recent prominent meta-heuristic algorithms. Furthermore, the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed control approach has been analysed in comparison with existing controllers as well as some other research work under diverse conditions like step and random disturbances. The comprehensive results studies show the overall better and improved dynamic performance analysis for anticipated hybrid power system. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated through real-time experimental analysis by means of Opal-RT platform for its practical feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Against the background of the current complex international geopolitical situation and more intense trade frictions, the volatility of financial assets has important research significance as a basis for risk analysis and option pricing. First, considering the characteristics of financial assets—such as “long dependence”—the pricing model can become complicated, making it difficult to calculate the implied volatility directly. Establishing the loss function between the trading data and modeled value, the implied volatility at different moments solved using the global optimal double annealing algorithm was found to differ from the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) volatility and historical volatility. Second, the implied volatility considering people’s future expectations of financial assets was predicted using the previously known implied volatility via deep learning methods. The empirical results showed that the implied volatilities predicted using the long short-term memory (LSTM) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) methods performed well for option pricing. Moreover, the fractal option-pricing models outperformed the traditional Black–Scholes (B–S) pricing model. Finally, based on the accumulated local effect (ALE) algorithm—which can quantify the impact analysis of different volatilities on pricing models—it was found that the predicted implied volatility using artificial intelligence algorithms was more relevant to the truth. A combination of traditional mathematical models and emerging intelligent algorithms are promoted in this study, providing a reference for investors and risk managers and contributing to the continued development of financial markets.},

Next, the entropy measure between two Cq-ROFSs is disclosed, and part of the proposed entropy measure characteristics is presented.

In the developed method, firstly, weights of DMs are obtained using the proposed distance measure and cubic q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted averaging operator. Then, the weights of criteria are determined by the developed entropy measure. A novel TODIM method is developed utilizing the proposed Minkowski-type distance measures for ranking alternatives in light of the acquired criteria weights.

  abstract     = {The supplier selection problem is one of the most important issues in supply chain management. So, many papers have investigated the mentioned problem. However, the related literature shows that researchers had less attention to the sustainability and resilience aspects based on the customer preferences in supplier selection problem. To cover this gap, this research tries to investigate the customer-based sustainable-resilient supplier selection problem. In this way, a Markovian-based fuzzy decision-making method is proposed. At the outset, the customer preferences are evaluated using a combination of the quality function deployment and the Markov transition matrix. Then, by combining the transition matrix and the fuzzy best–worst method, the weights of the indicators are calculated. Finally, the decision matrix is formed and the performance of suppliers is measured based on the multiplication of the decision matrix and vector of sub-criteria weights. Regarding the recent pandemic disruption (COVID-19), the importance of online marketplaces is highlighted more than the past. Hence, this study considers an online marketplace as a case study. Results show that in a pandemic situation, the preferences of customers when they cannot go shopping normally will change after a while. Based on the Markov steady state, these changes are from the priority of price, availability, and performance in initial time to serviceability, reliability, and availability in the future. Finally, based on the FBWM results, from the customer point of view, the top five sub-criteria for sustainable-resilient supplier selection include cost, quality, delivery, responsiveness, and service. So, based on these priorities, the case study potential suppliers are prioritized, respectively.},

However, few existing studies consider supply risks from the perspective of all three triple-bottom-line dimensions at the same time. To bridge this research gap, this research constructs a supply risk perspective integrated sustainable supplier selection model in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. First of all, the weights of decision-makers in the decision-making group are obtained by intuitionistic fuzzy set. Secondly, after obtaining the aggregated intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix considering the weight of decision-makers, the fuzzy entropy weight method is used to calculate criteria weight, objectively. Then, an improved failure mode and effects analysis is used to undertake risk assessments and to identify high-risk suppliers. Last but not least, the extended alternative queuing method is adopted to rank the eligible sustainable suppliers in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The proposed model not only reduces the uncertainty of decision-making in sustainable supplier selection, but also enables focal companies to reduce supply risk in their sustainable supplier selection practices and prevent the failure modes that relate to supply risk. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified through an empirical illustration in a leading electrical appliance manufacturer in China.},

The negation operation is used to obtain additional information of mass functions from the opposite side. By the joint use of mass functions information from the obverse and opposite sides, the informative belief functions of different elements are obtained, then the conditional belief function is applied to calculate proportions of singletons in multi-subset elements, and finally mass functions can be transformed to probabilities by proportion reasonably.

However, due to limited energy and computing capacity, a user device may not be able to complete its task within a given time, leading to a poor user experience. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can address this challenge by offloading tasks to edge servers with stronger computing capacity and more resources for execution, which can save energy of user devices and reduce the task computation time. Different offloading strategies will impact the number of tasks completed, latency, energy overhead and so on. This paper investigates the problem of maximizing the number of completed tasks while minimizing the average completion time, energy overhead and cost in MEC under both time and energy constraints. To solve the problem, we develop the mayfly genetic algorithm (MGA), which jointly optimizes task offloading locations and ratios, central processor unit (CPU) frequencies of user devices and computing capacities allocated to user devices by edge servers. Simulation experiments indicate that MGA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the number of completed tasks.},

Second, a cooperative game in multi-population is proposed, the pheromone income is distributed to participants based on their contribution, which can balance the convergence and diversity. Third, we introduce a bidirectional induction mechanism, by expanding the difference of pheromone concentration between outstanding solutions and mediocre solutions, the convergence can be further improved. In addition, the current optimal clip will be recommended to other populations for learning, each population will continue search based on the current optimal clip, which can improve the accuracy of the solutions. If the algorithm falls into stagnation, the current optimal solution will be inducted reversely, which can help the algorithm jump out of the local optimum.

The holding cost is considered a quadratic function of time, and preservation technology has been utilized to control carbon emissions. First of all, a profit maximization crisp model is developed. Then, due to market flexibility, the demand rate assumes uncertainty in nature, where the concept of membership value and nonmembership value exists. So, a fuzzy model is developed where the demand rate is assumed to be a pentagonal intuitionistic dense fuzzy number. A novel defuzzification technique and a solution algorithm have been presented to solve the proposed model. In the numerical illustration, a comparative study is given among crisp and other fuzzy environments. For numerical computation, LINGO 18.0 software has also been utilized. Findings reveal that the green concern is a vital factor for model optimization under uncertain system.

This archive chooses the solutions using a leader selection strategy and a roulette wheel. Accordingly, a mutation operator was also added to the algorithm. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, nineteen standard test functions were used and compared via MOPSO, MOGWO and MOMPA algorithms. The Taguchi–grey relational method was employed to adjust the parameters of the investigated algorithms. The ability of the proposed algorithm was investigated by seven metrics.

  abstract     = {In the power system, the economic dispatch (ED) problem is the key issue, while fossil fuels cause environmental pollution. The allocation of power generation is included in the actual economic load dispatch issue of power generation for reducing the operating cost. This creates the economic load dispatch issue, a large-scale, highly nonlinear controlled optimization issue. The major issue in the power systems is the loss, fuel cost, and emission. The existing algorithms can optimize the parameters mentioned above, but it is not much better. Hence, this paper presents the multi-objective multi-verse optimization (MOMVO) for the dynamic load dispatch problem. The dynamic load dispatch issue is evaluated by cost and emission evaluation with hybrid renewable energy Sources (RES). Here, the proposed algorithm generates the thermal, photovoltaic (PV) and wind power values, reducing the cost and emission values. The unit’s power generation is the foremost aim of dynamic economic load dispatch (DELD) to meet the load demand while sustaining various operational constrictions; the generation’s total cost is reduced. The MVO algorithm is applied to nonlinear DELD issues and is a reliable and robust optimization algorithm. The introduced scheme is implemented and tested over three test systems, such as 6, 10, and 11 generating units. The implementation is performed on the MATLAB R2016a platform, and the performance results are evaluated based on with and without valve-point loading (VPL). Finally, VPL produced better solutions than the without VPL case.},

  abstract     = {Real-parameter single objective optimization has been studied for decades. In recent, a new setting is applied in this field based on the consideration that solving difficulty scales exponentially with the increase in dimensionality. Under the new setting, differential evolution (DE) still outstands in performance as before. Meanwhile, a new type of population-based metaheuristic—gaining–sharing knowledge-based algorithm, becomes a dark horse. Furthermore, ensemble of the above two types of algorithm is proposed in the literature. Although such ensemble shows good performance, provided that a more reasonable scheme is used for the communication between the constituent algorithms, better ensemble can be obtained. We believe that the new scheme should be with adaptiveness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive scheme for the communication. According to the scheme, individuals chosen based on fitness and lifetime are exchanged. In fact, in the field of DE, it is rare to consider lifetime of individual. However, lifetime is no less important than fitness in our scheme. In our experiment, our ensemble is compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms. According to experimental results, our ensemble is comparable to one of the peers and better than the other ones.},

  abstract     = {Early detection of arrhythmia assists clinicians in timely treatment that improves the recovery rate and reduces the mortality rate. The existing research works employed various models to improve Arrhythmia detection performance. The existing models has low classification performance, due to irrelevant feature selection. In this research, K-Means Monarchy Butterfly Optimization (KMMBO) is used as a feature selection method for arrhythmia detection. The Monarchy Butterfly Optimization method escapes from local optima and provides good convergence in the search process. In this research, the role of k-means algorithm is to cluster the current generation population (feature subsets) from the Monarchy Butterfly algorithm into two groups to generate new solutions for the next generation. The relevant features selected by the KMMBO method are stored in a memory cell of Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) for long term that provides improvement in arrhythmia detection performance. The KMMBO method selection process avoids overfitting problems and imbalance data problems by focusing on unique features of the classes that increases the model sensitivity. The proposed KMMBO method’s efficiency is analyzed on the China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018 (CPSC 2018) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) datasets. Next, Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT), statistical, and entropy features are utilized for feature extraction and then KMMBO is applied for selecting optimum features. The KMMBO-BiLSTM model has better accuracy and sensitivity of 98.48\% and 99.85\% on the MIT-BIH dataset. In addition to this, the proposed KMMBO-BiLSTM model attained accuracy and sensitivity of 97.22\% and 97.61\% on the CPCS 2018 dataset.},

  abstract     = {Crow search algorithm (CSA), as a new swarm intelligence algorithm that simulates the crows’ behaviors of hiding and tracking food in nature, performs well in solving many optimization problems. However, while handling complex and high-dimensional global optimization problems, CSA is apt to fall into evolutionary stagnation and has slow convergence speed, low accuracy, and weak robustness. This is mainly because it only utilizes a single search stage, where position updating relies on random following among individuals or arbitrary flight of individuals. To address these deficiencies, a CSA with multi-stage search integration (MSCSA) is presented. Chaos and multiple opposition-based learning techniques are first introduced to improve original population quality and ergodicity. The free foraging stage based on normal random distribution and Lévy flight is designed to conduct local search for enhancing the solution accuracy. And the following stage using mixed guiding individuals is presented to perform global search for expanding the search space through tracing each other among individuals. Finally, the large-scale migration stage based on the best individual and mixed guiding individuals concentrates on increasing the population diversity and helping the population jump out of local optima by moving the population to a promising area. All of these strategies form multi-level and multi-granularity balances between global exploration and local exploitation throughout the evolution. The proposed MSCSA is compared with a range of other algorithms, including original CSA, three outstanding variants of CSA, two classical meta-heuristics, and six state-of-the-art meta-heuristics covering different categories. The experiments are conducted based on the complex and high-dimensional benchmark functions CEC 2017 and CEC 2010, respectively. The experimental and statistical results demonstrate that MSCSA is competitive for tackling large-scale complicated problems, and is significantly superior to the competitors.},

Therefore, the present study has four steps: experiments, modelling, mono- and multi-objective optimization. At the first step (in experiments), tests were conducted by Taguchi experimental design. The influences of nose radius, feed, speed and depth on the force, surface roughness and wear were determined. In the second step (modelling), experimental results were employed to establish first-order models. In the third step (mono-objective optimization), force, surface roughness and wear were utilized solely. To minimize outputs, Taguchi&#39;s signal-to-noise ratio was employed. The influence of inputs on responses was found with variance analysis. From mono-objective optimization, it was explored that the optimum settings for minimizing wear were nose radius of 0.4 mm, speed of 100 m/min, feed of 0.20 mm/tooth and depth of 1.8 mm. The optimum setting of milling factors for resultant force was nose radius of 0.4 mm, speed of 100 m/min, feed of 0.20 mm/tooth and depth of 1.2 mm. For the lowest surface roughness, the optimum combinations were nose radius of 1.2 mm, speed of 100 m/min, feed of 0.20 mm/tooth and depth of 1.8 mm. In the fourth step (multi-objective optimization), outputs were simultaneously optimized with grey relational analysis. From multi-objective optimization, the best orders for minimizing the resultant force, surface roughness and tool wear were nose radius of 0.4 mm, feed of 0.20 mm/tooth, speed of 100 m/min and depth of 1.5 mm.},

  abstract     = {Parameters identification of photovoltaic (PV) models is significant for forecasting power of PV system and simulating the PV models. To accurately identify the parameters of different PV models based on measured current–voltage characteristics, a novel algorithm inspired by triangle vertex and edge, called triangle search optimization (TSO), is proposed in the paper. The TSO algorithm is divided into two phases: the triangle vertex searching (TVS) and triangle edge searching (TES) phases. In the TVS phase, the population is divided into two subpopulations, which can be enhanced by vertex searching operators for exploration and the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) for exploitation. In the TES phase, the differential evolution vector between superior and inferior solutions is employed to improve the diversity of the population. The experiments on CEC 2017 test suite show that the proposed TSO performs better than the state-of-the-art algorithms in convergence accuracy. The novel algorithm, TSO, is employed to solve the parameters identification problems of single-diode PV model, double-diode PV model and PV module. Comprehensive experiments indicate that TSO can obtain a highly competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, especially in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

In this work, a FED is considered with the aim of system designing for maximum reliability while considering the limited availability of resources such as volume, cost, and weight of the system. A total of five possible arrangements of the redundant components are investigated, and a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is solved for system reliability optimization. For optimization purposes, a recently developed metaheuristic hybrid particle swarm grey wolf optimizer (HPSGWO) is implemented. The HPSGWO is a powerful fusion of PSO’s exploitation property and GWO’s exploration property. Solving RRAP by using HPSGWO provides 99\% reliability of the proposed FED under the limited availability of resources. To validate the superiority of the HPSGWO, a comparative study is explained.},

One is the new multi-population strategy inspired by teaching quality evaluation. In this multi-population strategy, first, the entire evolving population is partitioned into several subpopulations of equal size and each subpopulation is evaluated and assigned an evaluation score like the way in teaching quality evaluation, according to which new individuals are generated. Then the subpopulations integrate and are re-divided to make some individuals in the better subpopulations spread to other subpopulations, thus guiding the evolution of the entire population and accelerating the convergence speed. The other modification is the improved mutation strategy combined with Levy flight and adaptive parameters. Levy flight can avoid the algorithm stuck with the local optimum, and adaptive parameters can change dynamically during the evolutionary process, hence reducing the adverse effects caused by parameter sensitivity. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, extensive test experiments on benchmark functions are carried out, and the two modifications are studied separately at length. At the end, the proposed algorithm is applied to synthesize linear sparse array antennas. The results show that it can reduce peak sidelobe level further and enhance the performance of linear sparse arrays.},

The optimization is carried out using incremental cost (IC) consensus under the constraint of supply–demand balance while considering the capacity and ramp rate limits of the DGs. The optimality analysis has been provided via a variant of the conventional Lyapunov function for an additional term, addressing both consensus of ICs and convergence of supply–demand mismatch on directed graphs. In contrast with the previous work, the proposed algorithm is not susceptible to initial conditions of DGs, which makes it more resilient to communication failure and delay despite working under directed communication topologies. Extra limitations of capacity and ramp rate limits of DGs are taken into account by the algorithm while avoiding any supply mismatch. The simulation tests are carried on an IEEE benchmark to verify the efficacy of the proposed technique. The results indicate that the proposed technique is superior to existing traditional and distributed methods in various performance aspects.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world problems can be naturally formulated as discrete multi-objective optimisation (DMOO) problems. We have proposed a novel Physarum-inspired competition algorithm (PCA) to tackle these DMOO problems. Our algorithm is based on hexagonal cellular automata (CA) as a representation of problem search space and reaction–diffusion systems that control the Physarum motility. Physarum’s decision-making power and the discrete properties of CA have made our algorithm a perfectly suitable approach to solve DMOO problems. Each cell in the CA grid will be decoded as a solution (objective function) and will be regarded as a food resource to attract Physarum. The n-dimensional generalisation of the hexagonal CA grid has allowed us to extend the solving capabilities of our PCA from only 2-D to n-D optimisation problems. We have implemented a novel restart procedure to select the global Pareto frontier based on both personal experience and shared information. Extensive experimental and statistical analyses were conducted on several benchmark functions to assess the performance of our PCA against other evolutionary algorithms. As far as we know, this study is the first attempt to assess algorithms that solve DMOO problems, with a large number of benchmark functions and performance indicators. Our PCA has confirmed our assumption that individual skills of competing Physarum are more efficient in exploration and increase the diversity of the solutions. It has achieved the best performance for the Spread indicator (diversity), similar performance results compared to the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) and even outperformed other well-established genetic algorithms.},

However, EDBF cannot work with the numerous parent chromosomes especially exceeding fifty. To address this problem, an enhanced EDBF framework, namely adaptive boundary constraint framework (ABCF), is proposed by adaptively changing the boundary of weight assigned to each parent chromosome according to the constraint law. Furthermore, ABCF is compared with EDBF, ABPSO and RCBBFA algorithms on 20 benchmark functions in terms of convergence, efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that ABCF outperforms comparative algorithms on most of benchmark functions. As a general framework rather than a specific algorithm, ABCF is easy to implement and can easily be accommodated to any existing MCAs.},

  abstract     = {In the analysis of agricultural product price time series, the detection of abnormal fluctuations is the primary task. Accurately judging the abnormal fluctuations of agricultural product prices can help farmers avoid potential economic losses in a timely manner and improve the circulation efficiency of agricultural products. This paper introduces a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model based on time series images (TSI), and identifies abnormal fluctuations in agricultural product prices using improved standard deviation–slope judgment. First, a standard deviation–slope (SDS) time series abnormal fluctuation criterion is proposed. Second, the Markov Transfer Field (MTF) method is used to convert the sparse one-dimensional time series of agricultural product prices into a two-dimensional dense image. Third, the CNN model is used to automatically extract features from time series images containing abnormal fluctuations, and they are divided into two categories: “normal” and “abnormal”; Finally, the performance of the proposed model was evaluated using China’s corn and wheat price dataset. Comparing with other abnormal fluctuation judgment methods, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is about 20\% higher on average. This confirms the applicability of the standard deviation–slope time series Image-Resnet-34 (SDS-TSI-Resnet34) model in practical scenarios. At the end of the paper, some feasible suggestions for the efficient development of agricultural economy are proposed based on the abnormal fluctuation judgment method.},

  abstract     = {Constructing Bayesian network structures from data is an NP-hard problem. This paper presents a novel method for Bayesian network structure learning using a discrete Harris hawks optimization algorithm, named BNC-HHO. It uses the max-min parents and children algorithm, V-structure &amp; log-likelihood function, and neighborhood structures to limit the search space during the initialization phase. Then, the Harris hawk optimization algorithm is extended from the continuous to the discrete domain by redefining the movement strategies of hawks using genetic operators in genetic algorithm. The crossover and mutation operations in the proposed method are controlled by an adaptive crossover and mutation rate based on the X-conditional cloud. To balance the exploration and exploitation phases, a nonlinear escaping energy curve is also designed. Finally, the quality of the solution is further improved using a local optimizer. Experiments on various standard networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can quickly get higher structure scores and better convergence accuracy in most cases compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. It indicates that the proposed algorithm can be used as an effective and feasible method for learning Bayesian network structures.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, the neural image captioning (NIC) is considered as a primitive problem artificial intelligence (AI) in which creates a connection between computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). However, recent attribute-based and textual semantic attention-based models in NIC still encounter challenges related to irrelevant concentration of the designed attention mechanism on the relationship between extracted visual features and textual representations of corresponding image’s caption. Moreover, recent NIC-based models also suffer from the uncertainties and noises of extracted visual latent features from images which sometime leads to the disruption of the given image captioning model to sufficiently attend on the correct visual concepts. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we proposed an end-to-end integrated deep fuzzy-neural network with the unified attention-based semantic-enhanced vision-language approach, called as FuzzSemNIC. To alleviate noises and ambiguities from the extracted visual features, we apply a fused deep fuzzy-based neural network architecture to effectively learn and generate the visual representations of images. Then, the learnt fuzzy-based visual embedding vectors are combined with selective attributes/concepts of images via a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to incorporate the fused latent visual features into captioning task. Finally, the fused visual representations are integrated with a unified vision-language encoder–decoder for handling caption generation task. Extensive experiments in benchmark NIC-based datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FuzzSemNIC model.},

  abstract     = {World Wide Web is a vast information resource that can be used in a broad range of applications. Web content is an efficient way to derive valuable information from webpages, and many efforts have been made on this subject. However, due to the increasing complexity of webpage technology, the existing methods cannot match quite well the requirements for the content extraction of webpages. This paper proposed an improved content extraction method for webpage based on Cx-Extractor, which is capable of dealing with content extraction for different types of webpages. Several improvements have been made for the proposed method: (1) The hyperlink tags are not removed directly to avoid mistaking the dense hyperlink groups for the main content. (2) The starting point of the main content is taken as the line number of tag-line-block whose size exceeds the threshold and thus the first few short texts of the main content can be retained. (3) The threshold value of tag-line-block for the main content is calculated automatically instead of being set manually. The above can improve the accuracy of the extracted content. Moreover, (4) the blank spaces in the original text of webpage are retained, which can increase the readability of the extracted content by avoiding connecting English words into pieces. (5) The multimedia information (e.g., pictures and videos) can be selectively retained by users, allowing for maximum flexibility and usage in multiple industries. The experimental results conducted on real-world webpages show that the proposed content extraction method works well for both single-content and multi-content webpages. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed content extraction method was compared with the Chinese extraction method called Cx-Extractor and the English extraction method called Readability. It is found that the proposed method in this study outperforms these two methods in precision, recall, and readability. In addition, the extraction efficiency of the proposed method is superior to that of the Readability method.},

  abstract     = {Acceptance sampling plans (ASPs) are conducted by inspecting a small set of items instead of all outputs. Although traditional ASPs use certain plan parameters, it is clear that quality characteristics or definitions may not be certain in some real case applications because of uncertainties. The fuzzy set theory (FST) is a popular technique to model uncertainty in the engineering problems. It is known that ASPs have been successfully formulated based on FST in the literature. However, the uncertainty is generally more complex in cases including human evaluations. Neutrosophic sets (NSs) that is one of the fuzzy set extensions bring some advantages to manage more complicated uncertainties in quality problems especially uncertainty based on human’s hesitancy. Since the NSs include three terms as truthiness (t), indeterminacy (i), and falsity (f), they can successfully model the human thinking and inspectors’ evaluations under uncertainty. In this paper, traditional attribute ASPs have been extended based on interval NSs to combine the computational and interpretational advantages of the interval statistics with the advantages of NSs. Additionally, two well-known distributions for ASPs called Binomial and Poisson distributions are redesigned by using NSs. For this aim, NSs are converted to interval NSs by using α-cut technique and some characteristic functions of ASPs such as acceptance probability ( $${P}_{a}$$ ), average sample number ( $$ASN$$ ), and average total inspection ( $$ATI$$ ) have been designed for single and double ASPs based on interval NSs. The proposed ASPs based on NSs have been tested on some numerical applications from a manufacturing process, and results obtained based on real cases have been compared.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed not only in businesses, entertainment, and academia but also in sports training to raise the level of competition among athletes. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the brains of modern AI, and this paper examines their application in sports training’s load prediction with the hope of improving athletic performance, creating scientifically efficient training programs, and increasing the accuracy of training load forecasts. First, a sports training analysis system based on Browser Server (B/S) is constructed, and the overall structure, specific function modules, and database of the system are designed and introduced. Then, the artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA)-based prediction and modeling approach of sports training’s load is applied. To put it more specifically, we obtained a comprehensive index of joint acceleration in sports training by using data acquisition devices such as sensors. The independent variable in the load prediction is defined by the computational results, which are combined with other relevant features to obtain the load characteristics of sports training. The initial weights and thresholds of the ANN are optimized with the help of AFSA. To produce the final prediction result, the optimized ANN and extracted load characteristics are coupled with the prediction equation. The prediction model is applied to the sports training analysis system for realizing the application of training load prediction. Experiments show that the methods proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of sports training and load prediction, improve the effect of athletes’ training, and thus enhances the level of sports competitiveness.},

  abstract     = {Due to increasingly global cultural exchanges, people are more conscious about the importance of mastering a foreign language. Language translation and helping students in the colleges with their learning abilities to master one or more languages using computer-aided translation and training system has become an important research. Intelligibility is one of the most important indicators for translation evaluation of Chinese language spoken by English learners, but there is a big gap between the automatic translation intelligibility score and the human expert score. Based on this concept, this paper addresses the existing challenges faced by translation detection software to analyze their limitations and characteristics, especially related to learners’ Chinese translation experience. To enhance translation recognition accuracy, we employ a data mining approach to identify imaging factors associated with incorrect translation by college students. First, we develop a data mining recognition and detection method, leading to improved accuracy in translation recognition by utilizing association specification and classification. The classifier is then utilized to distinguish various types of translation errors, while also incorporating a translation intelligibility evaluation to provide error correction feedback to learners. The proposed model outperforms standard translation methods and alternative approaches, achieving impressive identification accuracy (94.58\%), efficiency (88.12\%), and a low missed detection rate (5.32\%). Moreover, it significantly reduces the translation mistakes, including grammatical (5.21\%), semantic (3.45\%), and contextual (2.18\%) errors. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier outshines artificial neural network (ANN) classification in error detection, and the suggested scoring system demonstrates its superiority with the highest average correlation coefficient (0.822) compared to expert scoring. Experimental results confirm the improved accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed translation recognition and detection method.},

The existing intrusion detection and prevention techniques have a wide range of limitations and thus are unable to precisely detect any type of attack or anomaly within the network traffic. Many machine learning-based algorithms have also been presented by the researchers, which lack performance in terms of classification accuracy, or in terms of multi-class classification. This research presents a data-driven approach for intrusion and anomaly detection, where the data is processed and filtered using different algorithms. The quality of the training dataset is improved by using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm and mutual information. Automated machine learning is also used to detect the algorithm with auto-tuned hyper-parameters that best suit to classify the data. This technique not only saves the computational cost to test the data at run-time but also provides an optimal algorithm without the need to run calculations to tune hyper-parameters, manually. The resultant algorithm solves a multi-class classification problem with an accuracy of 99.7\%, outperforming the existing algorithms by a decent margin.},

  abstract     = {Excessive energy reliance and uncontrolled exploitation have caused significant environmental damage by prompting experts to advocate for active protection and conservation of Earth&#39;s habitats. Preserving urban wetlands is crucial for reducing natural disasters and maintaining city biodiversity. Therefore, this paper addresses the urgent need for active protection and conservation of urban wetlands due to the significant environmental damage caused by excessive energy reliance and uncontrolled exploitation. Establishing a complete urban wetland ecosystem is crucial to ensure the long-term viability of these fragile ecological environments. Using big data and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), this study proposes a method to evaluate the plant landscape quality of Dongpu National Wetland Park in Luyang, Anhui, China. The proposed approach assesses and prioritizes urban wetland park landscapes by considering important ecological variables such as plant species diversity and wetland water ecology. Expert assessments generate a valid judgment matrix and assign weights to each evaluation index by providing insights into the influence of indicators on the park landscape. Demographic data analysis, including age, gender, education, and occupation, is considered to understand preferences. Based on the results of the evaluation, ten sample plots of Dongpu National Wetland Park in Luyang, Anhui, were classified into four grades (Grade I &gt; 13.5; Grade II &gt; 12–13.5; Grade III &gt; 10.5–12; Grade IV 10.5), with Grades 1–3 accounting for 90\% of the total. The evaluation scores confirm the visually appealing plant landscape of the park, with notable locations such as the main entrance, Huxin Square, and Yingying Road standing out for their lush vegetation and distinct ecological characteristics. This study outperforms previous research using a complete evaluation model and the AHP approach, allowing for a systematic assessment of the landscape quality of urban wetland parks. This localized research captures unique biological traits and gives significant insights into park management by concentrating on Dongpu National Wetland Park in Luyang, Anhui, China.},

  abstract     = {English language translation teaching plays a crucial role in today’s globalized world, particularly in countries like China, which has seen an increased emphasis on English language proficiency. However, effective teaching and assessment of students’ translation abilities remain significant challenges for educators. To address the challenges of English language translation and teaching, this paper proposes a novel approach that integrates Internet of Things (IoT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Neural Network algorithms to assist teachers in evaluating and assessing students’ English translation abilities by enabling them to better fulfill their teaching responsibilities. This paper first describes the computational mechanism of Neural Network algorithm using PSO, which includes the particle coding approach. An application model is designed to assess students’ capacity for learning using English translational instruction. The PSO algorithm gathers information on their learning progress, and fully utilize the analyzed results to develop learning strategies and create teaching materials for various learning types, which is helpful for the quick advancement of English translation teaching. Secondly, this paper develops a translational application model for English language as a practical framework. The proposed method utilizes the upgraded PSO-enabled Neural Network to process English language translation and teaching data by achieving network training in a global optimal state of PSO by reducing training errors. Thirdly, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of the model by comparing the average errors of the training and test samples with different numbers of particles such as 5, 10, and 20. Finally, the results demonstrate high accuracy in measuring students’ translation abilities. Furthermore, the study collects and examines three data sets, specifically English-Foreign Language Translation Corpus (EFLT), English Language Learners’ Corpus (ELLC), and English-Multilingual Parallel Corpus (EMPC), with a detection accuracy of 0.84, 0.97, and 0.65, respectively.},

The technical and scientific components that have permeated different sports sectors are becoming progressively less important as technology developments and the IoT requires disconnected. To address this problem, this study proposed a based deep learning technique for the tennis sports industry and the implications of smart athletes’ fitness using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The three basic categories of IoT-based smart fitness are player trackers, which include wearable and non-wearable sensors, movement analysis, and player applications. The skills and strategies of tennis players have improved through the use of sports products, and people have come to value physical education more as education has expanded. The development of a smart tennis system is meant to address the slow detection and unpredictable player and coaching staff movements of the traditional game of tennis. The background of the video is rebuilt using a median filter algorithm, and its target is located using an inter-frame difference technique to identify the track’s designated shoulder marker point. Using an enhanced SVM, it creates a tennis service model for evaluating and examining marker point tracks. The experimental results compare the proposed method with different machine learning methods such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms. The classification achieved excellent performance by the player motions, and the SVM is better than the other deep learning.

Deep convolutional networks have been successfully applied for various applications to learn different tasks related to vision, such as image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Deep learning models can generate fine-tuned results by transferring knowledge to large generic datasets. This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of a big data tracking algorithm for aerial images of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to detect houses using neural networks to address the low accuracy and efficiency of manual detection in remote areas by mitigating the associated security risks. In the context of big data, a UAV-based preprocessing method is discussed for images using guided filtering. In order to reduce the impact of radiation distortion on the color and brightness of UAV-based aerial images of houses, a histogram matching method was applied. The guided filtering method is used to solve the problem of imaging details of houses that are not apparent after smoothing and denoising the aerial images. A house detection algorithm based on a deep neural network is then applied to the UAV images to detect the images of houses, and the time consumption of the deep learning operation is examined within the context of big data. Combining deep separation convolution and calculation optimization with YOLOv2 improves the house&#39;s image detection in real-time while preserving an accurate performance of UAV-based aerial images to detect houses by combining the YOLOv2 detection framework. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed method can improve the efficiency and accuracy of house detection using aerial images and has certain practical applications.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a notable upswing in the realm of innovation and entrepreneurship education for Chinese students, leading to remarkable advancements. However, students&#39; initiatives in this field fall short of the desired standards. The current evaluation index system is insufficient for meeting the developmental needs of colleges and universities. Therefore, exploring innovative approaches and implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework become crucial. This research analyzes the limitations of the current evaluation system, which focuses on curriculum, teaching materials, management, research output, student employment, entrepreneurship awareness, and participation. Unfortunately, this narrow approach has a significant impact on the quality of education in this field. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel evaluation system for assessing students&#39; innovation and entrepreneurship education by utilizing the capabilities of backpropagation (BP) neural network. We researched the conceptual framework, components, and learning process of BP neural network. Additionally, we provide a thorough description of the calculation process and structure of the BP neural network algorithm by facilitating stakeholders&#39; understanding. Our study aims to strengthen the landscape of education by developing a culture of excellence. We developed a robust evaluation system with well-defined indexes calibrated to capture the essence of this education. Through precise training and analysis, we achieved remarkable results, with a maximum difference of 1.6\% between the anticipated and actual output. This highlights the accuracy of our model in assessing teaching quality. We also thoroughly compared several kinds of assessment methods for the growth of students’ entrepreneurial and innovative skills that have been presented in the literature. Based on the simulation results, we discovered that our model performs better as compared to the existing model. Based on the evidence, innovation and entrepreneurship education in Chinese institutions can be characterized as moderate. This finding lays the foundation for further advancements, fostering a future where educational excellence and entrepreneurial spirit thrive.},

However, most studies failed to consider variable illumination conditions on the target of interest (ToI), and only focused on detecting the presence or absence of road cracks. This paper proposes a new road crack/defect detection method, IlumiCrack, which integrates Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and object detection CNN models. This work presents several contributions: firstly, a large-scale road crack/defect dataset was prepared using a dashcam with a variety of illumination scenarios. Secondly, experimental evaluations were conducted on 2–4 levels of brightness using GMM for optimal classification. Thirdly, the IlumiCrack framework integrates deep learning-based object detection framework, the YOLO and SSD, to classify road crack and defect images into eight types with high accuracy. In the model training phase, the localization loss was modified to Focal-EIoU, obtaining higher-quality anchor box. Comprehensive model precision and geometric mean (G-mean) achieve 79.1\% and 77.1, respectively. Compared to YOLOv3 and SSD, IlumiCrack improves classification accuracy by at least 15.6\% on two levels of brightness.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study numerical solution of ruin probability of continuous time model. We develop an effective optimal adaptive particle swarm optimization-triangular neural network (PSO-TNN), which consists of three parts: particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) improved trigonometric function, extreme learning machine algorithm with initial conditions (IELM) and improved reduction algorithm. The results obtained that PSO-TNN is superior to triangular neural network (TNN) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and PSO is superior to Aquila Optimizer (AO), Smell Agent Optimization (SAO), African vultures optimization algorithm (AVOA), Arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) in the optimization of neural network. Because the relationship between the number of neural networks and the mean square error is uncertain, we propose the adaptive reduction algorithm (AR). Through the comparison of numerical solutions with the analytical solutions and traditional numerical solutions, the PSO-TNN algorithm clearly reduced the mean square error and relative error. The PSO-TNN algorithm shows a clear improvement in terms of accuracy and overall efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of science and technology, sports activities have advanced at an unprecedented scale in recent years. The rising complexity of advanced technologies has substantial ramifications for the sports industry. Therefore, table tennis coaches can gain useful training and strategic insights by studying technical and tactical data. Thus, the major goal of this research work is to explore the autonomous use of data mining techniques in the evaluation of table tennis strategies and tactics. The primary goal of this study is to undertake in-depth research on a data-mining-based table tennis technical and tactical analysis system. The objective is to give coaches with exact insights into technical and tactical data related to table tennis by enabling them to make informed decisions and provide efficient background information. This paper first designs the overall architecture of the technical and tactical analysis system for table tennis by providing a thorough overview of its functional structure. This functional structure consists of three modules: data acquisition, statistical analysis, and technical and tactical information management. The database of the system is then explained, with a focus on the technical and action table types. Third, this study builds the suggested table tennis system utilizing MySQL database to mark each game in accordance with indications for technical and tactical analysis. The constructed system stores each point&#39;s information and template information according to each game’s information. To enhance the security of data storage, the constructed system improves the efficiency of the overall data collection and query system by realizing targeted query and statistical data according to different technical and tactical indicators. In addition, this paper uses multi-condition screening and multi-condition sorting to process the technical and tactical information. Finally, this paper analyzes the table tennis approaches and tactics using a data mining technique. This is accomplished by combining sequential and inverse correlation analysis modes to produce an analysis system for table tennis tactics. The experimental findings show that the system performs commendably overall, with excellent data mining accuracy and efficiency. The efficiency of the suggested system is verified by the fact that it successfully improves training levels and competitive quality of athletes in table tennis.},

  abstract     = {Modern cutting-edge technologies have changed the appearance of the world and are presently working diligently to turn this partially automated world into a fully autonomous one. The primary players in this quest are the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and artificial intelligence. These technologies are game changers in almost all walks of life, including business, entertainment, healthcare, agriculture, education, etc. In the education sector, these technologies play their role to some extent, but there is still some room that needs to be filled in order to utilize the full potential of these technologies. For instance, there is very limited work in the literature that utilizes these technologies for developing college students’ innovative and entrepreneurial skills. Thus, the main goal of this research is to investigate how big data analysis and IoT might be used by the professional associations of college students to encourage their growth of innovative and entrepreneurial skills. In this study, we tackled this issue in two ways: first, we thoroughly examined how IoT can help college students’ professional associations for developing their innovative and entrepreneurial skills. More specifically, we used IoT to collect data on innovative and entrepreneurial skills from associations of college students. Secondly, we used a big data analytic algorithm, i.e., C4.5 decision tree, to calculate the knowledge acquisition rate for the professional associations of students’ training in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation. The results are carefully evaluated, and a thorough comparison is made with relevant work from the literature. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has a high degree of data classification accuracy and a high data throughput capacity as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed IoT and big data-enabled approach can significantly enhance college students’ professional practice and employment capabilities.},

The proposed approach accepts the X-ray image inputs and diagnoses the lung infection under the aforementioned five categories of major pneumonia infections. Pre-trained models like VGG19, Resnet-50, and NasNetMobile are applied to the diagnosis of chest X-ray images, and their performance is compared against a newly proposed convolutional neural network called the COVNET 2020, since the network is inspired to identify the COVID-19 chest X-ray images.

Identifying the infection manually by radio imaging, on the other hand, was considered, extremely difficult due to the time commitment and significant risk of human error. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques promised exploration in the development of precise and as well as automated COVID-19 detection tools. Convolution neural networks (CNN), a well performing deep learning strategy tends to gain substantial favors among AI approaches for COVID-19 classification. The preprints and published studies to diagnose COVID-19 with CXR pictures using CNN and other deep learning methodologies are reviewed and critically assessed in this research. This study focused on the methodology, algorithms, and preprocessing techniques used in various deep learning architectures, as well as datasets and performance studies of several deep learning architectures used in prediction and diagnosis.

  abstract     = {Image captioning is a technique that allows us to use computers to interpret the information in photographs and make written text. The use of deep learning to interpret image information and create descriptive text has become a widely researched issue since its establishment. Nevertheless, these strategies do not identify all samples that depict conceptual ideas. In reality, the vast majority of them seem to be irrelevant to the matching tasks. The degree of similarity is determined only by a few relevant semantic occurrences. This duplicate instance can also be thought of as noise, as it obstructs the matching process of a few meaningful instances and adds to the model&#39;s computational effort. In the existing scheme, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) are presented. For that reason, captioning is not effective due to its structure. Furthermore, present approaches frequently require the deliberate use of additional target recognition algorithms or costly human labeling when extracting information is required. For image captioning, this research presents a multimodal feature fusion-based deep learning model. The coding layer uses mask recurrent neural networks (Faster RCNN), the long short-term memory has been used to decode, and the descriptive text is constructed. In deep learning, the model parameters are optimized through the method of gradient optimization. In the decoding layer, dense attention mechanisms can assist in minimizing non-salient data interruption and preferentially input the appropriate data for the decryption stage. Input images are used to train a model that, when given the opportunity, will provide captions that are very close to accurately describing the images. Various datasets are used to evaluate the model&#39;s precision and the fluency, or mastery, of the language it acquires by analyzing picture descriptions. Results from these tests demonstrate that the model consistently provides correct descriptions of input images. This model has been taught to provide captions or words describing an input picture. To measure the effectiveness of the model, the system is given categorization scores. With a batch size of 512 and 100 training epochs, the suggested system shows a 95\% increase in performance. The model&#39;s capacity to comprehend images and generate text is validated by the experimental data in the domain of generic images. This paper is implemented using Python frameworks and also evaluated using performance metrics such as PSNR, RMSE, SSIM, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and precision.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurological illness that causes short-term memory loss. There are currently no viable therapeutic therapies for this condition that can cure it. The source of Alzheimer’s disease is unknown. However, genetic factors are thought to have a role in the illness’s development, with about 70\% of the disease’s risk attributed to the vast number of genes associated. Despite discovering several potential AD susceptibility genes through genetic association studies, there is a more significant challenge to identify unidentified AD-associated genes and drug targets to gain a good insight into the disease-causing mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease and develop effective AD therapeutics. The proposed DC-GC (Degree Centrality- Graph Colouring) model brings an accuracy of 96\% for (Artificial Neural Network) ANN model, 87.3\% for KNN (K-Nearest Neighbourhood classifier) classifier, 86\% for SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier, 85.3\% than Decision Tree. It is visible; the network topology model performs well for ANN classifier than other existing models. Similarly, the model also brings a sensitivity measure of 97\% for the ANN model, 84\% for KNN (K-Nearest Neighbourhood classifier), 84.2\% for SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier and 84\% for the Decision tree classifier. In this research work, a novel network topology measure DC-GC (Degree Centrality- Graph Colouring) and intelligent-based machine learning models are used for identifying candidate genes from protein–protein interaction and sequence features of genes. The integrated method helps to identify the target gene for Alzheimer’s disease by evaluating the connectivity between the genes and the physicochemical properties of the genes. The approach helps to rank the genes according to the property that adjacency genes should not share the same colour. The DC-GC (Degree Centrality-Graph Colouring)-based network topology measure provides remarkable improvement over existing centrality measures. The integration of network topology measure with the SVM (Support Vector Machine) model gave promising results of 96\% accuracy, 97\% sensitivity, 98\% specificity, 96\% PPV (Positive Predictive Value), 95\% NPV (Negative Predictive Value) and 97\% F-score.},

  abstract     = {It is well recognized that human societies and their problem-solving capabilities have evolved much faster than biological evolution. The inspiration from human behaviors, knowledge exchange, and transformation has given rise to a new evolutionary computation paradigm. Multiple research endeavors have been reported in the literature inspired by the diverse aspects of human societies with corresponding terminologies to describe the algorithm. These endeavors have resulted in piles of algorithms, worded differently but with more or less similar underlying mechanisms causing immense confusion for a new reader. This paper presents a generalized framework for these socio-inspired evolutionary algorithms (SIEAs) or socio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms. A survey of various SIEAs is provided to highlight the working of these algorithms on a common framework, their variations and improved versions proposed in the literature, and their applications in various fields of search and optimization. The algorithmic description and the comparison of each SIEA with the general framework enable a clearer understanding of the similarities and differences between these methodologies. Efforts have been made to provide an extensive list of references with due context. This paper could become an excellent reference as a starting point for anyone interested in this fascinating field of research.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we intend to propose multiple hybrid algorithms with the idea of giving a choice to the particles of a swarm to update their position for the next generation. To implement this concept, Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) have been utilized. Exhaustive possible combinations of these algorithms are developed and benchmarked against the base algorithms. These hybrid algorithms have been validated on twenty-four well-known unimodal and multimodal benchmarks functions, and detailed analysis with varying dimensions and population size is discussed for the same. Further, the efficacy of these algorithms has been tested on short-term electricity load and price forecasting applications. For this purpose, the algorithms have been combined with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to evaluate their performance on the ISO New Pool England dataset. The results demonstrate that hybrid optimization algorithms perform superior to their base algorithms in most test cases. Furthermore, the results show that the performance of CSA-GWO is significantly better than other algorithms.},

This study explores the use of a new deep learning-based method to design a more accurate automated system for analysing students’ feedback (called DTLP: deep learning and teaching process). The DTLP employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and attention mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, a deep learning-based method using a unified feature set, which is representative of word embedding, sentiment knowledge, sentiment shifter rules, linguistic and statistical knowledge, has not been thoroughly studied with regard to sentiment analysis of student feedback. Furthermore, DTLP uses multiple strategies to overcome the following drawbacks: contextual polarity; sentence types; words with similar semantic context but opposite sentiment polarity; word coverage limit of an individual lexicon; and word sense variations. To evaluate the DTLP, we conducted an experiment on a large volume of students’ feedback. The results showed (i) DTLP outperforms the existing systems in the field, (ii) DTLP that learns from this unified feature set can acquire significantly higher performance than one that learns from a feature subset, (iii) the ensemble of sentiment shifter rules, word embedding, statistical, linguistic, and sentiment knowledge allows DTLP to obtain significant performance, and (iv) an attention mechanism into CNN-BiLSTM improves the performance of DTLP. In addition, the deployed method looks for potential causes behind student feedback.},

  abstract     = {The autoclave curing process is an important step in composite parts production, in which a batch of parts is cured in an autoclave simultaneously by systematically changing the inner temperature and pressure. Typically, curing cycles have three main phases: heating, dwell, and cooling. During the heating phase, parts are heated until they reach a curing temperature. Due to factors such as positions of parts inside the autoclave and batch composition, it is often not possible for the parts to reach the curing temperature simultaneously. Parts that reach the curing temperature earlier than the others are overcured, which negatively affects their quality. Moreover, shorter curing cycles are preferred due to the savings in cost, energy, and time. This study addresses these two considerations with a unified approach that integrates two decision support methods: regression and optimization. In the first stage, we determine the factors affecting the time to reach the curing temperature and relate them using multiple linear regression models. In the second stage, we utilize the regression models of the first stage and determine efficient placements of the parts in the autoclave considering two objectives: minimization of the duration of the heating phase and the maximum time delay between parts in reaching the curing temperature. The former corresponds to increasing productivity and the latter corresponds to minimizing quality losses. We propose a biobjective mixed integer nonlinear programming model together with its equivalent linear model to generate the efficient frontier. Additionally, to obtain solutions faster, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm and its mechanisms that address the problem are proposed. The approach is applied on real cases in a composite factory. The estimates of the regression models are significantly close to the realizations, and considerable gains in both objectives are observed with the optimization tools.},

However, ABC still has the shortcomings of slower convergence and poorer exploitation for complex practical problems. To overcome these limitations, an enhanced algorithm of multi-strategy collaboration based on neighborhood search called EMABC-NS is proposed. Firstly, the information of global optimal individual in the current population and individuals in the neighborhood are employed to the search phase of employed bees and onlooker bees, respectively. Secondly, the modification rate MR is introduced to randomly perturb all dimensions of the solutions. Finally, the search strategy of scout bees is enhanced by integrating current optimal solution and stochastic solution through MR. 23 well-established benchmark functions and 5 engineering optimization problems are utilized to validate the performance of EMABC-NS. The experimental result reveals that EMABC-NS is more competitiveness compared with other outstanding competitors, and it ranks first in the Friedman test. Compared with the other five algorithms, the proposed algorithm is also proved to be effective in solving practical engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {A population-based optimizer called beluga whale optimization (BWO) depicts behavioral patterns of water aerobics, foraging, and diving whales. BWO runs effectively, nevertheless it retains numerous of deficiencies that has to be strengthened. Premature convergence and a disparity between exploitation and exploration are some of these challenges. Furthermore, the absence of a transfer parameter in the typical BWO when moving from the exploration phase to the exploitation phase has a direct impact on the algorithm’s performance. This work proposes a novel modified BWO (mBWO) optimizer that incorporates an elite evolution strategy, a randomization control factor, and a transition factor between exploitation and exploitation. The elite strategy preserves the top candidates for the subsequent generation so it helps generate effective solutions with meaningful differences between them to prevent settling into local maxima. The elite random mutation improves the search strategy and offers a more crucial exploration ability that prevents stagnation in the local optimum. The mBWO incorporates a controlling factor to direct the algorithm away from the local optima region during the randomization phase of the BWO. Gaussian local mutation (GM) acts on the initial position vector to produce a new location. Because of this, the majority of altered operators are scattered close to the original position, which is comparable to carrying out a local search in a small region. The original method can now depart the local optimal zone because to this modification, which also increases the optimizer’s optimization precision control randomization traverses the search space using random placements, which can lead to stagnation in the local optimal zone. Transition factor (TF) phase are used to make the transitions of the agents from exploration to exploitation gradually concerning the amount of time required. The mBWO undergoes comparison to the original BWO and 10 additional optimizers using 29 CEC2017 functions. Eight engineering problems are addressed by mBWO, involving the design of welded beams, three-bar trusses, tension/compression springs, speed reducers, the best design of industrial refrigeration systems, pressure vessel design challenges, cantilever beam designs, and multi-product batch plants. In both constrained and unconstrained settings, the results of mBWO preformed superior to those of other methods.},

  abstract     = {The Space Partition-Unscented Transformation (SPUT) is an efficient reliability method that partitions input space into a number of subspaces and then uses UT approximation to estimate the failure probability. Despite its simplicity, the efficiency of SPUT decreases with increasing the number of random variables and the number of subspaces. In this study, by introducing two different subspace ranking strategies together with the use of low-discrepancy sequences (LDS), a ranked Voronoi diagram-based modified SPUT (MSPUT) is proposed. In the proposed method, each subspace of VD is first assigned a distinct rank according to its contribution to failure probability. Then, MSPUT calculates the failure probability, in a stepwise process, by evaluating performance function(s) for more important subspaces until the proposed convergence criterion is satisfied. Solved benchmark examples showed that the LDS-based ranked MSPUT significantly improved the efficiency of standard SPUT even by analyzing small fractions of subspaces. A hybrid reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) framework is also proposed by integrating MSPUT and an enhanced particle swarm optimization that uses two Constraint Feasibility Check (CFC) operators for safety evaluations of search agents to handle probabilistic constraints of RBDO even more efficiently than the MSPUT. The proposed CFC-based algorithm terminates the incremental MSPUT reliability analysis process for each search agent whenever the status of the candidate solution is either feasible or infeasible with respect to probabilistic constraints. Thereby, it reduces the computational burden of RBDO as much as possible by avoiding numerous performance function evaluations for less important subspaces without compromising the accuracy of results.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimated highway traffic flow info plays a decisive role in dynamic and real-time road management, planning, and preventing frequent/recurring traffic jams, traffic rule violations, and chain/fatal traffic accidents. Traffic flow information is extracted by processing raw camera images via vehicle detection and tracking algorithms. Object detectors including the Yolo, single-shot detector, and EfficientNet algorithms are used for vehicle detection; however, You only look once version 5 (Yolov5) has a clear advantage in terms of real-time performance. Due to this reason, the pre-trained Yolov5 models were utilized in the vehicle detection part, and in the vehicle tracking module, a novel tracker algorithm was developed using vehicle detection features. The performance of the proposed approach was measured by comparing it to the Kalman filter-based tracker. The evaluation results show that the proposed tracking approach outperformed the Kalman filter-based tracker with 5.82\% (Buses), 2.24\% (Cars), 36.50\% (Trucks), and overall 2.58\% better traffic counting accuracy for the 12 nighttime case study videos captured from the highways with different horizontal and vertical angle-of-views.},

The aim of this paper is to obtain a spanning tree which satisfies the connectivity constraint and minimizes the total weight as well. The study uses conditional uncertain variable to describe the relationship between these two aspects of uncertain variables. On this basis, three different models of the UMST problem are suggested, and the equivalence relation between the MST model of uncertain networks with uncertain edge existence and weight and the MST of related deterministic networks is found.

It was shown (Byun et al. in Mathematics 8:571, 2020) that a fuzzy inner product on a vector space, producing a fuzzy real number as its value, is merely the embedding of a real-valued inner product into the fuzzy number systems over the set of tuples consisting of elements in the space because of its linear property. Thus, the linear property is needed to be weakened. In this paper, a new concept, called a fuzzy real weak inner product on a vector space, is introduced and some nontrivial examples are given. Then, a fuzzy real weak inner product in a suitable condition is deeply studied, which may be either almost positive-definite or positive-definite. Furthermore, it satisfies both Cauchy inequality and Parallelogram law even though it is not linear. And some properties of a general type of a fuzzy real weak inner product, especially the approximation related to the Parallelogram law, are investigated in analytic viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {In India, agricultural production is a crucial factor for economic growth. However, plants can be attacked by diseases that range from mild to severe, leading to their destruction. Therefore, it is essential to detect plant diseases at an early stage to prevent such damage. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid Xception transfer learning with crossover optimized kernel extreme learning machine (HXTL-COKELM) method for identifying healthy and diseased plant leaves. The proposed approach preprocesses and extracts image features using transfer learning with the Xception model to improve computation accuracy before classification. Additionally, we developed a crossover-based tasmanian devil-optimized kernel extreme learning machine model to optimize the KELM’s parameters using the TDO algorithm. We collected a dataset with 43,466 images of plant leaves from healthy and diseased plants to train, test, and validate the CNN model. Finally, we evaluated the system&#39;s efficacy using performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, specificity, F1-score, and kappa static value. Our experimental findings show that the proposed HXTL-COKELM method achieves a 98.9\% accuracy rate, outperforming existing methods. The HXTL-COKELM model also exhibits superior overall performance. Thus, the proposed HXTL-COKELM model can effectively detect plant leaf diseases.},

  abstract     = {Server logs are always essential in website maintenance. The services maintained may encounter various problems, and the logs generated by the server are the core data for locating the problem. However, existing log storage systems are susceptible to single points of failure, which can lead to potential log leakage. Meanwhile, external adversaries can tamper with logs to avoid tracking, and administrators can also tamper with logs to evade responsibility. In order to solve these tough shortcomings effectively, introducing blockchain networks seems to be an appropriate solution due to their immutability and decentralized nature. Traditional blockchains lack scalability in storing large files, but this can be tackled by storing log data in the interplanetary file system (IPFS). In this paper, we propose a log data storage scheme combined with blockchain networks and the IPFS technique. First, we utilize the IPFS to store extensive file log data and combine blockchain systems to realize decentralized log data storage in a secure manner. Second, to optimize the query efficiency of log data, we propose two improved Merkle tree methods, providing rapid queries of log data with a timestamp as query keywords (only one-third of the BBT in range query time). Finally, our comprehensive experimental results show that the two proposed methods have better log retrieval efficiency.},

A Cartan null curve is a curve whose tangent vector is light-like on each point, and its module vanishes everywhere along the curve. Due to these special properties of null curves, some research on them shows more particular and interesting prospects. In this paper, the involutes of null Cartan curves are defined and investigated based on the classifications of curves in Minkowski space. The conclusion that the involutes of null Cartan curves only can be space-like is achieved, and the relationships on curvatures, torsions, frames, expressions between a null Cartan curve and its three kinds of space-like involutes are explored. Especially, the pseudo-null involute of a given null Cartan curve can be directly expressed via the structure function of the null curve; the first and second kind space-like involutes of a given null Cartan curve can also be expressed if the tangent distance function is determined. Meanwhile, the k-type null helices and their involutes are expressed by the structure functions of null curves. Last but not least, some typical examples are presented and visualized to characterize such curve pairs explicitly.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy sets, soft sets and N-soft set are essential concepts for fuzzy modeling, decision making under uncertainty and computational intelligence. Nevertheless, all these models have some limitations imposed on the alternatives and attributes. These mathematical models were unable to handle the situations whenever decision makers need to assign non-binary evaluations to both attributes and alternatives. To overcome these problems, Riaz et al. (Symmetry 13(5):1–31, 2021) proposed the idea of M-parameterized N-soft set (MPNSS), through examining independent non-binary evaluations to both parameters and alternatives. MPNSSs are highly convenient in representation of ambiguous and uncertain data in decision analysis during ranking, rating and grading the objects. The proposed model has greater efficiency to handle the imprecision rather than existing mathematical models. Additionally, we develop multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) techniques on account of M-parameterized N-soft sets (MPNSSs), M-parameterized N-soft aggregation operators (MPNSAO) and M-parameterized N-soft weighted aggregation operators (MPNSWAO). For these objectives, we define fundamental operations on MPNSSs and their properties. Meanwhile, several related results are well proven and some algorithms for MADM are also developed. Moreover, the applications of MADM techniques corresponding to proposed algorithms are explained by illustrative material. To explain the presumption, authenticity and effectiveness of the suggested course of actions, we compared the techniques with few existing MADM methods.},

Then, according to the discovered seed community, the similarity between the neighboring nodes of the community and the community is calculated, and the nodes whose similarity meets the threshold are selected. After that, an adaptive optimization function is used to expand the community. Finally, the free nodes that have not been divided into the community are divided into communities, thereby achieving a more comprehensive community discovery.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of data generated by several applications like engineering, biotechnology, energy, and others has become a crucial challenge in the high dimensional data mining. The large amounts of data, especially those with high dimensions, may contain many irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features, which may negatively affect the accuracy and efficiency of the industrial data mining process. Recently, several meta-heuristic optimization algorithms have been utilized to evolve feature selection techniques for dealing with the vast dimensionality problem. Despite optimization algorithms’ ability to find the near-optimal feature subset of the search space, they still face some global optimization challenges. This paper proposes an improved version of the sooty tern optimization (ST) algorithm, namely the ST-AL method, to improve the search performance for high-dimensional industrial optimization problems. ST-AL method is developed by boosting the performance of STOA by applying four strategies. The first strategy is the use of a control randomization parameters that ensure the balance between the exploration–exploitation stages during the search process; moreover, it avoids falling into local optimums. The second strategy entails the creation of a new exploration phase based on the Ant lion (AL) algorithm. The third strategy is improving the STOA exploitation phase by modifying the main equation of position updating. Finally, the greedy selection is used to ignore the poor generated population and keeps it from diverging from the existing promising regions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed ST-AL algorithm, it has been employed as a global optimization method to discover the optimal value of ten CEC2020 benchmark functions. Also, it has been applied as a feature selection approach on 16 benchmark datasets in the UCI repository and compared with seven well-known optimization feature selection methods. The experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm in avoiding local minima and increasing the convergence rate. The experimental result are compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., ALO, STOA, PSO, GWO, HHO, MFO, and MPA and found that the mean accuracy achieved is in range 0.94–1.00.},

The widely used kernel-based methods mainly map process variables into kernel space without considering the relationship between the high-dimension features and quality indicators; therefore, the modeling performance of such transform cannot be guaranteed. For quality-related kernel learning, we propose a framework consisting of flexible neural transform and fixed kernel mapping. In this framework, neural network is used to learn representations for predicting quality indicators in the following kernel regression models. For monitoring the quality-related and quality-independent information, we present a solution for relevant subspaces decomposition and the diagnostic logic is summarized based on the quality-related and quality-independent statistics.

Also, we obtain the soft-threshold wavelet shrinkage estimator in high dimensional cases. Denoising real data set is one of the challenges in this field.

  abstract     = {Deep learning algorithms developed in recent decades have performed well in prediction and classification using accumulated big data. However, as climate change has recently become a more serious global problem, natural disasters are occurring frequently. When analyzing natural disasters from the perspective of a data analyst, they are considered as outliers, and the ability to predict outliers (natural disasters) using deep learning algorithms based on big data acquired by computers is limited. To predict natural disasters, deep learning algorithms must be enhanced to be able to predict outliers based on information such as the correlation between the input and output. Thus, algorithms that specialize in one field must be developed, and specialized algorithms for abnormal values must be developed to predict natural disasters. Therefore, considering the correlation between the input and output, we propose a positive and negative perceptron (PNP) algorithm to predict the flow rate of rivers using climate change-sensitive precipitation. The PNP algorithm consists of a hidden deep learning layer composed of positive and negative neurons. We built deep learning models using the PNP algorithm to predict the flow of three rivers. We also built comparative deep learning models using long short-term memory (LSTM) to validate the performance of the PNP algorithm. We compared the predictive performance of each model using the root mean square error and symmetric mean absolute percentage error and demonstrated that it performed better than the LSTM algorithms .},

Current image classification methods with supervised learning have achieved good classification accuracy. However, supervised image classification methods mainly focus on the semantic differences at the class level, while lacking attention to the instance level. The core idea of contrastive learning is to compare positive and negative samples in the feature space to learn the feature representation, and the focus on instance-level information can make up for the lack of supervised learning. To this end, in this paper, we combine supervised learning and contrastive learning to propose labeled contrastive learning (LCL). Here, the supervised learning component ensures the distinguishability of different classes, the contrastive learning component enhances the compactness within classes and the separability between classes. In the contrastive learning component, instances with the same label are set as positive samples and instances with different labels are set as negative samples, which avoids the problem of false negative samples (positive samples are mislabeled as negative samples). Also, we applied a dynamic label memory bank and a momentum updated encoder. The experimental results show that LCL can further improve the accuracy of image classification compared with some supervised learning method.},

  abstract     = {The hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution reconstruction has attracted much attention and been used widely in various study fields due to its low requirements on hardware in practice. However, most of the hyperspectral image super-resolution reconstruction studies apply one strategy for images with varying complexity of spatial information. This is not conducive to the improvement of Image processing efficiency and the extraction of complex details. Given the above, a new method named MSDESR (multilevel streams and detail enhancement) is proposed to reconstruct HSI by using partition reconstruction and detail enhancement. The MSDESR consists of a sub-map shunt block, a high-low-frequency information extraction with detail enhancement block, and a partition image reconstruction block. Firstly, the sub-map shunt block is designed to pre-classify hyperspectral images. The images are divided into complex and simple parts according to the spatial information distribution of the reconstructed sub-map. Secondly, the multiscale Retinex with detail enhancement algorithm is constructed to purify high-frequency noise-contaminated and enhance the image details by separating the samples into high- and low-frequency information. Finally, branching networks of different complexities are designed to reconstruct the images with high credibility and clear content. In this paper, datasets of QUST-1, Pavia University, Chikusei, the Washington DC Mal and XiongAn are applied in the experiments. The results show that MSDESR outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based methods in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and computational effort, with a 4.18\% and 9.35\% improvement in SRE and MPSNR metrics, and a 37\% saving in FLOPs. Overall, the MSDESR performs well in hyperspectral image super-resolution reconstruction, which is time saving and preserves the details of spatial information.},

As an important part of intelligent network management, wireless network traffic prediction has attracted more attention. Meanwhile, low delay communication is also an important part of the prediction task that needs to be considered. However, traditional deep learning models have many drawbacks in traffic prediction, such as excessive running time and computing resources. To address these issues, especially jointly considering effectiveness and efficiency, we propose a stacked broad learning system with multitask learning method for traffic flow prediction, called MTL-SBLS. Specifically, we use related tasks with similar change patterns as input to the prediction model and share more relevant features through multi-task learning. The multi-layer stacking structure of stacking broad learning system can effectively capture the traffic data features and ensure high prediction performance. When stacking new blocks, the fixed structure and weight of the underlying basic broad learning system blocks ensure that the newly generated stacking broad learning system still has a low computational cost. Finally, the experiments on three real data sets demonstrate that the MTL-SBLS model outperforms the other existing prediction methods (93.38\% prediction accuracy on average). Furthermore, the MTL-SBLS model can maintain a running time of less than 10 sec on all three datasets, indicating that it is efficient. Thus, the MTL-SBLS model is proved to improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction while maintaining low complexity and running time.},

To improve the naturalness, fluency, and accuracy of translation, this study proposes a new training strategy, the transformer fast gradient method with relative positional embedding (TF-RPE), which includes the fast gradient method (FGM) of adversarial training and relative positional embedding. The input sequence is founded on the transformer model, and after the word embedding matrix converts a word vector in the word embedding layer, the positional encoding can be embedded in it through relative positional embedding, helping the word vector to better save the linguistic information of the word (meaning, semantics). The addition of FGM adversarial training to the multi-head attention encoder mechanism strengthens the training of word vectors and reduces the phenomenon of miss-or-error translation, enabling significant improvement of the overall computational efficiency and accuracy of the model. TF-RPE can also provide satisfactory high-quality translations for the low-resource corpus. Extensive ablation studies and comparative analyses validate the effectiveness of the scheme, and TF-RPE achieves an improvement of average 3+ Bilingual evaluation understudy scores compared with the SOTA methods.},

In the textile production process, the problem of large variation in textile defect shape scale and edge uncertainty makes textile defect detection very difficult. We propose a textile defect detection method based on context receptive field and adaptive feature fusion. Firstly, we introduce an improved context receptive field block (CRFB) in the backbone network CSPDarknet53. It makes full use of local and global context information to enhance the extraction capability of the backbone network for textile defect features. Secondly, a deconvolution-based adaptive feature fusion network (DAFF) is designed to improve the transfer efficiency of shallow localization information and feature scale invariance. Finally, exponential distance IoU (EDIoU) is proposed to optimize the calculation of bounding box loss and adaptively weighting the bounding box gradient to improve the detection accuracy of the model. The experimental results on ZJU-Leaper and Tianchi datasets show that the mAP of this paper reaches 42.5\% and 61.5\%, which are 2.9\% and 3\% higher than the baseline YOLOv5s, respectively.

  abstract     = {There are various indicators, i.e., Relative Strength Index (RSI) [1] [2], Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) [3] [4] [5] [6], Stochastic Oscillator [7] [8] applications, to determine market movements with buying and selling decisions in computational Finance, but they have drawbacks that induced discrepancies to match against the best trading times at fixed order-triggering boundaries and delay problems. For example, RSI [1] [2]’s 70 and 30 overbuy and oversell are fixed boundaries. Orders can only be triggered when RSI’s value exceeds one of these boundaries, its computation only considers past market condition prompting indicators like RSI to trigger orders with delay. In this paper, we proposed a method to reduce these problems with advanced AI technologies to generate indicators’ buy and sell signals in the best trading time. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [9] has outstanding performance to learn time-series data automatic with long-time sequences but its ordinary RNN units [10] [11] such as Long-Short-Term-Memory(LSTM)[12] are unable to decipher the relationships between time units called context. Hence, researchers have proposed an algorithm based on RNNs’ Attention Mechanism [13] [14] allowing RNNs to learn information such as chaotic attributes [15] [16] [17] [18] and Quantum properties [19] [20] [21] contained in time sequences. Chaos Theory [15] [16] and Quantum Finance Theory (QFT) [22] are also proposed to simulate these two features (or attributes?). Quantum Price Level (QPL) [22] [23] is one of the well-formed QFT models to simulate all possible vibration levels to locate price. The system used in this paper consists of two components 1) neural network to predict future data and solve indicators lagging problem, and 2) fuzzy logic to solve fixed order-triggering boundaries problem. Its system design has two main parts 1) Chaotic HLCO Predictor consists of LSTM, Lee-Oscillator and attention mechanism to predict the High, Low, Close and Open, 2) QPL-based Fuzzy Logic Trading Strategy to receive the result and trigger trading signals. This new proposed model has obtained significant results in backtesting previous data and outperformed other traditional indicators to facilitate investment decisions when market changes constantly.

  abstract     = {Facial beauty prediction (FBP) is an important and challenging problem in the fields of computer vision and machine learning. Not only it is easily prone to overfitting due to the lack of large-scale and effective data, but also difficult to quickly build robust and effective facial beauty evaluation models because of the variability of facial appearance and the complexity of human perception. Transfer Learning can be able to reduce the dependence on large amounts of data as well as avoid overfitting problems. Broad learning system (BLS) can be capable of quickly completing models building and training. For this purpose, Transfer Learning was fused with BLS for FBP in this paper. Firstly, a feature extractor is constructed by way of CNNs models based on transfer learning for facial feature extraction, in which EfficientNets are used in this paper, and the fused features of facial beauty extracted are transferred to BLS for FBP, called E-BLS. Secondly, on the basis of E-BLS, a connection layer is designed to connect the feature extractor and BLS, called ER-BLS. Finally, experimental results show that, compared with the previous BLS and CNNs methods existed, the accuracy of FBP was improved by E-BLS and ER-BLS, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of the method presented, which can also be widely used in pattern recognition, object detection and image classification.},

  abstract     = {The classical TODIM considers the crisp numbers to handle the information. However, in a real-world applicative context, this information is bounded by noise and vagueness and hence uncertain. There are wide range of works in the literature which utilizes fuzzy sets to handle the uncertainty in the various dimensions. However, there is a constraint of hesitancy in such decision-making problems due to the involvement of various decision-makers. Also, in the TODIM method, decision-maker’s bounded rationality and psychological behavior are also taken into consideration which adds up the hesitation and considers the problem with higher dimension of uncertainty. There are various applications of fuzzy TODIM using type-2 fuzzy numbers where uncertainty is being handled in more than one dimensions and also the introduction of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers where hesitancy factor of a decision-maker is taken into account. This paper targets to handle the uncertainty in more than one dimension keeping the hesitancy part into consideration for intelligent decision-making. Therefore, a novel trapezoidal type-2 intuitionistic fuzzy set (TrT2 IFS) is proposed, which is an aggregation of several triangular IFSs having upper and lower membership along with a non-membership value. For this TrT2 IFS, we have defined the generation procedure, operations, comparison and distance between such TrT2 IFSs. In addition, the decision-maker weights and criterion weight computation are also presented with respect to the TODIM approach. Furthermore, we have applied this extended TrT2 IFS-based TODIM method into a renewable energy resource selection problem of multi-criteria decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) is an effective technique to share unconditional secure keys among a pair of legal distant users with the existence of eavesdroppers. It depends upon quantum mechanics that exhibits the probability for an eavesdropper to acquire full information on the key is forbidden by the laws of physics. Though quantum mechanics assure the security of the QKD system, it is critical to inspect whether the imperfections can result in the revelation of sensitive data. The presence of imperfections can result in side-channel attacks and the ones relevant to single-photon detectors are crucial as it is adopted in several QKD approaches. For resolving these issues, this study develops a new Security in Quantum side Channel (SQSC) framework to accomplish security. The proposed SQSC approach involves the design of Shifting and Binary Conversions (SBC) algorithm with two sub-processes namely shifting process and binary conversion. Since none of the works have been developed quantum channel in the current system to secure data, the proposed model added complexity to the secret data (shifting process and binary conversion using SBC) before q-bit conversion. The design of SBC algorithm to resolve side-channel attacks and accomplish improved security shows the novelty of the work. In order to demonstrate the enhanced performance of the SQSC approach, a comparison study with existing model is performed. The experimental results reported the promising performance of the SQSC approach over the other existing methods.},

Thus, determining the optimal spatial placement of EVCS becomes essential for the success of EVs in a market. Time taken by classical computers to solve such combinatorial optimization problems increases exponentially with the size of the area, making them non-scalable. We propose a novel quantum-classical solution to solve this problem. A crucial idea of our approach is to move the more complex combinatorial optimization portion of the problem into a quantum algorithm. We show that our solution gives more than 500\% improvement in speed compared to the state-of-the-art classical methods, thus making it well suited for scalability scenarios.

Furthermore, the created individuals are updated using an adaptive rotation angle operator that helps refine new individuals to converge to the optimal solution. We performed comparative tests with other quantum evolutionary algorithms and the classical genetic algorithm to demonstrate that this proposal performed better with the tested problem.

  abstract     = {Brain tumors are the second important origin of death worldwide. The early and exact identification of brain tumors is significant for the healing process. With accelerating diagnoses, medicine as well as pricing, quantum computing permits disruptive cases to providers. Quantum improved deep learning was especially significant to the sector. However, the conventional machine learning method faces main challenges to achieve accurate brain tumor detection with MRI images. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel technique called Lee sigma filtered histogram segmentation (LSFHS) for accurately detecting brain tumors with minimal time consumption. LSFHS technique is based on preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Input MRI image is preprocessed using adaptive Lee sigma filter in the first hidden layer to minimize noise significantly. In hidden layer 2, gray bimodal histogram segmentation is performed to partition a preprocessed image into a number of segments. Multiple features are extracted from the input image in the third hidden layer. Output layer uses the TanH activation function to match extracted features with disease features for detecting brain tumors. Experimental evaluation is carried out on factors, namely peak signal-to-noise ratio, tumor detection accuracy, error rate and tumor detection with a number of MRI images. The results illustrate LSFHS technique increases tumor detection accuracy by 14\% and 25\% faster tumor detection time, and reduces the error rate by 58\% compared to state-of-the-art works. Qualitative and quantitative results illustrate that our proposed LSFHS technique attains greater performance than state-of-the-art methods. LSFHS technique is designed to detect brain tumors at an earlier stage with higher tumor detection accuracy and less time.},

  abstract     = {Research in the field of medicine and relevant studies evince that melanoma is one of the deadliest cancers. It defines precisely that the condition develops due to uncontrolled growth of melanocytic cells. The current trends in any disease detection revolve around the usage of two main categories of models; these are general machine learning models and deep learning models. Further, the experimental analysis of melanoma has an additional requirement of visual records like dermatological scans or normal camera lens images. This further accentuates the need for a more accurate model for melanoma detection. In this work, we aim to achieve the same, primarily by the extensive usage of neural networks. Our objective is to propose a deep learning CNN framework-based model to improve the accuracy of melanoma detection by customizing the number of layers in the network architecture, activation functions applied, and the dimension of the input array. Models like Resnet, DenseNet, Inception, and VGG have proved to yield appreciable accuracy in melanoma detection. However, in most cases, the dataset was classified into malignant or benign classes only. The dataset used in our research provides seven lesions; these are melanocytic nevi, melanoma, benign keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratoses, vascular lesions, and dermatofibroma. Thus, through the HAM10000 dataset and various deep learning models, we diversified the precision factors as well as input qualities. The obtained results are highly propitious and establish its credibility.},

  abstract     = {Fostered by technological and theoretical developments, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in many applications, but their training via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can be very costly due to the possibly tens of millions of parameters to be optimized and the large amounts of training examples that must be processed. The computational cost is exacerbated by the inefficiency of the uniform sampling typically used by SGD to form the training mini-batches: since not all training examples are equally relevant for training, sampling these under a uniform distribution is far from optimal, making the case for the study of improved methods to train DNNs. A better strategy is to sample the training instances under a distribution where the probability of being selected is proportional to the relevance of each individual instance; one way to achieve this is through importance sampling (IS), which minimizes the gradients’ variance w.r.t. the network parameters, consequently improving convergence. In this paper, an IS-based adaptive sampling method to improve the training of DNNs is introduced. This method exploits side information to construct the optimal sampling distribution and is dubbed regularized adaptive sampling (RAS). Experimental comparison using deep convolutional networks for classification of the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets shows that when compared against SGD and against another sampling method in the state of the art, RAS produces improvements in the speed and variance of the training process without incurring significant overhead or affecting the classification.},

Nowadays, many QAs have been proposed, whose general conclusion is that using the effects of quantum mechanics results in a significant speedup (exponential, polynomial, super polynomial) over the traditional algorithms. This implies that some complex problems currently intractable with traditional algorithms can be solved with QA. On the other hand, DL algorithms offer what is known as machine learning techniques. DL is concerned with teaching a computer to filter inputs through layers to learn how to predict and classify information. Observations can be in the form of plain text, images, or sound. The inspiration for deep learning is the way that the human brain filters information.

It proposes an intelligent sociocentric approach that calculates the degree of potential relationship of a social network of finite size by proposing a fuzzy graph social network model. It takes into account social entity functional and relational attributes simultaneously. It computes the degree of potential relationship of a social network in two steps. The first step computes the fuzzy pairwise relationship between all social nodes or entities by incorporating the proposed fuzzy node activeness index parameter with an online and offline communication relationship. The second step further uses all fuzzy pairwise relationships calculated in the first step to calculate the degree of potential relationship of a social network. It uses an astute function that utilizes weighted arithmetic and geometric means of the relationships between entities. It also uses two weights—betweenness and closeness centrality of an entity in the social network. The paper performs the experimental work on a small WhatsApp social network of undergraduate students in the university for 6 months. Hence, the paper proposes the degree of potential relationship in social networks, which may be used as a global parameter to compare different social networks by simultaneously incorporating social node&#39;s functional and relational attributes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the quantum technology is exploited to empower the OPTICS unsupervised learning algorithm, which is a density-based clustering algorithm with numerous applications in the real world. We design an algorithm called Quantum Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (QOPTICS) and demonstrate that its computational complexity outperforms that of its classical counterpart. On the other hand, we propose a Deep self-learning approach for modeling the improvement of two Swarm Intelligence Algorithms, namely Artificial Orca Algorithm (AOA) and Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) in order to improve their effectiveness. The deep self-learning approach is based on two well-known dynamic mutation operators, namely Cauchy mutation operator and Gaussian mutation operator. And in order to improve the efficiency of these algorithms, they are hybridized with QOPTICS and executed on just one cluster it yields. This way, both effectiveness and efficiency are handled. To evaluate the proposed approaches, an intelligent application is developed to manage the dispatching of emergency vehicles in a large geographic region and in the context of Covid-19 crisis in order to avoid an important loss in human lives.

  abstract     = {The trade of humans aimed at the intention of forced labor, sexual slavery, commercial sexual slavery, or else others is termed human trafficking (HT). It happens inside a nation or else trans-nationality. Victims of trafficking may be of whichever age and gender. Herein, the face recognition (FR) design to fight against HT is propounded centred on surveillance videos aimed at rescuing the victims. Initially, the missing persons’ image is gathered as of the police department and then undergoes pre-processing. In the pre-processing phase, filtering (Gaussian filter (GF)) is executed to eradicate the noise existent in the image, and contrast enhancement (IMF-CLAHE) is done to acquire the contrast-enhanced image (EI). Next, in the image, the face is identified utilizing Viola–Jones algorithm (VJA). Then, feature extraction (FE) occurs; after that dimensionality reduction utilizing P7SKLDA is executed. The dimensionality reduced features are then inputted into the MDBN classifier to recognize the person. After performing FR on the inputted data, FR is executed on the surveillance videos by transforming the videos to frames. Lastly, motion estimation utilizing the Horn–Schunck Optical flow (HSOF) methodology is utilized to enumerate the relative motion betwixt surveillance videos’ frames aimed at detecting the location of the missing one’s trafficking. Lastly, the proposed design’s performance is analogized with the existent methodologies to deduce this methodology’s superiority.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective optimization has a wide range of applications in science and engineering. Various multiobjective optimization algorithms work fine for bi-objective problems with few variables. However, many problems involve several functions that handle many variables each, and there is no efficient mathematical method to solve these types of problems. Quantum computers offer an exponential speed-up for such problems when they take full advantage of quantum phenomena. At present, quantum multiobjective problem solvers for quantum computers do not exist. This paper presents a formal statistical analysis of two state-of-the-art classical multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and three quantum-inspired multiobjective optimization algorithms to determine whether quantum solvers can provide comparatively optimal quality solutions or if they are limited. One of the quantum-inspired algorithms tested is a novel proposal that uses fewer qubits. The paper also presents contributions to the state of the art by modifying two original, quantum-inspired algorithms to perform in continuous search spaces. The purpose of this paper is to settle the first step of multiobjective quantum optimization for quantum computers from quantum-inspired algorithms by providing valuable results that can assist in future research along the way in this field. The results indicated that the quantum-inspired algorithms tested performed as well as the NSGA-II, and the proposed method outperforms the other quantum-inspired algorithms in problems with constraints and complicated Pareto sets.},

  abstract     = {Globe&#39;s primary issue is global warming, water temperatures have accompanied it as the sea surface temperature, and it is the primary attribute to balance the energy on the earth&#39;s surface. Sea surface temperature prediction is vital to climate forecast. Downwelling currents carry some of this heat to the ocean&#39;s bottom layers, which are also heating, covering far behind the increase in sea surface temperature. In deep learning models, the correct loss function will try to reduce the error and converge fast. The proposed improved loss function correctly estimates how close the predictions made by the long short-term memory match the observed values in the training data. This research considers location-specific sea surface temperature predictions using the improved loss function in the long short-term memory neural network at six different locations around India for daily, weekly, and monthly time horizons. Most existing research concentrated on periodic forecasts, but this paper focused on daily, weekly, and monthly predictions. The improved loss function—long short-term memory, achieved 98.7\% accuracy, and this improved loss function overcomes the limitations of the existing techniques and reduces the processing time to ~ 0.35 s. In this research, the sea surface temperature prediction using the improved loss function in the long short-term memory neural network gives better results than the standard prediction models and other existing techniques by considering the long-time dependencies and obtaining features from the spatial data.},

The mean skin surface temperature was measured in neck, forearm, abdomen and calf region for normal, overweight and obese children. Two modified pre-trained CNN (MobileNet-V2 and VGG-16) and Customized Net are studied for multi-class categorization of normal, overweight and obese thermograms. In addition, VQC was simulated and compared with the performance of deep learning techniques. Among the regional temperature studied, abdominal region exhibited high temperature difference of 3.72 °C (10.96\%) and 5.56 °C (16.84\%) between normal vs overweight and normal vs obese, respectively. The proposed Customized Net model achieved the best overall accuracy of 91.6\% and 89.3\% for abdomen region and neck region, respectively. Similarly, VQC has illustrated best classification accuracy in neck (84.4\%) and abdomen (82.2\%) regions. Moreover, VQC model promotes reduction in the computational cost for the diagnosis of obesity based on thermal imaging. Hence, regional thermogram assessment with deep learning and quantum computing approach is considered as a feasible method for preliminary screening of overweight and obesity condition in children.},

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely employed as a significant tool to diagnose dystrophinopathies. Though MRI is effective, it is mainly based on personal experiences and can simply result in misdiagnosis. This study designs a multi-objective quantum tunicate swarm optimization with deep learning (MOQTSO-DL) model to diagnose dystrophinopathies using muscle MRI images. The proposed model involves a RoI detection process by an optimized region growing approach where the initial seed points and thresholds are effectively determined by the MOQTSO algorithm. Besides, capsule network (CapsNet) is employed as a feature extractor to derive an optimal set of features. Moreover, MOQTSO with extreme learning machine (ELM) based classifier is used to allocate appropriate class labels for the muscle MRI images. The design of the MOQTSO algorithm for the initial seed point selection of RoI detection and parameter tuning of the ELM model depicts the novelty of the work. Extensive experimental analysis is carried out to showcase the improved performance of the proposed method. The simulation outcomes reported the better classification outcomes of the MOQTSO-DL method over the other compared methods.},

In fact, during the Covid-19 pandemic, everything from the corporate world to educational institutes has shifted from offline to online. It leads to exponential increase in intrusions and attacks over the Internet-based technologies. One of the lethal threat surfacing is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that can cripple down Internet-based services and applications in no time. The attackers are updating their skill strategies continuously and hence elude the existing detection mechanisms. Since the volume of data generated and stored has increased manifolds, the traditional detection mechanisms are not appropriate for detecting novel DDoS attacks. This paper systematically reviews the prominent literature specifically in deep learning to detect DDoS. The authors have explored four extensively used digital libraries (IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, Springer) and one scholarly search engine (Google scholar) for searching the recent literature. We have analyzed the relevant studies and the results of the SLR are categorized into five main research areas: (i) the different types of DDoS attack detection deep learning approaches, (ii) the methodologies, strengths, and weaknesses of existing deep learning approaches for DDoS attacks detection (iii) benchmarked datasets and classes of attacks in datasets used in the existing literature, and (iv) the preprocessing strategies, hyperparameter values, experimental setups, and performance metrics used in the existing literature (v) the research gaps, and future directions.},

  abstract     = {Latest advancements in real-time remote sensing sensors and platform lead to the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) which enable the accessibility of high-resolution imaging data. Since image classification appears like a basic interconnection among aerial images and the corresponding applications, it intends to categorize images into semantic classes. Several earlier works have concentrated on the classification of an image into a single semantic label, whereas in the real world, an aerial image is commonly interrelated to many class labels, for instance, multiple object-level labels. Moreover, a broad image of present objects in provided high-resolution aerial image offers an extensive interpretation of the investigated area. To attain this, this paper presents a new quantum neural network based multilabeled aerial image classification (QNN-MLAIC) model. The proposed QNN-MLAIC model involves different processes, namely image acquisition, preprocessing, object detection, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, the aerial images are acquired by wireless UAVs and are preprocessed. Then, the Faster RCNN technique with Inception with Residual Network-v2 model as the baseline model is applied as an object detector, which detects the existence of multiple objects in the aerial image and generates a helpful set of feature vectors. Finally, QNN is employed as classifier, which categorizes the aerial images into multiple class labels. In order to tune the parameters involved in QNN model, the beetle antenna search algorithm is employed. Detailed performance analysis of the proposed QNN-MLAIC model takes place using the UC Merced dataset (UCM) aerial dataset, and the outcomes are investigated under many dimensions. The experimental outcome ensured the goodness of the presented QNN-MLAIC method on the applied UCM aerial dataset over the compared methods.},

This is particularly important in sectors where variability is inherent the process to be planned. The drawback of robust optimization is the chance of producing over-conservative solutions with respect to the real occurrences of the stochastic parameters. Information can be added in order to better control the extra cost resulting from considering the parameter variability. This work investigates how demand forecasting can be used in conjunction with robust optimization in order to achieve an optimal planning while considering demand uncertainties. In the proposed procedure, forecast is used to update uncertain parameters of the robust model. Moreover, the robustness budget is optimized at each planned stage in a rolling planning horizon. In this way, the parameters of the robust model can be dynamically updated tacking information from the data. The study is applied to a reverse logistics case, where the planning of sorting for material recycling is affected by uncertainties in the demand, consisting of waste material to be sorted and recycled. Results are compared with a standard robust optimization approach, using real case instances, showing potentialities of the proposed method.},

To solve the problem under study a dynamic hierarchical hyper-heuristic approach is proposed. The main idea of the hyper-heuristics is to search the space of low-level heuristics for solving computationally difficult problems. The proposed approach is “dynamic” since the low-level heuristic to be executed is chosen on the basis of the main characteristics of the instance to be solved. The term “hierarchical” is used to indicate the fact that the main hyper-heuristic can execute either simple heuristics or can run in a “recursive fashion” a hyper-heuristic. The developed solution strategy is evaluated empirically by performing extensive experiments on irregular packing benchmark instances. A comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches is also carried out. The computational results are very encouraging.},

  abstract     = {The planning process in urban rail transportation can be split into several stages, including line planning, timetabling, rolling stock scheduling and so on. The outcome of a stage provides inputs or constraints to the subsequent ones. However, while the output can be good or optimal at each stage, it rarely considers the global quality for the overall planning process. Furthermore, problems tackled at planning phase often use a more aggregate representation of reality, to achieve a more general overview. An integrated approach, while more complex to solve, may mitigate the gap between solution of different stages and a validation of a plan would still be required before its implementation in practice. In this paper, we focus on integrated optimization of train timetabling and rolling stock circulation for urban rail transit line with time-based origin-destination-dependent passenger travel demand and heterogeneous rolling stocks. The aim is to generate a comfortable timetable for passengers and an efficient timetable for operators. The objective is to minimize the total waiting time for passengers and the costs for operators, while constraints regarding train movements, passenger boarding and alighting, available rolling stocks and their capacity are considered. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated and solved by an iterative programming approach. Computational experiments are performed on the Chongqing Rail Transit Line 2 to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and solving method. With respect to CPLEX, results show the proposed iterative programming approach has advantages both on computation time and solution quality.},

The comparison, carried out on three different real world datasets, reveals better predictive performance for the shallow approach. The latter appears also more robust and less demanding, reducing the inference time by a factor of 2.5 to 4.5 compared to Echo State Networks.},

The aggregator establishes the pricing scheme by optimizing the supply strategy with the aim of maximizing the profit, prosumers react to the price signals by scheduling the flexible loads and managing the home energy system to minimize the electricity bill. The problem is solved by a heuristic approach which exploits the specific model structure. Some numerical experiments have been carried out on a real test case.

In particular, three different types of controllable appliances (shiftable, interruptible, thermostatically controllable) have been considered, each one with a specific representation of energy consumption profile and a potential discomfort rate for the user. The inherent uncertainty affecting the main model parameters (i.e., non- controllable loads, solar production, external temperature) is explicitly accounted for by adopting the two-stage stochastic programming modeling paradigm. The model solution provides the prosumager with the optimal scheduling of the controllable loads and the operation of the storage system that guarantee the minimum expected energy procurement cost, taking into account the overall discomfort. A preliminary computational experience has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of cost savings and the advantage related to the use of a stochastic programming approach over a deterministic formulation.},

In this paper, we derive a connection between parametric systems and interval linear programming, where interval parametric linear systems can be used to describe the weak optimal solution set. Then, we discuss the branch-and-prune framework for generating an approximation of the weak feasible set of such systems via a union of interval boxes. We propose two new pruning conditions that can be used to test infeasibility of interval boxes within the framework, based on interval linear algebra and on the geometry of zonotopes. Furthermore, we also design a condition for pruning the interval boxes by feasibility, which allows us to generate an inner approximation of the weak feasible set. Computational experiments illustrate competitiveness of the proposed pruning tests in comparison with other available pruning conditions. The experiments indicate that the test based on interval linear algebra usually produces the least number of boxes, while the zonotope-based test is right behind and runs several times faster.},

This problem consists of locating a cold storage warehouse, from which vehicles of limited capacity are dispatched to serve a given number of supermarkets with uncertain service requirements, and determining the order of supermarkets served by each vehicle. First, the LRP is solved by using a classical approach based on a deterministic model where the service requirements, i.e. customer demands, are defined through sample means. Second, we propose an indifference zone approach to the LRP. The indifference zone procedures are specific ranking and selection methods aimed at selecting the best option from a set of alternative configurations. In particular, they attempt to guarantee the probability of correct choice, while minimising the computational effort. The numerical results presented in the paper highlight the risk of biased decision making when mere sample means are used in a deterministic model. In addition, they show the effectiveness of indifference zone approaches to the dairy products distribution activity.},

We present the algorithm in a basic version based on genetic algorithms, and as an improved version based on genetic algorithms combined with decision trees. We tested the basic and the improved approach on benchmark datasets either as serial and parallel version. The improved version strongly reduces the computational time needed for finding optimized hyper-parameters.

As a consequence, it is shown how standard portfolio optimization models can result in an unstable model also when the covariance matrix is well conditioned and the objective function is numerically stable. This depends on the fact that the linear equality constraints of the model very often suffer of almost collinearity and/or bad scaling. A theoretical approach is proposed that exploiting an equivalent formulation of the original optimization problem considerably reduces such structural component of instability. The effectiveness of the proposal is empirically certified through applications on real financial data when numerical optimization approaches are needed to compute the optimal portfolio.

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) is frequently employed to improve human lives by monitoring various physical and mental activities. IoT may significantly improve the performance and advancement of athletes by collecting, analyzing, and tracking consumer data. Training and teaching are widely used in sports to exploit the benefits of various technologies such as image processing, computer vision, big data, and advanced artificial intelligence. In sports, the traditional technical movement analysis using video and high-speed photography is used to standardize action, which is essential for improving performance of the athletes. This paper uses IoT technology to build a feature model for technical actions in sports so that the manifestation of information can be more diversified and then collate, store, transmit, and process the multimedia data. It uses image processing technology to quantitatively analyze sports technical action to build an action model. It combines the forward kinematics of the human body based on the root bone using deep learning-enabled human bone recognition algorithm. Next, it uses the obtained information to construct the structural model of human body, and athletes’ sports data are fed into it to complete the quantitative processing of action characteristics and pattern analysis. Finally, the application impact of the analysis model for striking force by the legs on sports athletes reveals that the maximum strike force of athletes is 486 N after reaching the target for 13 s, and then, it starts to fall. In sports training, the accuracy of each leg joint varies according to athletes’ speed, wherein the contribution of the hip was 20.5\%, the knee was 20.5\%, and the ankle was 71.1\%, respectively. As a result, the method presented in this study for forward kinematics of the human body provides a robust and fast technique for determining the position and attitude of rigid body chains. This approach eliminates repetitive computations and increases computing performance by focusing on the trunk bone first, recursive calculations, and transformation matrices. These developments lead to this paper’s higher performance when compared to earlier research by making it a noteworthy addition to human body kinematics.},

  abstract     = {The information era has raised expectations for cinema and television production in recent years. As a result, movie and television production has changed from silent to sound, black-and-white to color, along with more varieties and contents. Therefore, movies, television, and photography use camera motion tracking for effective performance. Based on the benefits and scope of the motion tracking technology, this study uses the aforementioned technology for cinema, television, and photography based on Big data. First, the video-based human motion tracking technology is described in detail, and video motion detection algorithms are introduced. Next, Big data technology is explained and integrated with motion tracking technology in movies and television production along with photography. The method selects the Hadoop open-source cloud platform as the underlying platform and combines the MapReduce distributed programming model and Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Next, it explains the types of real-time tracking technology, lists the operation process of motion tracking by applying it in movies and television production. The particle filter algorithm is employed for human motion tracking in movies, television production and photography technology. This algorithm tracks the initial posture of human body in the video, gathers tracking data, and analyzes human motion information and actions within the recorded footage. Finally, the results of motion tracking algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization-Particle Filter (PSO-PF), Particle Filter (PF), Kalman Filter (KF), Mean-Shift (MS) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) are compared and analyzed. The experimental results show that the motion time of a single for the selected algorithm was 84 ms and the tracking success rate was 96.5\%, respectively, which indicates that the motion tracking success rate of the selected algorithm is higher. Through further testing of PSO-PF algorithm, the results show that it can process 26.67 Frame Per Second (fps), which is much faster and meets the requirements of movie, television production and photography technology.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the sports industry has experienced a significant transformation by integrating artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. Among other sports, table tennis has seen a digital revolution. Analyzing the rotational trajectory of table tennis balls enhances strategic decision-making and players&#39; performance. Using deep learning methods to analyze rotation trajectory in table tennis improves training efficiency and competitive athletic performance while reducing cost. Traditional approaches to trajectory analysis could be more time-consuming and effective in analyzing table tennis rotation trajectories more precisely and efficiently. The proposed method combines two deep learning algorithms, Spatial Upsampling and Reconstruction Encoder (SURE) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), to achieve accurate and dependable trajectory analysis. The SURF algorithm is used for environment motion by separating the table tennis rotation trajectory image into foreground and background points. Using color, displacement, and position data from the corrected image, frame difference processing, and morphological techniques integrate table tennis moving objects that revolve using morphological techniques and frame difference processing. The LSTM trajectory prediction network predicts the rotation of table tennis balls. The spin type of the table tennis ball is inferred from its flight trajectory. Table tennis ball speeds and rotation trajectories may be analyzed using the first five seconds of motion, simply splitting the rotation into three coordinate directions. The experimental results showed the rotation trajectory of a table tennis ball to achieve an accuracy of 96.5\% and a prediction speed of 15 s, which is exceptional compared to previous models. Compared to the proposed scheme with conventional methods, the Feature Fusion Network (FFN), DCNN-LSTM, and RNN algorithms achieve better performance from them. Accurate and efficient motion trajectory prediction improves table tennis practice and competition by identifying complex temporal correlations in ball rotations.},

  abstract     = {Badminton is a popular sport that requires precision, accuracy and speed. The latest technological trends ensure that it has far reaching effects on sports including badminton. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of training assistant for badminton training to increase the training efficiency and effectiveness of the players. The concept of virtual reality is used to build the system architecture for badminton. Moreover, 3D-enabled MAX tools are used to construct and design the simulation for training fields by utilizing the data present in the system database. To estimate the system status, Kalman filter is used for observation and mathematical model’s predictions. The Kalman filter also helps in calculating the arm movement and posture angle of badminton players. To address uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning, the Bayesian algorithm is used that relies on Bayes&#39; theorem. The Bayesian algorithm develops a posture estimation method for badminton players to enhance their efficiency and accuracy. Experimental validation shows that the AI-based badminton training ensures that the system is more stable which enhances the efficiency of the prayers during competitions. The proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches, i.e., Serve, BackRub, Pouncing, and Counterattack. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms or at least matched the existing algorithms in categorizing actions as Push Forward, Push Backward, Picking, Reverse Pick, and Lofty.},

  abstract     = {The proposed work integrates a smart embedded health monitoring system with IoT. The data that are sensed and analyzed from the system are secured using blockchain technology and are transmitted and further analyzed. Blockchains are used in various sectors. Mainly they are welcomed for their secure transactions and the privacy that we can ensure through it. In this paper, our proposed system explored its uses in the healthcare sector. The health sector is where information is of privacy concern for patients and needed information for doctors treating them. Blockchain is the best-suited solution for Identity and Access Management (IAM) needed in the healthcare sector. As blockchains have different types named public and private blockchains, we recommend private blockchains be implemented where no anyone can make transactions and mine the transactions. Patients, doctors, and hospital organizations care for their privacy, and authorized access to others’ data, is the reason for the choice of the private blockchain. Adding to the IAM, blockchain also accounts for flexibility, decentralization, and an immutable ledger. Those operations are authenticated and authorized by a blockchain admin who has no relationship with the entities that exist in the network. The owner of the data is given the sole control of permitting access to their data. Our system asks patients for permission to be given to any doctor who is requesting access to those data. Also, patients can permit a doctor they want within the network. Hyperledger uses no online currencies and hence no miners to wait for. This is important as it reduces the waiting time for a transaction to be verified. REST API is used for collecting information requested from the blockchain and presenting it to the end-users. The proposed system is very unique to the date in which a dedicated smart embedded system is developed to monitor the vital parameters of the patient; once the abnormality is sensed, it will be spontaneously alerted and the connected recording system is activated after the sensors read the deviations very accurately and are unique than conventional methods. Our system provides a secure, reliable, and IAM-included network in a webpage that can be accessed across all devices.},

  abstract     = {There has been a growing interest in using Internet of Things (IoT) for speech translation in recent years, focusing on practical language applications rather than traditional grammar-based training. The language translation method engages language learners by placing them in effective learning environments. The purpose of English language conversion is primarily to teach non-native speakers’ native languages by providing them with a simple and easy-to-understand vocabulary to introduce them to a new language. This study proposes a framework for collaborative privacy management in smart classroom networks based on fuzzy logic decision-making. We used the data sensitivity and confidence values as input variables for the fuzzy system in our framework. Our framework also incorporates trust values between users, because it calculates the trust loss and gain to determine the reputation value. This study investigated the development of an English translation learning system using big data analysis and IoT to enhance students’ comprehension of the English language and improve their ability, effectiveness, and proficiency in translation. For this purpose, a client/server (C/S) learning system for English translation on Android devices is proposed. A detailed description is provided of the functionality of each module and database of the system, which is designed using a model–view–controller architecture. Moreover, the system utilizes a three-layer IoT architecture to facilitate wireless connections among Android devices, network translation servers, and speech synthesis servers, thereby providing users with intelligent services. Subsequently, the study applied an enhanced fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to analyze English translation learning data. In addition to filtering out irrelevant information from the original dataset, the relief algorithm produces index weights that can be used in the improved fuzzy c-means clustering procedure. The enhanced fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is combined with a threshold to create an objective function. Moreover, a unique insight into the English translation learning mode by classifying and clustering English translation resource data is discussed. It was demonstrated that the proposed method achieves high data classification accuracy and significantly enhances the effectiveness and learning outcomes of English translation education.},

  abstract     = {These days, digital art has substantially improved painting art in China’s new media period through modern technology and specialized software, which has generated various digital artworks with painting effects, demonstrating their aesthetic, commercial, and cultural worth. As a result, designers must actively investigate intelligently linked and content-diverse techniques to innovate and improve digital media art. This investigation will allow the extraction of pivotal role of digital media communication and drives visual art to new heights in the modern digitized era. Based on this motivation, this paper tries to analyze the application of new media digital technology in painting creation using big data. The major goal is to obtain insights into artists’ behavior using behavioral habits and a morphological algorithm in digital painting. The study investigates the design process of digital painting by analyzing the habitual forms displayed by diverse painting user groups and integrating them with user experience design concepts. Two experimental methodologies are used to investigate painting user behavior: the interview method and the observation method. The observation approach collects comprehensive user behavior data to develop a habit form model that includes a both virtual and real activity. This model employs a hierarchical scheme emphasizing various behavior aspects and concepts throughout user interactions and painting system operations. The interview method, on the other hand, captures the psychological activities involved in user behavior decision-making. The study discovers and decomposes the traits specific to these characters by defining painted characters, developing their behavior sets, and making interactive decisions. The learned information and experience are then applied in interactive decision-making processes. Based on these findings, prototype development includes explicit and implicit interaction prototypes, with usability tests determining whether specific roles are included in the design. Throughout the study process, fuzzy mapping associations are built, and behavior mappings are labeled with varying relationship proportions, providing critical data for the habit form model’s construction. The paper uses new digital media technology to create paintings and experiments with 50 randomly selected persons. Forty-four participants are well-known authors on major painting websites, with the remaining six being interviewed as professional painters.},

  abstract     = {In many parts of the globe, heart disease or cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality. It is a group of conditions that includes heart failure and other cardiac problems. In the USA, there are an estimated 356,000 cases of hospital cardiac arrest every year, 90\% of which are fatal, as reported by the American Heart Association (Tsao et al. in Circulation https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001052 , 2022). However, the survival rate may be improved by routine monitoring of cardiac function in order to detect the illness at an early stage. Many formerly intractable medical issues have made significant progress because of the combination of computer technology and biomedical research. Automatic prediction is made possible by the examination of previously learned data in machine learning. In this research, we utilize the Physionet Cinc/C Challenge 2016 Phonocardiogram dataset. Classification models like K-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and AlexNet are used with the features retrieved using wavelet scattering transform and continuous wavelet transform. The primary objective of this work is to provide a very effective method for early diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders, which will help clinical professionals better spot heart issues in their patients. Sensitivity, Specificity and other performance metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the various categorization models. KNN, SVM, and AlexNet classifiers all achieve good accuracy with AlexNet outperforms the former two giving an accuracy of 98.11\%, with a sensitivity of 96.20\% and a specificity of 98.73\%. Our suggested model’s output has the potential to contribute significantly to the categorization of cardiac sounds.},

Numerous inherited and non-hereditary central nervous system disorders (CNSDs) may have an effect on brain–heart diseases either directly or indirectly. However, the clinical predictions of these CNSDs are time-consuming. So, a computer-aided detection-based artificial intelligence model can be used to predict and classify CNSDs with high accuracy. This article is focused on the implementation of CNSD-Network (CNSD-Net) for joint brain–heart disorders identification through collective analysis of EEG and ECG signals to trace the problems related to epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer’s and sleep disorders. Initially, minimum mean-square-error short-time spectral amplitude is performed as a preprocessing operation, which removes different types of noise from the dataset. Then, disease-specific features and disease-dependent features are extracted using a transfer learning-based AlexNet model from the denoised signal. In addition, a nature-inspired remora optimization algorithm is used to extract the optimal features. In addition, a deep Q neural network is used to classify various central nervous system diseases from optimal trained features. The simulations proved that the proposed CNSD-Net resulted in superior performance when compared to conventional approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there have been several sports-related injuries and even unexpected fatalities due to the rapid growth of China’s sports industry and increasing fitness issues. The prevalence of sports injuries is rapidly rising because of the intense competition among athletes and the increased physical load caused by players&#39; long-term training. The difficulty in the sports’ world is the identification and evaluation of risk factors associated with athletes. To address these issues, this paper develops a cognitive evaluation model for risk assessment of injuries in sports using big data to understand and determine the likelihood of injuries. The model is used to prevent the issues faced by running athlete’s injury and thereby lowers the risk of overall risk. This paper also analyzes the injury factors while running by establishing an estimation model based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network and explains how to compare RBF neural networks and risk level evaluation using certain criteria. The estimation model helps to identify and judge the risk factors of athletes. It designs an algorithm for Gaussian distribution, which predicts the output of the model. It discusses how the error may be calculated, which measures the neural network model&#39;s overall performance in forecasting sports’ injury outcomes using a particular dataset. Finally, it designs the RBF Neural Network Learning algorithm, which generates the leaned network parameters to evaluate the reliability of risk cognitive model for athletes based on big data. The Lagrange and Bayesian models are selected for comparison. The results indicate that this model has a higher evaluation effect and accuracy as compared to other models. For this purpose, the comparison is made using 25 athletes. The proposed model&#39;s evaluation time is the lowest in comparison to the existing approaches. After examining the impact of cognitive evaluation, it has been reflected that the proposed model can be utilized to assess the different injury types for different parts of athletes. The highest single injury degree is 38.76\%, while the highest composite injury degree is 40.05\%.},

  abstract     = {Image synthesis has recently been identified as a sensitive issue due to the enormous volume of data required to function deep learning models. Deep learning models are used for various issues to support medical imaging, speech synthesis and text-to-speech and text-to-image conversion. Several machine-learning approaches exist but suffer to achieve higher accuracy and stability. To handle this issue, an efficient multi-variant feature synthesis image generation model is presented. The model works with the generative adversarial network (GAN) structure, which generates synthesis images according to different features like shape, color and object. The generator uses such features to generate multiple variations of images according to various compositions. The discriminator, in turn, classifies the image and returns values to the same, which is iterated a number of times till the negative classification becomes less. The generator is an inverse convolution neural network model, and the discriminator is a CNN classifier with probability. The method has been designed with the neurons to compute shape transition measure, color transition measure and object transition measure. Using each of these techniques, the method calculates the value of image synthesis support to produce multiple results from the generator. Similarly, the discriminator is designed to measure multi-variant feature synthesis support to identify the class of image. The classification accuracy of the model is 95\% when compared to the classification accuracy of the KT-GAN, DR-GAN and BSD-GAN models. There are only 5\% of instances that are incorrectly classified, according to the 5\% false classification ratio. The model&#39;s stability is also 95\%, indicating consistent and dependable performance across several runs or modifications. The method introduces higher performance in stability and presents higher classification performance.},

  abstract     = {Modular neural networks have shown distinct advantages in many regimes due to the “modular design”. However, how to design an effective decomposition algorithm for improving the prediction accuracy is still a challenge for time series prediction. In this article, a novel modular neural network model based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique and multi-view learning (MNN-EMDMVL) is introduced for time series prediction, which can simultaneously and effectively decompose time series and improve the prediction accuracy of time series. Most of modular neural networks divide time series based on sample space using clustering algorithm without considering its time characteristic, which has an undesirable effect on prediction accuracy. Therefore, the structure of the proposed model consists of two parts: (1) time series decomposition, which can decompose time series into several subseries. (2) network learning, which can further improve the prediction performance of model. Firstly, this paper employs EMD technique to decompose time series into several subseries based on the local characteristic time scale, which can help subnetworks to learn the decomposed subseries more easily. But some subseries with high frequency feature fluctuates greatly, and changes fleetly, which may restrict the performance of subnetworks. Therefore, a novel multi-view learning with winner-take-all strategy (MVWTAS) is proposed to further improve the prediction performance of subnetworks. In MVWTAS, one or more views (features) of subseries with high frequency are selected as the auxiliary tasks and simultaneously learned. Then, the “best model” can be obtained from the auxiliary and main tasks in each time period of the subseries using winner-take-all strategy, thereby improving the prediction accuracy of the subseries with high frequency. Finally, experimental investigations using two benchmark time series and two real-world time series show that compared with other modular neural networks and single modes, MNN-EMDMVL has the distinct advantage in the terms of prediction performance both by time series decomposition using EMD and the developed multi-view learning with winner-take-all strategy.},

Lagrange polynomials, known for their efficiency in solving fractional calculus problems, are utilized as the neuro-solutions within the neural network structure. For an efficient learning process in artificial neural networks, appropriate activation functions play a crucial role. To handle the fractional derivative of variable-order and time-varying delays, it is essential to select the right activation function. Hence, numerical simulations are conducted to determine the optimal activation function for these equations. The training of the neural network is done using a modified Newton–Raphson method instead of the traditional supervised learning methods. As a result, the proposed functional link neural network provides more accurate results compared to conventional neural networks like the multilayer perceptron.},

  abstract     = {Smart city applications have increasingly relied on the internet of things (IoT) and edge computing to enable data collection, processing, and communication across distributed networks. Owing to the widespread adoption of IoT and visual object tracking technologies in various domains, traditional visual object tracking techniques are no longer suitable for IoT applications. This paper discusses how image recognition and visual target tracking can be used to enhance track and field training based on IoT technology and reduce coach workload. The purpose of this project aimed to analyze athlete movements, develop customized training plans for track and field athletes, and improve the quality and efficiency of training for track and on-field athletes. This is accomplished by utilizing the edge computing to track moving targets for tracking and field training images. Matching points are extracted from the track and field training images and incorporated into the field-of-view border. Using an invariant projection method based on color information, it is possible to accurately track the movement of the target by analyzing its center position and the distance between field-of-view boundaries. Moreover, a moving target recognition technique based on neural networks is employed for image recognition, utilizing an error back-propagation algorithm to facilitate target recognition in track and field training images. The proposed method is demonstrated to be highly accurate and efficient, thereby reducing the workload of coaches, enabling detailed movement analysis of athletes, and increasing the effectiveness of track and field training. This algorithm has been demonstrated to be more effective than other methods in terms of tracking-effect diagrams and evaluation criteria based on experimental results. Using the proposed algorithm, the occlusion problem can be effectively solved while ensuring real-time tracking performance.},

In DL, multiple layers accurately detect abnormalities in the retinal images. Various datasets are also present for this research work. This paper uses a hybrid multilayered classification (HMLC/CNN-VGG19). This system is developed to categorize four kinds of retinal disorders (age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, Drusen, diabetic retinopathy, as well as typical cases). The proposed H.M.L.C. is applied to OCT to gather pictures from different data sources, like the U.C.I. repository, Kaggle, etc. The CNN and VGG-19 models used in the H.M.L.C. are implemented in Python over the datasets. The experimental results in terms of classification accuracy are verified. The classification accuracy is high since the H.M.L.C. used the advanced features from CNN and VGG-19 models. The performance is calculated using sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy.},

Then, an observer barrier function-based adaptive fuzzy scheme is suggested to estimate unknown functions. Briefly, the main contributions of the proposed scheme are: (1) the proposed modeling can be employed in various classes of nonlinear systems, e.g., Single Input–Single Output (SISO), Single Input–Multi Output (SIMO), Multi Input–Single Output (MISO), and Multi Input–Multi Output (MIMO) systems with square or non-square control gain matrix, (2) by combining an observer error signal and the barrier Lyapunov function, the proposed Observer-based Barrier Lyapunov Function (OBLF) method can be employed to solve the problems of output constraint by preventing the output from violating the constraint, and (3) a non-singular robust adaptive fuzzy approach is presented for various classes of nonlinear systems so that the uncertainties are attenuated by a robust bounded $${H}_{\infty }$$ -like control term. The proposed scheme guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system based on the Strictly Positive Real (SPR) condition and OBLF theory, but it does not need the SPR conditions to be well known. Finally, to show the usefulness of the proposed technique, the simulation examples are employed for various classes of nonlinear affine and non-affine systems with square or non-square control gains.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a blind color image watermarking method based on Hadamard transform to deal with the infringement of color images in the complex network environment. First of all, the color watermark image is channeled and each pixel in the channel image is converted into an 8-bit binary code. And then, the color host image is also channeled and expanded into 4 × 4 non-overlapping pixel blocks based on the selected embedding position. Finally, Hadamard transform is put on the pixel block, and 1-bit watermark information is embedded by the coefficient pair of the first line of Hadamard coefficient matrix. When extracting watermark, the watermark can be extracted only by comparing the size relationship of the coefficient pairs without the help of the original image. In this paper, a voting system of the minority obeying the majority is designed and implemented, which actually enhances the robustness of the method. In addition, a high security encryption system is designed by combining symmetric key and public key, and the correlation between RGB color channels is considered. Simulation results show that the proposed method has better robustness, real-time performance and security compared with similar methods, and meets certain requirements in terms of invisibility and capacity.},

A Tai Le recognition sample database is constructed, 2 and 3 levels of wavelet decomposition prior features are extracted, and then, the wavelet a priori feature is transformed into a WDC feature. To avoid the dimensional disaster caused by feature fusion, a dimensionality reduction method combining LDA and PCA is used to reducing the dimensionality of the fused features without reducing the accuracy rate. Moreover, to better recognize handwritten Tai Le characters, 6 deep variationally sparse Gaussian process (DVSGP) models are integrated as an EDVSGP classification model.

The smart grid is also one of the profoundly evolved innovations, which influences the synchronization between demand and renewable energy reactions. The smart grids contain many operations with power calculations such as smart functions, assurance, and control techniques to provide steadiness and proficiency to the system performance. However, the quality of power such as voltage deviation minimization, sag/swell, power loss minimization, and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) appear to be the major issue. Therefore, in this paper, a novel Generalized Approximate Reasoning Intelligent Control along with Multi-objective African Buffalo Optimization is proposed to control the imperatives of the smart grid. In the grid, current controllers are upgraded by the proposed Optimal Pseudospectral Bang Bang Control technique, and voltage controllers are improved by the proposed Bessel Filter Sallen Key Topology. The simulation of the proposed method is actualized with MATLAB/Simulink. Consequently, the projected results are compared with the traditional control techniques and the outcomes show that the projected replica improved system efficiency concerning power quality problems in terms of reduced 14 MW of power loss and 2.18\% of THD.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things is ushering in the era of connected environments where the number and diversity of data sources (devices and sensors) are inevitably increasing the size of the data that need to be stored locally (at the edge device level) and transmitted to base storages (at the sink level) of the network. This huge amount of data highlights several challenges including network bandwidth, consumption of network energy, cloud storage, and I/O throughput. These call for data pre-processing and filtering solutions to reduce the amount of data being handled and transmitted over the network. In this study, we investigate data deduplication as a prominent pre-processing method that can be used and adapted to address such challenges. Data deduplication techniques have been traditionally developed for data storage and data warehousing applications and aim at identifying and eliminating redundant data items. Few recent approaches have been designed for connected environments, yet they share various limitations, including: (i) detecting duplicates at one level only of the network (either edge or sink exclusively), (ii) overlooking the context and dynamicity of the network (disregarding device mobility and overlooking boundary separations and sensor coverage areas), (iii) relying on crisp thresholds and providing minimum-to-no expert control over the deduplication process (disregarding the domain expert’s needs in defining redundancy). In this study, we propose FREDD, a new approach for Fuzzy Redundancy Elimination for Data Deduplication in a connected environment. FREDD uses simple natural language rules to represent domain knowledge and expert preferences regarding data duplication boundaries. It then applies pattern codes and fuzzy reasoning to detect duplicates at both the edge level and the sink level of the network. This reduces the time required to hard-code the deduplication process, while adapting to the domain expert’s needs for different data sources and applications. Moreover, FREDD is adapted for multiple scenarios, considering both static and mobile devices, with different configurations of hard-separated and soft-separated zones, and different sensor coverage areas in the connected environment. Experiments on a real-world dataset highlight FREDD’s potential and improvement compared with existing solutions.},

  abstract     = {Data processing in sports is a phenomenon increasingly present at all levels, from professionals in search of tools to improve their performance to beginners motivated by the quantification of their physical activity. In this work, a comparison between some of the main machine learning and deep learning algorithms is carried out in order to classify padel tennis strokes. Up to 13 representative padel tennis strokes are classified. Before a classification of padel tennis strokes is performed, a sufficiently representative data set is needed that collects numerous examples of the performance of these strokes. Since there was no similar data set in the literature, we proceeded to the creation of such a data set, for which we developed a data collection system based on an electronic device with an inertial measurement unit. Using the developed data set, the machine learning and deep learning algorithms were hyperparameterized to compare their performance under the best possible configurations. The algorithms were fed with both the temporal series of the acceleration and speed of the six degrees of freedom and also with feature engineering input, consisting in calculating the mean, maximum, and minimum values for each axis. The algorithms evaluated are: fully connected or dense neural networks, 1D convolutional neural networks, decision tree, K nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and eigenvalue classification. According to the results achieved, the best algorithm is the 1D convolutional neural network with temporal series input that achieves an accuracy higher than 93\%. However, other simpler algorithms such as dense networks and support vector machines achieve similar results.},

  abstract     = {Heartbeat classification plays an important role in identifying cardiac arrhythmias. Although automated heartbeat classification approaches have been broadly reported, they still suffer from some disadvantages, such as the inescapable domain knowledge and human ingenuity for hand-crafted heartbeat feature engineering, and the slow learning speed for iterative deep learning heartbeat classification approach. To address the above issues, for the first time, this paper proposes a novel multilayer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) heartbeat classification approach for feature representation and classification of the heartbeat signals. Different from the iterative optimization scheme in traditional neural networks, ELM autoencoder (ELM-AE) is employed in ML-ELM for random mapping of the input weights and non-iterative learning is implemented for output weights. To realize unsupervised self-encoding heartbeat feature mapping, the output of ELM-AE is consistent with the incoming heartbeat signal, and the optimization objective is to minimize the reconstruction error. Heartbeat feature extraction is efficiently performed by layer-by-layer ELM-AE stacking. In the stage of heartbeat classification, to solve the unstable performance caused by random parameter initialization in ELM hidden nodes, bagging-based ensemble learning is employed to combine several ELM classifiers and thus develops a well-performed heartbeat classification approach. The proposed approach is applied to two-lead ECG signals, which is obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia public dataset. The experimental results show that the ELM-AE based feature extraction can effectively characterize the characteristics of the heartbeat signal with high efficiency compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Applying the ensemble decision fusion to two leads, the final classification accuracy reaches 99.41\%.},

  abstract     = {The aim of customer-oriented design concept evaluation (CDCE) is to select the best product design solution from the perspective of customer. Traditionally, most of CDCE methods mainly focus on the customer preference judgement but ignore the confidence attitude of customer, namely, the reliability of preference. However, the customer’s uncertain attitude means he is unsure about his decision and could probably change his mind. With the help of Z-number, more complete customer preference information is recorded (Z-preference). The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new Z-preference-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) for CDCE method that retains the confidence coefficient α in evaluation value (Z-CDCE-α) to highlight the role of confidence attitude for CDCE, rather than simply translating Z-preference into a regular fuzzy preference value. By integrating with multiple information such as preference value, confidence coefficient α and the importance rating of design attribute, a novel ideal solution definition (ISD) strategy is put forward. For the re-defined ideal solutions, the distances of alternative to ideal solutions are deduced to get the priority degree δ to sort alternatives. According to the proposed ISD strategy of Z-CDCE-α, the best concept is that its important attribute values are preferred by customers with higher certainty or least preferred by customers with lower certainty, and the customers’ preferences and confidence attitudes for its less important attribute values are opposite. A case study and two comparison experiments are carried out to validate the reasonability and feasibility of Z-CDCE-α for CDCE by comparing with different evaluation values, ISD rules and MCDM models.},

For the sake of solving the problem that most previous studies failed to consider the causal relationship and data reliability of environmental governance inputs and outputs, a new environmental governance cost prediction method is proposed under the framework of the evidential reasoning (ER) rule with three improvements comparing to existing methods: (1) the causal relationship of environmental governance inputs and outputs is embedded into evidence representation for better extracting knowledge from data; (2) the efficiency about the minimum inputs to achieve the maximum outputs is used to evaluate the data reliability of environmental governance inputs and outputs; and (3) a new analytical ER rule is investigated to optimize the process of evidence combination. Hence, the new method includes the calculation of belief distributions, evidence reliabilities, and evidence weights, as well as the combination of evidences to predict environmental governance costs. In the case study, the data of 30 provinces in Mainland China from 2005 to 2020 are collected to verify the effectiveness of the new method. Results show a high level of accuracy of the new method over other existing methods.},

Firstly, the RLF under the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy (IVHF) environment is defined. Then, in view of the practical significance of the loss function, the relationship between the loss function and the evaluation value is established. At the same time, considering that the IVHF-MADM has multiple attributes and multiple evaluation values, an aggregated loss function via the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy weight average operator to reflect the overall loss of the alternative is provided. And the mixed information table (IVHF-MADMRLF) based on the overall loss function is established. Secondly, based on an outranking function and a distance from the positive ideal PIS, we define an estimation on the conditional probability method. Finally, the choice of line site, which is closely related to the cost of building the entire project, traffic safety, and economic development along the line, is discussed in more details using a case study of a traffic expressway. Moreover, we propose the parameters analysis approach to the test in terms of its viability and efficiency.},

However, the judgments of experts may be subjective. Using machine learning algorithms for decision-making can be more objective, but machine learning algorithms are strongly related to the collected data and not being flexible enough. This paper tries to combine experts’ judgments with algorithmic judgments to improve the bias of experts’ judgments while still making decision-making flexible. In this paper, the authors introduce the ordered pair of normalized real numbers (OPNs) into the AHP method for the first time and propose the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process with the OPNs (OFAHP). The OFAHP uses OPNs to combine experts’ judgments with those of machine learning algorithms and then make decisions by OPNs. Experiments on real data sets show that the proposed method can get reasonable decision results. Moreover, when the experts’ judgments are wrong or invalid, the judgments given by the machine learning algorithm can correct the experts’ judgments to obtain a reasonable decision-making result.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of urbanization in China has contributed to traffic events, such as traffic accidents and delays. It is difficult to detect and resolve highway traffic congestion in a timely manner using traditional methods because they are slow, require a large number of workers, and require the installation of a large amount of monitoring equipment. Therefore, it is imperative to introduce advanced technology to address these challenges. Recently, deep learning technology has made significant breakthroughs and has been widely applied to various fields with satisfactory results. Deep learning is among the most important technologies for the detection and evaluation of traffic congestion, enabling the accurate detection of the state of the expressway network’s traffic congestion, the evaluation of traffic congestion, and the prediction of possible traffic congestion. This enables management to formulate traffic dredging strategies in advance to prevent the negative impact of traffic congestion on normal traffic flow. This paper proposes a framework based on deep learning for next-generation highway traffic management. This framework selects traffic congestion indicators to construct an index model, and then constructs a deep learning model based on self-coding. It predicts and classifies highway traffic environment data and excavates sample data based on the characteristics of traffic parameters. As soon as traffic data were classified, a prediction model based on SoftMax was established to detect and predict highway traffic congestion. We conducted a traffic congestion analysis of the Shanghai expressway network based on the speed performance data obtained from the China Traffic Management Bureau. As a result of their research, we developed an index to measure highway traffic congestion. For traffic control and management organizations to function effectively, it is crucial to have an accurate and clear picture of traffic network operations. We evaluated the proposed framework using data gathered from highway monitoring scenes, and the results indicated that 98.6\% of the data could be correctly detected. Using the prediction model based on SoftMax for expressway vehicles during peak hours, the accuracy was 92\%, and the misjudgment rate was 8\%. This study demonstrates that detecting and evaluating the state of highway traffic environments using deep learning has high accuracy, can be applied to actual highway traffic systems, and is extremely useful for detecting highway congestion. This framework is a promising solution for next-generation highway traffic management and provides accurate and timely traffic congestion detection and evaluation.},

  abstract     = {In this study, to enhance the searching ability, convergence velocity, computational efficiency, and global performance of the standard Teaching–Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm, two modified TLBO algorithms designated as, TLBO-M1 and TLBO-M2, are developed. The standard and the two proposed TLBO algorithms are applied to solve inverse radiative boundary design problems in two-dimensional radiant furnaces with grey absorbing and emitting media. The goal of the inverse design problem is to find the best distribution of heat flux over the heater surface of the radiant enclosure which produces the desired temperature and heat flux distributions over the design surface. Radiation is considered the prevailing mode of heat transfer and thus the media inside the enclosure is at radiative equilibrium. Radiative heat transfer within the enclosure is modelled using the radiative transfer equation and is solved using the discrete ordinates method (DOM). To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, a validation problem and two inverse design problems with regular and irregular enclosures are considered. The results demonstrate that the TLBO-M1 algorithm is more effective and robust compared to the standard TLBO and TLBO-M2.},

This paper proposes a hybrid evolutionary algorithm NERS_HEAD with a new elite replacement strategy. In NERS_HEAD, a method to detect the local optimal state is proposed so that the evolutionary process can jump out of the local optimal state by introducing diversity on time; a new elite structure and a replacement strategy are designed to increase the diversity of the evolutionary population so that the evolution process can not only converge quickly but also jump out of the local optimal state in time. The comparison experiments with current excellent graph coloring algorithms on 59 DIMACS benchmark instances show that NERS_HEAD can effectively improve the efficiency and success rate of solving graph coloring problems.},

One such model is the Travelling Thief Problem (TTP); while it may offer a better benchmarking alternative to the standard models, only one form of inter-component dependency is investigated. The goal of this paper is to study the impact of different models of dependency on the fitness landscape using performance prediction models (regression analysis). To conduct the analysis, we consider a generalised model of the TTP, where the dependencies between the two components of the problem are tunable through problem features. We use regression trees to predict the instance difficulty using an efficient memetic algorithm that is agnostic to the domain knowledge to avoid any bias. We report all the decision trees resulting from the regression model, which is the core in understanding the relationship between the dependencies (represented by the features) and problem difficulty (represented by the runtime). The regression model was able to predict the expected runtime of the algorithm based on the problem features. Furthermore, the results show that the contribution of the item value drop dependency is significantly higher than the velocity change dependency.},

This study proposes a hybrid model—slime mold algorithm opposition tournament mutation (SMAOTM)—for TCQC trade-off optimization in three real construction projects in Vietnam. SMAOTM is inspired by the original slime mold algorithm combined with three well-known methods—opposition-based learning, tournament selection, and mutation and crossover—to improve exploration ability, speed up convergence, and reduce local optimization to find optimal results. However, these combinations increase the complexity to process data in the optimization process. The complexity of the actual projects will help to exploit the potential of the proposed model to bring about a successful project implementation solution. Further, to show the efficiency and superiority of SMAOTM, we compared it with well-known previous hybrid models (MOSGO, MODE, MOPSO, NSGA-II, and CAMODE). Based on our results, SMAOTM shows better diversification and convergence and provides a more robust optimal solution than the previous hybrid models.},

Then, the consecutive item packing is simulated as Markov Decision Process, where the state is defined as the set of already packed items, and the action is defined as the rectangle selected to be packed along with its orientation. We propose the reverse updating of Q-value in the paradigm of Q-learning and use the algorithm to optimize the sequence and orientation of the rectangles. The decreasing-size-choice mechanism in Q-learning is studied on randomly generated problems to optimize the setting of ε-greedy policy. We also test the Q-learning-based algorithm on the benchmark instances of C21, N13, N-series from NT, Cgcut and Beng.

  abstract     = {An efficient river crossing project (RCP) requires careful planning, front-end design, installation and maintenance. It is important to evaluate different influencing factors and crossing techniques, such as horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, direct pipe, guided auger boring, open cut, trenchless, trenched, semi-trenched, airborne, and bridging, using risk-adjusted methodologies. In order to evaluate different influencing factors of RCP, we can apply our decision-making approach in the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy 2-tuple linguistic (DHq-ROF-TL) environment. In this article, we utilize the q-ROF set, a most efficient set having a broader membership and non-membership representational domain, with the 2-tuple linguistic (2TL) framework to avoid information loss during decision-making process under dual hesitant fuzzy (DHF) environment. DHF set can effectively address human hesitance in decision-making difficulties and provides a more comprehensive and flexible approach of allocating numbers to each domain element. The Hamy mean (HM) operator is a classical mean type of aggregation operator utilized in modern information fusion theory which is appropriate to aggregate DHq-ROF-TL information. The HM operator can capture the interrelationships among the arguments of the alternatives. Furthermore, the DHq-ROF-TL Hamy mean (DHq-ROF-TLHM) operator, DHq-ROF-TL weighted Hamy mean (DHq-ROF-TLWHM) operator, the DHq-ROF-TL dual Hamy mean (DHq-ROF-TLDHM) operator and DHq-ROF-TL weighted dual Hamy mean (DHq-ROF-TLWDHM) operator are proposed along with some desirable properties and special cases. Afterward, based on developed aggregation operators in the DHq-ROF-TL framework, a novel approach is established to tackle multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems. Eventually, an example of a RCP is presented to demonstrate the usefulness and appropriateness of the developed approach. To analyze the advantages and superiorities of the developed approach, a comparative analysis is conducted.},

The defined operators meet certain important characteristics such as they can provide generality and flexibility in the aggregation process, model uncertainty of decision-making with interrelated attributes, and the influence of unreasonable attribute values can also be reduced by them. A generalized distance measure and an entropy measure were defined for L $$q$$ -ROFSs, subsequently. Afterwards, a multi-attribute group decision-making approach under L $$q$$ -ROF context, where the information about decision-makers’ and attribute weights might be known or unknown, is designed utilizing individual expressions of the proposed operators. The developed approach includes a TOPSIS‐based algorithm and an entropy-based algorithm in order to compute the weight of decision-makers’ and attributes, respectively. Finally, the proposed method’s feasibility is validated by solving a financial strategy-making problem, and its superiority is demonstrated via some detailed comparisons.},

Protoconcept, which is an extension of the formal concept, provides a new method of data processing. Three-way decisions is more in line with human cognition. Not like the decision of two ways, three-way cognition expands its scope of application. However, up to now, protoconcept is influenced by two-way decisions which leads to the restrictions of its applications. Hence, it is urgent to find a method to generalize protoconcept from the framework of two-way decisions. To give the solution to this urgent problem, the main contributions of this paper are the following: First, using the combination of protoconcept and three-way decisions, two models of three-way protoconcept are obtained. The algorithms for searching three-way protoconcept are built. Second, we investigate the constructions of three-way protoconcepts in double Boolean algebra. Third, the relationships between protoconcepts and three-way protoconcepts are found. Moreover, using examples that come from the real world, we explain the main results obtained above and show some applications. The two models for protoconcepts provided in this paper generalize the fields of thought from two-way decisions to three-way decisions. This follows that they are more in line with human thinking. Hence, the two models will certainly generalize the applications of protoconcept theory in the future.},

Although there are some solutions proposing “nonoutsourceable puzzles” to stop the pool operators in the centralized mining pools from outsourcing their mining work to others, we find that none of them can be adopted in real world to support strong nonoutsourceability. In other words, through some special means, e.g., legal prosecution or a tainted public reputation, the pool operator still can outsource his mining work. In this paper, we study the formal definition of strong nonoutsourceability and present constructions that support strong nonoutsourceability. The experimental results also show that our concrete construction is practical.},

  abstract     = {The need for security in healthcare environments has become increasingly important due to the rise of cyber-attacks and data breaches. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-based intrusion detection system for healthcare using a deep learning strategy with custom features. This paper proposes an IoT-based intrusion detection system for healthcare using a deep learning strategy with custom features. The proposed system utilizes the IoT technology to gather real-time data from various medical devices and sensors deployed in a healthcare environment. The system incorporates a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) algorithm to detect and classify intrusion attempts. The custom features are extracted from the incoming data streams and used to train the deep learning models. The proposed system is evaluated on a dataset comprising different types of intrusion scenarios, and it achieves an accuracy of 99.16\%, error rate of 0.008371\%, sensitivity ratio of 99.89\% and specificity ratio of 98.203\% for IoTID20 with custom features using RNNBiLSTM. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting and mitigating security threats in a healthcare environment. The system has the potential to improve patient privacy and security, ultimately leading to better healthcare outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson’s disease is one of the most common degenerative conditions that affect people aged 60 and older. The illness is normally diagnosed by clinical indicators that develop as a variety of movement symptoms and medical observations. Conventional diagnostic methods, on the other hand, rely on the detection of small motions, which are notoriously difficult to pin down with absolute precision. This makes it possible for these methods to lend themselves to subjective interpretations. This is because traditional diagnostic methods rely on the interpretation of motions. Image categorization is performed using an altered version of the ResNeXt model in the proposed model. The proposed ResNeXt extends version of ResNet architecture by introducing a new block called the “cardinality block.” The cardinality block consists of multiple parallel branches, each with its own set of convolutional layers. These branches are then combined by concatenation before being passed to the next layer. The key idea behind the cardinality block is to increase the capacity of the network without significantly increasing the number of parameters. By using parallel branches with different filter sizes, ResNeXt is able to capture a wider range of features in the input image, leading to better performance on image classification tasks. In order to enhance the performance of the standard ResNeXt model, certain extra dense and dropout layers have been included. The size of the final model is reduced by pruning the model in order to improve the efficiency of the network connections and minimize the overall size of the model. The proposed method is compared to a number of deep learning models that are already in use, and it is shown that the acquired results are superior to those of the deep learning models that are already in use.},

  abstract     = {Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is the type of tumour that develops in the gastrointestinal tract and disrupts the digestive system. The two most crucial factors for GIST detection and monitoring are structural and functional information, either one of which can be determined by a single imaging modality. Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are the two non-invasive imaging techniques that are frequently employed for this purpose. Effective clinical management dependent on precise diagnosis, which centres on accurate tumour detection and segmentation, is the major concern with manual processes. To over this problem, we proposed a deep learning framework in two stages: in the first stage, we use Dense Net and VGG model for CT and PET image fusion, and in the second stage, for effective tumour segmentation we use feature pyramid network (FPN) for automatic and accurate tumour detection. The advantage of using Dense Net and VGG Net for medical image fusion is their ability to extract features at different scales and resolutions. This allows for a more comprehensive representation of the input images, which can be beneficial from medical image fusion. The fused image is segmented using FPN semantic segmentation model with Efficient Net-B0 as encoder; finally the proposed model performance was evaluated through qualitative and quantitative metrics. The average mean squared error value is 63.27, the average peak signal-to-noise ratio value is 30.154 and the average Structural Similarity Index Measure value is 0.9647. The proposed FPN with Efficient Net-B0 segmentation produced an intersection over union of 0.8521 and pixel accuracy 96.09, which are comparatively higher than the other existing models. The proposed deep learning framework outperformed well in automatically and accurately segmenting GIST, assisting doctors in effective clinical management.},

Feature extraction is done by Chi-square test. Feature subsets are extracted using, mutual information and lightgbm. Later, the performances of the machine learning algorithms are analysed to find out suitable classifier that predicts the autism spectrum disorder. Using feature subsets extraction methodologies, the numbers of features are reduced from 802 to 254 features; hence, the performance of Naïve Bayesian and K-nearest neighbour has improved.

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks are applied in different domains such as agriculture, military, healthcare, and defense. The most critical issue in wireless sensor networks is achieving greater energy efficiency fairness measurement. This research proposes new evolutionary modeling using genetic algorithms with an energy-efficient clustering routing strategy to resolve this critical issue in healthcare networks of hospitals. This article develops a new model of homogeneous and heterogeneous network structures with the novelty of combining the consumption model of original energy to construct new evolutionary modeling to predict the optimal clusters count for minimizing the consumption of the total energy in wireless sensor healthcare applications. The simulation results show that the lifetime is maximum when the routing factor, α = 0.1 compared to other values of α. For the homogeneous healthcare networks instances, the death round value of the first node is for a smaller value of α. The better routing factor is obtained as α ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 for homogeneous and heterogeneous healthcare networks instances. For the range of energy levels that ranges from 0.4 to 0.8, the proposed evolutionary model achieves better measures for the rounds from 1800 up to 2400 compared to the recent methods. The proposed model evaluates optimal clusters based on the structure of the healthcare network, and then the clusters head is identified based on the clustering locations. The proposed method achieves a higher throughput percentage in all cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous instances where the energy lies between (0.4, 0.8). Simulation outcomes of the proposed evolutionary model result in the performance metrics mainly significant reduction of energy consumption decay rate of the network while maximizing the healthcare network’s lifetime by improving the network’s throughput compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

According to this concept, the encryption system controls the data security process by extracting key signatures from the ECG signal peaks to identify the characteristics or attributes of the data and encrypt it. To estimate the hashing qualities, the approach is to build a random key pattern based on the signal peaks and extract the signature. The signal was then encrypted and sent to a doctor or signal analyzer. Bilateral random hashing (BRH) is used to achieve this. This updates the hashing generation model by analyzing the parameters using probabilistic distributional characteristics. This crucial motif was applied. This key pattern was utilized to encrypt the data samples using the downhill peak follow (DPF) encryption technique, which follows the strength of the peak value in the ECG waveform.

  abstract     = {In skeleton-based action recognition, treating skeleton data as pseudoimages using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has proven to be effective. However, among existing CNN-based approaches, most focus on modeling information at the joint-level ignoring the size and direction information of the skeleton edges, which play an important role in action recognition, and these approaches may not be optimal. In addition, combining the directionality of human motion to portray action motion variation information is rarely considered in existing approaches, although it is more natural and reasonable for action sequence modeling. In this work, we propose a novel direction-guided two-stream convolutional neural network for skeleton-based action recognition. In the first stream, our model focuses on our defined edge-level information (including edge and edge_motion information) with directionality in the skeleton data to explore the spatiotemporal features of the action. In the second stream, since the motion is directional, we define different skeleton edge directions and extract different motion information (including translation and rotation information) in different directions to better exploit the motion features of the action. In addition, we propose a description of human motion inscribed by a combination of translation and rotation, and explore how they are integrated. We conducted extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, the NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120 datasets, to verify the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed direction-guided edge-level information and motion information complement each other for better action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Sports injuries have been a common concern during athlete training as the number of Chinese athletes and their training intensity have increased. These injuries frequently impact critical locations, including the waist, shoulder, and wrist, impeding training progress and intensity. Inadequate training levels, a lack of understanding of preventive measures, inappropriate movements, insufficient warm-up exercises, low physical condition, and an inability to adjust to the environment all contribute to sports injuries. As a result, athlete training and recovery suffer. To address these issues, this study presents a neural network-based sports injury risk analysis system that uses blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). The suggested system combines a multi-sensor data fusion technique based on blockchain and IoT to evaluate and analyze sports injuries completely. The system has three unique roles: coach, team doctor, and athlete, each with its functional modules. Sensors collect data on athletes’ recovery from sports injuries by collecting and analyzing inputs inside the human action system. The system then establishes the output values of a neural network and a risk level table, allowing for the estimation of athletes’ risk levels based on the given table. Comparing the traditional technique and the sports injury rehabilitation monitoring system demonstrates that the technology can reliably detect players’ injury locations in as little as 0.2 s. Furthermore, a thorough examination of the system’s tracking and analysis accuracy reveals a recovery rate of approximately 94.39\%, demonstrating minimal fluctuations and improved stability. The experimental findings reveal that combining blockchain, IoT, and neural network technologies makes the proposed sports injury rehabilitation monitoring system useful in quickly recognizing damage positions and enabling accurate tracking and analysis.},

  abstract     = {Distribution regression is the regression case where the input objects are distributions. Many machine learning problems can be analyzed in this framework, such as multi-instance learning and learning from noisy data. This paper attempts to build a conformal predictive system (CPS) for distribution regression, where the prediction of the system for a test input is a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the corresponding test label. The CDF output by a CPS provides useful information about the test label, as it can estimate the probability of any event related to the label and be transformed to prediction interval and prediction point with the help of the corresponding quantiles. Furthermore, a CPS has the property of validity as the prediction CDFs and the prediction intervals are statistically compatible with the realizations. This property is desired for many risk-sensitive applications, such as weather forecast. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend the learning framework of CPS to distribution regression problems. We first embed the input distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using kernel mean embedding approximated by random Fourier features, and then build a fast CPS on the top of the embeddings. While inheriting the property of validity from the learning framework of CPS, our algorithm is simple, easy to implement and fast. The proposed approach is tested on synthetic data sets and can be used to tackle the problem of statistical postprocessing of ensemble forecasts, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm for distribution regression problems.},

  abstract     = {Trustworthiness and energy efficiency are two important aspects of data gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The first criterion can be fulfilled by adopting trustworthy nodes for data communication along with choosing watchdogs for monitoring. Additionally, the use of the clustering scheme reduces energy exhaustion substantially. Accordingly, effective data gathering requires trust-aware and energy-efficient clustering, data gathering tree construction, and watchdog selection. The previous data gathering algorithms did not include all of the clustering, tree construction, and watchdog selection phases. Furthermore, some studies proposed greedy schemes to solve the mentioned phases and had low performance. In this paper, we propose the Trust-aware and Energy-efficient Data Gathering (TEDG) algorithm to gather data more effectively. The proposed scheme comprises all the above-mentioned phases, including clustering, tree construction, and watchdog selection. These phases are modeled as optimization problems, and they are solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The watchdog selection phase has variable-length particles because the number of watchdogs has not been unknown. Novel particle representation and initialization schemes are proposed to handle these particles. According to the performed simulations, TEDG improves consumed energy for data delivery to the sink, standard deviation of the residual energy of nodes, and network lifetime by 220\%, 81\%, and 129\%, respectively.},

However, for complex multimodal problems, it may get trapped into local optima and suffer from premature convergence for the shortcoming of population updating guided only by leading individuals. In this paper, the issue of low convergence efficiency and convergence accuracy of the CSA algorithm on complex multimodal problems is dramatically alleviated by integrating the mutation and crossover operators in DE algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the better performance of CCSA on convergence speed and accuracy as compared to other existing optimizers. Furthermore, aiming at the problem that there is no universal approach for the multi-degree reduction in Ball Bézier surfaces under different interpolation constrains, we propose a new method to solve this problem by introducing metaheuristic methods, where the change of interpolation constrains is treated as the change of decision variables. The modeling examples show that the proposed method is effective and easy to implement under different interpolation constrains, which can achieve the multi-degree reduction in Ball Bézier surfaces at one time and can simplify the degree reduction procedure significantly.},

Good researchers continuously develop solutions to the problems of breaches in security. Human interaction proofs are also one of the most affordable solutions to problems. The completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA) has a wide range of applications, including website authentication, preventing bogus email registration, preventing bogus online polls, preventing bogus ticket booking, and so on. CAPTCHAs come in various formats, but text-based schemes are the most common. Unfortunately, these text-based CAPTCHAs are available in foreign languages and have a high success rate. The usability of these foreign language-based schemes for native people is also very low. These days, Hindi CAPTCHAs are available, but before using them, we must test the security of these schemes. In this study, ten different coloured CAPTCHAs are broken using the k-nearest neighbours, the support vector machine, and the random forest classifiers. The breaking rate for two-colour schemes is 90\%, while the breaking rate for multi-colour schemes is 93\%. The solving time for the support vector machine and the random forest classifier ranges from 0.06 s to 0.09 s and 0.1 to 0.2 s in the case of two-colour schemes. For multi-colour schemes, it ranges from 0.06 s to 0.09 s and 0.09 s to 0.2 s for the support vector machine and random forest classifier, respectively.},

The nested probabilistic linguistic term set is a good tool for describing multidimensional uncertain information because it contains a collection of inner-layer and outer-layer terms and expresses both ordinal and nominal terminologies. In order to avoid losing information in the process of converting linguistic terms into numerical values, this paper proposes a series of new equivalent transformation functions for nested probabilistic linguistic term sets and defines the corresponding comparison rules. The criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) method is conducted to calculate the objective weights of attributes. Using equivalent transformation functions and the weighting approach with the nested probabilistic linguistic information, this paper combines the weighted MULTIMOORA method with dominance-directed graph to solve the doctor–patient shared decision-making problem. In addition, the results of comparative analysis show that the proposed method is reasonable and effective, and it is applicable to other decision-making scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Here, a general methodology is proposed to formulate and solve any multidimensional balanced/unbalanced, constrained/unconstrained transportation problems(TP) in different environments(crisp/fuzzy/rough). To understand the general model easily, here, at first, a multi-item 5-dimensional fixed charge profit maximization TP under budget and time constraint is presented. A potential solution of the problem is coded as a permutation of the different cells of the allocation matrix. A general decoding rule is proposed to determine the actual allocation from this coded solution. A heuristic approach is applied on a set of randomly generated coded solution of the target problem to determine the marketing decision. Applying swap operations on the coded solutions, the perturbation rules of the heuristic Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) are modified to solve the problem. In a particular case, the problem is analysed as a bi-criteria decision making problem with the maximization of the total profit as well as the minimization of the total shipment time under a budget constraint. The bi-criteria TP is formulated as a single objective optimisation problem using a proposed rule and the same heuristic is run for a finite number of times to determine the pareto optimal front. To formulate the problem in the fuzzy(rough) environment an approach is proposed using credibility(trust) measure of fuzzy(rough) events. Proper fuzzy(rough) simulation algorithms are also proposed to solve the problem for any type of fuzzy(rough) estimation. Using this approach no crisp equivalent of any imprecise parameters is used for the marketing decision. Due the unavailability of the test data in the literature, different hypothetical data sets are used for the illustration of the models.},

The existing barrier swaption pricing model cannot fully reflect the hereditability and memorability of the real financial market, so this paper aims to solve such difficulties and further measure the exercise ability of the barrier swaption pricing model. Firstly, the floating interest rate is regarded as an uncertain process because there exists difficult to obtain historical data for real financial model. Then the Caputo type fractional differential operator is introduced into the original barrier swaption pricing model, and a new uncertain barrier swaption model of floating interest rate is established. Secondly, based on the first hitting time, the pricing formulas and the corresponding efficiency index of four kinds of barrier swaptions under the floating rate model are derived, respectively. Finally, the rationality of the model is verified by numerical examples and corresponding methods, and gives the monotonicity of four numerical examples.},

The cosmology-based MVO processes the interaction of the multiple universes through white, black, and wormholes to solve the target optimization problem. However, the MVO has drawbacks such as slow convergence speed, easy to fall into local optimum, and low efficiency in the case of continuous and discrete variables existing in structural optimization. This paper aims to modify the Multi-verse Optimizer and propose an enhanced version, named as memory-assisted adaptive multi-verse optimizer (MAMVO). The enhanced algorithm seeks to reinforce the performance of the standard algorithm using two mechanisms: (I) Using an adaptive pseudorandom transfer strategy in cases with both continuous and discrete variables to strike a better balance between the diversification and the intensification tasks (II) using a multi-elite memory, by which several best so far solutions are saved and exchanged with several worst ones for better convergence. The performance of the proposed MAMVO is compared with those of the standard MVO and some other optimization methods through various types of truss benchmarks (beams, towers, and bridges) under different constraints such as displacement, stress, buckling, or frequency. Results confirm that MAMVO significantly outperforms the standard MVO and has comparable or superior performance to the other methods.},

To strike the balance between the explorations of the feasible region and the infeasible region, we look into the bi-objective space constituted by the objective function and the total constraint violation, and define the infeasible solution which has the lowest degree of constraint violation and lies in the Pareto front as the best infeasible solution. We discuss how the best infeasible solution help improve the current best solution. Based on this, we propose an improved differential evolution algorithm with adaptive ranking-based constraint handling technique (AR-DE). First, we start by identifying the best feasible solution and the best infeasible solution of the current population. Second, to guide the population evolving toward these solutions, different mutation and selection operators are proposed. Third, we design the adaptive control to automatically choose the operators to fit different stages of the evolution and various situations of the population. We conduct experimental studies by comparing with other widely used constraint handling techniques based on the cardinal version of differential evolution for fair competition. Standard test problems and five well-known engineering constrained optimization design problems are used to evaluate the effectiveness of AR-DE. Statistical outcomes show that the overall results of AR-DE are better than those of the other comparing methods. We also investigate the ability of AR-DE to obtain feasible solutions, and tune the parameters to achieve better performance.},

  abstract     = {Solving problems of high dimensionality (and complexity) usually needs the intense use of technologies, like parallelism, advanced computers and new types of algorithms. MapReduce (MR) is a computing paradigm long time existing in computer science that has been proposed in the last years for dealing with big data applications, though it could also be used for many other tasks. In this article, we address big optimization: the solution to large instances of combinatorial optimization problems by using MR as the paradigm to design solvers that allow transparent runs on a varied number of computers that collaborate to find the problem solution. We study and analyze the MR technology, focusing on Hadoop, Spark, and MPI as the middleware platforms to develop genetic algorithms (GAs). From this, MRGA solvers arise using a different programming paradigm from the usual imperative transformational programming. Our objective is to confirm the expected benefits of these systems, namely file, memory, and communication management, over the resulting algorithms. We analyze our MRGA solvers from relevant points of view like scalability, speedup, and communication vs. computation time in big optimization. The results for high-dimensional datasets show that the MRGA over Hadoop outperforms the implementations in Spark and MPI frameworks. For the smallest datasets, the execution of MRGA on MPI is always faster than the executions of the remaining MRGAs. Finally, the MRGA over Spark presents the lowest communication times. Numerical and time insights are given in our work, so as to ease future comparisons of new algorithms over these three popular technologies.},

Experiments were conducted at different levels of current, pulse on time, pulse off time and voltage with and without magnetic field assistance and the experimental results for power consumption, aerosol emissions, metal removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness were collected and analyzed. The power consumption, surface roughness, recast layers, microcracks, microvoids and microglobules were found to be reduced with improved MRR in the MEDM. A hybrid teaching learning-based optimization algorithm was proposed and optimized the process parameters in MEDM. With the proposed methodology, the MRR, surface roughness, power consumption and aerosol emissions reached 82\%, 80\%, 87\% and 68\% of the specified targets, respectively.

This article considers various demand patterns for a single product in a three-echelon supply chain where a single supplier, a single manufacturer and a single retailer are involved. A robust inspection process is considered at the manufacturer’s end to deliver a high-quality product to the retailer. The backorder strategy is incorporated to enhance the company’s trust and reputation among consumers. The major idea of this research is to analyze the nature of the product’s demand in three distinct situations, as well as the benefits of implementing the backorder technique. Three cases are analyzed on the basis of different demand patterns, in which the demand rate is assumed to be constant (i.e., deterministic), price-dependent and fuzzy in the first, second and third cases, respectively. To verify this model, numerical examples are tested independently with identical information for each case and owing to the complexity of the objective function; a genetic algorithm is employed to obtain the best solution.

  abstract     = {Feature selection, widely used in data preprocessing, is a challenging problem as it involves hard combinatorial optimization. So far some meta-heuristic algorithms have shown effectiveness in solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. As the arithmetic optimization algorithm only performs well in dealing with continuous optimization problems, multiple binary arithmetic optimization algorithms (BAOAs) utilizing different strategies are proposed to perform feature selection. First, six algorithms are formed based on six different transfer functions by converting the continuous search space to the discrete search space. Second, in order to enhance the speed of searching and the ability of escaping from the local optima, six other algorithms are further developed by integrating the transfer functions and Lévy flight. Based on 20 common University of California Irvine (UCI) datasets, the performance of our proposed algorithms in feature selection is evaluated, and the results demonstrate that BAOA_S1LF is the most superior among all the proposed algorithms. Moreover, the performance of BAOA_S1LF is compared with other meta-heuristic algorithms on 26 UCI datasets, and the corresponding results show the superiority of BAOA_S1LF in feature selection.

Besides, some realistic constraints are considered in the new uncertain EIT model. Then, the properties of the proposed model are discussed.

  abstract     = {Online reviews play a critical role in modern word-of-mouth communication, influencing consumers&#39; shopping preferences and purchase decisions, and directly affecting a company&#39;s reputation and profitability. However, the credibility and authenticity of these reviews are often questioned due to the prevalence of fake online reviews that can mislead customers and harm e-commerce&#39;s credibility. These fake reviews are often difficult to identify and can lead to erroneous conclusions in user feedback analysis. This paper proposes a new approach to detect fake online reviews by combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and adaptive particle swarm optimization with natural language processing techniques. The approach uses datasets from popular online review platforms like Ott, Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and IMDb and applies feature selection techniques to select the most informative features. The paper suggests using attention mechanisms like bidirectional encoder representations from transformers and generative pre-trained transformer, as well as other techniques like Deep contextualized word representation, word2vec, GloVe, and fast Text, for feature extraction from online review datasets. The proposed method uses a multimodal approach based on a CNN architecture that combines text data to achieve a high accuracy rate of 99.4\%. This outperforms traditional machine learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, recall, and F measure. The proposed approach has practical implications for consumers, manufacturers, and sellers in making informed product choices and decision-making processes, helping maintain the credibility of online consumer reviews. The proposed model shows excellent generalization abilities and outperforms conventional discrete and existing neural network benchmark models across multiple datasets. Moreover, it reduces the time complexity for both training and testing.},

  abstract     = {Cardiac arrhythmia (CA) is an irregular rhythm that can cause an increase or decrease in heart rate. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a noninvasive diagnostic technique widely used to identify CAs. The cardiologist analyzes these ECG signals for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of CA. However, diagnosing minute changes with the naked eye for longer ECG recordings is difficult and takes much time for the cardiologist to conclude the disease type. Therefore, developing an automated diagnostic tool for classifying CA from ECG recordings is essential. In this work, we propose a novel technique for effectively diagnosing CAs from the ECG signal. The proposed method optimizes the hyper-parameters of the tunable Q wavelet transform (TQWT) and random subspace of the stacked ensemble classifier using an enhanced Jaya optimization algorithm (EJOA) for CA classification. This optimized parameter of TQWT extracts features from ECG signals by decomposing them into high- and low-pass sub-band signals. Then, the low-dimensional features are extracted from the sub-band signal coefficients by applying principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, the optimized random subspace stacked ensemble classifier is trained with the optimal random subspace features of the principal components for subsequent classification of CAs. The trained random subspace stacked ensemble classifier was independently tested with inter-patient testing beats of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and St Petersburg INCART 12-lead arrhythmia databases to diagnose different CA classes. The proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 98.30\% and a sensitivity of 93.42\% for the MIT-BIH database, an average accuracy of 96.60\%, and a sensitivity of 80.2\% for the INCART database. These performance measures demonstrate the proposed classifier’s efficacy and are better than those reported in the existing literature.},

Recent research in such field of representation learning has significant progress of deep neural networks combined with a different network walking method. However, present feature learning approaches do not pay much attention to get enough global information combined with getting the diversity of connectivity patterns in the network. An algorithmic framework called as Global2vec and Global2vec-PMI of learning vector feature representations for nodes in networks is proposed. With such network embedding method, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of the network neighborhoods information as well as the global statistics information of nodes. The global and local statistics of the nodes are used for modeling the loss function. We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods over existing state-of-the-art techniques for multi-label classification, link prediction in several different real-world networks. The proposed Global2vec can outperform the compared methods in all cases, and Global2vec-PMI outperforms others in most cases of BlogCatalog, PPI and Flickr dataset with Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 score for multi-label classification task. For link prediction task, generally, Global2vec-PMI is better when using Euclidean and Manhattan distance; for other distance metrics, Global2vec can achieve better performance. The maximum area under curve scores of all distance metrics is mostly obtained by the proposed global co-occurrence statistics-based methods.

  abstract     = {While seeping into every aspect of our lives, intelligent systems carry serious concerns, many of which stem from the need to secure control over machines ensuring they turn into an enhancement and not into a threat to human societies. Issues are not lacking. Whether one considers recruiting platforms perpetuating historical patterns of discrimination or AI-driven systems unfairly evaluating the creditworthiness of natural persons, it clearly appears vital to firmly place human beings with their rights and needs at the center of intelligent technologies. The paper tackles this kind of issue by focusing on the use of artificial intelligence in criminal justice, where predictive analytics and AI-driven decision systems have proven capable not only of enhancing the fight against crime but also of bringing the risk of opacity, aberrations, and injustices. We present a human–machine collaboration strategy providing judges with the advantages of AI and computational heuristics while offering control and understanding of the role played by machines. Drawing from a research that led to the development of an experimental platform supporting judges and public prosecutors dealing with organized crime, the strategy revolves around two components: (i) an online learning model designed to support judges in the evaluation of criminal dangerousness of individuals and groups capable of learning from users’ feedback; (ii) a human–computer interaction component exploiting visual metaphors to ease judges’ interaction with data, AI and other heuristics. The main contribution of the work is a novel and viable declension of the Human-centered AI paradigm in justice administration.},

A novel feature selection technique for text classification is proposed, based on frequent and correlated items. This method considers both relevance and feature interactions, using association as a metric to evaluate the relationship between the target and features. The technique was tested using the SMS spam collecting dataset from the UCI machine learning repository and compared with well-known feature selection methods. The results showed that the proposed technique effectively reduced redundant information while achieving high accuracy (95.155\%) using only 6\% of the features.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown that deep learning has presented great potential in facial expression recognition (FER) tasks and attracted more and more researchers’ attention. Many existing methods have achieved good results on facial expression images in the laboratory environment. However, there are still great challenges for FER in the wild environment where facial expression images are more complex and diverse than those in the laboratory. In this paper, we propose a new method for FER from the perspective of multi-level features extraction and fusion. Different from the existing feature extraction network where only a single convolution kernel scale is present, we propose a feature extraction module with different convolutional kernel scales, which extracts multi-level features as the output of the whole feature extraction network. Further, we do not directly use these multi-level features but propose a feature fusion module with global and local attention to adaptively fuse these different level features in pairs with a top-down way and construct a new facial expression feature. To relieve the overfitting effect caused by data imbalance, we employ label smoothing and L2 regularization strategies to further guide our model forward in a better direction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our method achieves accuracies of 88.08\% on RAFDB, 88.11\% on FERPlus and 59.38\% on AffectNet, respectively, which are very competitive performances. Moreover, our multi-level feature fusion approach enables traditional convolutional backbone networks to improve performance by 0.64–1.13\% on FER tasks.},

When mass function degenerates to probability, the fractal dimension is equivalent to classical Renyi information dimension only with $$\alpha = 1$$ , which can measure the change rate of Shannon entropy with the size of framework. For Renyi dimension, different parameters $$\alpha $$ represent the relationship between different entropies and framework size. However, this compatibility is not shown in existing fractal dimension. Thus, in this paper, we introduce parameter $$\alpha $$ to generalize the existing dimension. Due to the diversity of the value of $$\alpha $$ , we name the new dimension: multifractal dimension of mass function. In addition, inspired by multifractal spectrum of Cantor set, we explore the relation between the belief degree of focal element and the number of focal element with same belief degree for some special assignments. Relevant results are also presented by spectrum. We provide a static discounting coefficient generating method to modify mass function to improve the accuracy of classify result. The experiment is conducted in three datasets, and the result shows the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {The Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) has widespread application in many fields as a system analysis method to explain the relationship between the risk factors in a system. By analyzing the influence relationship and degree of influence among risk factors, DEMATEL can determine their importance and priority. One characteristic of DEMATEL is that expert experience and knowledge should be fully considered. However, in practical applications, there are great uncertainties in the evaluation process because of the differences in experts’ historical experiences and subjective opinions. To address this issue, an improved fuzzy evidential DEMATEL method based on the two-dimensional correlation coefficient (2-DCC) and negation of basic probability assignment (BPA) is proposed in this paper. The new method uses 2-DCC to calculate the correlation between different expert evaluations in horizontal and vertical directions to get an overall correlation r and converts it into the macro-credibility and weight of experts. Then, to construct BPA according to the fuzzy evaluations, the total uncertainty (TU) measure and negation of BPA under the framework of evidence theory are used to deal with the uncertainty of evaluation, and then, the evaluations will be weighted and fused. Finally, the DEMATEL method is used to calculate the comprehensive influence matrix, and the importance of each risk factor is calculated. Two applications well verified the effectiveness of our method.},

The notion of bipolar complex fuzzy soft sets is a significant tool to cope with the awkward and complicated information involving the second dimension, i.e., unreal part, both positive and negative opinions, and the parameters. Further, similarity measures play an important role in various fields such as data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. They are used to measure the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between two or more objects, documents, images, or any other type of data. Consequently, in this script, we diagnose trigonometric similarity measures like generalized cosine similarity measure, generalized tangent similarity measure and generalized cotangent similarity measure, and generalized hybrid trigonometric similarity measure in the environment of bipolar complex fuzzy soft sets. Furthermore, we also discuss the weighted generalized cosine similarity measure, weighted generalized tangent similarity measure, weighted generalized cotangent similarity measure, and weighted generalized hybrid trigonometric similarity measure for bipolar complex fuzzy soft sets. After that, through the diagnosed similarity measures, we analyze real-life dilemmas like pattern recognition and medical diagnosis to portray the applicability and benefits of the diagnosed similarity measures in the real world. At the end of this study, we show the superiority and supremacy of the analyzed trigonometric similarity measures by doing their analysis with certain prevailing similarity measures.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this research is to develop a highly secured non-breakable fastest cryptosystem. A significant number of image encryption plans have been proposed during the past years. By far, most such plans arrive at a high-security level; be that as it may, their moderate velocities due to their complex phenomenon make them of no utilization progressively applications. Motivated by this, we propose another proficient and quick image encryption plan subject to the trigonometric turbulent guide. In contrast with most current plans, we utilize this basic map to create just a couple of arbitrary rows and columns in the form of S-boxes. Besides, to, moreover, accelerate, we raise the handling unit from the pixel level to the line/segment level. Security of the new plan is acquired through a replacement stage organization, where we implemented around the shift of lines and segments to break the strong relation between adjoining pixels and non-repeating sequences. By then, we join the Exclusive-OR operation with modulo capacity to cover the pixel esteems and avoid any spilling of information. High-security tests and reenactment examinations have been done to display that the plan is extremely safe and particularly speedy for continuous picture preparation at 80 fps (frames per second). The present research has developed a cryptosystem based on Exclusive-OR with S-box (Substitution Box) and trigonometric chaotic map (TCM) of image matrices. High security is achieved due to the non-repeating sequence of the TCM. Earlier, the author has already presented the efficacy of the TCM combined with the S-Boxes.},

In this paper, type-2 fuzzy sets-based random vector functional link, type-2 fuzzy sets-based extreme learning machine and Tikhonov-regularized extreme learning machine are fused into one network, a tensor way of stacking data is used to incorporate the nonlinear mappings when using type-2 fuzzy sets. In this way, the network could learn the sub-structure by three sub-structures’ algorithms, which are merged into one tensor structure via the type-2 fuzzy mapping results. To the stacked single fuzzy neural network, the consequent part parameters learning is implemented by unfolding tensor-based matrix regression. The newly proposed stacked single fuzzy neural network shows a new way to design the hybrid fuzzy neural network with the higher order fuzzy sets and higher order data structure. The effective of the proposed stacked single fuzzy neural network are verified by the classical testing benchmarks and several statistical testing methods.},

The use of networks provides valuable insights into the patterns, relationships, and behavior of various entities and their interactions. Healthcare service systems are critical social systems that can be analyzed using network-based methodologies, one of which is influence maximization (IM). It is a network analysis technique that identifies a small subset of suppliers in a network that has the most influence on the overall behavior of the healthcare system. By utilizing network analysis techniques, data scientists can identify the most crucial healthcare providers in a network and better understand the system&#39;s operation. The paper uses a network global structure-based centrality (ngsc) approach that combines conventional k-shell and the sum of neighbors&#39; degree methods with information about the network&#39;s global structural features to identify significant providers in the provider-interacting network. The experimental outcomes on five real-world networks reveal that the proposed NGSC technique outperforms earlier benchmark methods in identifying significant providers under a spreading dynamic when using the IC model.},

Notably, the size and number of medical datasets in healthcare are enormously increasing, and the automated model using data mining and machine learning techniques helps clinicians to make appropriate and efficient decisions. The major challenges in heart disease prediction include an imbalance of the samples and a lack of magnitude for some features. This research article aims to propose effective feature optimization and classification methodologies for heart disease prediction that help medical practitioners in the early diagnosis of disease. Firstly, the min–max normalization technique is applied to rescale the collected data from Shahid Rajaei hospital and UCI Cleveland datasets. Further, the optimal features and feature subsets are determined by employing Recursive Feature Elimination and Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithms. Lastly, the optimized feature subsets are fed to the ensemble classifier for heart disease prediction: presence and absence of the heart disease. From the experimental analysis, the proposed ensemble-based IPSO model obtained 98.41\% and 97.40\% accuracy on the UCI Cleveland and Shahid Rajaei hospital datasets, where the obtained results are superior compared to the traditional machine learning techniques.},

The system’s performance suffers when optimal channel selection data are not available. Removing noise and irrelevant channels improves the outcomes and implementation of the EEG deception identification system. Swarm optimization techniques are frequently used to overcome feature selection problems. Transfer functions need swarm algorithms because they change the search space from one that is continuous to one that is discrete. The currently used sigmoid transfer function cannot balance exploration and exploitation stages in the search space, including optimal local problems. The novel binary Harris Hawks optimization with a time-varying transfer function (TVk-BHHO) is used in this work to select channels from EEG channel data optimally. Controlling the time-varying parameter is essential for balancing the search space’s exploration and exploitation stages and avoiding the optimum local problem. In this case, a specific classifier from a random forest improves the system’s performance and accuracy. The results show that TVk-BHHO has consistent channel selection, resulting in higher classification accuracy and more harmonious convergence. Existing meta-heuristic algorithms are against the simulation results of the new TVk-BHHO approach. The best accuracy achieved here is 98.50\%.},

There are various techniques involved in the proposed Contrast Enhancement using Histogram Equalization algorithm such as image pre-processing and post-processing techniques, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Each stage is responsible for performing a series of actions. As the images are pre-processed, a feature vector is formed to which Principal Component Analysis is applied. The output is then subjected to k-means clustering to group the pixels obtained as vessel clusters or non-vessel clusters. The vessel clusters are not processed further, while the non-vessel clusters are subjected to ensemble classification which makes use of a decision tree along with bagging. The segmented image thus obtained is the combined result of clustering and ensemble classification technique. This segmented image thus obtained is then subjected to post-processing using morphological techniques. The images are then validated which shows that compared to the existing techniques, the proposed model for blood vessel segmentation shows 95\% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Edge detection is an essential computer vision phenomenon that is useful for contour detection and in turn it is useful for acquiring vital information. There are a variety of images, including medical, satellite, industrial and general-purpose images. An X-ray is a form of medical imaging that is created by transmitting electronic radiation into a patient&#39;s body to get an image of the human body&#39;s internal structures. This allows orthopedic surgeons and radiologists to make more accurate diagnoses of illness. Due to its versatility, soft computing approaches are regarded as effective edge detection tools. This study provides a novel fuzzy logic-based technique for edge detection in which the quality of edges is governed by a sharpening-guided filter. The proposed model holds four different patterns for extracting the edges from an image namely $$2\times 2$$ mask, $$3\times 2$$ mask, $$2\times 3$$ mask and $$3\times 3$$ mask. These patterns of masks target the edge pixels of an image along with the other pixels. The proposed model provides an enhanced approach for detecting edges in X-ray pictures of humans. Various statistical measurements are used to evaluate the proposed model to prove its significance. By adjusting the smoothing parameters appropriately, it has been discovered that the detected edges are significantly enhanced. The proposed model is implemented and evaluated under four different metrics namely Correlation Coefficient, Figure of Merit, Structure Similarity Image Metrics and Euclidian Distance. The proposed model results are compared five different state-of-the-art algorithms to prove the significance, and the result shows that the proposed model identifies the edge in a well-structured manner.},

  abstract     = {Neonatal disorder is most common in newborn babies. It is due to the unusual activity of the baby&#39;s organs. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is familiar among neonates. The origin of hyperbilirubinemia is the existence of yellow coloration on the baby&#39;s skin. At a severe stage, it may affect the human brain. Early prediction is essential to overcome the neonate&#39;s mortality. It is achieved by computer vision-based image preprocessing and machine learning. In the existing system, feature extraction is based on color features. To enhance the performance, multiple extractions such as structural feature extraction and pixel positioning feature extraction are essential for medical image feature extraction. In the proposed system, a feature fusion method is implemented to upgrade the performance. Developing the novel method of the feature fusion framework enhances the performance of the binary classification and helps for up-gradation. The system architecture consists of baby segmentation, feature fusion, and classification. Baby segmentation is done by the fast and robust fuzzy clustering algorithm. Feature fusion framework includes feature extraction, feature fusion, and feature selection. Feature extraction is performed by the novel method of Structural Color Gray Coherent Feature extraction to extract 35 features. The features are fused into a single feature by a concatenation operation. An improvised method of the Salp Swarm Algorithm is implemented for feature selection, and the classification is done by a random forest. The comparison analysis of various classifiers is carried out, based on their true positive, true negative, false negative, and false positive, respectively. The experimental result shows the random forest classified with a performance of 97\% accuracy.},

In this aspect, tech-centers offering technological &amp; innovative engineering solutions, and providing customized services to the needs of the companies, have taken attentions of academicians and practitioners. In this study, a tech-center location evaluation problem having a strategic and complex structure on the success and performance of the engineering companies, is analyzed. By considering inherent uncertainties and lack of information in the multi-criteria &amp; multi-expert based tech-center location selection problem, the fuzzy set theory as a tool of artificial intelligence is employed. In the study, one of the recently proposed fuzzy sets namely Spherical fuzzy sets are used to handle uncertainty in a better way by incorporating a larger domain. According to the best knowledge of the authors, it is the first study concentrating on tech-centers and employing an integrated interval-valued Spherical fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) &amp; MULTIMOORA methodology to solve location selection problem of a tech-center. In the study, a novel defuzzification function is also presented. In the application section, a case of a company planning to launch a tech-center is analyzed. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is applied to test the applicability and robustness of the method.

This process consists of time-domain statistical feature extraction and a subspace-based feature selection. The utilization of subspace features is observed to increase the identification accuracy and decrease the execution time. Besides, the foot galvanic skin response signal is found to be more sensitive to identification among other signals, and increased stress level causes increased false negativity and hence decreased accuracy. These outcomes show that driver identification can be achieved by a process similar to the previously proposed for distress recognition, even using just one wearable technology without the need for any other equipment, and thus give the possibility to realize driver-customized infotainment and vehicle security applications using a single system.},

Personalized health management, driven by advancements in big data analysis, feature extraction, and internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a prominent trend in the sports industry. Based on these advancements, this paper focuses on leveraging machine vision, big data, and IoT to conduct a comprehensive study for extracting football players&#39; offense features by aiming to improve accuracy and ensure the players’ safety in sports industry. First, this paper discusses a framework for sports health, which is based on big data analysis. Next, we discuss the use of big data and feature extraction for IoT and sports health informatics. The action image of an offense for football players is collected by an intelligent camera, and the gathered imaging code is read and analyzed by radio frequency technology. Using the recognition method of offense action using deep learning and motion information, the offense action’s image features and the three-color features of video RGB are fused into deep learning features to complete the offense action recognition. Based on the offense action recognition, the Harris 3D operator is applied to construct the sequence potential function of the offense action, and the sequence possible function of the offense action is used as the operational technique for this purpose. In addition, the AdaBoost algorithm is used to comprehensively screen the characterized data of athletes&#39; offense actions, and the filtered data are used as training samples to complete the feature extraction of athletes&#39; offense actions. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the recognition error of offense action and improve the efficiency of action’s feature extraction and the accuracy of feature extraction.},

The results can be useful in the context of the current trend of social media sensing and, in particular, to support social media providers in receiving early warnings related to the analysis of emotional dynamics that could lead to or degenerate into information disorder.

  abstract     = {Hybrid renewable power generation becomes essential in most of electric power networks. Battery storage is commonly used in renewable energy systems (RESs) with distributed generation, such as solar and wind energy systems, to reduce power fluctuations caused by the intermittent behavior of renewable energy sources. A battery has been connected with the dc grid through a dc–dc bi-directional converter. The control scheme of the dc–dc bi-directional converter (BDC) is having two controlled loops. One is voltage-controlled loop, and another is the current-controlled loop. In this work, two-degree-of-freedom fractional order proportional integral derivative + proportional integral controller (2-DOF FOPID + PI) is proposed and applied in the voltage-controlled loop to stabilize the dc bus voltage and power flow effectively for both islanded mode and grid-connected mode. A novel meta-heuristic algorithm, i.e., modified sine cosine algorithm (m-SCA), is used to tune the controller parameters of the proposed controller. To test the performance of the modified SCA algorithm, various well-known uni-modal and multi-modal benchmark functions are taken in this paper. To confer the viability of the proposed controller, its performance is compared with other literature-based conventional controllers. This paper presents time-domain analysis, stability, and robustness test to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. MATLAB/Simulink has been used for computational work to analyze the system&#39;s efficiency. Finally, the proposed technique is validated by using OPAL-RT platform (Opal-RT-OP4510 model) with the power management of RES (PV and wind) and battery energy storage. Experimental work proved the effectiveness of the proposed m-SCA optimized 2-DOF FOPID + PI controller.},

The input variables for the models were volumes of cars, medium vehicles, buses, heavy vehicles, and average speed. Prior to the development of the hybrid model, the potential of boosted regression tree, feed forward neural network, Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector regression and linear regression models for traffic noise prediction was evaluated and compared with each other. The performances of the single and hybrid models were evaluated using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and relative root mean square error (rRMSE). MLR-GPR hybrid demonstrated better prediction capability than all other models with NSE, RMSE, MAE and rRMSE values of 0.9312, 0.0427, 0.0347 and 7.4\%, respectively.

In this paper, we proposed models to design mobile robot combined with Android OS Tablet with a user interaction screen, voice control model, and AIDL IPC interactive model for remote control. We research the mobile robot using RockChip AI Processor RK3399Pro, which focuses on understanding the structure and operating mechanism of the AI Processor that RockChip robot uses, along with researching Android with IPC AIDL architecture and Automatic Voice Recognition technology to control robot to turn left, turn right, move forward, backward, and stop the movement by voice with three languages: Korean, English, and Vietnamese.

The results obtained a fairly high average confidence of 95\% for English and Vietnamese languages and 87\% for Korean. From results of this study, it will serve as a foundation for the research and development of a system to support students in learning by interacting with mobile robots through voice with multi-language.

Specifically, there were huge demands for autonomous agent-related IDS solution which need some human intervention as possible whereas can progress and enhance themselves (by making suitable acts for a presented environment) and turns out to be highly powerful to effective threats that were not seen before (for instance, zero-day attacks). Recently, DRL methods were presented that can learns from the environment with uncontrollable massive amount of states for addressing the major drawbacks of prevailing RL methods. This article introduces a Binary Bat Algorithm-based Feature Selection with Deep Reinforcement Learning (BBAFS-DRL) system for IDSs. The major intention of the BBAFS-DRL approach is the recognition and classification of intrusion systems. In the projected BBAFS-DRL method, data pre-processed was primarily executed to change the data as suitable format. Furthermore, the BBAFS system can be utilized for the effectual feature selection. Next, deep Q-network is applied for the effectual identification and classification of intrusion. At last, the root means square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer is utilized for the effectual hyperparameter tuning procedure. The experimental analysis of the BBAFS-DRL algorithm can be tested by utilize of benchmark database and the outcome can be analyzed on many measures. The comparison outcome demonstrated the improvement of the BBAFS-DRL methodology over other existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the permutation flow shop scheduling problem with makespan criteria is investigated, and two algorithms, Jaya and SAMP-Jaya, are proposed. Jaya is a simple and effective meta-heuristic optimization technique that has been successfully applied in various engineering problems, while SAMP-Jaya is a modified version of Jaya that uses a multi-population approach. Both algorithms are parameter-less, and the ANOVA experiment is used to identify the significant control parameters. The population size is found to be the most crucial parameter for improving solution quality. The performance of Jaya and SAMP-Jaya is compared to the exact solution and the genetic algorithm, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithms. The computational results confirm that the suggested optimization techniques are effective in terms of solution quality.},

In the sequel, their various kinds of properties are defined, such as closedness, weak intersection rule, some algebraic preserving properties, etc. The dual correspondence between the tangent and normal cones is also analyzed. For constrained optimization problems, the normal cone is used to characterize efficient solutions. Furthermore, we derive a necessary condition for efficient solutions for interval optimization problems with the help of Lagrange multipliers, tangent cones, and normal cones. Lastly, an application of the proposed normal cone in solving an interval-valued support vector machines type problem is discussed.},

Minimum road damage and goods damage are taken as design criteria for design. The objective function and constraint calculation in suspension design involve dynamic responses of the vehicle that has a high computational cost. Hence, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for fast convergence. Proposed hybrid GA is designed using the selection method of two different genetic algorithms, i.e. non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and 2-objective geometry inspired genetic algorithm (2GIGA). Proposed hybrid GA is tested for different benchmarking optimization problems along with suspension optimization problems. Two types of suspension systems, passive and semi-active suspensions, are designed. A semi-active suspension system design involves designing a controller for a controllable damper along with passive elements. An improvised control law using a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is used for the semi-active suspension system of multi-axle HGV. This control law is designed in such a way that it will eliminate the need for a passive damper in a semi-active suspension system. Results of the proposed hybrid GA are compared with the NSGA-II and 2GIGA. The proposed hybrid GA is performing better and saves significant computational cost for the suspension design of HGV.},

  abstract     = {Resolving the power crises requires the combination of different individual renewable energy sources so that one source can compensate for another. Unfortunately, renewable energy sources are not always available at certain times making their use problematic. To solve this uncertainty, it is important to combine independent renewable energy sources and determine the right set of the renewable energy mix that is economical and reliable. The sources of renewable energy data are solar PV, wind, battery, and biomass. Different scenarios of renewable energy mix or combination considered are wind–biomass–battery, solar PV–wind–biomass, PV–biomass–battery, and solar PV–wind–biomass–battery. Knowing the economic and reliable impact of these combinations helps to make the best investment decision. The nature-inspired optimization is utilized as the methodology to determine the feasible dimension, economic, and reliability of the energy mix. Historical energy-related data for one year were obtained from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and was used to evaluate the hybrid renewable energy systems. The result shows that SSP guaranteed optimal economic costs and satisfied the reliability constraints for wind–biomass–battery system, solar PV–wind–biomass system, PV–biomass–battery, and PV–wind–biomass–battery. The outcomes suggests that SSP can provide optimal result and therefore calls for researchers to further explore the potential of integrating this algorithm in their optimization approach for solar PV–wind–biomass–battery hybrid system.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm, CSMOEA, for multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) with computationally expensive objectives. Considering most surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) do not make full use of population information and only use population information in either the objective space or the design space independently, to address this limitation, we propose a new strategy for comprehensive utilization of population information of objective and design space. The proposed CSMOEA adopts an adaptive clustering strategy to divide the current population into good and bad groups, and the clustering centers in the design space are obtained, respectively. Then, a bi-level sampling strategy is proposed to select the best samples in both the design and objective space, using distance to the clustering centers and approximated objective values of radial basis functions. The effectiveness of CSMOEA is compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms on 21 widely used benchmark problems, and the results show high efficiency and a good balance between convergence and diversity. Additionally, CSMOEA is applied to the shape optimization of blend-wing-body underwater gliders with 14 decision variables and two objectives, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving real-world engineering problems.},

The ideal ability of the intelligent water drops algorithm in general search, along with the remarkable capacity of tabu search in local search guarantees the balance between exploration and exploitation processes in evolutionary cycles. Subsequently, several experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed method on standard benchmark functions, random DAGs, and actual workflows derived from the Microsoft Azure platform, respectively.

In this paper, ten different chaotic interference factors are introduced in the exploration stage of POA. After selecting an improved POA with the best performance, six different elementary mathematical functions are introduced in the exploitation stage of POA to improve its optimization performance. Then 30 benchmark functions in CEC-BC-2017 were used to test the performance of different improved algorithms. The experimental results showed that the performance of the improved algorithms have been improved effectively compared with the original POA, and the accuracy and optimization ability to balance exploration and exploitation were significantly improved. Compared with seven different algorithms, the feasibility of the improved POA proposed in this paper is proved. Finally, four engineering design problems are optimized, and the simulation results show that among four different engineering design problems, the improved POA proposed in this paper is obviously superior to the original POA, which proves that the improved POA based on chaotic interference factor and elementary function is competitive in optimization performance on function optimization and practical engineering applications.},

In GMO, the geometric mean of the scaled objective values of a certain agent’s opposites is assigned to that agent as its weight representing its overall eligibility to guide the other agents in the search process when solving an optimization problem. Furthermore, the GMO has no parameter to tune, contributing its results to be highly reliable. The competence of the GMO in solving optimization problems is verified via implementation on 52 standard benchmark test problems including 23 classical test functions, 29 CEC2017 test functions as well as nine constrained engineering problems. The results presented by the GMO are then compared with those offered by several newly proposed and popular meta-heuristic algorithms.

  abstract     = {Asymptomatically presenting COVID-19 complicates the detection of infected individuals. Additionally, the virus changes too many genomic variants, which increases the virus’s ability to spread. Because there isn’t a specific treatment for COVID-19 in a short time, the essential goal is to reduce the virulence of the disease. Blood parameters, which contain essential clinical information about infectious diseases and are easy to access, have an important place in COVID-19 detection. The convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is popular in image processing, produces highly successful results for COVID-19 detection models. When the literature is examined, it is seen that COVID-19 studies with CNN are generally done using lung images. In this study, one-dimensional (1D) blood parameters data were converted into two-dimensional (2D) image data after preprocessing, and COVID-19 detection was made with CNN. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding method was applied to transfer the feature vectors to the 2D plane. All data were framed with convex hull and minimum bounding rectangle algorithms to obtain image data. The image data obtained by pixel mapping was presented to the developed 3-line CNN architecture. This study proposes an effective and successful model by providing a combination of low-cost and rapidly-accessible blood parameters and CNN architecture making image data processing highly successful for COVID-19 detection. Ultimately, COVID-19 detection was made with a success rate of 94.85\%. This study has brought a new perspective to COVID-19 detection studies by obtaining 2D image data from 1D COVID-19 blood parameters and using CNN.},

  abstract     = {In many developed countries, photovoltaic solar power, which is considered the most cost-effective renewable energy source, accounts for a major portion of electricity production. The photovoltaic (PV) power generation is unpredictable and imprecise due to its high variation that can be caused of meteorological elements, to reduce the negative influence of the use of PV power, accurate PV power prediction is of crucial significance for the secure and efficient operation of photovoltaic power system operation. In light of this, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder (AE) for photovoltaic power forecasting. Initially, to generate encoded sequences the LSTM-encoder extracts the characteristics from the input data. Then the LSTM-decoder decoded the encoded sequences to advance them to the last dense layer for photovoltaic power prediction. Furthermore, we conducted experiments using a 23.40 kW PV power plants dataset from DKASC in Australia. The results have confirmed that the LSTM-AE model can achieve better prediction accuracy than the benchmark deep learning methods, in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R $$^2$$ ) performance measures. When the results are analyzed, the LSTM-AE model gives the best results with average RMSE, MAE, and R $$^2$$ to 0.0762 kW, 0.0389 kW, and 99.93 $$\%$$ , respectively. The experimental results confirm that proposed method with the highest R $$^2$$ values and minimum forecasting errors compared to the benchmark models can effectively improve stable performance and achieve better accurate photovoltaic power forecasting.},

Although existing methods have achieved promising performance to some extent, there still exist some limitations, such as the temporal dependency of long sequences and complex relationships among multiple features. To address these problems, a self-attention-based unsupervised multivariate reconstruction network called ALAE is proposed in this paper. ALAE first establishes a LSTM autoencoder framework to capture the temporal dependencies of long sequences. Then, a multi-head weighted self-attention mechanism is proposed to explore the complex relationships between multiple features in high-dimensional data. This attention mechanism also resolves the issue of insufficient information caused by the fixed vector between the encoder and decoder. Finally, a more robust strategy is used to calculate the anomaly score. Abundant experiments conducted on six public multivariate time series datasets, including financial risks, social governance, and NASA, show that ALAE performs better than seven baseline algorithms. Noteworthy, ablation experiments reveal the validity of integrating the autoencoder with the attention mechanism.},

Machine learning is utilized in a wide variety of applications due to its effectiveness in prediction and autonomous decision-making. However, applying machine learning would only be effective when representative features for the application can be acquired, through which learning algorithms can be trained. Hence, first, we present a feature extraction technique for radioactive source localization, and then propose a parameter estimation method via machine learning. A distributed sensor network is employed to assist in estimating the radioactive source’s location and intensity. We propose a feature extraction method that evaluates a feature vector using the reading and position of each sensor located in a region where a radiation source is detected. The feature extraction is based on a data fusion process, where a single feature value is provided to represent both the reading value and position coordinates corresponding to a given sensor. After the feature extraction, we apply the decision tree machine learning method for regression to localize a radioactive source. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed work, a performance comparison is carried out with recent existing methods in terms of the estimation accuracy and the execution time. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides accurate source intensity estimation and achieves a good compromise between localization accuracy and execution time.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of human life and society, the medical field is constantly improving. However, modern medicine still faces many limitations, including challenging and previously unsolvable problems. In these cases, artificial intelligence (AI) can provide solutions. The research and application of generative adversarial networks (GAN) are a clear example. While most researchers focus on image augmentation, there are few one-dimensional data augmentation examples. The radiomics feature extracted from RT and CT images is one-dimensional data. As far as we know, we are the first to apply the WGAN-GP algorithm to generate radiomics data in the medical field. In this paper, we input a portion of the original real data samples into the model. The model learns the distribution of the input data samples and generates synthetic data samples with similar distribution to the original real data, which can solve the problem of obtaining annotated medical data samples. We have conducted experiments on the public dataset Heart Disease Cleveland and the private dataset. Compared with the traditional method of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and common GAN for data augmentation, our method has significantly improved the AUC and SEN values under different data proportions. At the same time, our method has also shown varying levels of improvement in ACC and SPE values. This demonstrates that our method is effective and feasible.},

The coefficients, boundary conditions, and parameters in gr-FFDLSs are represented as fuzzy numbers. This type of system also encompasses the concept of fractional order granular Caputo (gr-Caputo) fuzzy derivative. To achieve this goal, the gr-Caputo fuzzy derivative of order $$n-1&lt;\beta &lt;n$$ , where n is a natural number, is defined. Furthermore, the granular fuzzy Laplace transforms of the fractional order gr-Caputo fuzzy derivative and fractional order granular fuzzy integrals are introduced. Using the definition of fractional order gr-Caputo fuzzy derivative, fuzzy Drazin inverse matrix, and Laplace transformation, the solution to the state equation of granular descriptor fuzzy fractional linear systems is obtained. Two techniques, the fuzzy shuffle algorithm and the fuzzy Drazin inverse method, are presented to find the fuzzy solution of gr-FFDLSs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques, two examples are provided to show that they can produce accurate solutions for gr-FFDLSs.},

The multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem under a PLTS environment has gained attention from numerous scholars. However, the majority of current studies are not precise enough in capturing information on PLTS. To address this problem, this paper presents a preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE) based on the redefined PLTS and novel score function to solve MADM problems under a PLTS environment. First, an asymmetric normalized PLTS based on prospect theory (ANPLTSPT) is developed. Compared with the PLTS, ANPLTSPT offers a more realistic portrayal of decision-makers’ psychological state while ensuring the superiority of the PLTS. Second, regarding the structural complexity of ANPLTSPT, this paper attempts to simplify the computational process through a score function that can embody the characteristics of ANPLTSPT. Inspired by previously formulated score functions, a novel score function called Score-InInHe is developed, the corresponding definitions are given, and some further properties are discussed. With the support of the proposed Score-InInHe, the total score entropy is defined and an objective method to determine the attribute weights is proposed. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to the selection of a green supplier and the determination of air quality. The validity and realistic applicability of the proposed approach are demonstrated through comparative analyses and discussions.},

Within this respect, the present paper will be discussing this condition. To ensure control performance and investigate the diagnosis process in low-speed operations, the backstepping algorithm is utilized to handle uncertainties. The discrete wavelet transform is employed to detect faults and decompose signals at various levels, while the fuzzy logic algorithm is applied to classify the fault severity. This study&#39;s novelty lies in evaluating fault severity for no/low-load conditions by using the energy approximation obtained from the discrete wavelet transforms of the speed regulator&#39;s output signal. This approximation is then used as input for the fuzzy fault classification algorithm. The control algorithm and fault diagnosis are validated experimentally using MATLAB/Simulink with a real-time interface based on dSpace 1104 implementation. The results obtained from this procedure demonstrate successful fault detection and severity classification using both the discrete wavelet approximation and its energy eigenvalue.},

However, this paper studies and establishes the optimal model for numerical solution of differential equations through deep learning and genetic algorithm. In this paper, the solution of ordinary differential equations is solved through the use of polynomial function space, while the linear combination of simple function x and its product nx can obtain multinomial function space. The space function form of polynomial is very simple, and the operation ability is very strong. Almost all functions can be approximated, and the function space can be transformed by a simple function. Through data simulation test results, it can be found that the oscillation of neural network output is stronger and stronger with the increase in depth, that is to say, the deeper depth endows the neural network with stronger oscillation properties, so for the oscillation function, the depth neural network fitting effect is better than the shallow neural network. Therefore, by combining deep learning and genetic algorithm, this paper studies and establishes the optimal model for numerical solution of differential equations, and finds that the deep neural network can largely complete data simulation.},

The expansion of each theory is based on the collection of practical experience and the development of science and technology, which also brings demand and space for the research of interactive enterprise financial system. This paper uses heterogeneous cellular network to provide technical support for the construction of interactive financial system, proposes an algorithm to use small base stations in traditional macro cellular network, and plans the status of base stations according to various traffic patterns. Under the premise of ensuring the quality of service, the number of small base stations can be effectively reduced, and the status of base stations can dynamically adapt to the changes of spatial traffic. With the support of heterogeneous cellular network, interactive enterprise financial system can be built on the basis of more complete and comprehensive information. The final simulation results show that the method can effectively reduce the cost of providing heterogeneous cellular network while maintaining the quality of service and improve the user and energy efficiency of interactive enterprise financial system. Heterogeneous cellular network provides a new insight for the design of interactive enterprise financial system, which helps enterprises improve the efficiency of processing financial transactions and maintain the financial security of enterprises.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the multidimensional visualization technology continues to accelerate, resulting in a huge amount of data, higher requirements for related technologies, and more opportunities. Under the background of big data technology application, multidimensional visualization methods can shine in different fields, such as applying them to linguistic research. Although the technology has a wide range of applications, it cannot effectively and intuitively display multidimensional voice feature data, which is difficult to fully meet the requirements of parameter visualization. In order to deeply study linguistic speech recognition and other issues, this paper introduces speech recognition technology to complete the creation and improvement of a multidimensional perspective analysis system for speech data and uses socket mechanism to complete the server construction, including voice recognition, data enhancement, model training and other modules. This system takes the target voice data collection as the calling end. Thus, based on socket connection, data interaction with the server can meet the task requirements of the multidimensional perspective analysis system and can achieve two-way data interaction. The simulation experiment results show that the system based on OpenSMILE toolbox can effectively obtain high-dimensional features, and its performance is excellent, which can meet most of the task requirements. It contains many kinds of acoustic feature data, which can solve the problem of over compression of the original signal, and mine the characteristics of voice waves to explain the relationship between frames. The system is higher than low-dimensional features in recognizing multiple speakers. This paper designs an effective simulation system by applying speech recognition technology to multidimensional linguistic data analysis in the context of big data.},

  abstract     = {In the face of the impact of the New Coronary Pneumonia epidemic, Schools need to actively engage in online teaching in response to the Ministry of Education’s call for “uninterrupted teaching”. Ideological and political education is an important way to train socialist successors and is the basis for establishing students’ correct outlook on life, values and the world outlook. Therefore, in this paper, sparse neural network algorithm is introduced to complete the construction of ideological and political online education platform for colleges and universities. Through the design of simulation experiments, we can know that the sparse model can still maintain the stability and accuracy of the network under the condition of black box attacks, and even after a certain amount of tailoring, it can still exceed the accuracy of the original network. The experimental results show the superiority of this platform. In this paper, the platform system is roughly divided into three layers: user layer, data storage layer and functional logic layer. The evaluation is carried out from four dimensions: teaching resources, teaching activities, teacher–student interaction and teacher–student evaluation. According to the results, students have higher systematic evaluation than teachers. Among them, the recognition of teaching resources and activities is high, which proves that the platform in this paper is effective. The online teaching platform designed in this paper can make full use of the characteristics of network technology, realizes the reform and innovation development path of the ideological course in schools, and enhances the attraction of the political course and the enthusiasm of students to learn. This paper designs a kind of network education system by introducing sparse neural network into ideological online education.},

Health care data collection using machine learning techniques can lead to privacy issues which cause disturbances among the parties and reduces the possibility to work with either of the parties. Since centralized way of information transfer between two parties can be limited and risky as they are connected using machine learning, this factor motivated us to use the decentralized way where there is no connection but model transfer between both parties will be in process through a federated way. The purpose of this research is to investigate a model transfer between a user and the client(s) in an organization using federated learning techniques and reward the client(s) for their efforts with tokens accordingly using blockchain technology. In this research, the user shares a model to organizations that are willing to volunteer their service to provide help to the user. The model is trained and transferred among the user and the clients in the organizations in a privacy preserving way. In this research, we found that the process of model transfer between user and the volunteered organizations works completely fine with the help of federated learning techniques and the client(s) is/are rewarded with tokens for their efforts. We used the COVID-19 dataset to test the federation process, which yielded individual results of 88\% for contributor a, 85\% for contributor b, and 74\% for contributor c. When using the FedAvg algorithm, we were able to achieve a total accuracy of 82\%.},

A brain tumor with a high grade type instance is extremely hazardous and lethal. The traditional method for locating tumors in brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) pictures relies on human skill. An effective and trustworthy model for cancer tumor detection and classification will revolutionize the medical industry because people are fallible. In this study, a paradigm for identifying and categorizing tumors visible in brain MRI scans is put forth. The object detection algorithm YOLO-v3 is employed for detection. The third iteration of YOLO, YOLOv3 (you look only once), detects the target topic in a single pass and provides a confidence score. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the identified tumor is then divided into two classifications based on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) grading system, low-grade and high-grade glioma. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and the classification accuracies and results are compared with other state-of-the-art models. The proposed method using CNN and YOLOv3 has more potential to classify the brain tumor by achieving an overall accuracy of 97\%.},

  abstract     = {Effective disease diagnosis is a significant unmet need on a global scale. The development of a model for early diagnosis and efficient treatment faces enormous hurdles due to the complexity of the many disease mechanisms and underlying symptoms of the patient population. In recent times, various ensemble-based ML models are assisting doctors with early diagnosis. But one of the biggest challenges for these models is the learning selection of diversity-based classifiers to enhance the model’s performance. Many researchers are attempted to improve classification accuracy with ensemble learning approaches but they failed. To improve the disease diagnosis performance in this study, a novel diversity-based evolutionary ensemble framework with a genetic algorithm is proposed. To improve the predictive performance we have used four diversity-based classifiers such as K-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, logistic regression, and decision tree using the bootstrapped approach to generate 20 diverse base learners with five bootstrapped bags using fivefold cross-validation. And also to improve the predictive performance, we have proposed a novel fitness function. To test the robustness, the model was run 20 times, and the average performance and average ensemble complexity of the proposed model were computed. Finally, our proposed model tested with four bench-mark disease datasets such as Pima Indian Diabetes (PID), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Statlog Heart Data (SHD), and Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC). These results are compared with state-of-the-art ensemble models and non-ensemble models. Results demonstrated that in comparison with ensemble models, the proposed model performance is superior in terms of accuracy, AUC, and specificity on PID, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on CKD, accuracy, AUC, specificity on SHD, and accuracy, AUC, and specificity on WBC. In comparison with non-ensemble models, the proposed model performance is best in terms of accuracy, precision on PID, accuracy, AUC, precision and F1-score on CKD, accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, precision, and F1-score on SHD and accuracy, AUC on WBC.},

  abstract     = {At a worldwide scale, artificial intelligence (AI) is now an intrinsic part of various sectors and a significant strategic element in the business agendas of several industries including health care, finance and retail. Machine learning, an statistical paradigm of AI, is one of the most preferred technologies to achieve AI. Machine learning-oriented approaches exploit massive sized, unstructured and complicated dataset instances to learn from previous experiences and find insightful patterns. A range of statistical, probabilistic and optimization approaches are used to achieve this task. Early detection of chronic diseases is critical in the realm of biomedical research and healthcare communities, where it is pivotal to primarily diagnose the particular disease at probabilistically early stage in order to lower the death rate. Pneumonia mainly affects a huge number of people, particularly children and adults, in the developing and undeveloped nations that are characterized as overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, malnutrition, lack of suitable medical services and other risk factors. It is critical to detect pneumonia at its early stage in order to properly treat the infection. This paper presents an approach, i.e. DPUD (Disease Prediction for Unstructured Data). The proposed framework consists of an statistically novel and fine-tuned algorithmic procedure to address certain pain points of categorization problem such as selection of an optimal set of model hyperparameters and attain an improved statistical performance metrics with multichannel shared activation function and cost function. In experimental evaluation, our approach capitulates state-of-the-art computational achievement on Chest X-Ray Images for the Pneumonia Classification dataset, while being considerably much faster at specifically test time. The methodology presented in this chapter has an empirical scope for societal improvement, modernization and progress.},

  abstract     = {A novel multi-layer multi-spiking neural network (MMSNN) model sends information from one neuron to the next through multiple synapses in different spikes. When a suitable training method is unavailable, there are numerous complications in training spike neural networks. The convergence rate is slow when gradient descent algorithms are trained on multi-spike neural networks. Meanwhile, the spiking network is likely to perform poorly in classifying electroencephalographic (EEG) datasets due to its high propensity to fall within the local minima. With the help of a 16-channel electrode, the Concealed Information Test created the EEG dataset. The Mini Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (MBSGD) built the batch size and cut the number of iterations to speed up the convergence rate. It can, however, avoid the problem of moving into the local minimum more effectively. This paper describes an MBSGD algorithm for MMSNN model training that addresses local minima and convergence rate issues. This paper presents an MBSGD-MMSNN model for classifying EEG data. The MBSGD algorithm adjusts the weight parameters of the MMSNN model based on the batch size until the error is less than the required value. As a result, we achieve a faster convergence rate and avoid issues with local minima. The performance of the proposed MBSGD-MMSNN model is compared to that of existing meta-heuristic algorithms. The proposed MBSGD-MMSNN model outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms regarding the accuracy and learning performance.},

  abstract     = {In today’s generation, many healthcare organizations moving towards patient-centred quality assessment, transparency strategies, and practices. Therefore, online reviews are the part of everyday life and millions of online reviews being generated daily; unfortunately, all online reviews are not genuine do happen negative reviews written by malicious users are everywhere on the social media platform such as Google, Yelp, Facebook, TripAdvisor, Amazon, Healthgrades, etc. Every fake, spam, and negative online review can directly impact a potential customer’s purchasing decision, company’s reputation, profitability and misleading the consumers, and damage the reputation of review websites. Hence, detecting fake online reviews has become a big challenge in the rapid development of e-commerce but it can be more dangerous when it comes to medical products, e-healthcare platforms to classify online reviews correctly due to the high false-positive rate (FPR) and the false-negative rate (FNR). In the medical environment, trust is the best reason to pursue transparency and deserve their confidence then patients have made online reviews an integral part of their decision-making process. Patient online reviews and ratings can be a good indicator of clinical effectiveness, efficiently control their health and patient safety. Researchers performed various investigations to predict fake online reviews, and their models could have provided low prediction accuracy due to the selection of lesser features and lack of essential prediction labels. To handle this issue, this paper presents an efficient approach to specifically predict fake online reviews with multiple feature analyses in an automated way with different perspectives of patient safety using qualitative methods. The primary aim of this paper is to provide a solid and complete comparative study of present research on detecting fake online reviews designed a deep learning index system to examine multiple features such as sentiment, test, and behaviour features of the online reviewers. The input samples are trained with the novel dense network model to extract essential features. And the labels are provided tentatively, and the model adopts some initial samples to train the proposed classifier model as the model intends to give better accuracy. The model’s novelty relies on the feature selection and label classification of reviews. The experimental results indicated that fake review detection yields better accuracy of 99.5\% on the anticipated model than other baseline approaches across the Amazon and medical datasets, using deep learning techniques to reduce the FPR, and FNR then improves fake review detection capabilities. The proposed model significantly improved the classifier’s performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques in the Amazon and medical domains, demonstrating the effectiveness and relevance of the method.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer is a leading deadly form of the illness that is the cause of one million deaths around the world every year. Identification of lung nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) scans has become an extremely necessary procedure in modern medicine as a result of the present state of things in the field of medicine. This occurs as a result of the fact that lung cancer does not display symptoms until it has progressed. Early detection and precise diagnosis of suspected malignant lung nodules will improve therapy and lower lung cancer mortality. This paper proposes a transfer learning-based approach to classify lung CT images and detect the cancer. The input images are first sent to the pre-trained hybrid model consisting of AlexNet, VGG and GoogleNet. The model extracts features from the images, and these features are sent to the multi-class support vector machine (SVM) for classification. As in any deep learning model, the data are first trained and then tested on real-time images. The training of the model is done with the help of IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset which contains 1190 images belonging to three categories, normal, benign and malignant. The data are divided into different ratios while training and validation stages to test the efficiency of the proposed model. The proposed model obtained a superior accuracy of 97\% which is much higher than the existing models.},

To improve the performance of the system, first we have tried to select the optimal subset of the EEG channels using binary particle swarm optimization and secondly performed support vector machine hyper-parameter optimization using continuous version of PSO. The proposed model is validated using EEG dataset. The performance of the proposed system has resulted in increase of accuracy from 76.98 to 96.45\% which is a significant improvement. Also, the proposed approach outperformed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and G-measure when compared with state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the world has encountered many epidemic impacts caused by various viruses, COVID-19 has spread and mutated globally since its outbreak in 2019, causing global impact. Nucleic acid detection is an important means for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Aiming at people who are susceptible to sudden and infectious diseases, considering the control of viral nucleic acid detection cost and completion time, a probabilistic group test optimization method based on the cost and time value is proposed. Firstly, different cost functions to express the pooling and testing costs are used, a probability group test optimization model that considers the pooling and testing costs is established, the optimal combination number of samples for nucleic acid testing is obtained, and the positive probability and the cost functions of the group testing on the optimization result are explored. Secondly, considering the impact of the detection completion time on epidemic control, the sampling ability and detection ability were incorporated into the optimization objective function, then a probability group testing optimization model based on time value is established. Finally, taking COVID-19 nucleic acid detection as an example, the applicability of the model is verified, and the Pareto optimal curve under the minimum cost and shortest detection completion time is obtained. The results show that under normal circumstances, the optimal combination number of samples for nucleic acid detection is about 10. Generally, 10 is used to calculate for the convenience of organization, arrangement and statistics, except for cases where there are special requirements for testing cost and detection completion time.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is very valuable since it directly affects the amount of agricultural water needed, the allocation of water consumption and the management of irrigation systems. This research consists of two parts; in the first part, ET0 was predicted by two machine learning models (artificial neural network (ANN)) and tree model (MT) with two empirical equations (Romanenko and Schendel). In the second part, a new preprocessing algorithm, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), was used to improve the prediction accuracy of the MT model and eliminate time-series noises. This approach was applied to several study areas in northwest of Iran including Urmia, Mahabad, Khoy, Takab, and Sardasht stations so that daily reference evapotranspiration values were calculated based on FAO-Penman equation. The parameters of average temperature, average relative humidity, average vapor pressure and average wind speed were input parameters to the models. The results of the first part showed that the performance of MT (with RMSE: 0.58 mm/day, RSD: 0.18, NSE: 0.97) has better performance than the ANN model (with RMSE: 0.70 mm/day, RSD: 0.22, NSE: 0.95). In Urmia station, EEMD–MT enhanced the MT model about 19\% reduction in RMSE. Among the investigated models, the EEMD–MT model had the highest ET0 prediction accuracy in all investigated stations. The results of the machine learning models showed a better performance than the empirical used equations. This research showed that using the new EEMD processing algorithm can improve the accuracy of hydrological forecasts and time series.},

  abstract     = {In computer vision applications, visual object tracking is a complex task in which object appearances change in the presence of illumination variation, occlusion, in-plane rotation, and fast motion. In the state-of-the-art approaches, trackers deal with the common model to address appearance variations with coexisting challenges. However, this approach is ineffective when dealing with simultaneous challenges because the object’s features differ due to the appearance variations. To alleviate these limitations, in this paper, a visual object tracking framework that relies on an object appearance feature update is proposed. The appearance tracking model was developed using templated spatial information and object features. The tracked object template is identified by comparing the tracked template from the previous frame with the directional templates in the current frame. To adapt to appearance variations, the proposed tracking model updates the tracked template feature vector, the motion parameters, and the spatial information as it tracks the target object in successive frames. The experimental results on challenging video sequences in object tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed tracking model can track objects with a precision of 84.5\% at a 10.1 fps tracking speed. The qualitative analysis shows that the proposed tracking model outperforms the related conventional trackers.},

Hence, this paper proposes an accurate deep learning-based pipeline to solve the problem of limited data sets on farms and reduce the partiality due to serious class imbalance. Firstly, an improved cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN) is used to generate synthetic samples to improve the learning of data distribution and solve the problems of small data sets and class imbalance. Secondly, ResNet is trained as a baseline convolutional neural network classifier to classify apple leaf diseases. The experimental results show that ResNet has the highest recognition accuracy on the test set, reaching 97.78\%, and the classification accuracy is significantly improved by the generated synthetic samples (+ 14.7\%). In addition, the experiment results of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and visual Turing test visually confirmed that the images generated by improved CycleGAN have much better quality and are more convincing.},

This paper presents the first application of firefly algorithm (FA) and its modifications and hybridisations for solving real-world course timetabling problem. A novel bi-objective firefly algorithm (BOFA) with Pareto dominance approach was developed for optimising the operating costs and resource utilisation. Random key technique was applied for adapting the continuous firefly movement to solve discrete timetabling problem. Five constructive heuristics were additionally embedded into the BOFA for initialising feasible timetables. Computational experiments were sequentially conducted using eleven problem instances obtained from a collaborating university. It was found that the proposed hybridisation outperformed particle swarm optimisation, the classical FA, and modified FA (MFA), in terms of the quality of the timetables obtained, computational times and convergent speed. The proposed hybrid bi-objective FA (HBOFA) yielded better Pareto frontiers than the conventional BOFA with less computational times for all problem instances.},

  abstract     = {It is a challenging task to develop appropriate realistic production inventory models due to the presence of imprecision in the data available in the current market situation. In addition, increasing environmental concerns around the world have led to a shift toward green products. There are subsidy programs implemented by governments in several countries for green products. In a real-life production system, the various inventory cost and carbon emission parameters are imprecise in nature. Interval number theory is an efficient tool for handling such impreciseness. This study investigates the effects of a simultaneous investment in greening innovation (GI) and emission reduction technologies (ERTs) in a green production inventory model where the various inventory cost components and the carbon emission parameters are interval-valued. Using the cap-and-trade carbon regulation policy, the optimal inventory decision is investigated based on a price and greenness level sensitive demand. Two models are developed depending on whether the manufacturer wishes or not to invest in ERTs. Both models consider the chances of imperfect production and their reworking process. The resulting interval optimization problems are solved using the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization technique to derive the interval-valued optimum profit. Numerical illustrations for both models are presented. Several managerial insights are identified through a sensitivity analysis over the optimal solution regarding the main inventory parameters. The result shows that the greenness level of the product increases with the intensity of the subsidy offered by the government. Again, it is found that the manufacturing company of the green product as well as our environment benefit from joint investment in GI and ERT.},

The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis of the USE Questionnaire enabled the study to identify the top three questions per criteria. These were converted into sub-heuristics along with the tips provided via Nielsen’s updated heuristics (2020), forming a total of 42 sub-heuristics. After the sub-heuristics were established, the research conducted AHP pairwise comparisons of the main heuristics to extract priority based rankings that will guide evaluators regarding which heuristics require more attention. The results validate the purpose of this usability heuristic evaluation, since the experts identified more problems than they did with Nielsen’s heuristics proving a higher level of effectiveness.},

The proposed optimizer is considered an enhanced version of the original INFO algorithm. By balancing the exploration and exploitation phases better, the EINFO algorithm is intended to improve the performance of the original INFO approach and prevent local optima. The new method was tested on 23 benchmark functions and compared to the original INFO algorithm as well as other recently evolved optimizers. The algorithm is examined and compared with some literature meta-heuristics, including the particle swarm optimization, sine cosine algorithm, dragonfly algorithm, atom search optimization, Harris hawks optimization, and efficient optimization algorithm, using 50 independent runs, in terms of convergence speed and least SSE. When compared to other methods, the final findings show that, the suggested technique achieves the fastest convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {The implementation of mobile edge computing (MEC) and software-defined networking (SDN) over sixth-generation networks is a driving force in the future of cloud computing. It holds significant promise in addressing smart device (SD) resources and battery life limitations. To deal with the variety and resource constraints of SDs while making better use of network infrastructure, collaborative offloading has emerged as a viable technique for improving the ability to schedule independent tasks while alleviating the burden of restricted computation resources and network congestion. Network congestion is a common issue when a network node or link carries more data than it can manage. Existing works frequently overlook the impact of insufficient edge server capacity and network congestion. This paper primarily focuses on an SDN-powered MEC network that utilizes a full offloading policy, which completely offloads all tasks from the SD to the edge server and adopts a collaborative offloading of the MEC network when it is overloaded. The problem also takes into consideration when and to whom to offload the task. To bridge this gap, we first implement a collaborative offloading scheme among MEC servers based on the edge server&#39;s resources and neighbors&#39; status to alleviate network congestion. It takes advantage of the computing capacities of edge servers deployed at the network&#39;s edge and the SDN controller&#39;s global view of the entire network. Then we devise a Deep Q-Network methodology to achieve near-optimal performance, and minimize the total execution time concerning deadline constraints. The experiments reveal that our proposed task scheduling of collaborative computation offloading algorithm can significantly minimize the total execution time more than the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Almost all evolutionary algorithms suffer from the problem of premature convergence and stagnation in local optima. An approach based on an evolutionary algorithm is presented in this work with different mutation schemes to address these issues. The mutation process used is an adaptive one which utilizes fitness variance and space aggregation concept. The mutation used in the technique is wavelet mutation, Levy flight, particle swarm optimization-based mutation, Chaotic, and non-uniform mutation. Levy flight is a random walk process which determines the step size based on Levy distribution, whereas chaotic and non-uniform mutation is based on logistic map and Gaussian distribution, respectively. In the wavelet mutation, Morlet wavelet is used as a mutation operator. The experimentation is carried out with each mutation strategy, and the results are obtained in terms of standard deviation and average. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed work is tested by performing a statistical analysis named Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test. The results from each mutation are compared with each other, and the results from the best mutation method are further compared with other optimization techniques. Moreover, the best strategy, i.e. DDMPEA with the chaotic mutation, is applied to the area coverage optimization problem of WSN.},

  abstract     = {For a stable system frequency without any problems, the generation and demand equation must always be balanced. But the difficulty of precisely predicting the changes in the load is a big problem. Here comes the responsibility of the load frequency control (LFC) loop to maintain the equality between supply and demand. The LFC loop’s performance depends on the control technique or controller used. In our work, we propose a new cascade controller PD-P-PID that is applied in LFC applications for the first time. To obtain the optimum settings of our cascade controller, we used an optimization method called the marine predators algorithm (MPA). To verify the robustness of our controller, it was tested on three different systems: a single-area multi-source power system, a two-area multi-source power system with AC–DC tie-lines, and a three-area hydro-thermal power system with the generation rate constraints and Governor dead band taken into account for a more practical study. The obtained results are compared with many published works based on objective function integral time absolute error, settling time Ts, and overshoot/undershoot of frequency and tie-line power deviation. MPA-tuned PID-PD controllers offer superior performance to other literature as it gives a dynamic response with a shorter settling time and fewer frequency and tie-line power deviation oscillations when step loads are perturbed.},

Fractional calculus is the generalized part of ordinary calculus. The memory of physical phenomena is a highly concerning topic but it is neglected with describing in terms of integer-order differential equation. To discuss the memory of the inventory model, fractional derivative tools are considered. A fractional derivative at any point gives the previous marginal output and current point output for any current point input. In this model, a shortage is considered, and during the shortage period, demand is partially backlogged. Depending on the low partial backlogging rate and high partial backlogging rate, the result of the memory effect varies on the total average cost and optimal ordering interval. Moreover, in order to show the relationship between fractional models and ordinary classical model, two types of memory indices have been considered: (i) differential memory index and (ii) integral memory index. For a certain memory effect, minimized total average cost is the same for low partial backlogging rate and high partial backlogging rate.},

Although the disease is preventable, there are still concerns about its continued spread. Without effective prevention or appropriate treatment, TB infection can be fatal to humans. This paper presents a fractional-order TB disease (FTBD) model to analyze TB dynamics and a new optimization method to solve it. The method is based on the basis functions of generalized Laguerre polynomials (GLPs) and some new operational matrices of derivatives in the Caputo sense. Finding the optimal solution to the FTBD model is reduced to solving a system of nonlinear algebraic equations with the aid of GLPs using the Lagrange multipliers method. A numerical simulation is also carried out to determine the impact of the presented method on the susceptible, exposed, infected without treatment, infected with treatment, and recovered cases in the population.},

Although there are number of physics based optimization techniques available to solve the optimization problems, however, they suffer from their complexity and may require multiple runs to achieve the optimum value. This paper focuses on a simple physics based problem which outperforms few of the existing algorithms. This work investigates the physics-based Lens formula integration using a population-based approach. The contender for a population-level solution to picture obstructions created by a convex, concave, or combination of the two lenses is the item with multiple dimensional locations. The object’s location is updated using the image position. The fundamental goals of population-based optimization algorithms are highlighted by the concave, convex, or combination of both lenses, which enhances the speed of exploration, exploitation, and local optimum avoidance of the search space. The focal length equation, controls how the object’s picture is produced, may be altered by specifying a number of random and adaptive factors to highlight the exploitation and exploration of the search space. The capacity of the proposed algorithm for exploitation, exploration, utilisation of the search space, avoidance of local minima, and attainment of global maxima is validated using unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions. In addition, a variety of real-world engineering issues taken into account to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The observations compared with few fundamental optimization techniques of the same category and found the proposed solution better performing in some context than the existing ones.},

  abstract     = {When deep learning models are used to predict the probability distribution of future values, a task called probabilistic forecasting, they need to handle the epistemic and the aleatoric uncertainties. For the former, some are based on Monte Carlo dropout and have focused on prediction interval estimation assuming a normal distribution for the aleatoric uncertainty, without looking into general probabilistic forecasting tasks such as quantile regression or scenario generation. Time series in practice are usually not normally distributed, usually having a non-symmetrical distribution. So, these models need to be adapted with pre- and post-processing ad-hoc transformations to recover a normal distribution. We propose a supervised deep model based on Monte Carlo dropout that handles both sources of uncertainty and can be applied for multi-step probabilistic forecasting, including prediction interval estimation, quantile regression, and scenario generation. For the aleatoric uncertainty, our model allows changing the normality assumption easily to other families of distributions with the same number of parameters, such as Gamma, Weibull, and log-normal. For multi-step prediction, we use a procedure of re-injection of intermediate samples. To validate our proposal, we examine the behavior of the model on wind speed, wind power and electrical load forecasting, important tasks for the energy sector, as electrical grids present more uncertainty due to the penetration of variable renewable sources. We show that generating scenarios with our recurrent approach works better than directly estimating the distribution of all future values, also that considering the epistemic uncertainty makes the model more robust, and that changing the output distribution of the model is a property that may improve the metrics for specific datasets.},

Furthermore, evolutionary computing (EC), as an optimization tool based on the biological evolution mechanism, has good performance on complex optimization problems. It provides a new way to construct DL models and has generated many sparks in the DL field, especially in automatic machine learning (AutoML). Although many reviews have been conducted on AutoML, in recent years, few comprehensive works have studied on the application of EC in DL, which is called evolutionary deep learning (EDL). After a thorough investigation, we think that EDL can be divided into four parts: (1) learning rule optimization, (2) hyperparameter optimization, (3) neural architecture search, and (4) other EDL-related works. In this work, we introduce the classic optimization methods and the challenges of EDL with respect to these four parts, review the related work, and then present the future research prospects. This work clearly and comprehensively reviews the concept and research content of EDL, which can help readers quickly find the intersection between EC and DL and seek their inspiration.},

Even though the number of cutting-edge neural network-based frameworks for object detection models and pedestrian detection in images has steadily increased, object detection and image classification have made progress in terms of accuracy levels greater than 99\% and level of granularity. A powerful object detector, specifically designed for high-end surveillance applications, is needed to position the bounding box, label it and return its relative positions. The size of these bounding boxes can vary depending on the object and its interaction with the physical world. To overcome these limitations and requirements, an extensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art algorithms has been presented in this paper. The work presented in this paper performs object detections on the MOT20 dataset using various algorithms and testing on a custom dataset recorded in our organization premises using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The main contribution of the paper is to tune the hyperparameters of the Yolov5 object detection algorithm to develop a new efficient, simple, and reliable object detector in Surveillance. The modified Yolov5 model outperforms the existing Faster-RCNN, SSD, and YOLO algorithms, according to real-world data experiments, and ensures better object detection with a 61\% precision and 44\% F measure value.},

  abstract     = {The literature approaches, devoted to sensor improve network coverage, are deterministic in terms of deployment environment and node configuration parameters. Nevertheless, this type of approaches has not proven to be very successful in uncertain deployment environments. This paper aims to deal with this issue using theories of uncertainty. We consider deployment environment’s imperfections and the characteristics of the sensor nodes. The selection of a minimum number of nodes for a minimum number of clusters to guarantee coverage in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is uncertain. As a consequence, this paper proposes a hybrid Fuzzy-Possibilistic model to Schedule the Active/Passive State of Sensor nodes Strategy (FP-3SNS). This model helps to plan the scheduling of node states (Active/Passive) based on possibilistic information fusion to make a possibilistic decision for the node activation at each period. We evaluated our model (FP-3SNS) with (a) a running example (that shows the best choice of the active node with a probability of 0.81215); (b) a statistical evaluation (calculation of the confidence interface), where the average coverage reliability at 95\% of FP-3SNS use is between (92.94, 96.27); and (c) a comparison with maximum sensing coverage region problem (MSCR), coverage maximization with sleep scheduling (CMSS), Spider Canvas Strategy, Semi-Random Deployment Strategy (SRDP), Probing Environment and Adaptive Sleeping with Location Information Protocol (PEAS-LI), and Variable Length Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with a Weighted Sum Fitness Function (WS-VLPSO). The simulation results highlight the benefits of using the fuzzy and possibility theories for treating the area coverage problem and the proposed model maintained a coverage between 99.99 and 90.00\% for a significant period of time.},

  abstract     = {Accurate assessment of road conditions can effectively alleviate traffic congestion and guide people’s travel plans, traffic control decisions of transportation departments, and formulation of traffic-related laws and regulations. This paper proposes a quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and adaptive hybrid exponential smoothing with residual correction (AHES-RC) for the nonlinearity and randomness of traffic flow. In the proposed algorithm, the single–double-exponential smoothing method is mixed with adaptive weights to form AHES, a new method of mixing weights according to real-time traffic trend changes. After the residual correction of AHES is calculated by the extreme learning machine algorithm, the parameters of AHES-RC are optimized using QPSO to improve the prediction accuracy further. This paper comprehensively compares the QPSO-AHES-RC algorithm with other benchmark models through testing on 26 real-world data sets. The results show that the proposed algorithm can adaptive forecasting under various traffic conditions, yielding the best forecasting performance in terms of various forecast error metrics. Compared with advanced machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and CatBoost, the mean RMSE and mean MAPE have been improved by over 20\% on average. In addition, it is revealed that the real-time dynamic capture of traffic flow can effectively improve prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous depletion of global fossil energy, optimizing the energy structure has become the focus of attention of all countries. With the support of policy and finance, renewable energy occupies an important position in the energy structure of the USA. Being able to predict the trend of renewable energy consumption in advance plays a vital role in economic development and policymaking. Aiming at the small and changeable annual data of renewable energy consumption in the USA, a fractional delay discrete model of variable weight buffer operator based on grey wolf optimizer is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the variable weight buffer operator method is used to preprocess the data, and then, a new model is constructed by using the discrete modeling method and the concept of fractional delay term. The parameter estimation and time response formula of the new model are deduced, and it is proved that the new model combined with the variable weight buffer operator satisfies the new information priority principle of the final modeling data. The grey wolf optimizer is used to optimize the order of the new model and the weight of the variable weight buffer operator. Based on the renewable energy consumption data of solar energy, total biomass energy and wind energy in the field of renewable energy, the grey prediction model is established. The results show that the model has better prediction accuracy, adaptability and stability than the other five models mentioned in this paper. According to the forecast results, the consumption of solar and wind energy in the USA will increase incrementally in the coming years, while the consumption of biomass will decrease year by year.},

  abstract     = {The finite element method (FEM) is a widely used technique to solve partial differential equations and can thus be applied to describe different physical phenomena. Preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) is often employed to solve FEM-generated systems of linear equations. The parallelization of PCG algorithms has been contemplated by several works in the literature. In this work, a massive parallel incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient (ICCG) algorithm for a graphics processing unit (GPU) is proposed. The method is particularly suited for Monte Carlo-based solutions to inverse problems. The solution adopted uses the cpJDS sparse matrix format to circumvent the difficulty in parallelizing the triangular solver by incorporating a coloring scheme. The cpJDS-based ICCG introduces a large number of synchronization points, adding a performance overhead, and its poor effects are minimized using a full kernel consolidation. Tests executed on a wide assortment of sparse matrices, with varying structures, showed that the proposed solution performs better that the CPU CG implementation for cases with medium-to-large matrices, achieving speed-ups of up to 60x.},

  abstract     = {The identification of a central node in a network is one of the important tasks of social networks. Nowadays, the central node helps grow online businesses, spread news, advertisements, etc. Existing methods for centrality measurement capture the direct reachability of the node. In social networks, parameters such as relationships among the nodes are generally uncertain. This uncertainty can be tracked using either probability theory or fuzzy theory. In this article, the fuzzy theory, particularly the neutrosophic fuzzy theory, is used because, in this concept, more information, such as true values, falsity and indeterminacy, is incorporated. Thus, the representation of social networks using neutrosophic graphs gives more information compared to fuzzy graphs. This study introduces a new form of centrality measurement using a neutrosophic graph. This measurement considers the different merits of individuals in a network. Individual merits (self-weight) have been included in the proposed method. A small network of university faculty members has been considered to illustrate the problem and to demonstrate the potential fields of application of this new method of centrality measurement.},

  abstract     = {Automated healthcare product classification is a challenging field of research that has recently gained a lot of interest. This process is beneficial in terms of time and cost but problematic in obtaining annotated data and lacks uniformity. The high volume of healthcare products and their categories raise the need for machine learning models that can decrease the time and cost spent by human editors. Deep learning techniques that have recently emerged are applied to automated healthcare data classification. The efficacy of the deep learning model depends on the training data and the learning model&#39;s suitability for the data domain. When the dataset is large, training a model requires potent processors, including GPUs, and might take hours. However, when such a large volume of data is unavailable, the Conventional Neural Network (CNN) does not train well for the lack of enough samples. To overcome this issue, an effective classification method is proposed to classify the products with a contemporary architecture that integrates the data selection, transformation, and filtering processes with the training of CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) with limited labeled data and has an imbalance among the classes. The efficiency of the hybrid LSTM approach is evaluated using ResNet, Google Net, and Alex Net. The models were trained using different hyperparameters and the accuracy of the network trained on this data and the accuracy of AlexNet is 94.38, GoogleNet is 94.82 and ResNet-50 is 95.37. Finally, the proposed approach demonstrates that using an efficient classifier at the end of the CNN structure delivers the desired performance even when the CNN model is not intensely trained.},

If successful, this would be an effective way for radiologists to circumvent the challenges they now encounter. The coloring of grayscale photos is a complex process that aims to improve the contrast of different sections of an image by changing grayscale images into color pictures with high levels of contrast. It is common for the predictions to be lacking in fine detail when simply a U-Net design is used; to assist alleviate this issue, cross or skip connections may be introduced between the blocks of the network. Instead of creating a skip connection every two convolutions as it now is in a ResBlock, the skip connections cross from a portion of the same size in the downsampling route to a part in the upsampling path.

  abstract     = {Oral cavity cancer (OCC) is one of the most common cancers, in which more than 500,000 new cases and 350,000 related deaths occur every year worldwide. It is necessary to develop technologies that are objective, cutting-edge, and enable early, precise diagnosis. A patient’s chances of surviving OCC are greatly increased when it is predicted in its early stages. In this work, a novel deep learning-based modified convolutional neural network (MCNN) for accurately detect and classify the normal, and abnormal cases of oral cavity. Initially, the images are gathered from Sheffield &amp; Piracicaba datasets and these images are pre-processed using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization which is used to reduce the noise from the input images. The proposed MCNN is improved version of convolutional neural network, in which the parameters of CNN are optimized with Stochastic gradient optimization algorithm to classify into normal and abnormal. The proposed MCNN is trained simultaneously using the initial dataset and the supplemented dataset. To train the MCNN, the source image size of the MCNN was used instead of resizing the complete images to fit the input file size of each pre-trained network. The effectiveness of the proposed MCNN is examined using several parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and F1 score. The experimental fallouts illustrate that the proposed MCNN achieves the overall accuracy of 97.96\%, which is comparatively high than the state-of-the art techniques in OCC detection.},

  abstract     = {The healthcare industry is a part of contemporary civilization that deals with a significant volume of confidential information. The integration of an increased number of digital systems in hospitals, laboratories, and outpatient examinations of patients, as well as the files that result from these examinations, has largely been responsible for the massive increase in the amount of information that is associated with patient care over the past few years. Electronic health record systems are a kind of medical management system that record a patient’s personal information in addition to their medical history. Consequently, the storage and protection of these data while it is held on the cloud is of the highest significance. In this work, an efficient data storage and protection system that is tailored to the internet of medical things is presented. The data, whether it is text or pictures, are compressed using a modified version of the lossless LZW compression algorithm, and then, they are stored locally before being sent to the cloud. After that, the data that were compressed are encrypted using the generated elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman key and the advance encryption standard. The suggested security strategy is a hybrid cryptography approach that incorporates both symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography in order to provide an increased level of protection for the system. Because it is not a complex system and uses less resources than other alternatives, the suggested solution is suitable for porting onto edge devices. When compared to the traditional technique, the time needed to generate a key was cut by a factor of 1e4, and the amount of time needed to encrypt data was cut by 20\%. The throughput of the model that was suggested improved by 87\%.},

  abstract     = {The human brain serves as the primary control centre for the humanoid system. Computer vision plays a vital part in the field of human health, which helps to reduce the amount of human judgement that is required to produce accurate findings. Scans using computed tomography, X-rays, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most popular imaging technologies used in MRI, and they could also the greatest trustworthy and safe. The MRI can identify even the most minute of objects. In this paper, Alzheimer’s disease detection in early stage, based on MRI by using the deep learning technique U-Net and EfficientNet which is a convolutional neural network, is implemented. Diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accurately is an vital aspect in treating AD patients, eventually during the early disease stages. This is particularly true in the early disease stages of the disease, when awareness of risk enables AD patients to take up protective measures well before the occurrence of brain damage that cannot be reversed. Despite of the fact that computers have been utilised in a significant number of recent research to diagnose AD, the majority of machine detection approaches are restricted by congenital findings. Early-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be identified, but early-stage AD cannot be predicted because prediction of the disease is successful only before the (AD) disease reveals itself. Deep learning, often known as DL, has recently emerged as a popular method for the initial recognition of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this article, we will give a quick overview of some of the key research that has been done on AD, and we will investigate how DL can assist researchers in the early phases of disease diagnosis.},

By using traditional applications, it is difficult to understand and analyze the transcriptomic profiles of cells at the single-cell level. So, to overcome these kinds of issues, machine learning technologies are playing a great role. In this paper, we analyzed single-cell RNA seq data by implementing linear dimensional reduction, identifying highly variable features, clustering the cells, nonlinear dimensional reduction, and identifying gene markers. This type of single-cell RNA sequencing analysis is much needed in identifying transcriptomic profile challenges in cells and heterogeneous characteristics.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an approach based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF) combined with singular value decomposition (SVD) was proposed to extract fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) from single-channel abdominal ECG recording. First, on the basis of dynamic model of maternal electrocardiogram established, the maternal ECG component was estimated from the single-channel abdominal signal by EKF or extended Kalman smoothing (EKS). Next, the preliminary estimation of fetal ECG was obtained by subtracting the maternal ECG component from the single-channel abdominal signal. To obtain the fetal ECG with high signal-to-noise ratio, the preliminary fetal ECG was denoised using SVD. In addition, an improved construction method of the ECG signal construction matrix was proposed in the SVD algorithm for the case of fetal arrhythmia. Synthetic abdominal signals and real abdominal signals (49 abdominal channels in total from DAISY database and PhysioNet noninvasive fetal ECG database) were used for fetal ECG extraction. The results showed that the signal-to-noise ratio of fetal ECG extracted by EKF + SVD or EKS + SVD was about 5 dB higher than that by EKF or EKS alone, and the accuracy of fetal ECG extraction was 95.60\% and 95.94\%, respectively. In conclusion, the signal-channel fetal ECG extraction method based on the combination of EKF and SVD could effectively improve the signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy of fetal ECG signals extraction, and would be suitable for maternal or fetal arrhythmia.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of multi-modal medical image fusion is to improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis; the fused image is produced by retaining the essential characteristics and precise details of the source images. In this paper, we proposed a weight-optimised anisotropic diffusion filtering (WOADF) method to merge computed tomography (CT) image and magnetic resonance (MRI) image. Diffusion of the intensities at the boundaries and detecting significantly meaningful edges in a medical image are two manifestations of an edge-preserving filter. WOADF is an effective method for realising these specifications within a scale space that consists of multiple dimensions. First, the CT and MRI images are decomposed into base layer and detail layer then weight map layers are created through image smoothing with an edge-preserving approach. And these weights are optimised by using the proposed WOADF. Lastly, by using the fusion rule, the optimized weight map layers and the fusion decision map are used to make a fused image. Compared to state-of-the-art standards, the proposed WOADF method outperforms them experimentally in terms of detail retention and visual effect.},

Therefore, the detachment of the retinal blood vessels is essential to the diagnosis of DR. If the diagnosis is made in the early stages, we can avoid vision loss or blindness issues. A 50\% reduction in the probability of vision loss would result from an early diagnosis and initial investigation. Basic preprocessing, segmentation of blood arteries utilizing primary curvatures (maximum) and the ISODATA algorithm with the aid of image processing techniques, and labeling of related components make up the suggested method in this study. This study made use of the DRIVE (digital retinal images for vessel extraction) and STARE (structured analysis of the retina) datasets. Performance metrics including accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity were chosen in order to show the effectiveness of the methodology.

Under this background, this paper introduces GIS data visualization technology to complete the expansion of VR technology and apply it to the Great Wall section protection research project. This paper has improved a kind of VR system, which can meet the needs of human–computer interaction and create virtual avatars to achieve two-way communication between human and VR experience environment.

The security is reflected in the degree of protection of private data. The simulation results show that the system can effectively reduce the magnitude of data after processing and compressing the data set, thus reducing the processing time. Compared with the original processing method, it can be seen that the system improves significantly. By traversing the original dataset, the array can be effectively drawn, which greatly reduces the system processing time and improves the efficiency.

At present, people’s demand for public building facilities is increasing, its shape evolution is becoming more complex, and the scientific and technological content of construction-related technology is also increasing. The development trend of green public buildings is more and more strong. The traditional building design cannot effectively deal with the energy consumption of public buildings and people’s demand for their performance. This paper introduces BIM and machine learning technology to study their practical application in the design of green public buildings and tests the perfect machine learning algorithm. According to the experimental test results, the building energy consumption decreased by 14.3\%, the carbon emission decreased by 11.39\%, and the absolute value of PMV thermal comfort decreased by 34.7\%, which obviously achieved the optimization effect. BIM technology parametric design can enable the design model formed by conceptual design research to automatically draw construction drawings, detailed drawings and other drawings according to the drawing requirements and standards, thus saving the designer&#39;s time and enabling him to transfer the drawing time to the program design. Finally, through experiments, the economy, rationality and operability of using BIM technology to design green public buildings are confirmed.

There are many problems such as incomplete system functions, confusion of drug management, unclear division of modules, loss and waste of human resources. At present, hospitals need a new and perfect hospital drug information management. Drug management is an indispensable part of the hospital management system. This paper completes the design of the target drug rapid retrieval system, which is realized multidimensional data analysis technology, and tests the multidimensional data analysis algorithm model used. The improved multidimensional data analysis algorithm greatly improves the accuracy. The design and improvement of the system can effectively improve the drug processing efficiency of existing pharmacies through the design and simulation experiments, enable the pharmacy department to better cooperate with other departments to work, make the cooperation between different departments more effective, and solve the work efficiency problems of the hospital. By introducing multidimensional data analysis technology into the field of drug information retrieval, this paper designs an effective and fast retrieval method.},

  abstract     = {Due to the possibility of equipment failure that leads to aberrant processes and resource loss, smart manufacturing and Internet of things (IoT) devices require the highest level of security and configuration for industrial automation systems, e.g., food sector. However, customizing active learning for each parameter value in the IoT-driven industrial environment is not easy due to the continually changing variables of industrial control machinery. Therefore, this paper focuses on neural network to improve the efficacy of fault diagnosis in food machinery and equipment by addressing poor generalization ability and low fault recognition rates. The paper presents a fault signal recognition method based on external correction and periodically correcting mechanical equipment’s fault features to extract signal features of equipment faults. Furthermore, an enhanced migration convolutional neural network is proposed for equipment fault diagnosis, establishing a convolutional neural network and two data classifiers to train fault data in the network source domain. The data classification loss and discriminant classifier functions minimize the feature distribution gap between the source and target domains. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively enhances mechanical equipment’s fault diagnosis and the safety of equipment operation to exhibit robust generalization ability.},

Firstly, for the DFONNs, the optimal sliding surface and SMC are constructed. Secondly, the sufficient condition for achieving GMPS is presented. Moreover, the error system’s reachability and stability are analyzed and proved, and the GMPS is realized well. At last, the trajectories of error system and GMPS of state variables for a three-dimensional example are simulated to verify the feasibility of synchronization theory analysis. Particularly, GMPS can be reduced to the complete synchronization, anti-synchronization, projective synchronization (PS) and modified PS.

  abstract     = {World Health Organization reports that cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death. Cardiovascular disease is responsible for around 31\% of global deaths, resulting in over 17.9 million deaths, making it a global health issue. Classifiers and common methods for encoding categorical data using machine learning have revealed a broad variety of surprising findings when used to identify cardiac disease based on small datasets from testing. To extract features without developing a comprehension of sequence information, the early research used convolutional neural networks (CNN)—a type of deep learning model. A deep learning-based system, particularly a CNN with bidirectional long/short-term memory, is proposed in this study in order to efficiently predict cardiovascular disease from patient data. Only the most applicable features were selected via feature selection, which was accomplished by prioritizing and picking features that were highly rated in the supplied disease dataset. After that, the CNN + BiLSTM-based hybrid deep learning technique was employed to predict cardiovascular illness. In contrast to past studies of a similar kind, the experimental outcomes of this hybrid deep learning technique were encouraging: 94.507\% accuracy,\% precision,\% recall, and an F1-score of 94\%.},

Compared with the existing literature, in this work we extend the passivity problem of CNNs from real field to quaternion field. In particular, the multiple coupling delays and discontinuous activation functions are considered, which have not been investigated in previous papers yet. By designing appropriate controllers and applying inequality technique, sufficient conditions are obtained correspondingly for three different types of fixed-time passivity of CQVNNs. Finally, simulations are given to substantiate the correctness of the theoretical results.},

Generally, accuracy-based fitness functions of metaheuristic algorithms are used for FS. In this work, eleven existing and six novel fitness functions are analyzed on eleven various datasets with a novel binary threshold Lévy flight distribution (BTLFD) algorithm.

As a result, pile foundations have gotten more research than any other type of foundation. Furthermore, estimating the lateral load capacity of a pile (LLCP) accurately is a difficult undertaking, and there has been relatively little study in this field. To overcome these problems, in this study, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was ustilized to construct forecasting models for the indirect assessment of LLCP embedded in clay in this work. The fuzzy c-means clustering technique (FCM) and the subtractive clustering method (SCM) were implemented as ANFIS models. The data from open-source literature were used to evaluate the two ANFIS models. In these models, pile length (L), pile diameter (D), undrained shear strength of soil (Su), and eccentricity of load (e) were used as the inputs, while the measured LLCP in clay was the output. To compare the performance of the estimating models, several statistical performance measures were used. The modeling results show that the relationships determined for estimating the LLCP in clay by ANFIS models (ANFIS-SCM and ANFIS-FCM) are accurate and close to the real value. It can also be concluded that the use of ANFIS models to predict the LLCP in clay is very efficient.},

Also, CS is a recent powerful algorithm, while it may consume a large number of function evaluations to get the optimal solution, and this is one of the disadvantages of this algorithm. MBOCS can circumvent the disadvantages of MBO and CS algorithms. In this work, we integrate MBO with CS to improve the quality of solutions to solve various optimization problems, namely unconstraint benchmark functions, nonlinear systems and clustering problems. We solve fifteen of CEC’15 benchmark functions and compare our results with various algorithms such as group search algorithm, harmony search, particle swarm optimization and other hybrid algorithms in the literature. Moreover, we apply MBOCS on ten known nonlinear systems and eight real-world data from UCI. The results of MBOCS were compared with other known algorithms in the literature.

Many scholars have established different time-dependent reliability models, but the model contains complex multiple integrals and is difficult to calculate. In this case, the current method for calculating time-dependent reliability is Monte Carlo method, which is inefficient and cannot meet the engineering needs. In order to solve the problem that time-dependent reliability is difficult to solve, this manuscript proposes a method for solving time-dependent reliability of bridges using neural networks, which is suitable for existing time-dependent reliability models.

Extraneous environmental factors coupled with structured and unstructured uncertainties have always posed concerns about the proposed algorithms’ effectiveness. This paper presents an improved control algorithm based on a robust adaptive neural network trained with integral sliding mode (NN-ISMC) with the capacity for state estimation and auxiliary control inputs. Additionally, the paper considers the contribution of active front steering (AFS) integrated with direct yaw moment control (DYC) to employ during critical driving scenarios. Moreover, a super-twisting ESO disturbance observer (STESO-DO) was developed to estimate disturbances imposed on the car during an emergency maneuver, such as double-lane change, in terms of successive strong gusts of crosswind. Additional uncertainties were introduced to the system to evaluate the algorithm’s robustness, such as the tire cornering stiffness and traveling speed. The performance of the designed framework was further assessed against two documented comparable methods in the literature using high-fidelity MATLAB/Simulink–CarSim co-simulations. The findings from various driving conditions and speeds indicate that the proposed controller successfully stabilizes the handling dynamics and thus enhances the path-tracking performance compared to the previously reported methods.},

This means that, available random data of a location problem may be unsatisfactory, therefore the fuzzy information must be integrate with the random data. This paper deals with the classical and inverse median location problems on uncertain networks in which the vertex weights are fuzzy random variables. We introduce the new criteria probability-possibility, probability-necessity and probability-credibility to convert the fuzzy random p-median location problem into a quadratic programming problem on uncertain networks. For this purpose, new formula are introduced for the possibility, necessity and credibility criteria that are used for converting fuzzy variables into deterministic variables. Also, the inverse 1-median location problem with the fuzzy random vertex weights is reformulated as the deterministic inverse 1-median location problem under the probability-possibility, the probability-necessity and the probability-credibility criteria. Finally, using these criteria, the linear time algorithms are presented for the inverse 1-median location problems on the uncertain tree networks.},

The initial population of IPSO is grouped by the k-means to form a multisubpopulation, which increases the intragroup learning mechanism of particles and effectively enhances the balance between the exploitation and exploration. The performance of IPSO is evaluated on six representative test functions and one engineering problem. In all experiments, IPSO is compared with PSO and one other state-of-the-art metaheuristics. The results are also analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The experimental results show that IPSO is very competitive and often better than other algorithms in the experiments.

We consider a variant of the HWPP in which (i) the precedence order of the edge hierarchies is linear and edges within each hierarchy are connected and (ii) the cost of serving each edge decreases with the number of times it is traversed, and we refer to it as HWPP with variable service costs. An integer non-heuristic linear mathematical formulation is proposed, and a solution approach is designed. Our solution heuristic adapts the layer algorithm of Dror et al. (Networks 17:283–294, 1987) but employs an integer mathematical formulation as a sub-procedure instead of the blossom algorithm to find the least cost path between the nodes of the graph. This choice is based on the fact that the blossom algorithm requires a symmetric cost structure while we deal here with the general case of asymmetric cost structure, which makes our problem a windy variant of the postman problem. It should be noted that our problem is not asymmetric in the sense that there are no opposite arcs with different costs but there are edges which have different costs depending on the traversal direction. In order to compare the performance of our heuristic algorithm with respect to the performance of the mathematical model that is solved by the commercial solver Gurobi, 84 test instances are generated having varying sizes and densities and with different number of hierarchies. These test instances are solved by both methods and the generated results show that the proposed heuristic method is much faster and generates better quality solutions.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) consists of several banks, which are shared resources among cores. Memory interference is caused by sharing with banks among cores, which results in overall system performance reduction. This will exacerbate the problem because shared libraries are commonly used in modern operating systems. The physical memories used by shared libraries are often distributed throughout all banks in DRAM, and shared library codes are regularly run. This will result in a large number of row-buffer conflicts and a decrease in system performance. This paper proposes a new shared library awareness and bank partitioning-based mechanism (SBM) that takes into account inter-thread interference caused by shared libraries and assigns allocated DRAM banks to specific cores rather than processes, thus taking advantage of bank-level parallelism (BLP) and improving system performance isolation. We conducted several experiments to assess the degree of performance isolation achieved by SBM. The findings indicate that SBM significantly enhanced performance isolation.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population-based swarm intelligence algorithm that falls under the category of nature-inspired algorithms and is similar to evolutionary computing in various ways. Rather than the survival of the fittest, the PSO is driven by a representation of a social psychological model inspired by the group behaviors of birds and other social species. The particle&#39;s position is modified in PSO based on its position as well as velocity, while in quantum mechanics, the trajectory idea is absurd; however, the uncertainty principle suggests that a particle&#39;s position, as well as velocity, cannot be determined simultaneously. As a result, an advanced version of the quantum mechanics-based PSO method is proposed. The study in this paper is focused on an investigation of a new quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO) method called Gaussian quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (GQPSO), which uses a mutation operator with a Gaussian distribution and is inspired by classical PSO methods and quantum mechanics concepts. In GQPSO, inadequate control parameter tuning results in poor solutions. To better understand the effect of different control parameters and their implications on GQPSO results, this paper used a full parametric sensitivity analysis on five different problems (the Design of a pressure vessel, Tension/Spring Compression, Rastrigin function, Ackley function, and Constrained Box Volume Problem). By adjusting each parameter one at a time, different optimization problems were used to investigate GQPSO. As a result, to allow particles to change their earliest best solution based on viability, a constraint-handling mechanism was developed. The optimal parameter set for GQPSO is provided based on the analysis of the results. With the help of the proposed optimal parameter set (contraction–expansion coefficient values as (1 = 1.6,2 = 1.3), swarm size as ‘350’, and number of Iterations as ‘500’), GQPSO returned an optimized solution for Rastrigin and Ackley functions. It also performed better in the case of the design of a pressure vessel and tension/spring compression problems in comparison to the existing solution available in related literature. As per the findings of the sensitivity analysis, GQPSO is the most sensitive to the contraction-expansion coefficient in comparison to the maximum number of iterations (itermax) and swarm size (‘n’).},

With the advent of smart technologies and smart campuses, educational institutes are making the best of their efforts to prevent such events from occurring.

In this study, we aim to propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) inspired framework to prevent sexual violence in public toilets of educational institutions with the improvisation of gender recognition from gait sequences by collecting the data from IoT devices installed at the public toilets. Gait recognition provides the ability to observe an individual unremarkably, without any direct cooperation from the human. In this study, we have used the fusion of Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. The performance of the proposed framework is compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

Accurate prediction of sea surface temperature is of great significance for ocean economic development and extreme weather prevention. Application of deep learning-based method in sea surface temperature prediction has significantly increased due to its high analytical power. Nevertheless, sea surface temperature time series are so volatile and stochastic, leading to the fact that in-depth analysis and accurate prediction of sea surface temperature are still challenging. Considering non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics in sea surface temperature sequence, variational mode decomposition is adopted as the de-noising module to reduce the influence of noise. Furthermore, the convolutional neural network is combined with the gated recurrent unit network to extract both spatial and temporal features in sea surface temperature sequence, simultaneously. Finally, a sea surface temperature prediction model based on deep learning model with frequency analysis module is proposed in this paper. The sea surface temperature of East China Sea is selected for empirical study. Comparative analysis demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing sea surface temperature prediction models. Especially, even to the mesoscale level, mean absolute error and root mean squared error of the proposed method are still 0.2038 and 0.2481, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Achieving accurate turning point (TP) forecasting techniques can provide investors with tools to make profitable trading decisions, by offering the opportunity to buy = low and sell = high. Forecasting stock time series TP is known to be one of the most important but also extremely challenging issues. The stock TP forecasting problem is a classification problem where the decision to buy or sell a stock has to be made at each point in time. The first step to achieve this goal is to identify and label the TPs present in the history of the stock time series through a detection technique. Once the labels are achieved, the corresponding classifier is trained to assign labels to new, invisible observations. According to the literature, improving the accuracy of the classifier leads to an increase in the forecasted TPs’ accuracy. Various intelligent classification techniques with different properties have been developed, Over the past decades, to achieve more accurate classification results. However, the parameter estimation of classifiers is done by optimizing a continuous distance-based cost function; and since the goal of the classification problem is discrete, applying a continuous cost function is unreasonable, or at least quite inefficient. To address this, we introduce a novel discrete learning-based methodology for estimating the unknown parameters of the classifier and thereby forecasting stock TPs. In contrast to the existing classification techniques, the proposed methodology is tailored to the discrete goal function of the classification. The present study chooses the multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is one of the most widely-used intelligent classification techniques, to implement the proposed methodology. Although it can be generally shown that the forecasting performance of the proposed discrete learning-based multilayer perceptron model (DIMLP) will not be worse than that of its continuous learning-based counterparts, this paper compares it to other classification techniques to determine the superiority of the proposed DIMLP model. Experimental results using randomly selected datasets from the Shanghai Stock Exchange show that the proposed DIMLP model is superior to its counterparts including classical MLP, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Radial Basis Function Network, Generalized Logistic Regression, Probabilistic Neural Network, and AdaBoost. Consequently, further support is provided for the hypothesis that using a discrete learning-based function as a cost function for classification purposes is appropriate and effective.},

  abstract     = {A traditional approach for panoramic image generation consists of a random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm on a set of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) correspondences to generate a homography matrix between two images. Although producing adequate results for some type of images, hand-crafted SIFT features are not robust enough for highly varying natural images and the iterative RANSAC algorithm with its randomness does not always find the desired homography matrix. Recently, deep neural networks have been producing significant results in many challenging computer vision problems by learning features from large amounts of data. However, only very few recent works have been applied deep learning to panoramic image generation with the objective of finding feature correspondences and estimating homography matrix. Moreover, the absence of a proper dataset for the image stitching task hinders the standardization of models and comparison of their results. This paper attempts to generate panoramic images by extensively experimenting with various approaches using deep neural networks. The best proposed deep learning model achieved 7.31 and 1.07 pixels of the average absolute value loss for corner difference in X and Y directions, respectively. At the same time, qualitative results demonstrate superiority in comparison with the state-of-the-art SIFT+RANSAC algorithm. Specifically, in 72\% of time the proposed framework either produced better results than SIFT+RANSAC or results of the proposed approach and SIFT+RANSAC were indistinguishable. Although SIFT + RANSAC produces better results in 28\% of the time with respect to the loss function, our results are still visually comparable in many of these cases. Finally, a novel panoramic image generation dataset is introduced in this paper.},

Specifically, an RL agent is employed to select hyperparameters and treat the k-fold cross-validation result as a reward signal to update the agent. To guide the agent’s policy update, we design an embedding representation called “experience variable” and dynamically update it during the training process. Besides, we employ a predictive model to predict the performance of machine learning algorithm with the selected hyperparameters and limit the model rollout in short horizon to reduce the impact of the inaccuracy of the model. Finally, we use the meta-learning technique to pre-train the model for fast adapting to a new task. To prove the advantages of our method, we conduct experiments on 25 real HPO tasks and the experimental results show that with the limited computational resources, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art Bayesian methods and evolution method.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label classification (MLC) is a very explored field in recent years. The most common approaches that deal with MLC problems are classified into two groups: (i) problem transformation which aims to adapt the multi-label data, making the use of traditional binary or multiclass classification algorithms feasible, and (ii) algorithm adaptation which focuses on modifying algorithms used into binary or multiclass classification, enabling them to make multi-label predictions. Several approaches have been proposed aiming to explore the relationships among the labels, with some of them through the transformation of a flat multi-label label space into a hierarchical multi-label label space, creating a tree-structured label taxonomy and inducing a hierarchical multi-label classifier to solve the classification problem. This paper presents a novel method in which a label hierarchy structured as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is created from the multi-label label space, taking into account the label co-occurrences using the notion of closed frequent labelset. With this, it is possible to solve an MLC task as if it was a hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) task. Global and local HMC approaches were tested with the obtained label hierarchies and compared with the approaches using tree-structured label hierarchies showing very competitive results. The main advantage of the proposed approach is better exploration and representation of the relationships between labels through the use of DAG-structured taxonomies, improving the results. Experimental results over 32 multi-label datasets from different domains showed that the proposed approach is better than related approaches in most of the multi-label evaluation measures and very competitive when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we found that both tree and in specially DAG-structured label hierarchies combined with a local hierarchical classifier are more suitable to deal with imbalanced multi-label datasets.},

  abstract     = {Mine safety evaluation (MSE) is a complicated engineering problem that may contain the truth, falsity, and indeterminacy information. In the process of mine safety evaluation, the linguistic neutrosophic multivalued information can conveniently express the truth, falsity, and indeterminacy linguistic values and satisfy the thinking and expression habits of decision makers. Then, existing probabilistic linguistic neutrosophic decision-making methods are difficult to reveal the real probability values in several linguistic evaluation values. To reasonably simplify the expression and operation of the linguistic neutrosophic multivalued information and overcome the defects of the probability methods, the aim of this study is to propose a safety evaluation method of mines using correlation coefficients of consistency linguistic neutrosophic sets (CLNSs) in the setting of linguistic neutrosophic multivalued sets (LNMVSs). To do so, this study first defines LNMVS based on truth, falsity, and indeterminacy linguistic multivalued sequences with identical and/or different linguistic values, and then proposes a transformation method from LNMVS to CLNS based on the average values and consistency degrees (complement of standard deviation) of the linguistic multivalued sequences to reasonably simplify the information expression and operations of LNMVSs. Next, correlation coefficients between CLNSs and their MSE method are developed to solve MSE problems. By an actual example about the safety assessment of metal mines and relative comparative analysis, the evaluated results reveal that the proposed MSE method can reasonably and effectively deal with safety evaluation problems of the mines in the setting of LNMVSs. The proposed method can not only reflect the mean and consistency information of multiple language evaluation values and overcome the defect of unreasonable information generated by the probabilistic language method in small evaluation data, but also make evaluation results more effective and credible.},

  abstract     = {Conformable derivatives have deep connections with fractals and local fractional calculus. This paper presents a generalized concept of higher-order fuzzy conformable differentiability for fuzzy-valued functions and interprets higher-order fuzzy conformable differential equations using this concept. We propose the fuzzy conformable Laplace transform (FCLT) as an alternative to the fuzzy Sumudu integral transform, and fuzzy Shehu transform method; and establish some potential properties of FCLT, related to higher-order fuzzy conformable derivatives. The FCLT method is very convenient for solving fuzzy conformable linear higher-order differential equations. We illustrate linear second-order and linear fourth-order fuzzy conformable initial value problems having at most four and sixteen different solutions, respectively.},

  abstract     = {To overcome the limitations of classic fuzzy systems, including Type-1 and Type-2 fuzzy systems, and to propose a robust and flexible intelligent network, this paper presents a new fuzzy system called optimized cascade chaotic fuzzy system (OCCFS) for the function approximation and chaotic systems identification. The OCCFS incorporates fuzzy reasoning of the fuzzy systems, self-adaptation of the neural networks, chaotic signal generation, and generalizability of cascade systems in a unique structure. These features are integrated and optimized with the evolutionary algorithm to present the best performance. In fact, after generating chaotic properties in the neuronal oscillation model, the cascade structure is used for enhancing it and forwarding it to the inference engine of the fuzzy model. The proposed cascade structure could enhance the chaotic properties of primary functions. In other words, outstanding results of Type-2 fuzzy systems (T2FSs) can be achieved through Type-1 fuzzy systems (T1FSs). Based on the General Function Approximation and Stone–Weierstrass theorem, we show that the proposed model has the function approximation property. The prediction capability of the proposed model is verified through popular simulated and real benchmark problems. Moreover, the OCCFS is applied to predict the traffic flow in Ferdowsi Street, Mashhad city, Khorasan Province, Iran. In comparison with T1FS and T2FS, and according to the criteria of accuracy and time, the proposed model provides more accurate and robust results.},

Thus, the research on the location of MLDC has important theoretical and practical application significance separately. Recently, the TODIM and VIKOR method has been used to solve multiple-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) issues. The probabilistic uncertain linguistic term sets (PULTSs) are used as a tool for characterizing uncertain information. In this paper, we design the TODIM-VIKOR model to solve the MAGDM in PULT condition. Firstly, some basic concept of PULTSs is reviewed, and TODIM and VIKOR method are introduced. The extended TODIM-VIKOR model is proposed to tackle MAGDM problems under the PULTSs. At last, a numerical case study for medical logistics center site selection (MLCSS) is given to validate the proposed method.},

In the current analysis, we utilize a hydrodynamic complex wavy model to analyze the movement of gliding bacteria over a layer of Carreau-Yasuda (C.Y) fluid. After using lubrication and creeping flow assumption, the resultant fourth-order differential equation of the gliding model is solved numerically with two different techniques, i.e., implicit finite difference method (IFDM) and MATLAB’s function Bvp-5c. The convergent solution is obtained for appropriate gliding gaits, slime parameters, and certain guesses of flow rate (Q) and glider speed (Vg/c). Unknowns are refined by the modified secant method in such a way that they will satisfy the mechanical equilibrium condition. Excellent agreement between two different computational approaches and outstanding benchmarking is attained. Power required (P), level curves and velocity profiles are plotted for calculated pair from the said procedure. The key verdict of this present examination is that the bacterial speed and slime velocity can be controlled via five different rheological parameters and two gliding gaits.},

  abstract     = {The implementation of fixed-time synchronization is a challenging problem for dynamic networks with derivative coupling. When there are derivative coupling in multilayer heterogeneous dynamic networks, it is difficult to obtain the fixed-time stable synchronization criteria via using the conventional Lyapunov function. To overcome these difficulty and challenge, we choose a special Lyapunov function to solve the fixed-time stable synchronization criteria. To eliminate the differential term in fixed time controller and reduce the difficulty of the design for controller, different from the comprehensive method used in lots of literatures, we use analysis method to design a fixed time control strategy. To be closer to reality, we consider multilayer neural networks with stochastic disturbances and nonlinear connections. When designing the controller, considering the actual communication constraints, we introduce quantization into the designed controller. Under the theoretical framework, we find that the upper limit for function of synchronization time is related to the quantization intensity, parameters of the designed Lyapunov function, parameters of the controller and a maximum eigenvalue related to the structure of multilayer Cohen–Grossberg neural networks. Finally, an secure communication algorithm based on the synchronization scheme is designed. The secure communication algorithm can be achieved before 11.0027. This shows that the derived theoretical framework is effective.},

  abstract     = {Human health issues require estimation of heart rhythm anomalies, brain wave pattern abnormalities, blood parameter outliers, social media analysis, and more. Researchers propose many deep learning models to estimate these issues, and each uses neural optimizations to classify input parameters into disease types. But most of the existing models are either highly complex, or are not capable of capturing multiple body parameters, in order to perform comprehensive disease diagnosis. To overcome the challenges of feature representation and classification, this text proposes design of a high-density feature representation model for multidomain analysis of human health issues. The proposed model collects patient-specific datasets from multidomain sources like blood reports, electrocardiograms (ECGs), electroencephalograms (EEGs), social media posts, and physiological parameters to generate comprehensive health feature vectors. Fourier, Wavelet, Convolutional, and Gabor components transform vectors into multimodal feature sets. Representing the input vector into these components improves feature density, which helps identify multiple disease types. Bee Colony Optimization Models estimate high-variance feature sets using these features. A 1D CNN Model classifies these sets to help identify disease classes. The model performed well in accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC (area under the curve) tests for heart, brain, and psychological issues, making it suitable for clinical use. Compared to standard disease classification models, it improved accuracy, precision, recall, and fMeasure by 3.2\%, 3.5\%, 2.9\%, and 2.5\%, making it useful for real-time deployments.},

Today, with the great development trend of visual media, it has gradually entered the era of reading and map reading, which is a period of information flow and communication.

Traction motor is not only the power source of high-speed train, it is also the basic unit form that can reflect the reliable and stable operation of high-speed trains. The running safety of the train can be effectively protected by diagnosing the traction fault of the train. Based on research data on the development process of high-speed rail, this paper introduces the importance and pertinence of this research. Based on the study of separable linear SVM and nonlinear SVM, the composite fault diagnosis for traction motor using SVM technology is realized. After discussing the actual faults of current sensor and position sensor and their causes, a dynamic model based on traction motor is established and its parameters are simulated. Finally, a diagnostic observer is designed based on an example to determine the sensitivity of the composite fault to the high-speed rail traction motor, and experiments are designed to verify the detection results.

Virtual interaction technology has also begun to penetrate into the application market. At present, virtual reality technology has been widely recognized in the field of interior design, which can be used for target display based on virtual exhibition halls, so it is sought after by many users. This form is different from the previous rigid scene reproduction methods such as images and videos. Customers do not have to be in the actual scene, as long as they can run and watch through the network, and get a sense of reality. This paper develops a kind of virtual interior design system based on VR technology and divides it into two categories: One is virtual reality based on software technology and the other is virtual reality based on virtual hardware technology. The technical principle is based on the following four steps: preprocessing, model transformation, image fusion, and registration, which are tested by simulation experiments. The algorithm proposed in this paper can determine whether the Cu is continuously divided in advance, so as to improve coding efficiency, accelerate the effect display of interior design, and improve customer experience. The intended task of the system design is to bring immersive experience to the target users, so that they can get the most real perception at anytime and anywhere.

  abstract     = {The advancement in healthcare services has been increasing widely to extend several services with intense quality. One of the important issues affecting the effective use of public funds is the detection of health insurance fraud. Previous techniques of detecting fraud pay close attention to characteristics of a single visit rather than many patient visits. Due to a higher false positive rate and poor profile construction, the common traits have reduced detection performance. This paper introduces a novel and intelligent Provider Fraud_Anomaly Detection System (PF_ADS) by combining big data and deep learning approaches for the healthcare insurance industry. The proposed framework contributes to improvising the preprocessing and classification phases to detect provider fraud at an untimely phase. Initially, the collected datasets are preprocessed using a Relative Risk-based MapReduce framework that builds an organized set of relationships between diseases, patients, and claiming variables. The classification phase is improvised using a proposed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It consists of sophisticated steps to consider the significant attributes using hyperparameter optimization. Recalling ability is one of the best parts of RNNs that defines the past and present states of the networks. Therefore, the ability of network state predictions and the tuning of parameters is studied by improved Decisional Score-based Bayesian Optimization (DS_BO). Finally, the best attributes with the selective hyperparameters are fed into the input layer of the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify the anomalies from the provider’s end. The proposed PF_ADS framework is experimented with and validated on the public repositories. The experimental results state that the proposed framework outperforms better than the other methods in terms of accuracy (88.09\%), precision (14.15\%), recall (32.80\%), and 92.30 s computational time.},

  abstract     = {Cucumbers, pumpkins, and muskmelons use flowering as one of the most important pollination processes. Natural pollinators such as bees and butterflies are declining, drastically reducing harvests. The aim of this research is to use UAV images to build deep transfer learning to detect floral patterns in autonomous pollination of cucurbit plants. The images taken by the drone equipped with an OpenMV camera from farm in various situation are collected and stored in the CuCuflower database for flower identification. For self-pollination, pollen area and other identifiable characteristics for classification of flower gender and family are observed. In particular, the fast detection and high accuracy of small, densely packed objects of a large farm in real time is still an open challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by finding and identifying small objects in a bloom of a complete image using the method of transfer learning based on YOLOv structure. However, the cheek component of the flower was relatively small compared to the total relative environmental image. The results revealed that the proposed model performs best in detecting the pollinating flower and the AP50 Momentum Factor with 0.95 is 91\% and 92\%, respectively, which are better than other detection methods.},

  abstract     = {The challenge of identifying the emotional qualities of voice, regardless of the semantic meaning, is known as speech emotion recognition (SER). While people are capable of performing this activity efficiently as a natural aspect of voice communication, the capacity to do so autonomously through programmed technologies is indeed a work in progress. As it offers perspective on human mental processes, emotion identification from speech signals is a frequently investigated topic in the construction of human–computer interface (HCI) models. In HCI, it is frequently necessary to determine the emotion of persons as mental feedback. An attempt is made in this study to distinguish seven different emotions using speech signals: sadness, anger, disgusted, pleased, surprised, enjoyable, and neutrality mood. For the identification of emotion, the suggested method uses a signals preprocessing method based on the randomness measure. The signals are first normalized to reduce noise. Due to the obvious changing length and continual form of voice signals, emotions identification requires both locally and globally information. Local features depict dynamic behavior, while feature points reveal statistic factors such as standard error, median, and lowest and maximum values. The SER system includes several features, including spectrum characteristics, sound quality characteristics, and Teager energy operator-based characteristics. Prosodic features are those that are based on the human perception, such as rhythm and inflection. These characteristics are based on three factors: power, length, and frequency response. From of the heavily processed signals, a features vector is generated that evaluates the random feature for all of the emotional responses. Then, using mutual information (MI), the feature vector is utilized to choose from the entire set. The feature vectors are then categorized using the BOAT method and association rule mining. Experiments were carried out on the TESS dataset for several metrics, and the performance of the suggested method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {A multi-attribute decision-making method based on heterogeneous information and set pair analysis is proposed, considering the balance of the contradictions between information representation and information processing in the decision-making process. The method is applied to decision-making problems in which the attribute weights are completely unknown and the attribute values are characterized as heterogeneous information (including exact numbers, interval numbers, intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, interval intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, neutrosophic numbers, interval neutrosophic numbers, picture fuzzy numbers, and Pythagorean fuzzy numbers). First, various transformation methods for converting heterogeneous information into the connection numbers (CNs) of set pair analysis are introduced and defined, and the heterogeneous information is uniformly converted into CNs for ease of processing. Second, the attribute weights of the heterogeneous information are obtained using the information entropy of the CNs. Thereafter, the alternatives are ranked by the VIKOR method. Moreover, we use the method of setting a threshold for the compromise evaluation value, and the clustering method to group the alternatives to provide more auxiliary decision making. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by a typhoon disaster evaluation example, and the advantages of the proposed approach are emphasized by performing a multi-faceted comparative analysis with other methods. Among them, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm can be simplified as $$O\left( m \right)$$ , which demonstrates an improvement on the simplified time complexity $$O\left( {m^{2} } \right)$$ of the two existing methods.

When merged with statistical or machine learning techniques, these techniques give rise to hybridization. Hybrid techniques significantly improve the performance of search-based techniques and the quality of solutions produced by them. In this systematic review, we have investigated 72 papers published from January 2000 to December 2021 that ascertain the use of hybrid techniques and their effectiveness in predicting software defects. The review identifies and evaluates various techniques, experimental design, fitness functions, performance measures, threats to validity, and well-known statistical tests in the studies that apply these hybrid techniques. We also compared the performance of hybrid techniques among themselves and statistical and machine learning techniques present in the literature. According to the findings, the predictive capability of hybrid techniques is encouraging.

However, it is challenging because the traffic network is a non-polynomial problem. In this study, the problem is evaluated from a unique perspective. The primary idea is to remove the crossings of the intersections. A Hamiltonian cycle algorithm has been used to design the network. So, vehicles are only able to join or split. Thus, no control mechanism is needed that delays or interrupts the flow. The suggested algorithm and intersection design were tested on Allsop and Charlesworth’s widely used sample network. Findings were compared with the literature in the form of delay calculated using the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 formula. The suggested network’s delay is calculated to be 98.17\% and 95.45\% less than the original network and recently published study-based delay, respectively. As a result, Hamiltonian roads seem sustainable in time and fuel consumption and could be used for future designs.},

  abstract     = {The combination of idle computing resources in mobile devices and the computing capacity of mobile edge servers enables all available devices in an edge network to complete all computing tasks in coordination to effectively improve the computing capacity of the edge network. This is a research hotspot for 5G technology applications and integrating collaborative computing techniques into edge computing. Previous research has focused on the minimum energy consumption and/or delay to determine the formulation of the computational offloading strategy but neglected the cost required for the computation of collaborative devices (mobile devices, mobile edge servers, etc.); therefore, we propose a cost-based collaborative computation offloading model. In this model, when a task requests these devices’ assistance in computing, it needs to pay the corresponding calculation cost; and on this basis, the task is offloaded and computed. In addition, for the model, we propose an adaptive neighborhood search based on simulated annealing algorithm (ANSSA) to jointly optimize the offloading decision and resource allocation with the goal of minimizing the sum of both the energy consumption and calculation cost. The adaptive mechanism enables different operators to update the probability of selection according to historical experience and environmental perception, which makes the individual evolution have certain autonomy. A large number of experiments conducted on different scales of mobile user instances show that the ANSSA can obtain satisfactory time performance with guaranteed solution quality. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the mobile edge computing (MEC) offloading system. It is of great significance to strike a balance between maintaining the life cycle of smart mobile devices and breaking the performance bottleneck of MEC servers.},

An Adaptive Inertia Weighting Factor (AIWF) is utilized in the velocity update equation of traditional PSO for the improvement in speed of convergence and precision in tracking Maximum Power Point (MPP) in standalone Photovoltaic system. Adaptation of weights based on the success rate of particles toward maximum power extraction is the most promising feature of AIWF. The inertia weight is kept constant in traditional PSO for the complete duration of optimization process. The MPPT in PV system poses a dynamic optimization problem and the proposed APSO approach paves way not only to track MPP under uniform irradiation conditions, but also to track MPP under non-uniform irradiation conditions. Simulations are done in MATLAB/Simulink environment to verify the effectiveness of proposed technique in comparison with the existing PSO technique. With change in irradiation and temperature, the APSO technique is found to provide better results in terms of tracking speed and efficiency.

Therefore, the paper proposes a generative GAN-based frameworks with the piecewise linear representation (PLR) approach to learn three trading actions, namely buying, selling, and holding. The proposed framework consists of two parts: first, PLR approach uses to detect historical prices to form trading sequences with three actions, PLR can provide a guided trading strategy to discriminator of GAN. Second, the generator of GAN is used to generate/predict daily trading actions, and the discriminator is used to detect the real/fake trading actions from the PLR/generator of GAN.

Then, the extracted two-dimensional feature vector is input into the KELM neural network for fault identification, and combined with PSO, KELM parameters were optimized.

This paper aims to develop an outranking method with high generalization performance to solve the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems under a probabilistic linguistic environment. To simplify the computation, a novel standardization process based on the greatest common divisor is first put forward to preprocess PLTSs to have the same probabilities. On this basis, a parametric distance measure between PLTSs is proposed. Next, a new concept called the outranking degree of PLTSs is introduced to compare PLTSs and four kinds of binary relations for PLTSs are then defined by using this concept. Moreover, an outranking framework similar to ELECTRE I method is formulated to rank alternatives for MCDM problems with probabilistic linguistic information. Finally, a case study is provided to confirm the validity and effectiveness of the developed method, and the advantages of this study are further tested by some robustness and comparative analysis.},

Motivated by this, in this paper, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of users and minimize the transmit power simultaneously. According to our early work on fitness landscape analysis of sum rate maximization problems, the proposed problem is inferred to be multi-modal. To solve this non-convex and multi-modal problem, we propose a novel multi-objective evolutionary hybrid beamforming (MEHB) framework to find different trade-off solutions between the two conflicting objectives. In particular, we employ different kinds of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and multi-modal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms as the baseline of MEHB framework, so as to design the passive beamforming. And the active beamforming at the base station is optimized by the classical zero-forcing method.

A challenging approach to uncover the community structure in complex network, and then revealing the internal organization of nodes, is Modularity optimization. In this research paper, we present an immune optimization algorithm (opt-IA) developed to detect community structures, with the main aim to maximize the modularity produced by the discovered communities. In order to assess the performance of opt-IA, we compared it with an overall of 20 heuristics and metaheuristics, among which one Hyper-Heuristic method, using social and biological complex networks as data set. Unlike these algorithms, opt-IA is entirely based on a fully random search process, which in turn is combined with purely stochastic operators. According to the obtained outcomes, opt-IA shows strictly better performances than almost all heuristics and metaheuristics to which it was compared; whilst it turns out to be comparable with the Hyper-Heuristic method. Overall, it can be claimed that opt-IA, even if driven by a purely random process, proves to be reliable and with efficient performance. Furthermore, to prove the latter claim, a sensitivity analysis of the functionality was conducted, using the classic metrics NMI, ARI and NVI.},

  abstract     = {The chicken swarm optimization (CSO) is a novel swarm intelligence algorithm, which mimics the hierarchal order and foraging behavior in the chicken swarm. However, like other population-based algorithms, CSO also suffers from slow convergence and easily falls into local optima, which partly results from the unbalance between exploration and exploitation. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a chicken swarm optimization with an enhanced exploration–exploitation tradeoff (CSO-EET). To be specific, the search process in CSO-EET is divided into two stages (i.e., exploration and exploitation) according to the swarm diversity. In the exploratory search process, a random solution is employed to find promising solutions. In the exploitative search process, the best solution is used to accelerate convergence. Guided by the swarm diversity, CSO-EET alternates between exploration and exploitation. To evaluate the optimization performance of CSO-EET in both theoretical and practical problems, it is compared with other improved CSO variants and several state-of-the-art algorithms on two groups of widely used benchmark functions (including 102 test functions) and two real-world problems (i.e., circle packing problem and survival risk prediction of esophageal cancer). The experimental results show that CSO-EET is better than or at least comparable to all competitors in most cases.},

  abstract     = {Automotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR), as an open, standardized framework for automotive electronic software development, has gradually become the standard followed by major automotive manufacturers and automotive electronic device suppliers. The electronic software system problem improves the development efficiency and portability of the system by reducing the development cost of automotive electronic software while ensuring the quality of products and services, which is beneficial for subsequent upgrades and updates of the system. In order to improve the reliability of the software component deployment algorithm based on AUTOSAR architecture, we proposed the TDCA algorithm. During the execution of the algorithm, communication volume and communication degree are introduced to improve the accuracy of the deployment plan by optimizing the bus load and ECU balancing. Algorithm comparison experiments show that comparing heuristic and linear optimization algorithms, the TDCA algorithm proposed in this paper has significant advantages in reducing bus load and ECU utilization. The algorithm can reduce the communication between cores and balance ECU load according to the constraints of AUTOSAR architecture.},

Third, the MR and λ parameters in the proposed algorithm are adapted over time, and finally, single-objective and multi-objective approaches are proposed to solve the gene selection problems. The 15 datasets pertinent to microarray data of various cancer types are employed to compare the proposed method with other well-known binary optimization algorithms. The experiments&#39; results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a better capability to select the optimal genes for a faster disease diagnosis.},

As one of the biggest passenger terminals around the world and among the most attractive destinations for visitors during the Hajj pilgrimage, this paper concentrates on enhancing the movement of travelers in the King Abdulaziz International Airport&#39;s pilgrimage station in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Several optimization methods are used to better schedule the phases within the airport terminals as well as the assignment of arriving flights to vacant airport portals. These include the differential evolution algorithm (DEA), harmony search algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), flower pollination algorithm (FPA), and black widow optimization algorithm. The findings demonstrated the potential sites for the development of airport stages, which may assist decision-makers in improving operational efficiency in the future. The simulation results showed that GA was more efficient in most of the experiments than the alternative algorithms for small population sizes in terms of the quality of the solutions obtained and the convergence rates. In contrast, DEA performed better in the larger population sizes. The outcomes also showed that FPA performed better than its rivals in identifying the optimal solution in terms of the overall duration of passenger waiting time.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty estimation has received momentous consideration in applied machine learning to capture model uncertainty. For instance, the Monte-Carlo dropout method (MC-dropout), an approximated Bayesian approach, has gained intensive attention in producing model uncertainty due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, MC-dropout has revealed shortcomings in capturing erroneous predictions lying in the overlapping classes. Such predictions underlie noisy data points that can neither be reduced by more training data nor detected by model uncertainty. On the other hand, Monte-Carlo based on adversarial attacks (MC-AA), an outstanding method, performs perturbations on the inputs using the adversarial attack idea to capture model uncertainty. This method admittedly mitigates the shortcomings of the previous methods by capturing wrong labels in overlapping regions. Motivated by this method that was only validated with neural networks, we sought to apply MC-AA on various graph neural network models to obtain uncertainties using two public real-world graph datasets known as Elliptic and GitHub. First, we perform binary node classifications, then we apply MC-AA and other recent uncertainty estimation methods to capture the uncertainty of the models. Uncertainty evaluation metrics are computed to evaluate and compare the performance of the uncertainty of the model. We highlight the efficacy of MC-AA in capturing uncertainties in graph neural networks wherein MC-AA outperforms other given methods.},

  abstract     = {Data preparation is a vital step in the web usage mining process since it provides structured data for the subsequent stages. Hence, it is necessary to convert raw server logs into user sessions to generate structured data for pattern discovery phase. In recent decade, popular websites’ server log production has risen to many terabytes to petabytes each day. As a result, server logs possess big data issues such as storage and processing. This study focuses on initial phases of web usage mining process such as data cleaning, user identification, and session identification. These phases are classified as data-intensive processes and deemed-computation intensive. In the last decade, MapReduce emerges as one of the best parallel programming frameworks for data-intensive applications. An efficient MapReduce-based data pre-processing algorithm, i.e. IRPDP_HT2, is proposed in this study. Previous parallel data pre-processing algorithms either include partial phases or lack with efficient robot detection approaches. IRPDP_HT2 algorithm uses a variety of efficient heuristics in all three phases of data pre-processing to identify both ethical and unethical robots. The suggested IRPDP_HT2 approach is found to be effective and scalable for larger datasets after various experiments on a cluster of nodes. The effectiveness of suggested heuristics is also examined during session identification phase. Three variants of IRPDP_HT2 such as PDP_HT2, IPDP_HT2, and RPDP_HT2 are also developed and tested. Impact of robots’ requests and internal dummy connections’ requests on session count by IRPDP_HT2 algorithm is 45.81\% which is more than in PDP_HT2, IPDP_HT2, and RPDP_HT2 algorithms. Further speed-up and size-up are also analysed to demonstrate scalability of algorithm. In the presence of larger datasets, the algorithm’s running time falls, while the number of data nodes grows. The size-up of IRPDP_HT2 demonstrates that even after doubling the input data, the algorithm’s running time does not grow in that ratio for the fixed number of data nodes.},

Therefore, we propose a capsule network based on deep routing and residual learning. The network reduces the number of capsules to reduce the computation during routing, adds local routing layers to extract deep hidden capsule information and constructs residual connections to assist parameters training. In addition, we propose a new capsule dropout method to enhance the robustness of the network and reduce the computation of the network. We conducted several experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, SVHN, Fashion-MNIST and MNIST). The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive results on multiple benchmark datasets.

Different image sources usually can provide complementary knowledge for improving the classification performance. Current methods generally extract features or recognize each source separately before performing fusion, and this cannot well exploit the correlation of different sources. We propose a multi-source image (i.e., visible and infrared images) fusion target recognition method based on mutual learning (MIF-ML). In this paper, an end-to-end visible-infrared image fusion model is constructed. Firstly, two networks are built for the visible and infrared images, respectively, and jointly trained based on mutual learning. The generalization performance of the networks can be efficiently enhanced because the information of different images is transferred between the two networks. Secondly, a weighted decision-level fusion method is developed to combine the classification results of visible and infrared images for achieving as good as possible recognition performance. In the training process, the weight of each image is automatically optimized in the networks. Finally, the performance of the MIF-ML method has been tested by comparing with other related methods, and the experimental results show that the proposed MIF-ML can efficiently improve the classification accuracy.},

Firstly, we use an end-to-end Com-Rec network to reconstruct examples with feature compression to expand the distinguishing features. Secondly, propose an image reconstruction differences based on information-theoretic VIF, structural information UQI and spectral information RASE composition to discriminate AEs. Moreover, we introduce the idea of integrated learning to form a strong random forest binary classifier to enhance the performance of detecting AEs. We further validate it through extensive experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. These experiments demonstrated that the IRD effectively detected AEs and achieved a high average accuracy of 98.33\%. Specifically it also performs favorably against the following methods based on Feature Squeezing, Local Intrinsic Dimensionality, Kernel Density and Network Invariance Checking with an average detection rate of 99.54\% and a 1.44\% average false positive rate.},

  abstract     = {Water is one of the main sources of life on Earth. As a result of the progress made in the field of industry and technology, water has become one of the most important wealth that must be preserved. Studies indicate that the world is heading toward a crisis in the percentage of available water by the year 2025 as a result of the scarcity of water sources, the increase in pollution rates, and the increased use of water. On the other hand, water refining is a very expensive method. Therefore, it was necessary to go to computer methods characterized by high accuracy to know the percentage of water quality scale and the possibility of using it in different places other than drinking before resorting to the refining process. This paper presents a model for predicting a water quality scale based on twelve concentrations called (IM12CP-WQI) that is based on the use of the concept of intelligent data mining that combines the construction of two algorithms, namely (DWM-Bat and DMARS). The DWM-Bat worked to find the number of DMARS models in addition to the weights of each of the concentrations used in this study. The DMARS algorithm has found a mathematical model that combines these concentrations to predict the percentage of water quality. The MARS algorithm was developed by replacing its kernel with four functions: [linear, RBF, sigmoid, and polynomial]. The proposed model consists of four basic stages that included: the first stage is data collection and preliminary treatment to put it within the same ranges, which are [0, 1], as well as finding the correlation between concentrations to find out the direct or inverse correlation between those concentrations and their relationship with the water quality coefficient WQI. The second stage included building an optimization algorithm called DWM-Bat to find the optimal weights for each of the twelve concentrations, as well as the optimal number of M models for DMARS. The third stage included building a mathematical model that combines these concentrations, based on DMARS and benefiting from the results of the previous stage, DWM-Bat. The last stage included evaluating the results that were reached using three types of measurements (R2, NSE, D) on the basis of which the WQI value was determined based on four cases. The first case if the WQI value is less than 25, it can be used for the purpose of drinking, the second case if it was between (26–50) and it is used in fish lakes, the third case if it was between (51–75) and it could be used in agriculture, the fourth case if the WQI value is higher than 75 and then the water needs a refining process. Also, the results of the proposed model called (IM12CP-WQI) were compared with the results of MARS after it was developed by using different kernel functions. By applying the proposed model, it was found using DWM-Bat that the optimal number of M related to the winter and summer data sets is 9. And the best weight for each concentration was as follows: PH = 0.247, NTU = 0.420, TDS = 0.004, Ca = 0.028, Mg = 0.042, Cl = 0.008, Na = 0.011, K = 0.175, SO4 = 0.008, NO3 = 0.042, CaCO3 (TA) = 0.011, and CaCO3 (TH) = 0.004. On the other hand, the study demonstrated a high correlation between WQI, and the following concentrations are k = 0.985, TH = 0.86, NO3 = 0.761, TDS = 0.55, Na = 0.415, PH = 0.371, TA = 0.37, Cl = 0.362, and Ca = 0.317. The results showed that the predictor IM12CP-WQI is a good indicator compared with other techniques represented by MARS-linear, MARS-Sig, MARS-RBF, and MARS-Poly. Thus, the proposed model IM12CP-WQI is considered one of the most promising techniques in the field of water quality measurement despite the different concentrations that cause water pollution .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce heuristic method for addressing batch effect of transcriptome (genetic expression) data. Batch effect refers to the distortions in the data set originated due to measurements being performed under different conditions. While the data from the same batch (measurements performed under the same conditions) are compatible, the outcome of combining various batches together creates a new set of incompatible data elements, and thus, the combined data are inappropriate for conducting reliable analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to perform correction (normalization) of the combined data, before performing gene expression analysis. There are numerous normalization methods designed to correct gene expression data for batch effect. These methods rely on various assumptions regarding the distribution of the measurements. However, forcing the data elements into assumed in advance distribution can severely distort biological signals, thus leading to incorrect interpretations and conclusions. As the discrepancy between the assumptions and the actual data is wider, the biases introduced by such “correction methods” are greater. The method we introduce has several clear advantages in comparison with the alternative methods presently in use. It does not rely on assumptions regarding the distribution and the behavior of data elements. Hence, it does not generate any new biases due to unrealistic assumptions. In addition, it strictly maintains the integrity of measurements within the original batches. Additional major advantage of the introduced method is its conceptual simplicity. It is based on common sense and human reasoning, and thus, the users can easily understand the consequences of normalization, in contrast to the alternative methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new type of L-fuzzy generalized neighborhood system is introduced and then novel L-fuzzy rough sets based on it are defined and discussed. It is verified that the proposed model is an extension of Pang’s generalized neighborhood system-based pessimistic rough sets and so called L-fuzzy generalized neighborhood system-based pessimistic L-fuzzy rough sets. Firstly, the basic properties of the novel model are studied. To regain some Pawlak’s properties which are lost in the novel model, the serial, reflexive, transitive and symmetric conditions for L-fuzzy general neighborhood systems are defined. Secondly, the axiomatic characterizations of the pessimistic L-fuzzy rough sets and that generated by serial, reflexive and symmetric L-fuzzy general neighborhood systems are given, respectively. Thirdly, a reduction theory preserving L-fuzzy approximation operators is established. Finally, one applied in information system, i.e., a new three-way decision model based on pessimistic L-fuzzy rough sets, is built. To show the effectiveness and reliability of our model, a practical example is presented.},

In addition, the number of decision makers, alternatives or criteria of decision making problems in the context of big data are increasingly large. Correlation analysis between decision making attributes has become an important issue of large-scale linguistic decision making problems. In the paper, we concentrate on correlation analysis between decision making attributes to deal with large-scale decision making problems with linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy values. Firstly, we proposed a new similarity measure between two linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy sets to formally define correlation between decision making attributes. Then we propose linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy reducible weighted Maclaurin symmetric mean (LIFRWMSM) operator and linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy reducible weighted dual Maclaurin symmetric mean (LIFRWDMSM) operator to aggregate linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy value decision information of correlational decision making attributes, and analyze several important properties of the two operator. Inspired by evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method, we design a solution scheme and decision steps to deal with large-scale linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy decision making problems. To show the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed decision method, we employ the choice of buying a house and the selection of travel destination to demonstrate our method and make comparative analysis with others aggregation operators or methods.},

  abstract     = {The low-frequency electromechanical oscillations (LFEOs) in electric power system are because of weaker interties, uncertainties, various faults and disturbances. These LFEOs (0.2–3 Hz) are less in magnitude and are responsible for lower power transfer, increased losses and also threaten the stability of power system. An adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy sliding mode controlled power system stabilizer (AIT2FSMC-PSS) is presented to neutralize the LFEOs and enhance stability under uncertainties and external disturbances. The AIT2FSMC is a hybridization of type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) with conventional SMC to lower the chattering effect, enhance the robustness of reaching phase and improve system’s performance. Here, T2FLS is used for estimating the unknown functions of SMC. A robust sliding surface is presented to keep the system in the desired plane and remain stable under disturbance conditions. A modified control law is proposed for selecting the control parameters and Lyapunov synthesis is used to make the error asymptotically converging to zero. The effectiveness of the AIT2FSMC-PSS is accessed in single and multimachine power systems subjected to various uncertainties and disturbances. Again, comparison of performance indices (PIs), eigenvalues, damping ratios, oscillating frequencies, integral time absolute error (ITAE), figure of demerit (FD) and frequency domain plots like Bode, root locus and Nyquist plots are also analysed to access the efficacy of the proposed stabilizer. The simulated responses, comparative study and frequency plots confirm the supremacy of the proposed AIT2FSMC-PSS in suppressing the LFEOs to lesser settling characteristics, offer stable performance and assure transient stability of power system as compared to other stabilizers.},

In particular, the corresponding concepts and properties can be obtained directly when aggregation function takes uninorm and nullnorm, respectively.

Artificial intelligence technology is now inseparable from human society, and artificial technology and human society are each other to promote progress. Voice is the carrier of language, and voice recognition is actually the conversion of voice signals into symbols that can be recognized by the system. Accuracy can be greatly improved, but also converts a variety of different languages into a universal symbol so that it can be recognized by a computer and its meaning can be understood. The development of the e-commerce industry did not explode suddenly but went through a long process.

E-commerce is also combined with new technologies to continuously enrich the development model. Under this development trend, B2C e-commerce has also been greatly promoted. However, there are still many B2C e-commerce which retain the traditional business model and cannot make good use of big data. Therefore, this paper analyzes the current situation of B2C e-commerce platform, introduces artificial intelligence technology into consumer behavior recognition and analyze the urgent needs of consumer behavior recognition. For B2C e-commerce companies, in order to improve management efficiency and reduce operating costs, it is necessary to classify users in a targeted manner and find the target users they need.

This improves the accuracy of English video, reduces the execution time of the algorithm and reduces the memory occupation. Compared with ordinary video, the training time required under the same training parameters is shorter, and the convergence speed of the model itself will be faster.

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of network information technology, people’s dependence on network information is becoming stronger and stronger. The information on the Internet shows a trend of explosion, and information overload has also become a research hotspot. Due to the defects of cold start and sparse data, the traditional personalized recommendation algorithm will show the problem of accuracy degradation in the face of excessive information. Therefore, the traditional methods have been unable to adapt to the current needs of literature and art analysis. The goal of speech enhancement is to remove noise interference from noisy sounds and extract pure sounds as much as possible. Speech enhancement can reduce sound distortion, improve sound quality, and reduce hearing fatigue. At present, voice enhancement technology is widely used in products and fields such as mobile communications, computers, smart phone devices, and smart homes. First, this article will briefly introduce the artistic analysis of film and television works. Starting from the main characteristics of film and television works, according to the characteristics of various data lists based on visualization and visual data mining.

  abstract     = {With the development of urbanization, the city has entered the stage of improving the quality of the stock, and the number of urban demolition has increased, resulting in the generation of construction waste and great pressure on the environment. The discharge of construction waste threatens the sustainable development of urban environment. And because large public buildings have high energy consumption and high emissions, it is urgent to establish an effective energy consumption measurement system. In the past, the calculation method for energy consumption was relatively single, which could not effectively manage energy consumption. This paper discusses how to use construction waste scientifically based on the Internet of things, and using advanced measurement technology to monitor and analyze building energy consumption is an effective way to solve this problem. Based on this, this paper constructs a building energy consumption measurement system through the Internet of things technology. By using BP linear neural network model to predict, the system effectively improves the prediction accuracy and makes it close to the actual value. The system is mainly based on the collection terminal, the centralized data terminal and the data management terminal and then builds a communication bridge between the terminals through the Internet of things and the Internet. The response time of energy consumption monitoring and management is relatively short, and the response speed of power control management and energy consumption management analysis is relatively fast, which can effectively measure the energy consumption of buildings. In addition, this paper also makes a brief analysis of the recycling of construction waste and puts forward the corresponding strategic analysis of resource utilization. This paper designs an effective energy consumption measurement system by introducing the Internet of things technology into the building field.},

  abstract     = {As the usage of credit cards has become more common in health care applications of everyday life, banks have found it very difficult to detect credit card fraud (CCF) systematically. The fraudulent activities should be identified and detected using new techniques. As a result, machine learning (ML) can help detect CCF in transactions while reducing the strain on financial institutions. This research aims to improve cybersecurity measures by detecting fraudulent transactions in datasets. The new classifier strategies cluster and classifier-based decision tree (CCDT), cluster and classifier-based logistic regression (CCLR), and cluster and classifier-based random forest (CCRF) are modeled in this research. The proposed strategies are applied to detect fraudulent health care activities. This research performed the preprocessing through the feature extraction, sampling, and transformation stages, and the proposed classifiers are simulated, and the results are analyzed. The significant results expected range of the proposed classifiers over the other methods are accuracy—(99.95\%, 99.97\%), precision—(99.96\%, 99.98\%), sensitivity—(99.9\%, 100\%), specificity—(99.8\%, 100\%).

There is a surge of concern among all persons, especially those who wish to resume in-person activities, as the globe recovers from the epidemic and intends to return to a level of normalcy. Wearing a face mask greatly decreases the likelihood of viral transmission and gives a sense of security, according to studies. However, manually tracking the execution of this regulation is not possible. The key to this is technology. We present a deep learning-based system that can detect instances of improper use of face masks. A dual-stage convolutional neural network architecture is used in our system to recognize masked and unmasked faces. This will aid in the tracking of safety breaches, the promotion of face mask use, and the maintenance of a safe working environment. In this paper, we propose a variant of a multi-face detection model which has the potential to target and identify a group of people whether they are wearing masks or not.},

The proposed approach was developed from a structured questionnaire containing 25 quality attributes adapted from the E-S-QUAL model and applied to consumers of online shopping services. Fuzzy set theory was used in the approach to simplify the subjectivity of human judgment, along with the extension of Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Therefore, this research was classified as applied, exploratory, quantitative and survey. To achieve the research objective, 819 questionnaires were collected. Among the main findings, it is highlighted that the attributes “product availability”, “products with excellent quality”, “confidence in online shopping processes” and “ease of buying online” were the ones that presented the best perceptions of quality by the respondents. At the other end, the attributes &quot;opinion sharing on social networks&quot;, &quot;buying online is a good option when you have little time&quot;, &quot;distraction in online shopping searches&quot; and &quot;shopping online is a pleasure&quot; showed the highest level of dissatisfaction with the service. Thus, this article highlights the importance of online shopping services in times of the pandemic caused by COVID-19, and its main contribution and originality is the development of an approach that aims to support the decision-making process, establishing strategic actions for the continuous improvement of online shopping services with the reduction of subjectivity in customer perception and with successive refinements.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, the modern power system has become more complex because of high penetration of generation power, heavy load changes, voltage fluctuation, high reactive power, and environmental and economic problems. These problems can cause voltage disintegration issues in the power system. Thus, the voltage stability in the system should be predicted and required to improve the stable conditions. However, the earlier investigations do not significantly improve the coordination&#39;s voltage stability. For this reason, in this research, a novel generalized approximate reasoning based intelligent control based unified voltage collapse proximity indicator is proposed for calculating the system&#39;s weak buses voltage. Moreover, the African buffalo optimization is proposed to estimate the finest location of unified power flow controller based flexible alternative current transmission system devices in the scheme for voltage strength enrichment. The implementation of these proposed approaches is done via MATLAB/Simulink. The projected system has been experienced on IEEE 118 and IEEE 30 bus systems. Consequently, the simulation outcome indicates that the proposed methods effectively predict and upgrade the voltage stability index. The results are compared with the conventional models concerning cost, real power loss, and computational time. The proposed system attained real power for IEEE 118 bus is 4.5502 MW and IEEE 30 bus for 4.902 MW, which is very low compared with the existing methods.},

This study proposes a multiple correlation neural networks (MCNN) method to solve these problems. In the first step, a set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are built to approximate the safety domain of structural reliability. Then, the trained ANNs are connected with improved dual neural networks to form the MCNN method. Using the correlation of ANNs in MCNN, the solution of multiple definite integrals with the implicit integral domain is obtained. The proposed method has significant accuracy and efficiency compared with other existing methods and increases the computational stability of ANN-based reliability calculation methods. The performances of the newly proposed method in calculation accuracy and efficiency are analyzed for several structural reliability problems.},

The performance of the models was evaluated using various statistical criteria, scatter, and PDF plots. Results showed that the data-driven models are more capable in simulating the SAR data than the classical multiple linear regression model. The WANN model provided reliable predictions of the SAR values rather than the other models.},

  abstract     = {Most genetic operators use random mating selection strategy and fixed rate crossover operator to solve various optimization problems. In order to improve the convergence and diversity of the algorithm, an adaptive adjacent maximum distance crossover operator is proposed in this paper. A new mating selection strategy (distance-based mating selection strategy) and an adaptive mechanism (adaptive crossover strategy based on population convergence) are adopted. Distance-based mating selection strategy purposefully selects parents to produce better offspring. Adaptive crossover strategy based on population convergence increases the convergence speed of the algorithm by controlling the crossover probability. The proposed crossover strategy is evaluated on the simulated binary crossover operators of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition. The performance of the algorithm is verified on a series of standard test problems. Finally, the optimization results of the improved algorithm using adaptive adjacent maximum distance crossover operator and the standard algorithm are compared and analyzed. The experimental results show that the algorithm using adaptive adjacent maximum distance crossover operator has better optimization results.},

It is implemented through fuzzy gain scheduling of PID (FGS-PID) controller in combination with the radial basis function network sliding mode (RBFNSM) for controlling a grid-connected hybrid generating system. A wind turbine (WT) based on the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and a photovoltaic (PV) is considered for this study. FGS-PID controller equipped with scaling factors (SF) for the input signals of FGS are used to reach MPPT for the PV system. In order to regulate the member functions (MFs) of FGS, the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and developed farmland fertility optimization (IFFO) algorithm are used. Moreover, the pitch angle control is applied for the WT. The pitch angle control of the WT is implemented by the RBFNSM to control the generated power and the speed at the nominal value. For protecting the wind turbine architecturally and escape catastrophic operation, this idea is implemented. MATLAB software is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The main advantages of the proposed method over other approaches are efficiency, fast and accurately tracking the highest generated power of the PV system.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called chief executive officer election optimization algorithm (CEOA), is proposed, which is inspired by the process of electing a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in a company. CEOA simulates three stages of electing a CEO, namely the mass-election stage, election stage and authorization stage. The list of candidates is confirmed during the mass-election stage. In the election stage, each candidate has its own public relation team, and all the employees are divided into three different groups. The loyalist group always supports the candidate of their own faction, which enhances the exploitation ability of the algorithm. The speculator group tries to seize the CEO’s position directly by taking advantage of the current candidates through a variety of behaviors, which enhance the exploration ability of the algorithm. The neutralist group takes its own interests as the priority, supports the candidate who meet its own interests by comparing the candidate teams and improves the exploitation and exploration ability of the algorithm at the same time. The final CEO is confirmed in the authorization stage. In addition, a precocity judgment rule is introduced to ensure the effectiveness and rationality of the election process and improve the ability of the algorithm to escape from the local optimal region. The performance of CEOA is evaluated through twenty-one classical test functions, twenty-nine CEC2017 test functions, six real-world engineering optimization problems and three date clustering problems. The average value, standard deviation, Friedman mean rank and Wilcoxon signed rank are used as criteria. The above experiments are compared with the well-studied and recent optimizers, such as GA, PSO, DE, EO, MPA, AEFA, SHADE, ISOS, mSSA and PO. For the twenty-one classical test functions, in both cases of function shifting and without shifting, CEOA can gain the first rank, and its performance in high-dimensional search space also outperforms other algorithms. For the twenty-nine CEC2017 test functions, CEOA gain the third rank, only slightly behind SHADE and LSHADE-SPACMA. However, in the twenty-one classical test functions without shifting, Friedman mean rank of CEOA is 2.4762, while SHADE and LSHADE-SPACMA are only 4.5952 and 6.0476, respectively. The experimental results show that CEOA outperforms most of optimizers and is competitive compared with high-performance methods. In addition, CEOA ranks first on all six constrained engineering optimization problems and has good performance on three real-life datasets clustering problems, proving its applicability on real-world optimization problems.},

The objective is to maximize the total demands of the covered population within some constraints. Several metaheuristic approaches were proposed to solve the problem as it is an NP hard problem. In this article, we have proposed a chemical reaction optimization (CRO)-based approach to solve MCLP. CRO is a metaheuristic based on population to solve optimization problems. We are proposing a method to solve MCLP by redesigning four fundamental operators of CRO. Sometimes the solutions get trapped into local maxima, so an additional repair operator is also designed to find optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is tested for both small and large scales of instances of datasets, which include benchmark as well as random ones. The proposed method gives best percentage of coverage results in 91.60\% of instances, and for the remaining 8.40\% of instances it produces results with average error value 0.10\% which is very close to the optimal value. Nevertheless, the proposed method performs very well in terms of computational time for all test instances (100\%) on all datasets compared to state-of-the-art method (Atta_GA). Wilcoxon signed-rank test has been performed on the results of the proposed method to observe the statistical significance. For both real-world and random instances, the results of the statistical test are significant.},

Our goal is to provide a set of solutions for potential future threat scenarios. The multi-objective feasibility enhanced particle swarm optimization (MOFEPSO) model is used as a heuristic algorithm, and the model is implemented in MATLAB. We then perform a comparative analysis using a goal programming (GP) model. The GP model is solved using the Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) method with the Excel Solver tool. The results of the comparative analysis show that the MOFEPSO model has some advantages over the GRG solution in terms of sensitive results related to the probability of kill and the diversification of missile investment costs.},

  abstract     = {Chatter is a type of self-excited vibration that expresses variations in frequency and energy dispersion during the milling process and invariably results in poor part quality and a lower material removal rate. An efficacious chatter detection approach is necessary to anticipate the chatter&#39;s nascent stage. Feature extraction is an important step in identifying chatter. In this paper, an efficient PF-based multi-mode signal processing method, i.e., Spline-Based Local Mean Decomposition (SBLMD), has been used to decompose the experimentally acquired sound signals into a series of PFs and then, selected PFs have been used to reconstruct the new chatter signal, which is rich in information. Further, two three-layer ANN-based prediction models are established to predict the CI and MRR. Three process-related variables, such as tool speed, feed speed, and cut depth, have been used to develop ANN models. Statistical comparisons have been conducted to obtain the optimal training algorithm and have found that the LM-based training algorithm was the best among the five other training algorithms. For the estimates of CI and MRR, the neurons in the hidden layer are optimized at 5 and 7 with the least mean squared errors (MSE), respectively. After applying MOPSO to ANN-based prediction models, the MOPSO-optimized ANNs are very sensitive to optimizing input layers. The optimal ranges for the Cut Depth (CD), Feed Speed (FS) and Tool Speed (TS) are 1.56–1.77 mm, 77–97 mm/min, and 2380–2880 rpm, respectively.},

First, a fuzzy number processing method based on fuzzy clustering that is more in line with the actual production was designed to replace the classic triangular fuzzy number. Second, based on the critical path theory, a more efficient method of critical operation block selection and critical operation movement were designed and applied them to the chemotaxis stage of bacterial foraging optimization algorithm to improve the accuracy of optimization and reduce invalid movement.

The electric fish optimization algorithm (EFO) is a new meta-heuristic algorithm. Because of its simplicity and easy implementation, it has attracted the attention of researchers. However, it still faces premature convergence and poor balance between exploration and exploitation. To address this problems, an orthogonal electric fish optimization algorithm with quantization (QOXEFO) is proposed in this paper. In QOXEFO, orthogonal cross-design and quantification technique are employed to enhance the diversity of population and convergence precision of EFO. Secondly, the dynamic boundary mechanism is adopted to improve the convergence speed of EFO. At the same time, a sine-based update strategy of active electrolocation is used to change the direction of movement of individuals, thereby helping them jump out of the local optimum. Finally, the CEC2017 benchmark function and Speed reducer design problem are used to verify the performance of the proposed QOXEFO. Experimental results and statistical analysis show that compared with 9 famous evolutionary algorithms, QOXEFO is competitive in solution accuracy and convergence speed.},

In this paper, we have developed the Markov chain model of the BOA and analyzed the convergence behavior of the algorithm. The Markov chain model of the BOA is constituted where the population sequence generated by the algorithm is found to be a finite homogenous Markov chain and the defined population state set is found to be reducible. Convergence analysis of the algorithm is performed mathematically using the Markov chain model of the algorithm with the help of global convergence theorem which is based on a random search algorithm satisfying two subtle conditions. The butterfly algorithm has been found to satisfy the conditions for the global convergence theorem to enact, whereof it guarantees the global convergence of the BOA. We have also tried to show experimentally that the convergence of the algorithm does not always have considerable impact on rate of convergence as it is influenced by various other factors. Moreover, the convergence of BOA has been compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms experimentally. Further, the effects of the parameters, namely sensory modality and power exponent on the performance of BOA, have been studied.},

The proposed algorithm is inspired by the AI-based competitive behavior exhibited by the individuals in a group while simultaneously improving themselves and establishing a role (leader, advocate, believer). LAB performance in computational time and function evaluations are benchmarked using other metaheuristic algorithms. The algorithm is validated using the CEC 2005 and CEC 2017 benchmark functions. The algorithm was applied to solve engineering problems, including abrasive water jet machining, electric discharge machining, micro-machining processes and turning of titanium alloy in a minimum quantity lubrication environment. LAB algorithm was validated using the Friedman rank test. The results were compared with other algorithms such as FA, CI, GA, SA, PSO, Multi-CI, CMAES, ABC, SADE, CLPSO, BSA, IA, WOA, SHO, AVOA, LSHADE-Cn-EpsiN, FDB-SFS and LSHADE.

Therefore, investigating and understanding how data are leaked from the information transmission platforms and protocols can lead us to a more secure environment. In this paper, we propose a framework to systematically find the most vulnerable information fields in a network protocol. To this end, focusing on the transport layer security (TLS) protocol, we perform different machine-learning-based fingerprinting attacks on the collected data from more than 70 domains (websites) to understand how and where this information leakage occurs in the TLS protocol. Then, by employing the interpretation techniques developed in the machine learning community and applying our framework, we find the most vulnerable information fields in the TLS protocol. Our findings demonstrate that the TLS handshake (which is mainly unencrypted), the TLS record length appearing in the TLS application data header, and the IV field are among the most critical leaker parts in this protocol, respectively.},

Classification of hydatid cyst types is very important to give the most suitable cure to patients.

The primary objective of this work is to develop a new image classification framework to classify hydatid cyst types. Firstly, we collected a computed tomography (CT) image dataset. This CT image dataset consists of 2416 CT images with five classes (hydatid cyst types). We proposed a new deep feature engineering dataset framework for this dataset. This framework consists of (i) deep feature extraction by deploying transfer learning, (ii) iterative feature selection using INCA (iterative neighborhood component analysis), and (iii) classification. In the first phase—the feature extraction phase—we extracted deep features by deploying ten pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The used CNNs are commonly used CNNs, and the deep features have been extracted using the last pooling and fully connected layers of these networks. INCA has been applied to the generated deep features by each feature vector. k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier has been utilized to generate predicted values of these 10 CNNs using the selected features by INCA. Our proposed INCA-based deep feature extractor attained over 92\% classification accuracy for each pretrained model. Our proposed framework reached over 92\% classification accuracies, clearly demonstrating that our proposed framework is good image classification.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is a life-threatening and consequential disease due to its invasive and proliferative trait, predominantly found in women. Early detection of the cancer is a significant contributor to improved mortality and hence is an area of keen focus for ongoing researches. However, developing a technique to diagnose the severity of the patients at an early stage is a challenging task. Manual diagnostic techniques are time-consuming and result in inaccurate diagnosis of breast cancer. Prompted by these facts, a quantum optimized rule-base generated automated framework is developed to cluster the data based on degree of criticality of the cancer patients and further classify it as benign or malignant utilizing probability of malignancy of the clusters along with assignment of grades of cancer. Firstly, after implementing data pre-processing step, significant features are selected using an integrated feature selection approach. An efficient weightage algorithm is proposed incorporating the knowledge of physicians and the benefits of regression analysis which thereby provides a novel approach for detection of breast cancer. A novel ensemble clustering and classification algorithm employing voting-based Weighted Interval Type-II Fuzzy Inference System and Staged Pegasos Quantum Support Vector Classifier is then developed basis the prioritization of clusters depicting the critical state of breast cancer. A grading approach is also proposed based on fuzzy linguistic multi-criteria decision making system. Finally, the research is validated on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The detailed implementation of the proposed integrated model is accomplished to establish its superiority over other existing models in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Incomplete multi-view clustering has attracted attention due to its ability to deal with clustering problems with incomplete information. However, most existing methods either ignore the local structure of the data or fail to consider the importance of different views. In addition, some methods based on mean filling may easily introduce useless information when the data has a large missing rate. To address these issues, this paper proposes an incomplete multi-view clustering algorithm based on graph regularized low-rank representations without using filling method. Specifically, we combine a distance regularization term and low-rank representation-based non-negativity constraints to directly learn graphs with global and local data structures from raw data. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weighted fusion mechanism in the model to learn a consistent representation of all views, which effectively avoids bad views from affecting the quality of the final fused consensus graph. Experimental results on six incomplete multi-view datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the best performance compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In the process of multi-label learning, feature selection methods are often adopted to solve the high-dimensionality problem in feature spaces. Most existing multi-label feature selection algorithms focus on exploring the correlation between features and labels and then obtain the target feature subset by importance ranking. These algorithms commonly use single-channel structure to obtain important features, which induces the excessive reliance on the ranking results and causes the loss of important features. However, the correlation between label-specific feature and label-instance is ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes Parallel Dual-channel Multi-label Feature Selection algorithm (PDMFS). We first introduce the concept of dual channel and design the algorithm model as two independent modules. The algorithm obtained different feature correlation sequences, thus avoided relevant feature loss. And then, the proposed algorithm uses the subspace model to select the feature subset with the maximum correlation and minimum redundancy for each sequence, thus obtaining feature subsets under respective correlations. Finally, the subsets are cross-merged to reduce the important feature loss caused by the serial structure processing single feature correlation. The experimental results on eight datasets and statistical hypothesis testing indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective.},

  abstract     = {Climate changes and the number of people in the world are increasingly affecting the environment. In order to reduce this impact, there are more and more alternatives to cars with internal combustion. Currently, the most used alternative is electric cars. This research aimed to rank electric cars according to their characteristics. It was selected 13 criteria according to which 20 alternatives were ranked. For this purpose, it was used two methods, DNMEREC (Double normalization Method based on the Removal Effects of Criteria) used to determine criterion weights objectively and DNCRADIS (Double normalization Compromise Ranking of Alternatives from Distance to Ideal Solution) method used to rank alternatives. Here, classical methods for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) are extended to contribute to a more stable ranking of alternatives. Unlike similar approaches, the same normalization has been used here, but in two ways, which represents an innovative approach in MCDM. The results of this approach have shown that the best-ranked alternative is A6 (Sono Sion), while the worst-ranked alternative is A2 (Smart EQ forfour). These results were confirmed with a comparative analysis of the results obtained using other MCDM methods and sensitivity analysis. The validation of the results and the application of the Spearman correlation coefficient have shown that the ranking of the alternatives is uniform and more stable when double normalization is applied than when classical methods with their normalization are used. In addition, this decision-making provides support to potential buyers for choosing electric cars.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the topic of smart manufacturing systems (SMS) has become the focus of attention for researchers and production experts because it enables intelligent optimization of production processes. Enterprises have started to use SMS and technologies to develop complex products, accurately predict customer needs, minimize production costs, increase flexibility in production, and analyze risks. However, enterprises needs more knowledge about the requirements and features which should be in place for SMS. Customizing SMS is more costly and takes more time than traditional manufacturing. For this reason, the system must be considered in its entirety during the design process and the requirements must be met. The features of the SMS technology to be used must also be determined during the design process. In this study, 6 main and 30 sub-features of the SMS are defined to enable its implementation. The objective is to analyze the impact of these features on the SMS technology. The weighting coefficients of the defined main and sub-features were calculated using the Fuzzy Full Consistency Method (F-FUCOM), one of the multi-criteria analysis (MCA). Later, these coefficients were used in the Fuzzy Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (F-MARCOS) method to determine SMS technologies. The analysis results provide some important information for companies planning to switch to the intelligent production system. When examining the results related to the main criteria, it was found that the best ranking was Internet of things (IoT), the second best ranking was cyber-physical systems (CPS), and the third best ranking was big data. For the sub-criteria, the best score was CPS, the second best score was IoT, and the third best was big data. Overall, the results show enterprises should prioritize IoT, CPS, and big data.},

  abstract     = {Railways are the backbone of complex and multimodal transport systems in Europe. To secure a larger share of the transport market and attract existing and future freight customers, further improvement in services is required. To achieve this goal, the use of new technologies in the era of railway automation and digitalization is required. Automatic train operation (ATO) in rail transport is considered a promising solution for providing cost-effective rail products. In this study, we define ATO as autonomous train operation and the feasibility of ATO deployment in rail freight is investigated. For this purpose, a knowledge-based approach is introduced to identify opportunities, problems, and the most appropriate grade of automation in rail freight. In a multi-stage process, Delphi questionnaires were combined with the analytic network process (ANP) method to investigate, define, and weight the determinants for ATO deployment. The final phase of the survey estimated the potential costs and drivers for different grades of automation. The results show that, in addition to the positive impacts of ATO, there are numerous challenges and risks that need to be analysed before ATO is implemented. In addition, the Delphi-ANP approach was used to identify the key determinants for decision-making prior to ATO implementation and the most viable alternative based on them. Investment cost, level of safety, energy saving, and reliability of management system are the most important determinants for the decision to implement ATO. The results of this study can effectively support rail infrastructure managers and operators in strategic planning and decision-making for ATO implementation in rail freight.},

It is therefore appropriate to consider decision support tools that take into account the characteristics of the products, the needs and requirements of producers, sellers and final consumers. The paper presents an age-based model for the inventory-routing problem of perishable commodities with stochastic demands. In particular, we propose a dynamic decision-making approach with a “moving” horizon that advances over time taking into account the more recent available information. This approach allows future decisions to be rescheduled in relation to new data, over a planning horizon of the same duration. To address a problem as realistic as possible, we assume that the demand for products of each age is unknown and we model this uncertainty by means of random variables with a probability distribution that can be estimated from historical data. Computational experiments on test cases based on a real-life agri-food company located in Southern Italy show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

They considered a single-degree-of-freedom of uncertainty in the urn, i.e., the problem deals with uncertainty stemming from the fact that the number of balls for two colors is unknown, but the total number of balls is known. We further generalize the problem by proposing a k-degree-of-freedom Ellsberg urn problem. In this setting of the problem, the Ellsberg urn contains a total of n balls, and each ball is either one of the $$k+1$$ colors. The numbers of balls of different colors are unknown and come from an unknown distribution. The number of balls of different colors is considered an uncertain variable.

Therefore, a new negation operation based on the maximum Deng entropy of mass function is presented in this paper. After iterative negations, the focal elements are finally converging to a specific proportion, and the maximum Deng entropy is obtained. Then the characteristics of the new negation are explained through some numerical examples. Compared with existing negation models, the proposed model has maximal uncertainty. The convergence speed is affected by the scale of the frame of discernment. Finally, the rate of Deng entropy increases and some properties are discussed.},

Diagnosability is a property that requires a large number of sensors for fault detection, which leads to expensive system deployment. To alleviate the above drawbacks, we propose a new property called intermittent fault manifestability, which is a weaker observation requirement for diagnosing the occurrence of intermittent faults. In order to verify the property, we consider fault events and their corresponding reset events and introduce two properties of f-manifestability and r-manifestability, respectively. Based on an intermittent fault pattern automaton, we first propose a diagnoser structure to track the occurrence of intermittent faults and prove that the verification of intermittent fault diagnosability can be transformed into the problem of detecting an intermittent fault language. Then, we present a pair verifier constructed by the strict composition of a fault diagnoser and a normal diagnoser, which are the subparts of the diagnoser with respect to the fault events and the normal events, respectively. Finally, we introduce necessary and sufficient conditions for verifying intermittent fault manifestability.},

  abstract     = {Entropies are widely applied in measuring the degree of uncertainties existing in frame of discernment. However, all of these entropies regard the frame as a whole that has already been determined, which does not conform to actual situations. In real life, everything comes in a sequence. So, how to measure uncertainties of the dynamic process of determining sequence of propositions contained in a frame of discernment is still an open issue, and no related research has been proceeded. Therefore, a novel ordinal entropy to measure uncertainty of frame of discernment considering the order of propositions is proposed in this paper. Compared with other traditional entropies, it manifests effects on degree of uncertainty brought by orders of propositions. For example, assume there exist three propositions, for ordinal belief entropy, the potential categories of situations are $$C_{3}^{1}C_{2}^{1}C_{1}^{1}$$ , which illustrates that the proposed entropy is able to measure more complex environment and more matches actual circumstances. But for other entropies, they have only one certain value for descriptions of actual situations and the ability of measuring environment is limited. In a general rule, if number of propositions is n, then there are $$\prod _{k=1}^{n}C_{k}^{1}$$ categories of description of situations with respect to ordinal belief entropy. Besides, some numerical examples are provided to verify the correctness and validity of the proposed entropy in this paper.},

  abstract     = {The maximum $${\log }_q$$ likelihood estimation method is a generalization of the known maximum $$\log $$ likelihood method to overcome the problem for modeling non-identical observations (inliers and outliers). The parameter q is a tuning constant to manage the modeling capability. Weibull is a flexible and popular distribution for problems in engineering. In this study, this method is used to estimate the parameters of Weibull distribution when non-identical observations exist. Since the main idea is based on modeling capability of objective function $$\rho (x;\varvec{\theta })=\log _q\big [f(x;\varvec{\theta })\big ]$$ , we observe that the finiteness of score functions cannot play a role in the robust estimation for inliers. The properties of Weibull distribution are examined. In the numerical experiment, the parameters of Weibull distribution are estimated by $$\log _q$$ and its special form, $$\log $$ , likelihood methods if the different designs of contamination into underlying Weibull distribution are applied. The optimization is performed via genetic algorithm. The modeling competence of $$\rho (x;\varvec{\theta })$$ and insensitiveness to non-identical observations are observed by Monte Carlo simulation. The value of q can be chosen by use of the mean squared error in simulation and the p value of Kolmogorov–Smirnov test statistic used for evaluation of fitting competence. Thus, we can overcome the problem about determining of the value of q for real data sets.},

For example, construction project management software can only be used manage a construction project. In the actual operation process, it is also found that unreasonable time arrangements often occur in various links, such as personnel scheduling and material distribution of engineering projects. It will not only cause a large waste of material resources, but also affect the effect of labor.

Diabetes is considered as severe syndrome as it causes severe damage to major parts of the body. Loss of vision, failure of kidneys, and vision loss are few examples of damages caused by this disease. Recently, in the year 2023, Diabetes Association from America has released several standards to patients suffering from diabetes. The standard includes guidelines to diagnose, prevent, and treat people suffering from diabetes. Therefore, any innovative approach facilitating early diagnosis of this serious disease is much need of the hour. Several machine learning algorithms have recently attracted more attention in the medical field and have been successfully used in a variety of medical applications. Thus, to function autonomously without seeking any assistance or help from a person, a well-known branch of machine learning called deep learning completes several related tasks parallely. The objective of this work is to design an efficient framework for the classification of the intrinsic complex diabetes dataset. Since tasks are assumed to be related to one another, the proposed framework which is a regularized version of multilayer perceptron has a massive advantage that it can identify the complex intricate features involved in the classification with very limited preprocessing layers. Therefore, the proposed work achieves better accuracy and outperforms well to the best of our knowledge.},

How to improve the algorithm model to improve the accuracy of sports training action classification needs further research. Based on BP neural network algorithm, this paper carries out the modeling of BP neural network signal classification algorithm and the construction of BP neural network, and deduces the BP algorithm in detail. Firstly, this paper applies genetic algorithm to the initial parameter selection of BP algorithm to avoid the local optimization problem. When carrying out chromosome coding, binary coding is easy to cause the problem of too long coding string, which also needs to be restored and decoded. The algorithm runs too long and the learning accuracy is not high. Therefore, this paper uses real coding. Through simulation analysis, it can be seen that the classification accuracy of the improved algorithm model is significantly higher than that of the simple BP algorithm. In addition, this paper analyzes the requirements of the sports training management visualization system, introduces the system structure framework and network topology, describes in detail the functions of the user information management module, the training plan management module, the training test management module, the competition information management module and the scientific research information management module, and tests the visualization function of the system.

  abstract     = {At present, wearable devices have some problems, such as poor adaptability to human motion behavior, and the recognition accuracy required for different wearers cannot be achieved. Based on the principle of deep learning algorithm, this paper realizes the development of intelligent rope skipping movement data monitoring system. Through the universal human body analysis model, the attention mechanism is introduced and embedded into the decoding network. The data set of rope skipping is classified by multiple labels, and the convolution of spatial graph is constructed, which is extended to the time series dynamics of moving human skeleton data. Aiming at the problem of complex information data in the process of moving human body recognition, we use pose estimation to calculate the key points of moving human body, extract the dynamic structure information of human skeleton sequence. Due to the problems of line of sight occlusion in the process of moving human target tracking, a target tracking algorithm based on multi domain convolution neural network is adopted to improve the feature extraction ability of the algorithm by segmenting the target to be tracked and identifying the area around the target. The data set of rope skipping is collected by wearable sensors, and the difference in the numerical range may be large, so the data is normalized. Finally, through the loss function, the fitting effect of neural network can be evaluated, and the gradient optimization model parameters can be calculated, and coping with different data changes. Through the final system performance test, it is verified that the accuracy rate of the system designed in this paper is above 90\%, which can effectively monitor the data of skipping rope and be used in the actual operation of skipping rope.},

  abstract     = {Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) are a grammar system that consists of string rewriting rules. The rules replace every symbol in a string in parallel with a successor to produce the next string, and this procedure iterates. In a stochastic context-free L-system (S0L-system), every symbol may have one or more rewriting rule, each with an associated probability of selection. Properly constructed rewriting rules have been found to be useful for modeling and simulating some natural and human engineered processes where each derived string describes a step in the simulation. Typically, processes are modeled by experts who meticulously construct the rules based on measurements or domain knowledge of the process. This paper presents an automated approach to finding stochastic L-systems, given a set of string sequences as input. The implemented tool is called the Plant Model Inference Tool for S0L-systems or PMIT-S0L. PMIT-S0L is evaluated using 960 procedurally generated S0L-systems in a test suite, which are each used to generate input strings, and PMIT-S0L is then used to infer the system from only the sequences. The evaluation shows that PMIT-S0L infers S0L-systems with up to 9 rewriting rules each in under 12 hours. Additionally, it is found that 3 sequences of strings are sufficient to find the correct original rewriting rules in $$100\%$$ of the cases in the test suite, and 6 sequences of strings reduce the difference in the associated probabilities to approximately $$1\%$$ or less.},

  abstract     = {The influence of distributed generation sources in the Islanded microgrid has adverse effects on frequency stability because of the absence of inertia. Accordingly, the concept of a virtual synchronous generator (VSG) has been proposed, which follows the behavior of conventional synchronous generators. The virtual inertia control can be implemented on energy storage systems (ESSs) as a part of a virtual synchronous generator. Virtual inertial control does not perform optimally against the uncertainty of islanded microgrid parameters and disturbances. Therefore, virtual inertial control requires a supplementary controller in its structure that is resistant to these effects. In this paper, a new robust output feedback control method was used to control the virtual inertia in a two-area microgrid, which is based on the linear matrix inequality. The proposed control method does not need to measure all modes and only uses the output feedback. We compared the results of the proposed controller for controlling the virtual inertia in multiple different scenarios by considering the uncertainty of the two-area microgrid parameters as well as disturbances applied to the microgrid with the virtual inertia control based on optimized PI controllers (genetic algorithm), no controller (virtual inertia), and without considering virtual inertia (conventional methods). Accordingly, the effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated in terms of response speed, reduction of the frequency deviations and tie-line power deviations, robustness against parameters’ uncertainty, and disturbances occurring to the two-area microgrid.},

  abstract     = {Learning Algorithm for Multivariable Data Analysis (LAMDA) is a fuzzy approach, which has been used in clustering and classification processes. Recently, extensions have been proposed for LAMDA, to improve its performance in classification tasks. The first one is called LAMDA-FAR, which proposes a new criterion to validate functional states after recognition, based on the minimum and maximum calculated distances between the two membership degrees with the highest values. The second extension is called LAMDA-HAD, which proposes two strategies to improve LAMDA performance. The first strategy calculates an adaptive Global Adequacy Degree (GAD) of the Non-Informative Class (NIC) to each class to prevent that correctly classified individuals will be assigned to the NIC class. The second strategy calculates the similarity among the GAD of an individual and all ones of each class, to make a more reliable assignment. This article analyzes the performance of these techniques for different classification problems. The goal is to define the application context for each one. Each case study was defined by a set of data in an operational context, which must be used by the classification techniques to obtain accurate results. LAMDA-HAD was better with unbalanced classes, while LAMDA-FAR was excellent for discovering new classes. Both algorithms worked well for different levels of noise (which can represent faults in the sensors), a factor important in diagnostic tasks. The aim of this paper is to determine the correct utilization profile of each LAMDA technique adjusted to the properties of the problems under study.},

Therefore, before reaching the final stage of this heart disease, all precautionary measures must be taken. For this reason without the help of any kind of traditional methods, if we can scientifically diagnose heart disease at an early stage through various decision support systems, then surely death rate of this disease will decrease in the whole world. Many researchers investigate the diagnosis of heart disease by creating various intelligent medical decision support systems. Artificial neural network concepts represent the highest predictive accuracy over medical data compared to other decision support systems. In this paper, we propose a better prediction method for the existence of heart disease through the scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation of artificial neural networks using K-fold cross-validation. For cardiac datasets, the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository and IEEE data port have been used. For Cleveland processed heart dataset, the proposed system uses 13 input attributes and provides minimum 63.3803\% and maximum 100\% accurate results; similarly, for Cleveland Hungarian Statlog heart dataset, the proposed system uses 11 input attributes and provides minimum 88.4754\% and maximum 100\% accurate results by estimating the presence and absence of heart disease during testing.},

Nowadays, forest managers are looking for decision support system tools which evaluate the aesthetic quality of forest landscapes, particularly in the development of human ecosystem services. In our methodology, the aesthetic quality of environment is assessed with a human-perception-based approach to apply three machine learning techniques (support vector machine (SVM), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP)) for the aesthetic quality simulation of forest areas. To perform this method, the landscape attributes (13 features) were defined in 72 Hyrcanian broad leaves forest landscapes. The landscapes aesthetic quality model was designed to determine the visual qualities by machine learning techniques. Considering the results, MLP model was detected as the most practical, reliable and accurate model for evaluation of landscape quality in broad leaves forest areas. Comparing to RBFNN (R2 = 0.809), and SVM (R2 = 0.829), MLP (R2 = 0.878) model represents the most reliable results of R2 in the test data set. The number of species, tree density, Alnus subcordata, canopy density, altitude and Carpinus betulus in forest areas were detected as the main influential factors of the MLP model. On the other hand, the designed graphical user interface tool finds the most scenic landscapes for peoples who are looking for relaxation and recreation services in the nature. The forested lands planted according to the ecological techniques could be designed with resulted aesthetics criteria.},

This work proposes handling the hesitance of respondents’ opinions for the rating scale questions. To evaluate the collected opinions, a three-level aggregation model is developed. In the first level, the overall opinion of each respondent is computed as a mean of fuzzy numbers covering uncertain answers and their respective hesitance. In the second level, stakeholder groups are considered as a whole. Aggregation by a relative quantifier is applied to calculate the validity of a proposition the majority of respondents have a positive or negative opinion. At the third level, the consensus among diverse subsets of stakeholder groups is calculated considering the relevance of each group independently as well as their so-called coalitions by Choquet integral. Finally, the proposed model is illustrated by a real-life case study.},

However, most of the existing consensus-reaching methods for MCGDM problems fail to adequately consider the effects of these interactions among criteria and experts, which may bring about inaccurate results. Therefore, this paper establishes a novel MCGDM framework based on the generalized Shapley value to solve the consensus-reaching problem with interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets (IVPFS). First, experts’ evaluations are collected using IVPFS, which offers a more flexible way to express this vague information. Second, the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Choquet integral operator and the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Shapley aggregation operator are developed to fuse the decision information with complementary, redundant, or independent characteristics. Third, an integrated consensus-reaching algorithm is established to improve group consensus by iteratively updating the evaluations until the group consensus level reaches the preset threshold. Then, the classical PROMETHEE method is extended using the generalized Shapley value within an IVPFS context to derive a more scientific ranking result. Finally, a case study for a sustainable supplier evaluation problem is presented to validate the proposed method. The results and comparative analysis show that the proposed method can represent experts’ evaluations more flexibly, integrate inputs with interrelationships more effectively, and improve group consensus more efficiently.},

Preferential voting is a decision-making method based on a linear programming model with weight restrictions, which in combination with KEMIRA can significantly eliminate its shortcomings. This paper presents the new Voting-KEMIRA method to achieve this purpose. First, the voting model is designed as a multiple objective decision-making (MODM) problem. Then, to reduce the computational complexity, the problem is reformulated as a linear programming model. It is then solved with a goal programming approach. Finally, the new hybrid method has been implemented on a real-world problem of a hospital construction and compared to the previous method. A significant reduction of calculations in decision-making has been achieved. In the Voting-KEMIRA model, criteria weights can be calculated more accurately and it also allows for use of numerous experts in determining the weights of the criteria.},

  abstract     = {In the prediction of turning points (TPs) of time series, the improved model of integrating piecewise linear representation and weighted support vector machine (IPLR-WSVM) has achieved good performance. However, due to the single data source and the limitation of algorithm, IPLR-WSVM has encountered challenges in profitability. In this paper, a model fusion method based on multi-source heterogeneous data and different learning algorithms is proposed for the prediction of TPs (MF-MSHD). Multi-source heterogeneous data include weighted unstructured and structured information with different granularities. RF, WSVM, BPNN, GBDT, and LSTM are selected to be the learning algorithms. The differences among meta-models are constructed by different inputs and algorithms as much as possible, and a model fusion rule is designed to determine the final TPs. Moreover, the TPs are generated based on the characteristics of individual stock. For sentiment analysis, a more accurate sentiment dictionary of stock market comments is established. Specifically, the fine-grained data is introduced to jointly determine the accurate trading moment. The prediction level of the proposal improves the accuracy and profitability, and also outperforms the composite indexes. Experimental results show that the profit rate of randomly selected stocks in MF-MSHD reaches 0.5172, while the highest value is 0.2841 in single meta-model and 0.0992 in buy and hold strategy, respectively. The other indicators including the accuracy are also modified. Compared with the increases of 0.1648, 0.4051, and 0.3397 in Shanghai Composite Index, Shenzhen Composite Index, and CSI 300 Index, MF-MSHD shows higher profitability in stock trading signal prediction.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the problem of customer allocation to facilities with regard to some fuzzy parameters. In this problem, each customer is assigned to the nearest facility. Assigning a client to a facility includes a cost for the client due to the distance between the client and the facility. It is assumed that distances are fuzzy numbers. Moreover, each facility has a fuzzy efficiency which is calculated by the data envelopment analysis method with fuzzy parameters. The higher efficiency of the facility to which a customer is assigned, cause more profit for the customer. The goal is allocation of all customers to the facilities such that the profitability of the least profits for the customers is maximized. In addition, to prevent queuing in some facilities, we consider the balancing on allocation customers to the facilities. Therefore, the second goal is minimizing the difference between the maximum and minimum number of customers that are assigned to different facilities. A fuzzy bi-objective programming model is presented for the problem, then three fuzzy approaches are proposed and compared for solving this model. Finally, a real data empirical analysis on education in the schools shows the applicability and strength of proposed models.},

  abstract     = {Optimal power flow (OPF) is a complex, highly nonlinear, NP-hard optimization problem, in which the goal is to determine the optimal operational parameters of a power-related system (in many cases a type of smart or micro grid) which guarantee an economic and effective power dispatch. In recent years, a number of approaches based on metaheuristics algorithms have been proposed to solve OPF problems. In this paper, we propose the use of the Cross-Entropy (CE) method as a first step depth search operator to assist population-based evolutionary methods in the framework of an OPF problem. Specifically, a new variant of the Coral Reefs Optimization with Substrate Layers algorithm boosted with CE method (CE+CRO-SL) is presented in this work. We have adopted the IEEE 57-Bus System as a test scenario which, by default, has seven thermal generators for power production for the grid. We have modified this system by replacing three thermal generators with renewable source generators, in order to consider a smart grid approach with renewable energy production. The performance of CE+CRO-SL in this particular case study scenario has been compared with that of well-known techniques such as population’s methods CMA-ES and EPSO (both boosted with CE). The results obtained indicate that CE+CRO-SL showed a superior performance than the alternative techniques in terms of efficiency and accuracy. This is justified by its greater exploration capacity, since it has internally operations coming from different heuristics, thus surpassing the performance of classic methods. Moreover, in a projection analysis, the CE+CRO-SL provides a profit of millions of dollars per month in all cases tested considering the modified version of the IEEE 57-Bus smart grid system.},

  abstract     = {The process of optimal operation of multipurpose reservoirs is accompanied by large dimensions of decision variables and the uncertainty of hydrological parameters and water demands. Therefore, in determining the optimal operation policies (OOPs), the decision making for water allocation is faced with problems and complexities. One of the effective approaches for sustainable management and optimal allocation from water resources is the multi-objective structural development based on the uncertainty of input parameters. The purpose of this study is to provide OOPs from Karaj AmirKabir multi-purpose reservoir with applying uncertainty in the inflow to reservoir and downstream water demand. The proposed approach has been investigated in two certain and uncertain models, and three objective functions of the system including maximizing hydropower generation, water supply demands, and flood control have been considered to formulate OOPs. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was performed to optimize the three proposed objective functions and by applying multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, the best operation scenario was selected. In the uncertainty model, using the interval method and repeated implementation of the deterministic model for completely random scenarios that generated based on the variation interval of the uncertain parameters, the non-deterministic optimal allocation values were produced. Based on these optimal allocation values and the fitting of the standard probability distribution on it, the probability of occurrence of the deterministic allocation values was determined. Production of optimal probabilistic allocation policies can be very useful and efficient in providing real vision to managers to select appropriate policies in different conditions and rare hydrological events. The results obtained from the certain model shows that as a result of optimal allocation to demands, the fuzzy reliability, resiliency, and system stability indexes were improved to 67.81, 21.99, and 24.98 percentage, respectively. Also, in an uncertain model, applying changes of 48\% and 22\%, respectively, for the inflow and downstream demand has led to changes of 23\%, 55\%, and 18\%, respectively, in the first, second, and third objective functions. The highest impact from uncertain conditions, has been related to the water supply demands with 55\% of the range of variations So, the water supply demands, has a higher sensitivity and priority than other reservoir objective functions under uncertain conditions. Another important result extracted from this study is to determine the monthly probability of optimal allocations achievement. Accordingly, in the warm seasons and years in which the reservoir is facing drought, the occurrence probability of the optimal allocations decreases. Given the comprehensiveness of the proposed methodology, this approach is a very suitable tool for determining the optimal water allocations as probabilistic based on the scenarios desired by managers and reservoir operators.},

Considering these issues, the load balancing objective was taken into consideration. Moreover, the current study has implemented a novel Fruitfly-based transfer learning for sharing the required resources to each Virtual Machine (VM) for the task execution. Initially, the Virtual Machines (VMs) were created with different user tasks then the load was balanced by equally sharing the burden with other connected VMs. Consequently, the task ordering function was performed based on priority, and the required resources were assigned. Moreover, the planned model was tested in the python platform, and the metrics were measured. Also, the improved score for enhancing cloud services is validated by performing a comparative analysis. The shortest duration for the job scheduling process is 180 s, execution time 700 s and response time 15 s. These outcomes are better than the compared conventional models.

  abstract     = {In this era of trying to get more information from data, demand forecasting plays a very important role for companies. Companies implement many of their plans based on these forecasts. However, forecasting demand is not always easy. Demand is divided into many different classes depending on its structure. One of them is the problem of intermittent demand. Estimating intermittent demand is a more difficult problem than estimating series with low variability and no null demand. When working with intermittent demands, either a good demand forecast or a good inventory policy is required. Determining an efficient inventory policy is important in terms of meeting customer demand and customer satisfaction. In this study, an inventory lower bound and upper bound are calculated to balance the inventory cost of intermittent demand and the lost sale cost. For this purpose, 7 different test data with intermittent demand structure were studied. A mathematical model is proposed to calculate the cost with the upper and lower inventories under intermittent demand. A feasible solution could not be obtained with the proposed model, and a fitness function for the relevant model was proposed. This function was run on test data using genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results and solution times of GA and PSO were compared. In this way, the variability of demand and the difference between arrival times of demands were met with minimal cost.},

In the first stage, a global radial basis function (RBF) surrogate model is constructed with all historical solutions and is used to evaluate the positions of monkeys in the climb process and watch-jump process. Such global RBF model is updated with the positions of monkeys and their real objective function values after the second round of the climb process for each iteration. In the second stage, a local RBF surrogate model is built with a set of current best solutions, which can help to select the most promising sample so as to further locally improve the solution searched in the first stage. Experimental studies are conducted on eight benchmark optimization problems with the number of dimensions varying from 30 to 100, and numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than five other state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted algorithms with a limited budget of function evaluations.},

The adjustment phase is implemented using the simplex algorithm for search better location of the worst agent within a small region. The effectiveness of the BSO is validated on the CEC2017 benchmark problems, three classical engineering structural problems and neural network training models.

The procedure combines the differential evolution method with a $$k$$ -nearest neighbors (k-NN) similarity-based surrogate model. In this approach, the database that stores the solutions evaluated by the exact model, which are used to approximate new solutions, is managed according to a merit scheme. Constraints are handled by a rank-based technique that builds multiple separate queues based on the values of the objective function and the violation of each constraint. Also, to avoid premature convergence of the method, a strategy that triggers a random reinitialization of the population is considered. The performance of the proposed method is assessed by numerical experiments using 24 constrained benchmark functions and 5 mechanical engineering problems.

  abstract     = {Identification of a person on the basis of different characteristics is a prevailing area of research. Both behavioral biometrics and physical biometrics are used as measures to recognize a person’s identity. Physical biometrics includes fingerprints and IRIS patterns; whereas behavioral biometrics includes some sort of pattern in human activities like handwriting. Handwriting, like other biometrics, is one of the best attributes for implicitly identifying a person. Every person has a different style of handwriting. Gender prediction on the basis of handwriting styles in different Indian and non-Indian scripts offers a vast area for research and is an effective strategy for biometrics. This paper&#39;s major goal is to give an in-depth analysis of gender prediction using handwriting in non-Indic and Indic scripts. The intention is to provide a variety of feature extraction methods, datasets available, and a taxonomy of conventional and machine learning-based tools for gender prediction on the basis of handwriting. This article discusses the context, survey protocol, methodology, and various datasets used by the various researchers. The compiled study used for feature extraction and classification methods, along with a critical analysis of the work done, is also elaborated in this manuscript.},

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are designed to detect malicious activities that attempt to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and assurance of computer systems. Intrusion detection system has become the most widely employed security technology. The novelty of the proposed research is to develop a system for IDSs. In this research, a support-vector machine (SVM) with ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed to detect an intrusion. Standard data sets, namely Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) Cup &#39;99 and Network Security Laboratory (NSL)-KDD, were utilized to test the results of the proposed system. One of the greatest challenges in a network analysis dataset is dimensionality. To handle dimensionality reduction, the ant colony optimization algorithm was applied. In the ACO method, significant subset features are selected from the entire dataset. These subset features have proceeded the SVM machine learning algorithm for detection intrusion. The empirical results point out that the SVM with ACO has obtained superior accuracy. It is concluded that the SVM-ACO model can more efficiently protect a network system from intrusion.},

  abstract     = {Recently, product/ service reviews and online businesses have been similar to the blood–heart relationship as they greatly impact customers’ purchase decisions. There is an increasing incentive to manipulate reviews, mostly profit-motivated, as positive reviews imply high purchases and vice versa. Therefore, a suitable fake review detection approach is paramount in ensuring fair e-business competition and sustainability. Most existing methods mainly utilize discrete review features such as text similarity, rating deviation, review content, product information, the semantic meaning of reviews, and reviewer behaviors. In the matter of discourse, some recent researchers attempted multi-feature (review- and reviewer-centric features) integration. However, such approaches face two issues: (1) Review representation is extracted in an independent manner, thus ignoring correlations between them (2) Lack of a unified framework that can jointly learn latent text feature vectors, aspect ratings, and overall rating. To address the named issues, we propose a novel Deep Hybrid Model for fake review detection, which jointly learns from latent text feature vectors, aspect ratings, and overall ratings. Initially, it computes contextualized review text vectors, extracts aspects, and calculates respective rating values. Then, contextualized word vectors, overall ratings, and aspect ratings are concatenated. Finally, the model learns to classify reviews from such unified multi-dimensional feature representation. Extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline approaches.},

  abstract     = {Recently, for the abstractive summarization task, most of proposed techniques have adopted the deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequential auto-encoding architecture to effectively learn and generate meaningful summaries for different input documents. However, most of recent RNN-based models always suffer the challenges related to the involvement of much capturing high-frequency/reparative phrases in long documents during the training process which leads to the outcome of trivial and generic summaries are generated. In addition, the lack of thorough analysis on the sequential and long-range dependency relationships between words within different contexts while learning the textual representation also makes the achieved summaries unnatural and incoherent. In order to deal with these challenges, in this paper we proposed a novel semantic-enhanced generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach for abstractive text summarization task, called as: SGAN4AbSum. We use an adversarial training strategy for our text summarization model which trains the generator and discriminator to simultaneously handle the summary generation and distinguishing the generated summary with the ground-truth one. The input of generator is the jointed rich-semantic and global structural latent representations of training documents which are achieved by applying a combined BERT and graph convolutional network textual embedding mechanism. Extensive experiments in benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SGAN4AbSum which achieve the competitive ROUGE-based scores in comparing with state-of-the-art abstractive text summarization baselines.},

TRANScriPtion fActor REgulatory NeTwork (TRANSPARENT) is a user-friendly Python tool designed to help researchers in studying given biological tasks or given diseases in human, by identifying transcription factors controlling and regulating the expression of genes associated with that task or disease. The tool takes in input a list of gene IDs and provides (1) a set of transcription factors that are significantly associated with the input genes, (2) the correspondent P values (i.e., the probability that this observed association was driven by chance) and (3) a transcription factor network that can be directly visualized through STRING database. The effectiveness and reliability of the tool were assessed by applying it to two different test cases: schizophrenia and autism disorders. The obtained results clearly show that identified TFs, for both datasets, are significantly associated with those disorders, in terms of both gene enrichment and coherence with the literature.

In the latest research, multi-view learning model using privileged information is proposed; specific models are PSVM-2V and MCPK. In these models, views complement each other by acting as privileged information policies; however, a single view contains privileged information that can guide the classifier, and the existing framework does not consider it. In order to use this information to correct multi-view support vector machine classifier, we propose a framework for generating a series of small-scale views based on information hidden in a single view, which extends the original multi-view parallel structure to a hierarchical structure with sub-view mechanism. In this paper, two sub-view learning structures SL-PSVM-2V and SL-MCPK are constructed. The two new models fully exploit the data features in the view. Similarly, they follow the principles of consistency and complementarity. We use the standard quadratic programming solver to solve the new model. In 55 groups of classification experiments, the proposed model improves the classification accuracy by about 1.91\% on the original basis. SL-MCPK ranks 1.3846 on average in the accuracy experiment, indicating that they have good classification ability. In addition, the computational time statistics and noise data set experiments are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method from multiple perspectives.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the reason for cancer death, with high morbidity and mortality. Computed tomography is one of the efficient medical imaging tools for lung cancer diagnosis, which offers internal lung details. However, as there is limited availability of datasets and requires large number of images for interpretation, it is hard for radiologists to diagnose lung cancer. The generative adversarial network (GAN) is a significant generative model employed for data augmentation, which has the benefit of simulating data distribution without the explicit modeling of potential probability density functions. Despite the benefits of GAN, training process remains challenging due to high convergence time and mode collapse problems. To resolve these issues, in this paper, a Hessian Adaptive Learning (HAL) Optimization technique. The proposed HL technique uses gradient and curvature data to eliminate the mode collapse problem and to improve the dataset size via a generation of diverse images. The experiments were conducted on Vanilla GAN, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN), Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), Wasserstein, and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). Each GAN is tested using stochastic Gradient descent (SGD), Gauss–Newton (GN) Second-order learning, and proposed HAL optimization techniques. The experimental outcomes prove that the GANs with HAL optimization technique yields better performance compared to SGD and GN models. The experimental results assured that the GANs converge fast and eliminate mode collapse problems using HAL optimization.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is a set of long-term metabolic issues characterized by high blood glucose levels over a drawn-out time. It is a challenging and threatening disease because nearly half of patients who have diabetes do not know that they have it. Data mining techniques have been heavily utilized to predict diabetes in its earliest stage, and therefore can potentially reduce medication costs. Most of the existing research used metaheuristics to optimize neural network parameters or used other data mining algorithms to classify diabetes. This research integrates design of experiments (DOE), genetic algorithm (GA), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify diabetic patients. Two sets of factorial designs were used to determine an optimal set of parameters for the GA. GA is used to optimize the parameters in the MLP, where the MLP acts as a simulator within the GA to provide the fitness evaluation of the solutions. The best resulting solution from DOE–GA–MLP represents the optimized MLP that achieves the highest classification accuracy in diabetes patients. The proposed approach outperforms eight different classification algorithms in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-score. The developed DOE–GA–MLP model presents a robust predictive tool that can help healthcare professionals identify patients with diabetes in its early stage. Intervention and/or preventive strategies can be implemented in those identified cases to improve patient care and possibly reduce diabetes rates and potential expenditures.},

However, Python logic is used in this, which mitigates the drawbacks of fuzzy logic in MATLAB. The type of clothing, level of grime, and load of clothing are the inputs for this procedure, and the wash time, RPM, dry time, and temperature are the outputs.

This subjectivity results from several factors, in particular, the high number of components in the system studies, connections and structural interactions, and functional dependencies between the components including operating conditions. Also, physical factors and environmental influence the state and functioning of the system. All these factors alternate the credibility and perfection of data as well as security analysis results. Although the QRA method is effective, its application is very costly in terms of time and effort, which requires competent specialists. It is right that several aspects are not well supported by conventional QRA. Paving the way for further improvements and suggesting soft computing approaches using fuzzy sets and logic although various other approaches can be adopted such as fuzzy probability theory approach. A good review of the QRA approach in various fields is also appreciated as the availability and quality of the data restrict the objectivity and effectiveness of QRA and secondly the results of QRA either the steps taken are qualitative or quantitative are associated with uncertainty or impreciseness and compel to adopt soft computing approach. Four types of uncertainties are covered: Uncertainty associated with input parameters, stochastic/ontological uncertainty, Assessment and reduction in risk and modeling of dangerous effects. The uncertainties inherent in QRA approach are dealt with using tools from the theory of fuzzy sets and that of possibility and helpful in flexible solutions allowing for adaptive risk management.},

Applying the proposed approximation to Telegraph model equation, we have established unconditional stability on a time-graded mesh. Linear difference schemes are solved by direct methods, that is, using a tri-diagonal solver and Newton–Raphson iterative method employed to handle nonlinear difference equations at each advanced time level. An order two in time explicit scheme at first time level is derived, which can be used in the proposed approximation while computing. Seven important benchmark problems are computed to validate the utility of the proposed 3-level implicit approximation.},

However, China&#39;s online sales are far below half of the United States. One of the important reasons is the privacy risks of e-commerce and insufficient consumer trust, but it still hinders the development of e-commerce online shopping applications. According to the trust survey, interaction is an important condition for generating trust and an important element. However, in the existing e-commerce trust surveys, the impact of interaction is analyzed, but few surveys only have an impact on consumers&#39; shopping tendency. Therefore, this article considers the importance of reliability of e-commerce online shopping applications, as well as issues related to consumer privacy protection between blockchain and mobile clients. On this basis, this article explores the impact of consumer platform based shopping websites on reliability and the factors and mechanisms of consumer shopping behavior through theoretical analysis and empirical research, and designs a survey validation table for blockchain and mobile client privacy protection. The shopping direction identification system of e-commerce consumers has to some extent made up for the shortcomings of previous empirical research on e-commerce trust behavior.

Using intelligent robot technology to complete programming to design and process is an important research direction in related fields. In this context, this study strives to design a unitary production scheduling algorithm, which is implemented based on artificial intelligence technology. After testing, this algorithm has the best performance, the shortest running time, relatively low power consumption and short product processing cycle. The system design framework includes three parts: the communication design between physical control equipment and PC, the interactive control software design of PC, and the virtual controlled object model design. From the research results, it can be concluded that the realization of production scheduling algorithm design for intelligent manufacturing cells can help enterprises to make rational allocation of order size and resources, so as to improve production efficiency while taking into account the low-carbon production concept widely promoted by the international community.

Through the establishment of the Ministry of natural resources, the planning of the national space system was carried out, and the historical division phenomenon within the administrative institutions was solved by using the transformation of fragmentation. Subsequently, relevant functional departments began to design the land spatial planning system and coordinate the mechanism. From the policy guidance, it can be seen that land use spatial planning has risen to the central position in the national management system. From the current situation of planning control, planning control becomes more and more important in the management process. At the same time, the construction of ecological civilization requires us to examine the regulatory mechanism from a new perspective. Therefore, based on machine vision technology, this paper develops a land use spatial planning method system. The sub-pixel edge detection algorithm used in the system design can obtain the point coordinates on the edge of the gauge block with high accuracy. After testing, we can see that in terms of storage space, the octree map used in this paper can save more space than the point cloud map under the same resolution. The data results obtained from the test are also better than the existing system, indicating that the machine vision spatial planning system studied in this paper can better serve the field of land and resources planning.},

  abstract     = {Microgrids having renewable energies like wind and solar necessitate competent control and optimization to ensure system frequency stability. The intermittent behavior of the wind and solar influences the system frequency badly. This issue is appearing prominent in case of multi-interconnected microgrids. Hence, in this study, a fractional calculus-based integral tilt derivative with filter (ITDF)-based frequency regulation control strategy is utilized in a multi-microgrid. Here, the two unequal control zones with renewable energy and thermal generating power sources are connected through AC/DC parallel interfaces. A recent Jaya optimization method is exploited to tune the design variables of the controller. The comparative analyses of the dynamic response of the suggested control strategy with some existing control strategies like proportional integral derivative with filter (PIDF)/tilt integral derivative with filter (TIDF)/integral proportional derivative with filter (IPDF) exhibit the effectiveness of the suggested control strategy to suppress the frequency fluctuations. This paper also implements an accurate high-voltage direct current (AHVDC) line model and evaluates the results of the system by replacing conventional HVDC with AHVDC tie-line. Further, to enhance the frequency regulation, the inertia emulation controlling technique is executed which permits the exploitation of the accumulated energy in capacitors of HVDC interface for load frequency control. A comparative analysis shows the better dynamic response with AHVDC link with inertia emulation control strategy in parallel with AC link in comparison to conventional HVDC.},

A comparative qualitative and quantitative analysis of 12 algorithms for training artificial neural networks (ANN) which predict the HHV of biomass using the proximate analysis is given. Fixed carbon, volatile matter and ash percentage were utilized as inputs. Each ANN had the same structure but a different training algorithm (BFGS Quasi Newton, Bayesian Regularization, Conjugate Gradient—Powell/Beale Restarts, Fletcher–Powell Conjugate Gradient, Polak–Ribiére Conjugate Gradient, Gradient Descent, Gradient Descent Momentum, Variable Learning Rate Gradient Descent, Levenberg–Marquardt, One Step Secant, Resilient Backpropagation, Scaled Conjugate Gradient). To ensure an extended applicability of our results to a wide range of different biomass species, the data conditioning was based on diverse experimental data gathered from the literature, 447 samples overall. Out of these, 301 datasets were used for the training, validation and testing by MathWorks MATLAB Neural Network Fitting Application and by custom designed codes, and 146 remaining datasets were used for the independent evaluation of all training algorithms. The HHV predictions of the ANN-based fitting functions were thoroughly tested and intercompared, to which purpose we developed a test suite which applies mean squared error, coefficient of the determination, mean Poisson deviance, mean Gamma deviance and Friedman test.

  abstract     = {Domain Name System flood attacks are generally carried out in the application layer with the user datagram protocol. This type of attack is a vulnerability that concerns almost all web assets of web services. Various studies provide different security solutions to handle these attacks, but cyber-attackers find some unique approaches to exploit Domain Name Systems. In this study, we focused on Domain Name System flood attacks, which involve delaying or blocking services by increasing the memory and processor usage of Domain Name System servers. In order to separate the measurements of Domain Name System server traffic from legitimate network traffic, flooding attacks were detected with an innovative hybrid deep learning model consisting of a convolutional neural network with a long short-term memory model. This proposed model has been validated with the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset obtained from traffic data that causes flooding of the Domain Name System over HyperText Markup Language requests. Validation metrics were compared with widely used support vector machines, shallow neural networks and deep learning classifiers with long short-time model. As a result, very low false alarms and significantly high detection accuracy (99.54\%) were achieved using the proposed hybrid deep learning classification. The proposed method for direct detection of domain system attacks without feature optimization and statistical methods such as coding of tags, normalization and standardization of data offers a comprehensive solution based on these metrics.},

To estimate the stereo correspondence results, the method exploits the temporal information and machine learning. In other words, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained using the temporally preceding disparity maps in order to be used as predictor for the stereo correspondence of the current pair. The algorithm starts by extracting edge points from the omnidirectional images using a spherical edge points detector. The spherical rectification is then performed on three omnidirectional pairs, which would include the current pair, the left image and its preceding one, the right image and its preceding one. The temporally preceding disparity maps are used to generate disparity ranges for the current ones as well as to train an SVM classifier. The trained SVM along with a dynamic programming method is then used on the three stereo pairs resulting in three disparity maps. Finally, the three disparity maps are combined into one $$360^\circ $$ final disparity map. The proposed approach has been evaluated on real omnidirectional sequences and the results provided are satisfactory.},

In this paper, a hybridized Artificial Potential Field (APF)-Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (BFGS) Quasi-Newton technique is being proposed for the trajectory planning of the humanoid robot. The proposed methodology combines the faster local search BFGS Quasi-Newton method with the global search APF method for an efficient and faster-hybridized trajectory planning technique. The humanoid robot herein is being tested in a multi-humanoid working space having uneven surfaces. The data obtained from the sensors concerning the location of obstacles and the target are at first imparted to the APF method, which supplies an intermediate turning angle dependent on the predesigned training model of the APF method. The obtained turning angle is then fed into the BFGS quasi-newton method to produce an optimum turning angle, which inevitably guides the humanoid robots to the target by keeping a minimum safe distance from the obstacles. Multi-humanoid robots are employed in an environment having random static obstacles, with unique targets for them to reach. The proposal of using a multi-humanoid system arises the chance of inter-collision among the humanoids. To get rid of this situation, the dining philosophers controller is being implemented. The simulations and experiments are carried using the proposed technique to ratify the efficacy of the proposed technique. The experimental and simulation results yield a suitable acceptance rate under 5\%. In comparison with the previously used navigational technique, it proves to be comfortably skillful and robust for the trajectory planning of the humanoid robot.},

Recently, machine learning (ML) methods emerge as a powerful tool among these techniques and have great contributions to automated beehive monitoring systems with low cost and better performance. By analyzing the data collected from beehives, ML algorithms are able to solve a number of crucial problems in monitoring the beehives such as early detecting the phenomena of swarming, identifying the bee queen’s absence, and recognizing pest infestations. In this study, we suggest several techniques to enhance the performance of the machine learning models applied to monitoring the honey beehives. Particularly, we apply an advanced technique for tuning hyper-parameters of the ML models and investigate the new Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) features. The obtained results show that our proposed methods can improve significantly the accuracy of these ML-based models in recognizing and classifying the bee buzzing from other ambient noises, making them even better than plural deep learning algorithms suggested in the literature. In addition, we introduce a new dataset of bee sound samples and we verify the efficiency of our proposed models on the new dataset.},

This study aimed to focus on controlling water salinity used to water the green area that have measured the concentration fluctuations of the influent and effluent parameters, e.g., Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Electrical Conductivity (EC), Temperature, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and pH. In the first step, we tried to obtain a model using general regressions, e.g., the linear or nonlinear approaches. Here, it was assumed that the reason for failing these approaches on modeling was an unsteady operation of the zeolite behavior on wastewater purgation, which could be trained by a lag-time associated with time series analysis, e.g., ARIMA. The second step was to use the Fuzzy Inference System, FIS, for finding the relation between the COD concentration value of the effluent with the concentrations of TDS, TSS, and EC of influent. Finally, to achieve a model for simulating the removal of COD against other parameters, the Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was used. The vague and intangible zeolite behavior led to form the fuzzy inference systems, and there thus resulted in good distribution between estimated and observed data. Because the regression coefficient on comparing the simulated distribution of COD concentration of daily effluent with the line of 1:1 was 0.764. The results revealed that two extreme points existed for the fluctuations of COD concentration effluent led to its lowest or highest levels due to the concentration fluctuations of Na and NH4 + , where its removal efficiency has maximum or minimum without the steady-state conditions. This study observed that the role of zeolite was the disruption of ion-exchange stability by constantly arousing their interaction and has the reason of failure iteration to improve the regression coefficient of linear and nonlinear functions via the curve fitting approach and clustering analysis with and without normalized data. The fuzzy set theory was very helpful in this condition, such showed the soluble solids concentration (e.g., 1877 mg/l) on the discharge wastewater in the industrial treatment plant has a threshold value whose an important role in the zeolite filtration effectiveness.},

In this study, the values of Q classification system, Lugeon and joint spacing in five-meter intervals of boreholes in limestone rocks of Bazoft and Khersan II dam sites, in south Iran were determined. Then, the Lugeon number was estimated based on Q classification system and joint spacing in control and trial grouting boreholes by statistical analysis (SA), multilayer perceptron neural network (MPNN) by feed-forward method, support vector regression (SVR), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and random forest (RF) methods. Results showed that rock mass is categorized in moderate permeability class based on mean Lugeon value and in the good category based on Q classification system. The Q classification system and joint spacing indicated the highest effect on the Lugeon and the depth showed the least effect on the Lugeon. The SA displayed that it is possible to predict Lugeon values by Q and Js with a precision higher than 78\% based on the data of both dam sites. According to the criteria, the accuracy of the MPNN (R = 0.91), RF (R = 0.97), ANFIS (R = 0.93) and SA (R = 0.80–0.83) to estimate the Lugeon number was lower than SVR (R = 0.98) method.},

The use of cloud computing environment services is increasing exponentially with all technology applications based on IoT. Fog computing has led to addressing issues in cloud computing environments. Fog computing reduces load balancing, processing, bandwidth, and storage as data file replication from the cloud to the network closest to sensors in different geographic locations. There are three critical issues:—what data should be replicated?—when should the data be replicated? and—where the new replicas should be placed? These three main open questions must be tackled for data replication in the cloud environments. This strategy, the identification and mode of the data replication problem are designed as a multi-objective optimization with modern meta-heuristic optimization method. Therefore, a new hybrid method using Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) and the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new hybrid metaheuristic method, using the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) and the salp swarm algorithm (SSA), is proposed to handle the problem of selection and placement data replication in fog computing. Secondly, the Floyd algorithm is used to strategy the least cost path, distance, and data transmission in different geographic locations. The performance of the designed AOASSA strategy to tackling the data replication problem is evaluated using different datasets of different sizes. To validate the AOASSA strategy, a set of experiments was carried out to validate the proposed strategy AOASSA. Experiment results show the superiority of AOASSA over its competitors in terms of performance measures, such as least cost path, distance, and bandwidth.},

However, under a wider range of disturbances, the PID strategy is not suitable for practical applications, and the parameters must be tuned again for more reliable operations. To this end, a Lyapunov definition-based adaptive mechanism is adopted for the PID strategy, which can increase the stability and robustness of this scheme under various disturbances. Moreover, the system is considered a black-box without the need for accurate mathematical modeling of the system that can result in a lower computational burden as well as ease of implementation. The Lyapunov concept is a modern adaptive algorithm that can find optimal answers in shorter periods with more accuracy and reliable stability insurance. To examine the strength of this method, conventional fractional-order PID (FOPID) and PID control techniques are also tested to be compared with this work using the PSO algorithm to tune their parameters. Finally, the results related to both simulations and experimental outputs are tested, showing faster dynamics and significant robustness of Lyapunov-based PID strategy in different challenging scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Climate change and environmental protection have a significant impact on thermal plants. So, the main principles of combined economic-emission dispatch (CEED) problem are indeed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel costs. Many approaches have demonstrated their efficacy in addressing CEED problem. However, designing a robust algorithm capable of achieving the Pareto optimal solutions under its multimodality and non-convexity natures caused by valve ripple effects is a true challenge. In this paper, chaos-enhanced multi-objective tunicate swarm algorithm (CMOTSA) for CEED problem. To promote the exploration and exploitation abilities of the basic tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA), an exponential strategy based on chaotic logistic map (ESCL) is incorporated. Based on ESCL in CMOTSA, it can improve the possibility of diversification feature to search different areas within the solution space, and then, gradually with the progress of iterative process it converts to emphasize the intensification ability. The efficacy of CMOTSA is approved by applying it to some of multi-objective benchmarking functions which have different Pareto front characteristics including convex, discrete, and non-convex. The inverted generational distance (IGD) and generational distance (GD) are employed to assess the robustness and the good quality of CMOTSA against some successful algorithms. Additionally, the computational time is evaluated, the CMOTSA consumes less time for most functions. The CMOTSA is applied to one of the practical engineering problems such as combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED) with including the valve ripples. By using three different systems (IEEE 30-bus with 6 generators system, 10 units system and IEEE 118-bus with 14 generating units), the methodology validation is made. It can be stated for the large-scale case of 118-bus systems that the results of the CMOTSA are equal to 8741.3 $/h for the minimum cost and 2747.6 ton/h for the minimum emission which are very viable to others. It can be pointed out that the cropped results of the proposed CMOTSA based methodology as an efficient tool for CEED is proven.},

  abstract     = {In computer security, semantic learning is helpful in understanding vulnerability requirements, realizing source code semantics, and constructing vulnerability knowledge. Nevertheless, learning how to extract and select the most valuable features for software vulnerability detection remains difficult. In this paper, we first derive a subset of vulnerability knowledge representations from the Functional Connectivity (FC) of Graph Gated Sequence Neural Networks (GGNNs). The Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks can be utilized to capture the long-term dependency to understand a high-level representation of potential vulnerabilities in order to detect vulnerabilities on a target project. Studying functional connectivity-based Graph Neural Networks ensures our deep understanding of the operation of sequence graph networks as highly complex interconnected systems. This ensures that the model focuses on vulnerability-related code, which makes it more appropriate for vulnerability mining tasks. Which constructs a composite semantic code property graph for code representation based on the causes of vulnerabilities. The experimental findings indicate that the suggested Model can select relevant discriminative features and achieve superior performance than benchmark methods.},

Locusts interact in two different ways of searching for food: social and familial. In the familial phase, small locust groups search foods in a local area and the locusts share their information in the social phase. The proposed algorithm is less likely to trap into the local solution than other methods and has high performance in the sensitivity of the global solution. In addition, it is effective not only for the solution of black-box optimization problems but also for the solution of problems with an irregular objective function. The ALSO algorithm is compared with other recent and well-known optimization algorithms on 22 benchmark functions and 3 real engineering design problems. Simulation results prove that the ALSO algorithm is very competitive when compared to the other algorithms. Moreover, it even requires the less runtime and memory space under the same conditions.},

The proposed methodology addresses network congestion through an optimum time of charging, cost optimization, new charging infrastructure, and minimization of losses under a set of technical and physical constraints, which represents practical uncertainties. Along with load flow analysis, selection of the number of ports and technology at the host charging station is obtained through the application of response surface methodology. The proposed methodology provides coordinated planning for the development of EB charging station infrastructure that takes into account the effects of both the power dispersion framework and transportation framework. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is investigated by applying it to the 69-node IEEE modified distribution test system considering three charging technologies, viz. fast charging, ultra-fast charging, and battery swapping. The results of the proposed model are compared with the direct statistical method, and it revealed that the right selection of technology for EB charging and the right planning of the charging infrastructure can effectively optimize the cost of EV charging infrastructure and thereby catalyze the decarbonization of the transportation sector.},

Automatic sarcasm detection using social media data is a challenging task in the presence of imbalanced classes. Real-life social media data often suffer from this problem of class imbalance resulting in dramatical degradation of the performance of classification models attempting to detect sarcasm. Motivated by this, in the current article, a Bi-LSTM variational autoencoder model has been proposed to alleviate the problem of imbalanced classes in social media datasets targeted to train sarcasm detection models. The proposed BVA model is trained with a large corpus of sarcastic and non-sarcastic tweets to obtain the most suitable latent space representation of the same. These inherently class-biased latent vectors are then oversampled using synthetic minority oversampling techniques. The quality of the proposed method is established by training and testing a set of well-known classifiers in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and G-mean. Extensive experiments reveal that the proposed BVA model combined with oversampling techniques can improve classifier performance for sarcasm detection to a greater extent.},

Aiming at these issues, this paper proposes an intelligent generation method based on topology optimization and deep learning, which can automatically generate innovative structures with novel shapes and better mechanical performance. Firstly, the approach uses the topology optimization solver to optimize the initial main truss model under various working conditions, and optimization results are collected to establish a deep learning dataset. Then, the topologically optimized dataset of the main truss is fed into the least squares generative adversarial networks (LSGANs) algorithm for deep learning. Cloud computing technology is configured to generate a variety of new models intelligently. Finally, the developed schemes of innovative structures are evaluated from the aspects of novelty, diversity, mechanical performance, and mass. The research results show that the method can not only efficiently generate multiple innovative main truss structures in batches but also further optimize the mechanical performance and material consumption, which can provide a reference for the conceptual design of the main truss in a steel bridge, while the program for this method has not been developed to make it more suitable for practical engineering.},

This paper designs novel kernel-free Universum quadratic surface support vector machine models. Further, this paper proposes the $$\ell _1$$ norm regularized version that is beneficial for detecting potential sparsity patterns in the Hessian of the quadratic surface and reducing to the standard linear models if the data points are (almost) linearly separable. The proposed models are convex, so standard numerical solvers can be utilized to solve them. Moreover, a least squares version of the $$\ell _1$$ norm regularized model is proposed. We also design an effective tailored algorithm that only requires solving one linear system. Several theoretical properties of these models are then reported and proved as well. The numerical results show that the least squares version of the proposed model achieves the highest mean accuracy scores with promising computational efficiency on some artificial and public benchmark data sets.

However, machine learning applications on bitcoin have given limited attention to developing end-to-end deep learning frameworks that are modeled to exploit the bitcoin graph structure. To identify illegal transactions on bitcoin, the current paper extracts nineteen features from the bitcoin network and proposes a deep learning-based graph neural network model using spectral graph convolutions and transaction features. The proposed model is compared with two state-of-the-art techniques, viz., a graph attention network (GAT2) and an extreme gradient boosted decision tree (XGBOOST) trained on convoluted features for classification of illegal transactions on bitcoin. To understand the efficacy of the proposed model, a dataset is collected consisting of 13310125 transactions of 2059 entities having 3152202 bitcoin account addresses and belonging to 28 categories of users. Two sets of experiments are performed on the datasets: labeling transactions as legal or illegal (binary classification) and identifying the originator of the transaction to one of the twenty-eight types of entities (multi-class classification). For fast and accurate decisions, binary classification is appropriate, and for pinpointing the category of bitcoin users, a multi-class classifier is suitable. On both the tasks, the proposed models achieved a maximum of 92\% accuracy, validating the methodology and suitability of the model for real-world deployment.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a graph convolution network prediction model based on the lioness optimization algorithm (LsOA-GCN) is proposed to predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in 17 regions of Hubei Province from March 23 to March 29, 2020, according to the transmission characteristics of COVID-19. On the one hand, Spearman correlation analysis with delay days and LsOA are used to capture the dynamic changes of feature information to obtain the temporal features. On the other hand, the graph convolutional network is used to capture the topological structure of the city network, so as to obtain spatial information and finally realize the prediction task. Then, we evaluate this model through performance evaluation indicators and statistical test methods and compare the results of LsOA-GCN with 10 representative prediction methods in the current epidemic prediction study. The experimental results show that the LsOA-GCN prediction model is significantly better than other prediction methods in all indicators and can successfully capture spatio-temporal information from feature data, thereby achieving accurate prediction of epidemic trends in different regions of Hubei Province.},

  abstract     = {Detecting vulnerabilities in software is crucial to guarantee the security of software systems. Most previous methods focus on training a classification or regression model on the text feature of the source code to predict vulnerabilities. However, it is not always easy to obtain the labeled vulnerabilities in practical applications, and using only the text feature is insufficient to find the vulnerabilities in complex software systems. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to detect vulnerable software functions, which uses both text and dependency features of the source code to improve the detection accuracy. Specifically, we first extract the text and dependency features from the source code and concatenate them to the combined feature. We then learn a deep autoencoder to transform the combined feature into low-dimensional embedding. We finally apply an outlier detection method on the embedding to predict the vulnerable functions. We extensively evaluated the proposed method on seven C/C++ program datasets, and the results illustrate that our method improves F1 score on average of 88 and 66\% over comparison methods Rats and Joern, which verifies the effectiveness of our method.},

However, there are differences in the statistical distribution of the feature space comprising of genetic data of different species. Therefore, this paper proposes a feature and sample jointed transfer (FSJT) method for semi-supervised scenarios, consisting of two modules. In the first module, the distance between the sample probability distribution functions in the feature space is taken as the optimization objective, and a hybrid balanced distribution adaptation method is constructed to transform the feature space of the two domains to increase the similarity between the domains. In the second module, the confidence of the unlabeled data in the target domain is defined and a self-learning sample transfer method is proposed to reduce the impact of samples having large differences in source-domain training data. Simultaneously, to select the suitable source-domain samples and the target domain when the sample size between the fields is very different, the transferred Lasso and the nearest-neighbor (TLR) feature selection method is proposed using FSJT. Then, the whole framework and algorithm flow of the TLR-FSJT model is presented and verified using the transfer learning standard dataset and ribonucleic acid data from GenBank database by comparing it with three machine learning methods and the FSJT model. Results show that the TLR-FSJT model has the highest accuracy in semi-supervised scenarios.},

The recent generative dataless methods construct document-specific category priors by using seed word occurrences only; however, such category priors often contain very limited and even noisy supervised signals. To remedy this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel formulation of category prior. First, for each document, we consider its label membership degree by not only counting seed word occurrences, but also using a novel prototype scheme, which captures pseudo-nearest neighboring categories. Second, for each label, we consider its frequency prior knowledge of the corpus, which is also a discriminative knowledge for classification. By incorporating the proposed category prior into the previous generative dataless method, we suggest a novel generative dataless method, namely Weakly Supervised Prototype Topic Model. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that Wsptm outperforms the existing baseline methods.},

This paper proposes a novel frequency-based stability measure called rank stability (RSt) that evaluates FS algorithms on both criteria, i.e., subsets of features and feature rankings. The proposed measure evaluates the variation of feature rankings generated by FS algorithms after making a small perturbation to the training set. We mathematically justify the proposed measure based on the earlier and newly defined desirable properties. Additionally, we explore various heterogeneous ensemble techniques and compare them with traditional FS algorithms on real-world datasets. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate that the heterogeneous ensemble techniques perform better than traditional FS algorithms with respect to the proposed measure and other performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the online learning problem of Lagrangian $$\varepsilon$$ -twin support vector regression (L- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR), with the goal of presenting incremental implementations. First, to solve the problem that the existing L- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR cannot efficiently update the model under incremental scenarios, an incremental Lagrangian $$\varepsilon$$ -twin support vector regression (IL- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR) based on the semi-smooth Newton method is proposed. By utilizing the matrix inverse theorems to update the Hessian matrices incrementally, IL- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR lowers the time complexity and expedites the training process. However, when solving the problem of nonlinear case, the training speed of IL- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR rapidly decreases with the increasing size of the kernel matrix. Therefore, an incremental reduced Lagrangian $$\varepsilon$$ -twin support vector regression (IRL- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR) is presented. IRL- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR employs the reduced technique to restrict the size of the inverse matrix at the cost of slightly lower the prediction accuracy. Next, to lighten the prediction accuracy loss caused by parameters reduction, a novel regularization term is introduced to replace the original one, and an improved incremental reduced Lagrangian $$\varepsilon$$ -twin support vector regression (IIRL- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR) is designed. The results on UCI benchmark datasets show that IL- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR can effectively address the linear regression problem under incremental scenarios and obtain almost the same generalization capability as offline learning. Moreover, IRL- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR and IIRL- $$\varepsilon$$ -TSVR can reduce training time of nonlinear regression model and obtain sparse solution, and their generalization capabilities are close to those of offline ones. Particularly, the proposed algorithms can implement fast incremental learning of large-scale data.},

  abstract     = {Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a widely used performance analysis tool, but for every newly added unit in a data set, it requires complete re-processing of the DEA model. In real applications, data sets are usually imprecise and enormously increasing, which demands a large computer processing time. A predictive capability of DEA, typically in uncertain environment, can solve this problem. This paper aims to establish an integrated DEA and support vector machine for regression (SVR) approach with imprecise data for efficiency estimation and prediction in optimistic and pessimistic environments. To illustrate the potential of the proposed approach, it is applied on Indian banks for evaluation and prediction of different efficiency measures (technical, pure technical, and scale) during the period 2011–2020. To study the sensitivity analysis and productivity of Indian banks’ efficiency with time, DEA window analysis (window width five years) and Malmquist productivity index (MPI) in optimistic and pessimistic environments have been improvised with interval data. The new approach results in very reliable and accurate prediction (mean square error: $$2\times 10^{-3}$$ to $$5\times 10^{-3}$$ ) of different efficiency measures that benefits bank experts for planning and decision making on bank addition/merger. Other findings conclude that (i) technical efficiency is more influenced by managerial (pure technical) inefficiencies rather than bank size (scale efficiency) in all windows, and (ii) on the contrary to all other banks, Yes Bank Ltd. examined decreased productivity in both the environments, (iii) technical efficiency change has higher impact on MPI in both environments as compared to technological change.},

The aim is to tailor a medicine according to an individual’s genetic make-up and response to drug, diet, and environment. Machine learning algorithms are being developed to dissect inter-individual variability in the population. This is more important for prevention of diseases in healthy individuals and early actionable interventions. In Ayurveda, the basic tenet of the practice is personalized—an individual’s constitution type “Prakriti” is used for predicting healthy and disease trajectories as well as individualized management. Prakriti refers to the nature of the body in terms of doshas, and the time of conception is decided according to the predominance of doshas. It does not change throughout life and is responsible for a person’s physical and mental characteristics. Any population can be stratified into seven Prakriti groups amongst which the Vata, Pitta and Kapha are the three phenotypic extremes with contrasting disease susceptibilities and response. Prakriti is assessed through examination of multi-system attributes and has been formalized into a questionnaire that captures 120 feature attributes for objective assessment. We use for the first time—powerful dense neural network deep learning algorithms for predicting Prakriti classes. The study was carried out on a validated dataset of 233 extreme Prakriti individuals derived from two genetically diverse cohorts from North and West India. We benchmark our method with the state-of-the-art supervised machine learning and establish a learning approach for transferring features from the Western to Northern Indian data and vice versa as well. Our study provides a computational framework for predicting Prakriti which can be implemented in large scale studies of precision medicine.

  abstract     = {Brain tumor (BT) occurs on account of the anomalous development of cells, and it is one among the foremost reasons for the death of adults all through the globe. As the existing methodologies utilize the 2D brain image, they could not give better accuracy. There is also a high possibility for the tumor being undetected since they segment the tumor part as of the whole brain. For addressing these issues, the paper proposed a semi-supervised (SS) 3D BT detection (BTD) system utilizing a tumor cut (TC)-based technique. The 3D brain image is firstly preprocessed for eradicating the skull by utilizing the kilter-based morphological (KMO) approach. The skull-stripped image is then clustered into 3 groups, say cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem with the aid of modified K-means (MK-means). The tumor part in the clustered image is then segmented with the utilization of the improved tumor cut (ITC) approach. Afterward, the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), shape, discrete wavelet transforms (DWT), texture, along with radiomic features of the segmented tumor part are extracted. At last, the extracted features are inputted to the convolutional deep learning neural network (CDLNN) classifier, which categorizes the tumor into classes, namely a) the tumors in the cerebrum are astrocytoma and craniopharyngioma, b) the tumors in the cerebellum are astrocytoma and medulloblastoma, and c) the tumors in the brain stem are astrocytoma. In an experimental evaluation, the proposed BTD system acquired better accuracy when contrasted with some existing methodologies. The model attains the highest detection metrics, such as accuracy of 0.96, 0.94 of sensitivity, precision, recall, and F-measure (F-M), 0.97 of specificity, 0.97 of negative predictive value (NPV), and 0.90 of Matthew&#39;s correlation coefficient (MCC). In addition, the model attains the lowest values for the error metrics, such as false-positive rate (FPR) (0.032), false-negative rate (FNR) (0.065), and false reduction rate (FRR) (0.065). The values of detection metrics attained by the model are higher, and the values of error metrics attained by the model are lower when analogized to the existing approaches. This shows the superiority of the presented model for BT detection as of 3D MRI images.},

This research refers to fuzzy theory, uses fuzzy rough set tools to build a fuzzy rough loss function, and designs the FR-CNN algorithm for fuzzy facial expression recognition. In order to verify the application effect of the designed algorithm, facial expression recognition experiments were carried out using BU-3DFE and Jaffe datasets. The experimental results show that the distance index data of the FR-CNN (AA kNN) and FR-CNN (Softmax) algorithms constructed based on the algorithm designed in this study is significantly lower than that of the comparison scheme on BU-3DFE datasets, and the similarity index is significantly higher than that of the comparison scheme. The Cosine similarity values of FR-CNN (Softmax) and FR-CNN (AA kNN) algorithms are 0.988 and 0.986, respectively. However, the FR-CNN algorithm is slightly slower than the comparison scheme in processing facial expression image data. It can be seen that the algorithm designed in this study has a certain application prospect in the task of fuzzy facial expression recognition.},

  abstract     = {The applications based on the wireless sensor network (WSN) work with a large quantity of tiny battery-powered sensors. It has always been a problem for WSNs that sensor node has such a short battery life, and efficient management of the sensors&#39; energy is essential for improving their overall performance. For the network&#39;s energy issues, the clustering approach has proven to be a successful solution. To address energy concerns, clustering divides the network area into different clusters. In this paper, a clustering protocol based on the fuzzy logic model and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to improve the lifespan and performance of the entire network and is named as fuzzy logic and PSO-based energy efficient clustering (FLPSOC). The proposed protocol uses the fuzzy logic model to appoint the most efficient node for the cluster head (CH) job. The fuzzy model considers the neighbor count, energy ratio (initial energy and residual energy), and distance to neighbors as the input parameters in the fuzzy system for the CH selection procedure. The data gathered by the CH are transmitted to the base station (BS) by using the relay nodes. In the proposed scheme, most optimal nodes for relay task are selected using the PSO technique, which considers residual energy of CH and distance between the CH and BS parameters. Performance measures such as network lifespan, stability period, throughput, and CH count are used to determine how efficient the proposed algorithm is in comparison with other existing protocols.},

After on-site testing, all performance indicators have reached the design requirements. The laying of optical fibers and cables under different monitoring environments, the selection of monitoring key areas, and the setting of alarm thresholds are studied.

After enhancement, the generated network not only produces distinguish feature map without collecting more samples, but also achieves advantage of feature representation with high efficiency for computing. Specifically, cutout approach is simple yet highly effective for image regulation, which enhances input image matrix by adding a fixed mask to improve robustness and overall performance of network.

The proposed semi-supervised method fuses multiple graphs to find a unified flexible manifold embedding model. This model provides the attractiveness score of the unlabeled face images and a linear mapping that maps the feature space to the score space. The proposed method merges the graphs of geometric features and deep features to estimate a unified embedding. It also improves the discriminative power of the graph-based score propagation method by creating an additional similarity graph from the predicted scores.

In the link of emotion classification, this paper innovatively proposes a classification method SVM-NB to obtain more emotional polarities. Finally, the classifier is used to obtain the emotional polarities of the text, including positive and negative categories.

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation system (ITS) is widely employed in dynamic traffic management to alleviate roadside congestion and increase traffic efficiency for solving the increasingly critical traffic congestion problems. With the advancement in ITS, real-time data collection of vehicles on the road has become a reality. A vast amount of traffic data ensures that the state of the road network may be analysed and predicted in real time for vehicle detection. Decision support system plays a significant role in the early decision making based on some defined criteria again available options. If the decision is made in the right and precise way, then eventually, it lead to success. This research investigates and designs a vehicle recognition algorithm and the road environment discrimination algorithm, which greatly increase the accuracy of highway vehicle detection, using a deep learning framework. In this work, we collect the highway video surveillance’s images in various environments, create an original database, build a deep learning model of environment discrimination, and train the classification model to achieve real-time highway environment as the basic condition of vehicle recognition and traffic event discrimination. The proposed work uses a decision support system which is feed with basic information for vehicle detection and selection. Labeling the vehicle target and sample preparation of various environments are carried out to improve the accuracy of detecting the vehicles on a highway. The vehicle recognition algorithm is investigated in this context, and a vehicle detection technique based on weather environment recognition and a rapid RCNN model is presented. The performance of the vehicle recognition algorithm developed in this study is then verified by comparing detection accuracy with the existing state-of-the-art approaches. The comparison with these approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and F-score shows that our algorithm outperforms these approaches for detecting and classifying vehicles on the highway.},

  abstract     = {The issue of weed classification in paddy fields has received extensive research. There are various methods for resolving the weed classification issue. These methods use color, texture and binary features in classifying the weed image in the paddy field, but it suffers to achieve higher performance. Green–red-texture (GRT) approximation segmentation with the DCNN weed classification model (GRT-DCNN) proposed in this paper to solve this problem. Initially, the method preprocesses the weed image with multiple filters to remove noise from the color image. Further, the process applies K neighbor semicircular color approximation segmentation algorithm toward segmentation. The segmentation scheme groups the weed image features into several groups according to the paddy field nature. With the segmented image, the method applies GRTFA (green–red texture feature approximation) algorithm in selecting the region of interest (ROI). The selected ROI has been used to extract the color features and texture of the selected ROI. The features extracted are used to train the deep convolution neural network. This DCNN model has been designed with four convolution layers to reduce the dimensionality of the features considered. The GR features of the weed image are convolved in two level and texture features are convolved in the next two levels of convolution. The DCNN model was trained with four convolution and pooling layers to perform classification. The neurons at the output layer estimate weed class GR support (WCGRS) toward various classes of weed according to green and color features. Also, the method computes the weed class texture support (WCTS) according to the texture of different weed-maintained classes. The method computes disease class support (DCS) to carry out classification based on the value of WCGRS and WCTS. The decision support system would also estimate the distribution measure according to the growth region to detect the weed growth. The potential yield and the amount of fertilizer needed to support the field worker have been determined. The proposed GRT-DCNN-based weed classification model improves the performance in classification as well as in estimating the yield to support effective regulation of fertilizer.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an intelligent attendance monitoring system based on spatio-temporal human action recognition, which includes human skeleton gait recognition, multi-action body silhouette recognition and face recognition. Our system solves several problems, for example, when a mask is worn to conceal the face, which leads to a decrease in recognition accuracy performance, and when a 3D face mask is used to fake an identity. The skeleton gait feature of our intelligent attendance monitoring system uses a temporal weighted K-nearest neighbours algorithm to train the recognition model and carry out identification, while the multi-action body silhouette feature uses a multiple K-nearest neighbours algorithm to train the recognition model, identify the person and vote on the outcome. Using the proposed system, which integrates skeleton gait features, action silhouette features and face features, more effective recognition can be achieved. When the system encounters a situation with feature masking, such as when an individual is wearing a mask or has changed their clothes, or when the viewing angle is masked, it can continue to deliver good recognition ability through multi-angle skeleton synthesis gait recognition. Our experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the system is 83.33\% when a specific person wears a mask and passes through a monitored area. The intelligent attendance monitoring system uses a LINE messaging API as the access control notification function and provides a responsive web platform that allows managers to perform follow-up management and monitoring.},

  abstract     = {This research presents a practical study of active disturbance rejection control law (ADRC) for the control of robotic manipulators in the presence of uncertainties. The control objective of the proposed control law is to track the trajectory accurately and rejects the disturbance caused by robotic manipulators. First, Euler Lagrange’s equations are used to model the dynamic behavior of a rotary flexible joint manipulator system (RFJMS). Secondly, the ADRC is designed for the rejection of lump disturbances (modeling uncertainties, nonlinearities, and external disturbances) of the manipulator; to estimate the lump disturbances a fifth-order extended state observer is constructed. Furthermore, a state error feedback control law with disturbance compensation is designed, which needs only a few control parameters to be adjusted. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control law by comparing the experimental results with those of LQR and PID. Experimental results show that high precision position control as well as vibration suppression can be achieved with the proposed controller, which is superior to LQR and PID controllers. In spite of uncertainties and nonlinearity of the flexible joint, QUANSER&#39;s RFJMS exhibits excellent tracking behavior and disturbance rejection.},

However, traditional FPPT control methods tend to cause certain oscillations in the system. This paper proposes an FPPT method based on the adaptive lion swarm optimization algorithm (ALSO). First, an ALSO algorithm is proposed, which adds adaptive scaling parameters to the lion swarm optimization algorithm, so that the number of adult lions can be adjusted adaptively with increasing iterations to coordinate the local exploitation and global search abilities of the algorithm. Then the ALSO is used to selectively optimize the operation of different intervals so as to achieve the FPPT control on the left or right side of the maximum power point. The test experiments for the ALSO algorithm show that the ALSO algorithm has strong local exploitation and global search abilities, which is better than the compared algorithms. Through the simulations on the PV grid-connected system, the validity and superiority of the ALSO-based method over the traditional FPPT algorithm in terms of dynamic and steady-state performance are verified under different operating conditions.},

One of the major complications with the high penetration of DG sources is islanding. The islanding may damage the clients and their equipment. As per the IEEE 1547 DG interconnection standards, the islanding will be identified in two seconds and the DG must be turned off. In this paper, an advanced islanding detection process stands on a deep learning technique with continuous wavelet transforms and convolution neural networks implemented. This approach transforms the time series information into scalogram images, and later, the images are used to train and test the islanding and non-islanding events. The outcomes are correlated with the artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic methods. The comparison shows that the proposed deep learning approach efficiently detects the islanding and non-islanding events.},

Second, a dynamic backtracking strategy is proposed to help the algorithm exit quickly in the deadlock region to complete the task. With these two strategies, even if the deadlock region is large, the algorithm can get the result quickly. This paper takes the ant colony algorithm as an example to demonstrate the deadlock strategy.

To enhance the forecasting robustness and provide a relatively comprehensive comparison between the preprocessing and postprocessing model, this research proposes a novel hybrid model KELM-VMD-KELM by combining variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM), in which the KELM is firstly employed to forecast the daily carbon price series and obtain the initial prediction results, and then the VMD-KELM is utilized to build the predicting models for the residual error series to implement the process of error correction. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is made a use to determine the optimal parameters of KELM and VMD. The daily average carbon price from Beijing, Guangdong and Shanghai market are selected to test the validity of the model. The results indicate that there is heterogeneity of the optimal model in different datasets. Both KELM-VMD-KELM and VMD-KELM perform well in the daily carbon price prediction.

  abstract     = {The variance swap is one of volatility derivatives popularly used for the risk management of financial instruments traded in volatile market. An appropriate choice of a volatility model is an important part of the risk management. One of desirable considerations should be given to the fact that the volatility varies on several characteristic time scales. Stochastic volatility models can reflect this feature by introducing multiscale volatility factors. However, pure stochastic volatility models cannot capture the whole volatility surface accurately although the model parameters have been calibrated to replicate the market implied volatility data for near at-the-money strikes. So, we choose a hybrid model of constant elasticity of variance type of local volatility and fast and slow scale stochastic volatility for evaluating the fair strikes of variance swaps. We obtain a closed-form solution formula for the approximate fair strike values of continuously sampled variance swaps and compute the solution. The theoretical formula is validated through Monte Carlo simulation. The predictability of the strike price movements is discussed in terms of the sensitive effects of the stochastic volatility and the elasticity of variance parameters for a given partial information about the underlying asset and volatility.},

And then, the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is used to derive the coordinated weights of experts, which is not affected by the selection of the initial value of expert weights and can objectively reflect the scoring level of each expert. Since different sorting methods would have inconsistent sorting results, a combined method based on SQP algorithm to derive the coordinated weights of different sorting methods is proposed to promote the ability of ranking the alternatives.

  abstract     = {Neural network methods are widely used in business problems for prediction, clustering, and risk management to improving customer satisfaction and business outcome. The ability of a neural network to learn complex nonlinear relationship is due to its architecture that uses weight parameters to transform input data within the hidden layers. Such methods perform well in many situations where the ordering of inputs is simple. However, for a complex reordering of a decision-maker, the process is not enough to get an optimal prediction result. Moreover, existing machine learning algorithms cannot reduce computational complexity by reducing data size without losing any information. This paper proposes an induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator for the artificial neural network IOWA-ANN. The operator reorders the data according to the order-inducing variable. The proposed sorting mechanism in the neural network can handle a complex nonlinear relationship of a dataset, which results in reduced computational complexities. The proposed approach deals with the complexity of the neuron, collects the data and allows a degree of customisation of the structure. The application further extended to IGOWA and Quasi-IOWA operators. We present a numerical example in a financial decision-making process to demonstrate the approach&#39;s effectiveness in handling complex situations.

  abstract     = {Aiming at the poor population diversity and serious imbalance between global exploration and local exploitation in the original fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), a novel elitist fruit fly optimization algorithm (EFOA) with elite guidance and population diversity maintenance is proposed. EFOA consists of two search phases: an osphresis search with elite and random individual guiding and a vision search with elite and boundary guiding in an iteration. The former contains two sub-stages: exploration with random individual guiding and exploitation with elite individual guiding. Randomly selected individual and flight control parameter constructed by the Sigmoid-based function are first introduced into the algorithm to improve the exploration. The elite guiding strategy with two position-update approaches is designed to augment the local ability of the proposed algorithm. With these stages, EFOA can search some areas of the problem space as much as possible. Finally, elite and boundary information is introduced into EFOA to enhance population diversity. The proposed EFOA is compared with other algorithms, including the original FOA, three outstanding FOA variants, and five state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms. The validation tests are conducted based on the classical benchmark functions and CEC2017 benchmark functions. The Wilcoxon signed rank test and Friedman test are utilized to verify the significance of the results from the perspective of non-parametric statistics. The results demonstrate that the elite guiding strategy and the alternating execution of the three search stages can effectively balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the EFOA and enhance its convergence speed.},

To deal with the uncertainties of a real-world scenario, a neutrosophic set is better equipped than a fuzzy set. In this article, we develop a neutrosophic economic order quantity (EOQ) inventory model with the assumption that the market demand is sensitive to the retail price and promotional effort. The supplier and retailer both adopt a partial trade credit policy. We include preservation technology to restrict normal deterioration. We analyse the crisp model first, and then, neutrosophic logic is implemented in the proposed model. De-neutrosophication of total neutrosophic profit is performed based on the removal area approach. The present investigation yields that the de-neutrosophic value of the profit function is convex, that is, a unique solution exists. Mathematical outcomes are generated to efficiently determine the optimal inventory policy for the retailer. To demonstrate numerically and validate the model, a case study is carried out. The findings in this work generalize several existing results, and sensitivity analysis is also reported to support the model.},

To ensure the maximum variety of classifiers, we have implemented three versions of each classification algorithm by varying each classifier’s parameters making a total of nine diverse experts for the ensemble.

This algorithm first enhances its population diversity through crossover operation, then adds elite individuals to guide its update process to speed up the algorithm convergence speed. Finally, the method of information enhancement is adopted in the abandonment process, so that the algorithm is not easy to fall into the local optimum. In order to verify the performance of the algorithm, this paper uses a variety of benchmark functions and performance evaluation indicators to evaluate it, and provides a case to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in practical applications. The experimental results show that CIE-MOCS has good performance compared with the contrasting algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The grey-wolf optimizer (GWO) is a comparatively recent and competent algorithm in Swarm Intelligence (SI) to solve numerical and real-world optimization problems. However, the biggest challenge is the quick stabilization of its search agents to the local optima. Therefore, to bring effectiveness in the global search, it is imperative to relocate the leading agents through the procreation of their positions in the search space. This paper proposes GL-GWO, a genetic learning (GL)-based GWO, which imitates the genetic offspring generation scheme to improve the intelligence of GWO’s leading agents. The GL scheme expedites the global effectiveness of leading agents by constructing the exemplars for them through genetic operators using their historical information. The obtained exemplars are well diversified and highly intelligent; therefore, the rest of the population’s global searchability and search efficiency are enhanced under their guidance. The GL-GWO is tested on widely adopted 20 benchmark functions from the IEEE-CEC-2005 dataset and 38 functions from the IEEE-CEC-2014 dataset. The efficacy of GL-GWO is tested on four real-world engineering problems, namely recommendation systems, face image super-resolution, tension/compression spring, and welded beam. The obtained results on benchmark functions and considered engineering problems conclude that the GL-GWO is an efficient, effective, and reliable algorithm for solving real-world optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Avoiding conflicting elements is a natural constraint that appears in several graph problems making them more challenging and close to real applications. Minimum Conflict-Free Spanning Tree (MCFST) is a variant of the classic Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem, where we are asked to find (if any) the spanning tree avoiding pairs of conflicting edges (conflict-free) of minimum cost. Although it is well known that MST is polynomial-time solvable, the MCFST problem is $$\mathcal{N}\mathcal{P}$$ -hard. In this paper, we present a GRASP with adaptive memory (GRASP-AM) for Minimum Conflict-Free Spanning Tree. Adaptive memory (AM) is used in the constructive phase to decide which set of edges generates good solutions. Furthermore, we show how to implement the local search adopted in the GRASP-AM efficiently. Experimental results on a well-known benchmark indicate that our proposal outperforms the best existing heuristic for the problem. In particular, our GRASP-AM was able to find all known optimal solutions and to improve best-known solutions.},

Thirdly, a nonlinear convergence strategy is proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation.

In contrast to traditional multiple classifications, one additional class is added into the proposed architecture to represent the reject decision made on foreign patterns, which exhibit significant differences compared to the patterns used for constructing the classification models. A collection of information granules is constructed on the basis of available experimental evidence to form a compact and interpretable representation of the feature space occupied by the native patterns. The patterns located outside the regions occupied by these information granules are identified and filtered out prior to classification while only the native patterns are subject to classification. The proposed methodology leads to a human-centric and human-interactive construct in which the rejected patterns need further processing. Different distance functions are utilized in the construction of information granules. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated involving one synthetic dataset and a collection of publicly available datasets.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the number of sudden deaths due to heart disease is increasing with the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is crucial for diagnosis and treatment. Thanks to deep learning algorithms, classification can be performed without manual feature extraction. In this study, we propose a novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture to detect ECG types. In addition, the proposed CNN can automatically extract features from images. Here, we classify a real ECG dataset using our proposed CNN which includes 34 layers. While this dataset is one-dimensional signals, these are transformed into images (scalograms) using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). In addition, the proposed CNN is compared to known architectures: AlexNet and SqueezeNet for classifying ECG images, and we find it more effective than others. This study, which not only performed CWT but also implemented short-time Fourier transform, examines the success in recognizing ECG types for the proposed CNN. Besides, different split methods: training and testing, and cross-validation are applied in this study. Eventually, CWT and cross-validation are the best pre-processing and split methods for the proposed CNN, respectively. Although the results are quite good, we benefit from support vector machines (SVM) to obtain the best algorithm and for detecting ECG types. Essentially, the main aim of the study increases classification results. In this way, the proposed CNN is utilized as deep feature extractor and combined with SVM. As a conclusion of this study, we achieve the highest accuracy of 99.21\% from the proposed CNN–SVM when using CWT. Therefore, we can express that this framework can be used as an aid to clinicians for ECG-type identification.},

SpanMTL combines word-based and span-based table labeling to tackle AFOE task. Specifically, in the proposed model, we use two separate BiLSTMs to encode the information of aspect and opinion terms into a word-based 2D representation table. Based on the table, we construct span-based table with CNN by associating the word-pair representations. At last, we integrate the table label distributions of word- and span-based table labeling to generate a multi-table labeling. The proposed method improves the performances of Opinion Pair Extraction (OPE) and Opinion Triplet Extraction (OTE) tasks by introducing span information, especially on the datasets with lots of spans. We have conducted various experiments on AFOE datasets to validate our method.

  abstract     = {Class imbalance problem occurs when the training dataset contains significantly fewer samples of one class in contrast to another class. Conventional extreme learning machine (ELM) gives the same importance to all the samples leading to the results, which favor the majority class. To solve this intrinsic deficiency, modifications of ELM have been developed such as weighted ELM (WELM) and WELM based on the overall distribution (ODW-ELM). Recently class-specific ELM (CS-ELM) was designed for class imbalance learning. It has been shown in this work that the derivation of the output weights, $$\varvec{\beta }$$ , is more efficient compared to class-specific cost regulation ELM (CCRELM) for handling the class imbalance problem. Motivated by CCRELM, X. Luo et al. have proposed the classifier ODW-ELM, which is also not efficient for imbalance learning. In this work, a novel class-specific ELM based on overall distribution (OD-CSELM) and the kernelized version of OD-CSELM (OD-CSKELM) is proposed to address the binary class imbalance problem more effectively. OD-CSELM and OD-CSKELM are motivated by CS-ELM. In addition, the computational complexity of OD-CSELM and OD-CSKELM is significantly lower than WELM and kernelized WELM, respectively. The proposed work is evaluated by using the benchmark real-world imbalanced datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed work gives good generalization performance in contrast to the rest of the classifiers for class imbalance learning.},

  abstract     = {Smart devices are equipped with technology that facilitates communication among devices connected via the Internet. These devices are shipped with a user interface that enables users to perform administrative activities using a web browser linked to the device’s server. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is the most prevalent web application vulnerability exploited by attackers to compromise smart devices. In this paper, the authors have designed a framework for shielding smart devices from XSS attacks. It is a machine learning-based attack detection framework which employs self-organizing-map (SOM) to classify XSS attack string. The input vector to the SOM is generated based on attack ontology and the changing behavior of the attack strings in different input fields in the device web interface. Additionally, it also sanitizes the injected attack string to neutralize the harmful effects of attack. The experimental results are obtained using the real-world dataset on the XSS attack. We tested the proposed framework on web interface of two smart devices (TP-link Wi-Fi router and HP color printer) containing hidden XSS vulnerabilities. The observed results unveil the robustness of the proposed work against the existing work as it achieves a high accuracy of 0.9904 on the tested dataset. It is a platform-independent attack detection system deployed on the browser or server side.},

  abstract     = {Bike-sharing systems (BSSs) have become increasingly popular around the globe and have attracted a wide range of research interests. In this paper, we study the region-based demand forecasting problem in BSSs. State-of-the-art methods usually employ branched residual 2D or 3D convolutional neural networks, in which each branch extracts one spatiotemporal dependence in three fragments: closeness, period, and trend. However, these methods ignore the correlations among the fragments. To address the challenge and extract the correlations, we propose a multiple spatiotemporal fusion network named MSTF-Net. It consists of multiple spatiotemporal layers: shared 3D convolutional network (3D-CNN) layers, eidetic 3D convolutional long short-term memory network (E3D-LSTM) layers, and fully connected (FC) layers. Specifically, the shared 3D-CNN layers highlight extracting low-level and short-term spatiotemporal dependence in each fragment. The E3D-LSTM layers extract long-term spatiotemporal dependence and correlations among the fragments. The FC layers extract nonlinear correlations of external factors such as weather, day-of-week, and time-of-day. MSTF-Net outperforms seven baseline models, including the branched residual 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks on station-free and station-based bike-sharing datasets.

In fact, the problem of estimating the input and output levels simultaneously is studied when data are time-dependent. This problem is solved using multiple-objective programming tools in the framework of dynamic inverse data envelopment analysis. The proposed models in the current study, unlike other existing models in the literature of inverse data envelopment analysis, can solve the problem of estimating the input and output levels such that the unit maintains or improves its current efficiency level to a pre-defined amount in the assessment window. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the estimation of input and output levels through the linear multiple-objective programming problems.

  abstract     = {The development of reliable and efficient techniques for protecting modern communications systems becomes a very active research point which stimulates major challenges in the twenty-first century. Several encryption schemes, including chaos-based encryption systems, have been proposed for this purpose. In this paper, we design a new hybrid technique based on asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) and discrete memristive chaos for physical layer encryption and watermarking (PL-EW). The proposed technique is secured in the underlying physical layer of visible light communication (VLC) systems. The hybrid PL-EW ACO-OFDM technique uses two-stage encryption process to modulate both order and values of pixels in the plain image. Moreover, the introduced hybrid technique achieves the authentication property via employing two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform for the digital image watermarking process in encrypted images. A new suggested two-dimensional hyperchaotic modular cascaded memristive (2D HC-MCM) map is proposed and employed as an enhanced chaos generator capable of overcoming the observed deficiencies in similar discrete chaos systems. The proposed 2D HC-MCM map extends the secret space of original memristive map by a factor of 100. The positive Lyapunov exponents (LEs) of 2D HC-MCM map are 10 times greater than the corresponding LEs in conventional memristive map, which indicates that the complexity of chaotic attractors is boosted. The 15 statistical tests of NIST SP 800-22 are applied to examine the randomness quality of the generated chaotic sequences. The bit error rate (BER) of the proposed secure system is studied over the dispersive VLC channel. The results show that all statistical tests are passed for wide range of secret parameters, and a 10−4 BER is achievable at SNR = 18 dB. The best extracted digital watermark image with an ideal NCC can be achieved at SNR = 24 dB. Finally, a plethora of security attacks is applied to verify the immunity of hybrid PL-CEW ACO-OFDM technique against possible types of attacks. It is shown that the proposed scheme can resist brute force, differential, statistical, and different signal processing attacks.},

Besides, several optimization models are built to determine the PISs of linguistic terms with LIFPRs and obtain the acceptable additive consistent LIFPRs. Second, a new definition of Hamming distance for measuring linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (LIFNs) is developed by considering the PISs model, and several desirable properties are discussed. Then, the method of deriving the weight vectors of criteria is calculated based on the proposed distance measure. Subsequently, a framework of group decision-making (GDM) process with LIFPRs is offered, and the application of the proposed method is illustrated by using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem about evaluating different brands of mobile phones.

A new type of spectral collocation method based on the Lagrange interpolation basis polynomial has been studied and modified for the equation. In the spectral collocation technique, it is necessary to choose collocation points to find the numerical solution of the equation. We have chosen the collocation points based on the Chebyshev extreme points or Gauss–Lobatto–Chebyshev points of order N. We have used the fractional Gauss–Jacobi quadrature method to approximate the fractional integral terms of the proposed equation. Also, the integral operators have been approximated by the Gauss quadrature rule. A theorem has been given to demonstrate that there exists a unique solution for the proposed equation. In addition, Banach’s fixed point principle has been applied in the proof of the existence and uniqueness theorem. The convergence analysis of the proposed numerical technique is given in the form of some lemmas and theorems. Some numerical experiments have been performed to verify the proposed method. Five different kinds of errors have been computed and compared to do the error analysis. Also, these kinds of error analysis have been examined by analyzing the result in the form of different graphs and tables. The numerical results of the proposed technique have been compared with an existing method, Adomian decomposition method (ADM).},

The reviewed methods come under the following optimization-based principles: uncertainty balance, minimum error, average uncertainty, entropy preservation, sharpness balance, gradualness balance and trade-off between uncertain and certain zones. These principles provide different semantic interpretation of shadowed sets and modifies the original idea of shadowed set approximation. The parameters of each method have different impacts on the ensuing shadowed set. Consequently, different approximation regions emerge from different method. This triggers a question of what seems to be the best approximation method in shadowed sets. This paper attempts to answer this question by investigating the performances of the aforesaid methods in unsupervised learning framework. When comparing the performances of optimization methods, no method can get the best performance across all possible problems. Therefore, we involve some statistical testing to evaluate their universal and pairwise performance significance over some data sets obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository. Accordingly, some recommendations and guidelines regarding the methods that can be used in unsupervised learning are delivered.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a new perspective of the TOPSIS and VIKOR methods using the recently introduced spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs) to handle the vagueness in subjective data and the uncertainties in objective data simultaneously. When implementing these techniques using SFSs, two main problems might arise that can lead to incorrect results. Firstly, the reference points might change with the utilized score function. Secondly, the distance between reference points might not be the largest, as known, among the available ratings. To overcome these deficiencies and increase the robustness of these two methods, they are implemented without utilizing any reference points to minimize the effect of defuzzification and without measuring the distance to eliminate the effect of distance formulas. In the proposed methods, when using an SFS to express the performance of an alternative for a criterion, this SFS per se can be viewed as a measure of proximity to the aspired level. On the other hand, the conjugate of the SFS can be viewed as a measure of proximity to the ineffectual level. Two practical applications are presented to demonstrate the proposed techniques. The first example handles a warehouse location selection problem. The second example evaluates hydrogen storage systems for automobiles with different types of data (crisp, linguistic variables, type 1 fuzzy sets). These data are transformed to SFSs to provide a more comprehensive analysis. A comparative study is conducted with earlier versions of TOPSIS and VIKOR to explicate the adequacy of the proposed methods and the consistency of the results.},

In this paper, various operation properties of complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets are investigated when the membership phase and non-membership phase are restricted to $$[0,2\pi ]$$ . Meanwhile, consider that precise membership values and non-membership values should normally be of no practical significance, and there is no equality and proximity measure investigation on complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets. First of all, we proposed a new distance measure for complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Then this distance measure is used to define $$(\alpha ,\beta )$$ -equalities of complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Two complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets are said to be $$(\alpha ,\beta )$$ -equal if the distance between their membership degrees is less than $$1-\alpha $$ and the distance between their non-membership degrees is less than $$\beta $$ . Furthermore, this paper shows how various operations between complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets affect given $$(\alpha ,\beta )$$ -equalities of complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Finally, complex intuitionistic fuzzy relations are discussed and some examples are given to illuminate the results obtained in this paper.},

The authors do not assume the existence of a top element —they generalize MV-algebras, pseudo MV-algebras, and pseudo EMV-algebras. A g-state is defined on a unital wPEMV-algebra M as a mapping from M into the positive half-line of reals such that it preserves a partial addition $$+$$ , and in a fixed strong unit, it takes the value 1. They form a Bauer simplex, and extremal points are exactly g-states whose kernel is a maximal and normal ideal. We show that extremal g-states generate all g-states, and it can happen that in some unital wPEMV-algebra, even commutative, there is no g-state. We present some conditions for existence of g-states and establish an integral representation of g-states. In addition, we give a topological characterization of the spaces of g-states and extremal g-states, respectively. Moreover, discrete g-states are investigated.},

  abstract     = {Some phenomena develop over time, while they are uncertain sets at each moment. From an uncertain set, we mean an unsharp concept that is not clearly defined, even for an expert. The potential values of parameters describing this unsharp concept guide one to explain it quantitatively. For instance, in “recovering” from some disease, different levels of health might be defined, meaning that at each specific time, being healthy is measured by belonging some parameter values to a set with a specific belief degree. Clearly speaking, the set defining “recovery” at the beginning stage of a disease would be entirely or partially non-identical with it at other stages. These sets might be extracted using imprecisely observed data, or an expert opinion defines them by some belief degrees. An essential feature of these sets is their variation over time by considering a sequence of evolving sets over time. Such concepts would direct one to employ uncertainty theory as a solid axiomatic mathematical framework for modeling human reasoning. Analyzing the behavior of such a sequence motivated us to define the set-valued uncertain process. This concept combines uncertain set, uncertain process, and uncertain sequence to a new concept. Here, we introduce the main idea; some properties are extracted and clarified, along with some illustrative examples. We also put forward some potential state-of-the-art applications.},

  abstract     = {Color correction is an image-altering technique that modifies image color in such a way that it matches a reference image. Many approaches have already been proposed by various researchers; however, those models have been unable to reduce color errors between two images, which results in inefficiency and poor-quality images. This research paper presents an effective and improved color correction model wherein alternate least square (ALS) and root polynomial (RP) are used together. The main objective of the proposed model is to reduce the error between a reference image and a target image to enhance the image quality and make them look realistic. To achieve this objective, the proposed model used the Amsterdam library of object images which contains a picture of single objects captured under various illumination angles and colors. The main contribution of this paper is a hybrid ALS + RP color correction technique, implemented on the dataset image that fixes its color as per the reference image and enhances its quality. The target image is then converted into three color models, i.e., LAB, LUV, and RGB into XYZ format. Finally, the color difference between a reference image and a target image is observed by calculating values for parameters like Mean, median, 95\% quantile, and maximum error. The effectiveness of the suggested hybrid color correction approach is assessed and validated in MATLAB software for each color model. Through extensive experiments, it is observed that the proposed hybrid model yields the least errors for the RGB color model. This is followed up by LUV and then LAB, to prove its supremacy over other models.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare social networks have a significant role in providing connected and personalized healthcare environment with real-time capabilities. However, building resilient, robust and technology-driven healthcare 5.0 has its own barriers. Especially with social media’s high susceptibility to rumors and fake news, these networks can harm the society. Many researchers have been investigating the process of information diffusion, and it has been one of the most intriguing issues in network analysis. Modeling rumor propagation is one of the prominent researched topics in recent years. Traditional models assume that rumor propagation happens only in one direction, where only supporters are supposed to be active, whereas, in a real-life situation, both supporters and deniers of the information operate simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a model for the recovery of nodes in a setting where rumor propagation and rumor control happen simultaneously. We propose the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Anti-spreader model based on the notion of spreading of epidemics and also its applications to modeling the propagation of rumors and control of rumor. Our model assumes people have multiple forms of reactions to rumor, either posting it, deleting it or announcing the rumor as fake. This paper also suggests how the model can act as a simulation method to compare two node centrality algorithms where spreaders chosen from one centrality algorithm try to spread the rumor, and the anti-spreaders chosen from other centrality try to dispel the rumor and vice versa. We simulate the proposed algorithm on different weighted and unweighted real-world network datasets and establish that the experimental results agrees with the proposed model.},

The soft errors present in these circuits are found to affect the reliability of the systems such as biomedical and space applications. In this work, fault-tolerant digital finite impulse response (FIR) filters are designed to have the same impulse response that process different input signals and multiple responses with constant input signals using the soft computing approaches. The soft computing approaches used in the proposed FIR filters are Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) code for single error correction and double error correction. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by considering different FIR filter tap configurations. The Questasim simulator has been used to validate the functionality of the designed modules using a Verilog HDL. The Xilinx Vivado HLx 2018.3 and Artix-7 xc7a200 and Virtex-4 XC4VLX80 FPGA devices have been used for synthesis and implementation. Significant savings up to 28.02\% and 21.8\%, 26.67\% and 26.33\% of different field programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture resources like Slices, LUTs, flip-flops, and LUTRAMs for the parallel filters having the same impulse response and different impulse responses, respectively, are achieved as compared to the triple modular redundancy method.

  abstract     = {Detection of intrusions in Internet of Things networks is essential to maintain the availability and integrity of the data generated and transmitted by connected devices. Such a procedure is paramount when the data originate from critical activities, such as military, financial, industrial, and health sectors. In the last decades, machine learning (ML)-based approaches have become one of the most suitable and adopted procedures for the task, providing automatic, fast, and accurate results. Despite such success, the literature still presents a gap regarding valid applications of intrusion detection in the IoT environments, which usually stands for a challenging task composed of different types of attacks. In this context, this work applies a recent technique based on graphs and logic fuzzy, namely Fuzzy Optimum-Path Forest (Fuzzy OPF), to detect threats that escape an IoT network’s regular traffic. We evaluate our model against five well-known ML algorithms, i.e., Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and the standard Optimum-Path Forest. Experimental results show that Fuzzy OPF outperforms the baselines considering accuracy, recall, and F1 metrics. As a result, the Fuzzy OPF proposal for intrusion detection had a hit rate of 98 and 99\%.},

In the field of medicine, medical imaging obtains the image of a certain part of tissue in the body. There are many ways of medical imaging and acquisition systems, such as X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, endoscopy, ultrasound and positron emission tomography and microscopic imaging. Medical image provides a more intuitive visual means, which provides a reliable basis for disease diagnosis, clinical treatment and teaching research. In real life, many different kinds of noise will affect the image collection process, these factors will make the quality of the image to a large extent. In the process of image denoising, white noise is a very common kind of noise. Even a high-resolution image will have some noise, but some simple denoising algorithms can be used for these noises. However, in this era of high resolution, the real-time performance of denoising is not good, and the real-time denoising is still the subject of many studies. In order to enhance the visual sense of the image by filtering out the noise in the image, we need to filter the two-dimensional image, and then make the operation of the image easier. In this paper, we study the real-time medical image denoising and information hiding model based on deep wavelet multiscale autonomous unmanned analysis. The experimental results show that this method can effectively deal with the noise points in the medical image, and the result graph is better.},

To overcome the biggest challenge of optical buffering and big quantity of data switching, the Data Vortex (DV) all optical switch innovations and its various enhancements such as Augmented Data Vortex (ADV) seem to be the possible solution and can bring the revolution in the industrial world. In this paper, a new generalized algorithm has been used to simulate the equivalent planar virtual model of 3-D ADV and is named as equivalent planar algorithm (EPA). The algorithm is more versatile and provides more flexible design for multiple level networks. To verify the proposed EPA of ADV (or EPA ADV), the simulations have been performed for various input traffic loads and switch size keeping active angle ‘A’ constant. Also the ADV switch is not studied under asymmetric mode (AM) of operation till now which has been done here. Lastly the paper also provides the performance comparison study of original DV and EPA ADV under symmetric and asymmetric I/O mode. The results obtained from simulation have shown that under modest degree of asymmetric I/O operation of the switch EPA ADV shows performance improvement in injection rate (throughput) and average switch latency (SL) under different traffic pattern as compared to symmetric mode (SM) of operation in ADV.},

It consists in finding the minimum number of moves that are needed to retrieve all the containers located in a bay, according to a given retrieval order. Unfortunately, such an order may be subject to uncertainty. The variant of the problem that takes such issue into account is known as the stochastic container relocation problem. In this case, the containers are partitioned into batches. The retrieval order among the batches is known, while that of the containers of the same batch is uncertain and becomes available only when the last container of the previous batch is retrieved. The solution approaches proposed so far in the literature present a common pitfall concerning the complexity of the produced solutions, whose size can grow exponentially with the number of blocks. Here we present a new ad hoc heuristic approach for the problem that applies a suitable reduction of the solution space. Computational experiments on a set of instances taken from the literature are performed. The proposed methodology is able to solve instances that was not possible to solve before. This makes the procedure very appealing also for being applied in practice. Statistics showing how the performances are affected by the size of the instances are also presented.},

Intelligent manufacturing is the latest form of advanced manufacturing development. In order to pay attention to the design and evaluation status of manufacturing system, we understand the connotation of manufacturing system from the perspective of actual manufacturing production and sales. In this paper, the evaluation model and algorithm of Intelligent Manufacturing System Based on pattern recognition and big data are proposed. In the process of studying the information transmission of intelligent manufacturing system, the evaluation hierarchy algorithm of intelligent control system is improved with reference to several modeling methods. Finally, an intelligent manufacturing system suitable for processing big data is designed. In the experiment in workshop A, with the help of computer simulation of artificial intelligent activities, the intelligent manufacturing system analyzes the processing and production data, obtains the dynamic requirements of products in the machining workshop, and provides judgment basis for the construction of dynamic units in enterprises. The experimental results show that after the change of the production organization model using the seasonal change forecasting method, the introduction of the smart manufacturing system, the sales production of this shop has been increasing, and in the 20th month has increased seven times more than the initial, while the overall situation of the predicted sales and actual sales and costs, the superiority of using the smart manufacturing evaluation model is derived.},

Each inbound truck carries one or more load units possibly of different commodities, and each outbound truck must be loaded with different commodities as well. The problem is to define the sequence of trucks at the inbound and outbound gates and the transshipment plan, so as to minimize the makespan of the whole process. We propose a Lagrangian relaxation scheme and a dual ascent method to optimize the Lagrangian dual that encloses three heuristics aimed at recovering feasible solutions for the problem at hand from the solution of the Lagrangian problem.

  abstract     = {The application of wireless sensor networks is not limited to a particular domain. Technology advancements result in innovative solutions for simple communication to large applications via wireless sensor IoT networks. Besides the advancements, there is a serious issue in terms of threats or attacks on wireless sensor networks, which is common. Various intrusion detection methodologies have evolved so far to detect common network attacks. But it is essential to concentrate on other routing attacks like selective forwarding attack, black hole attack, Sybil attack, wormhole attack, identity replication attack, and hello flood attack. Existing research models concentrate on any one of the above-mentioned routing attacks and attain better detection performance. Detecting each attack through different detection mechanisms will increase the overall cost, and it is a tedious process. Considering this factor, in this research work, a novel intrusion detection system is introduced to detect routing attacks in wireless sensor networks using fuzzy and feed-forward neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model attains an average detection rate of 97.8\% and a maximum detection accuracy of 98.8\%, compared to existing techniques like support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) models.},

  abstract     = {Industry 5.0 focuses on collaboration between humans and machines, demanding robustness and efficiency and the accuracy of intelligent and innovative components used. The use of sensors and the fusion of data obtained from various sensors/modes increased with the rise of the internet of things. The multimodal sensor fusion provides better accuracies than a single source/mode system. Typically, in multimodal fusion, data from all sources is assumed to be available all the time, aligned, and noiseless. Contrary to this highly unrealistic assumption, data from one or more sources is generally unavailable or noisy in most real-world applications. Hence, there is a need for robust sensor fusion, which is a more realistic scenario and critical for Industry 5.0 implementations. Multimodal co-learning is one such approach to study the robustness of sensor fusion for missing and noisy modalities. In this work, to demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal co-learning for robustness study, gas detection systems are considered a case study. Such gas detection systems are prevalent and crucial to avoid accidents due to gas leaks in many industries and form a part of the industry 5.0 setup. This work considers the primary dataset of gas sensors data and thermal images for robustness experimentation. The results demonstrate that multi-task fusion is robust to missing and noisy modalities than intermediate fusion. Having an additional low-resolution thermal modality supports co-learning and makes it robust to 20\% missing sensor data, 90\% missing thermal image data, and Gaussian and Normal noise. The end-to-end system architecture proposed can be easily extended to other multimodal applications in Industry 5.0. This study is a step towards creating standard practices for a multimodal co-learning charter for various industrial applications.},

Meanwhile, its performance evaluation attracts more and more attentions from potential users and researchers. To model its computing ecology more accurately, this paper first builds a three-staged TOC service model by introducing asynchronous multi-vacations and tandem queueing, and then proposes a task scheduling algorithm and an optical processor allocation algorithm with asynchronous vacations of some small optical processors after dividing equally the entire optical processor into several small optical processors which can be used independently. At the same time, the analytical model was established to obtain important performance indicators such as response time, the number of tasks and utilization of optical processor, based on M/M/1 and M/M/n queuing system with asynchronous multi-vacations. In addition, relevant numerical simulation experiments are conducted. The results illustrate that the number of small optical processors, vacation rate and the number of small optical processors allowed to be on vacation have important effects on the system performance. Compared with synchronous vacation, asynchronous vacation not only ensures the system to obtain better maintenance but also improves the system performance to some degree.},

With the advent of the information age, enterprise transformation has become an inevitable trend. The management efficiency of enterprises is effectively improved, and the optimal scheduling and efficient management of personnel are realized to design and develop a human resource management (HRM) information system to meet the actual needs of enterprises. By studying the current problems of intelligent enterprise system and HRM information system, based on Java programming language, spring model–view–controller (MVC) web application system is combined with browser/server (B/S) framework, and construction is realized on an intelligent enterprise HRM information system. Aiming at the complexity of enterprise HRM, the meta-heuristic algorithm is adopted to optimize the human resource optimization scheduling module. Through the specific example data, the system implementation and model performance comparison experiments are carried out to further verify the effectiveness of the intelligent enterprise HRM information system proposed here. The results show that the HRM information system based on intelligent enterprise system realizes the effective collection and sorting of data, the running system meets the expected research objectives, and different modules can effectively perform specific functions; the algorithm based on meta-heuristic can realize the reasonable scheduling of personnel, and its model performance is significantly higher than the latest algorithm model. With the continuous increase in the number of events, what is improved is the optimal solution ability of the algorithm. Moreover, it decreases with the increase in the number of iterations, converging around 80 times, and the optimization efficiency reaches 86.35\%; the system can find the optimal solution in a shorter time under the same number of iterations. Besides, after the system clustering, the accuracy of employee performance reaches 92\%. The intellectualization of enterprise HRM greatly improves the office efficiency.},

  abstract     = {At present, the old production management mode has become a stumbling block to the development of enterprises, and the high-end manufacturing technology is still not mature enough. This research mainly discusses the intelligent manufacturing management system based on data mining in artificial intelligence energy-saving resources. The enterprise business management system cannot accurately and timely grasp the actual situation of the production site, and the accuracy and feasibility of the upper-level planning cannot be guaranteed. At the same time, on-site personnel and equipment cannot get practical production plans and production instructions in time, resulting in product backlogs and excessive inventory. On the other hand, equipment is idle and resources are wasted, and the workshop scheduling system loses the corresponding scheduling role. The development of this system is mainly composed of front-end technology, back-end technology and front-end and back-end interaction technology. The interface design of the front end is mainly completed by the windows form application in c#. The interaction between the front and back ends is mainly realized by programming in each control of the form application. Back-end technology is the core content of the system, mainly including two key technologies: mixed programming of C #. Net and MATLAB and C # connecting SQL Server database. The system mainly includes five sub-functional modules: order management, material management, mixed model assembly line balance, assembly line logistics scheduling and system management. Order management and material management are the basis of the system, which provides parameter input for the balance of assembly line and logistics scheduling. The balance of mixed model assembly line is the core function of the system. The balance of mixed model assembly line is carried out by calling the intelligent algorithm written in MATLAB, and the optimal assembly scheme of workstation is displayed to the front end of the system, which reflects the intelligent characteristics of production control system for intelligent manufacturing. The logistics scheduling of assembly line takes the balance result of mixed model assembly line as the premise, takes the balance result as the task sequence input of logistics scheduling, and optimizes the operation efficiency of logistics system (driving path and running time of AGV). The operation results show that the comprehensive energy consumption of 10,000 yuan industrial output value is 401.19 kg standard coal/10,000 yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 6.96\%. This study is helpful to the fine management of manufacturing industry.},

The shopbots were proposed in Industry 4.0 where the more focus was on process automation. In this research work, we propose recommender system for industry 5.0 which is based on collaboration of human beings and machines with more focus on user’s personalization. Recommender system can be considered as an information filtering tool that provides suggestions to users about products, music, friend, topic, etc. This suggestion is based on the interest of users. Several research works have been carried out to improve recommendation accuracy by using matrix factorization, trust-based, hybrid-based, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. However, very few existing works have leveraged textual opinions for the recommendation to the best of our knowledge. Existing research works have focused only on numerical ratings, which do not reflect actual user behaviour. In this research work, sentiments of textual opinions are analysed for an in-depth analysis of user’s behaviour. Recommendation accuracy is improved by using the proposed score Recop which is calculated from opinion sentiments. Furthermore, the sparsity issue is resolved by using our proposed approach. Amazon and Yelp review datasets are used for Experiment analysis. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values are improved significantly using the proposed approach compared to the existing approaches. MAE and RMSE scores on the Yelp dataset are 0.85 and 1.51, respectively. Additionally, MAE and RMSE scores on the Amazon dataset are 0.66 and 0.93, respectively, which clearly reflects the significant contribution of our proposed approach.},

The neural network is trained using the error backpropagation method. One of the benefits of using a neural network is its speed and accuracy while tracking the Maximum PowerPoint. In order to test the suggested MPPT technique, MATLAB/SIMULINK software was used to simulate the TEG mode&#39;s performance. MPPT was developed and used to regulate SEPIC converter switching technology. The temperature is used as an input variable in this technique. Under a variety of temperature conditions, the proposed methodology for studying dynamic responses to track the TEG system&#39;s maximum power point and power generated.

Firstly, the dynamic modeling via Euler Lagrange equation for a single link flexible joint manipulator is discussed. Secondly, for the execution of smooth motion between two points, bounded and continuous jerk trajectory is developed and implemented. In addition, the prospective strategy uses the concatenation of fifth-order polynomials to provide a smooth trajectory between two-way points. In the planned algorithm, user can independently define the position, velocity, acceleration and jerk values at both initial and final positions. The feature of user-defined parameters gives the versatility to the suggested algorithm for generating trajectories for diverse applications of robotic manipulators. Moreover, the planned scheme is easy to implement and computationally efficient.

In accordance with the Gestalt principle, proximity among the nearby objects is higher, whose value varies from expert to expert. Therefore, a possibility for type-I fuzzy logic to be used to evaluate proximity. Fuzzy proximity is computed by means of a difference in intensity (colordiff) and distance (closeness). Further, the block color proximity obtained from the proximity calculation network is graded using an interval threshold. Accordingly, data embedding is processed in the sequence generated by the shared secret keys. The tampering coincidence problem is solved through a post-processing approach to increase the quality and accuracy of the recovered secret message. The experimental analysis, steganalysis and comparisons clearly illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of visual quality, structural similarity, recoverability and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Because the traditional computing model can no longer meet the particularity of Internet of Vehicles tasks, aiming at its characteristics of high bandwidth, low latency and high reliability, this paper proposes a resource allocation strategy for Internet of Vehicles using reinforcement learning in edge cloud computing environment. First, a multi-layer resource allocation model for Internet of Vehicles is proposed, which uses the cooperation mode of edge cloud computing servers and roadside units to dynamically coordinate edge computing and content caching. Then, based on the construction of communication model, calculation model and cache model, make full use of idle resources in Internet of Vehicles to minimize network delay under the condition of limited energy consumption. Finally, the optimization goal is solved by two-layer deep Q network model, and the best resource allocation plan is obtained. The simulation results based on the Internet of Vehicles model show that the computational energy consumption and system delay of proposed strategy do not exceed 400 J and 600 ms, respectively. Besides, the overall effect of resource allocation is better than other comparison strategies and it has certain application prospects.},

  abstract     = {Text summarization is the process of converting the input document into a short form, provided that it preserves the overall meaning associated with it. Primarily, text summarization is achieved in two ways, i.e., abstractive and extractive. Extractive summarizers select a few best sentences out of the input document, while abstractive methods may modify the sentence structure or introduce new sentences. The proposed approach is an extractive text summarization technique, where we have expanded topic modeling specifically to be applied to multiple lower-level specialized entities (i.e., groups) embedded in a single document. Our goal is to overcome the lack of coherence issues found in the summarization techniques. Topic modeling was initially proposed to model text data at the multi-document and word levels without considering sentence modeling. Subsequently, it has been applied at the sentence level and used for the document summarization; however, certain limitations were associated. Topic modeling does not perform as expected when applied to a single document at the sentence level. To address this shortcoming, we have proposed a summarization approach that is incorporated at the individual document and clusters level (instead of the sentence level). We aim to choose the best statement from each group (containing sentences of the same kind) found in the given text. We have tried to select the perfect topic by evaluating the probability distribution of the words and respective topics’ at the cluster level. The method is evaluated on two standard datasets and shows significant performance gains over existing text summarization techniques. Compared to other text summarization techniques, the Rouge parameters for automatic evaluation show a considerable improvement in F-measure, precision, and recall of the generated summary. Furthermore, a manual evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art text summarization approaches.},

For better understanding of the prediction problem, a comprehensive data analysis of weibos related to verified accounts is conducted first. Then, verified account prediction is formulated as a sequence learning problem. Specifically, a weibo from a user is represented as a sequence of feature values by feature hashing and whether the user account is verified is the corresponding label to predict. A deep learning approach is proposed for solving verified account prediction in this formulation.

  abstract     = {At present, the COVID-19 epidemic is still spreading at home and abroad, and the foreign exchange market is highly volatile. From financial institutions to individual investors, foreign exchange asset allocation has become important contents worthy of attention. However, most intelligent optimization algorithms (hereinafter IOAS) adopt the existing data and ignore the forecasted one in the foreign exchange portfolio allocation, which will result in a huge difference between portfolio allocation and actual demand; at the same time, many IOAS are less adaptable and have lower optimization ability in portfolio problems. To solve the aforementioned problems, this paper first proposed a DETS based on hybrid tabu search and differential evolution algorithms (DEAs), which has excellent optimization ability. Subsequently, the DETS algorithm was applied to support vector machine (SVM) model. Experiments show that, compared with other algorithms, the MAE and RMSE obtained by using DETS optimization parameters are reduced by at least 3.79 and 1.47\%, while the CTR is improved by at least 2.19\%. Then combined with the DETS algorithm and Pareto sorting theory, an algorithm suitable for multi-objective optimization was further proposed, named NSDE-TS. Finally, by applying NSDE-TS algorithm, the optimal foreign exchange portfolio is acquired. The empirical analysis shows that the Pareto front obtained by this algorithm is better than that of NSGA-II. Since the lower the uniformity index and convergence index, the stronger the optimization performance of the corresponding algorithm, compared with NSGA-II, its uniformity and convergence index decreased by 15.7 and 39.6\%.},

The success of the IBOA algorithm was tested on 13 benchmark functions which are well known to those working on global optimization and are frequently used for testing and analysis of optimization algorithms. The Tent-mapped IBOA algorithm outperformed the other algorithms in most of the benchmark functions. Moreover, the success of the IBOA-MLP algorithm also has been tested on five classification datasets (xor, balloon, iris, breast cancer, and heart) and the IBOA-MLP algorithm was compared with four algorithms in the literature. According to the statistical performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and Friedman test), the IBOA-MLP outperformed the other algorithms and proved to be successful in training the feed-forward artificial neural networks.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, localization turns out to be a crucial aspect in the realm of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) sparking a lot of research interest among researchers. It is the procedure of discovering the locality of target nodes concerning the installed anchor nodes whose placements are well known as they have a GPS component integrated into them. But as GPS is incompatible with indoor and/or aquatic situations, all sensor nodes are often not set up with it. If all the nodes are fitted with GPS, a network becomes too expensive and uses extra energy, which is a key disadvantage of WSNs. In the literature, various localization strategies have been presented; however, the majority of research ideas focus on 2D applications. In 3D implementations, however, the region under consideration in the sensing environment may be complicated. The determination of node placement in a 3D environment necessitates an optimal algorithm. In this research, we proposed a repulsion-based improved grey wolf optimizer (R-GWO) for the sensor nodes localization that outperforms the traditional GWO in terms of exploration and exploitation abilities. The suggested R-GWO has been evaluated on the WSN Localization problem and has shown to have the lowest localization error when contrasted to the other strategies used in 3D environments.},

The global exploration phase helps the algorithm to get away from the local optimum solutions and enhances the exploration ability of the search process of the algorithm. Like Rao algorithms, the I-Rao algorithm also does not need algorithm-specific control parameters. The effectiveness of the I-Rao algorithm is tested on 25 unconstrained benchmark functions, 45 complex CEC test functions, and 19 real-world constrained mechanical design optimization problems of CEC2020. The comparison of results reveals the effectiveness of the I-Rao algorithm over many state-of-the-art advanced optimization algorithms such as GWO, SCA, PSO, WOA, Jaya, IJAYA, MJAYA, PGJAYA, EJAYA, IUDE, εMAgES, iLSHADEε, and COLSHADE.

  abstract     = {Due to the economic and technical advantages, the use of solar energy is expanding in developed countries. The extraction of maximum power in solar power plants is an important issue that requires extensive research. Extracting the maximum possible power in solar power plants can increase the efficiency of this type of renewable energy sources (RESs). Climatic condition is a very important feature of solar systems. In fact, radiation and temperature are two important parameters that affect the efficiency of solar systems. This paper suggests a novel maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique based on the sliding mode controller (SMC) to extract the maximum power of photovoltaic (PV) systems in different climatic circumstances. To obtain the optimal coefficients of the SMC online, the Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm is employed. SMC coefficients are applied for the variable perturb and observe (P&amp;O) step of MPPT. The proposed GWO-SMC controller can eliminate oscillations in the transient mode and guarantee stability. The findings of the simulation indicate that with the use of an MPPT controller for the solar-PV system, such as P&amp;O, Fuzzy Logic (FLC), Incremental Conductance (INC), the β method, and hill climbing (HC) MPPT, the system will operate more efficiently. The method that has been suggested is tested in a number of different climate conditions. The findings indicate that the proposed technique has an efficiency of 99\%, which demonstrates a substantially superior response time when reaching the MPP in comparison to prevalent methods, which have an efficiency of 92 to 97\%. The results of the simulations allow for the various approaches to be ranked as follows: 1. GWO-SMC, 2. FLC, 3. INC, 4. β method, 5. P&amp;O, 6. HC with response times of 0.14 s, 0.17 s, 0.23 s, 0.25, 0.28 s and 0.35, respectively. The fluctuations using the combinatorial GWO-SMC technique is 4.31 W, while that of the P&amp;O is 74.56 W. Through simulation and testing with the MATLAB software, the developed method&#39;s performance is evaluated to make a comparison.},

  abstract     = {In this work, by combining a three-term memoryless BFGS conjugate gradient direction with the hyperplane projection technique , we develop a new derivative-free algorithm to solve nonlinear monotone equations. The method is motivated by conjugate gradient method and hyperplane projection, as well as quasi-Newton method. The search direction has three terms and is obtained by modifying the BFGS updating matrix with a unit matrix in each step. The algorithm needs no matrices computing, and it is suitable for solving large-scale nonlinear monotone equations. The proposed method satisfies the Dai–Liao conjugacy conditions and is always descent irrelative to any line searches. Under standard conditions, the optimizer solution can be obtained by a globally convergent sequence as long as the initial point is given. The reported numerical experiments show that the method is promising and efficient compared to similar algorithms in the literature.},

We also proposed a framework for solving the unknown area exploration problem with energy constraints using metaheuristics in both single- and multi-robot scenarios. This framework allowed us to benchmark the performances of different metaheuristics for the robotics exploration problem. We conducted several experiments to validate this framework and used it to compare the effectiveness of xBOA with well-known metaheuristics used in the literature through 5 evaluation criteria. Although BOA and xBOA are not optimal in all these criteria, we found that BOA can be a good alternative to many metaheuristics in terms of the exploration time, while xBOA is more robust to local optima; has better fitness convergence; and achieves better exploration rates than the original BOA and its other variants.},

Bioinspired algorithms are well-suited for optimization. The simulator is stressed by inputting thousands of randomly generated parameters, and hence, a robust numerical model is required. Once the proper model and parameters reproduce the experimental data, they can be used for design improvement. This article proposes a reformulation of a macrohomogeneous mathematical model to provide higher numerical stability to the solutions. We introduce optimization problems for parameter estimation and design optimization by applying three bioinspired algorithms to maximize its performance and minimize the platinum mass loading $$m_\mathrm{{Pt}}$$ . The results are validated by comparing the experimental polarization curves with those simulated from the estimated parameters. We compare a base design’s performance with the optimized design for maximum performance. We also compare a base design with the optimized design for minimum $$m_\mathrm{{Pt}}$$ . The results show that the particle swarm optimization requires the lowest computational cost and performs the best in most cases, fitting the experimental data with errors lesser than $$10^{-17}$$ . The minimization of $$m_\mathrm{{Pt}}$$ reduces the amount by 42\% compared to the base case.},

However, due to the wide range of load usage in grid systems, the reliability and power loss in forward converter-based system performance became crucial. Many earlier researches are conducted to validate the performance of forward converters in renewable resources. But, effective improvement is not achieved for wind applications. Thus, in this paper, the novel grey wolf-based boosting intelligent frame (GWbBIF) control algorithm is proposed in forward converter switching controls. The gain of the controller and duty cycle of the converter is tuned by the proposed control approach. Consequently, the power loss from the wind transformer is optimized by the proposed grey wolf fitness function. The implementation of this research has been done on the MATLAB/Simulink platform. The simulation outcomes of the proposed system are compared with various conventional techniques in terms of total harmonic distortion (THD), power loss, stability, error, driving circuit, etc. While compared with the other methods, the proposed methods effectively show the optimal performance of forward converter in wind system by reduced power loss and improved reliability that is considered as the significant aspects while estimating the entire system.},

  abstract     = {The dialogue data usually consist of the pairs of a query and its response, but no previous response generators have exploited the responses explicitly in their training while a response provides significant information about the meaning of a query. Therefore, this paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence response generator with a response-aware encoder. The proposed generator exploits golden responses by reflecting them into query representation. For this purpose, the response-aware encoder adds a relevancy scorer layer to the transformer encoder that calculates the relevancy of query tokens to a response. However, golden responses are available only during training of the response generator and unavailable at inference time. As a solution to this problem, the joint learning of a teacher and a student relevancy scorer is adopted. That is, at the training time, both the teacher and the student relevancy scorers are optimized but the decoder generates a response using only the relevancy of the teacher scorer. However, at the inference time, the decoder uses that of the student scorer. Since the student scorer is trained to minimize the difference from the teacher scorer, it can be used to compute the relevancy of a prospective response. The proposed model is the first attempt to use a golden response directly for generating a query representation, whereas previous studies used the responses for its implicit and indirect reflection. As a result, it achieved higher dialogue evaluation score than the current state-of-the-art model for Reddit, Persona-Chat, and DailyDialog data sets.},

  abstract     = {As cryptocurrency is widely accepted and used, attendant illegal activities have attracted extensive attention, especially phishing scams, which bring great losses to both customers and countries. From the perspective of crime prevention, early warning of such illegal behaviors is of great significance. However, most existing studies focus on detecting phishing scams that have already occurred and been reported. In addition, previous studies ignore the temporal order of users&#39; appearance and thus cannot accurately extract features reflecting users’ transaction patterns. In this paper, we propose a framework called early-stage phishing detection to address the problem of early phishing detection. According to the phishing amount, we first divide the process of phishing scams into three stages: early stage, middle stage, and late stage. Then, we develop a feature extraction method to capture features from both the local network structures and the time series of transactions. In experiments, the dataset is strictly partitioned by time series, and experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms existing graph embedding methods on a real-world Ethereum transaction dataset. Finally, we select the ten most important features and analyze the differences between phishing users and normal users on these features, which provide useful insights for regulators and platforms to detect phishing scams in advance.},

In order to deal with the second issue, this paper presents an algorithm to improve the quality of adversarial examples in terms of $$L_0$$ -norm and $$L_2$$ -norm. This algorithm employs adversarial pixel ranking heuristics such as JSMA and COI to prioritize adversarial pixels. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments have been conducted on the MNIST dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. For the first issue, the proposed autoencoder generates diverse adversarial examples. For the second issue, the proposed algorithm significantly improves the quality of adversarial examples. In terms of $$L_0$$ -norm, the proposed algorithm decreases from hundreds of adversarial pixels to one adversarial pixel. In terms of $$L_2$$ -norm, the proposed algorithm reduces the average distance considerably.

  abstract     = {The decomposition structure learning algorithm is the most effective for the structure learning of large Bayesian networks. Maximal prime subgraph decomposition is one of the main methods of Bayesian network structure decomposition learning. The key to maximal prime subgraph decomposition is the search for separators. However, existing methods of searching separators are inefficient, because they all search for separators globally. To improve the accuracy and speed of Bayesian network structure decomposition learning algorithm, we design an efficient recursive Bayesian network structure decomposition learning algorithm (ERDA) and propose a method to locally search for separators recursively for ERDA in this paper. Each iteration includes two steps. The first stage is to determine a target node according to the minimum node degree. The second stage is to perform a local search for the separator in the adjacent node set of the target node. The separator splits the network into two subgraphs, where the small subgraph contains the target node and the larger one does not. Local search is only performed iteratively in the large subgraph. Finally, we conduct experiments on various samples to compare the Hamming distance and running time of ERDA method with four existing methods and ERDA method based on recursive local search for separators with ERDA based on global search for separators. Then, we apply our method to the German credit dataset, which is a real data from UCI, to obtain its credit causality model. All the algorithms are compiled and implemented in MATLAB. Experiments show that our method has better performance than state-of-the-art methods and has applicability to real problems.},

In the financial market, there are many similar but not simultaneous fluctuations caused by different reaction efficiencies to the same event. Therefore, quickly reflected stocks’ trends could improve trend predictions of similar slowly reflected stocks. To find the temporal correlation between stocks in the same securities exchange, a financial time series classification approach based on aligning change points is proposed to help investors discover hidden temporal correlations, which could improve stock trend prediction, to adjust portfolios. Firstly, the securities index of the securities exchange is chosen to be the benchmark, and the important change points are screened out to mark the essential fluctuations. Secondly, the points of all the constituent stocks of the same securities index which could be aligned to the important change points of the index are screened out and aligned through the aligning algorithm. Then the number of aligned stocks’ points in different types helps to divide stocks into lead class and lag class. Temporal correlation and time difference are obtained through the temporal correlation analysis algorithm. Finally, four different prediction models are used to verify whether the classification information and time difference obtained from temporal correlation analysis could improve the stock trend prediction. The results show that our work could reveal potential connections among stocks as a bridge to introduce valid exogenous information, which is promising for stock trend prediction studies.},

  abstract     = {Many recent data-driven studies have used sensor profile data for prognostics and health management (PHM). However, existing data-driven PHM techniques are vulnerable to three types of uncertainty: sensor noise inherent to the sensor profile data, uncertainty regarding the current health status diagnosis caused by monitoring a single health index (HI), and uncertainty in predicting the remaining useful life (RUL), which is affected by unpredictable changes in system operating conditions and the future external environment. This study proposes a deep conditional health index extraction network (DCHIEN) for PHM to effectively manage these three types of uncertainty. DCHIEN is a model that combines a stacked denoising autoencoder that extracts high-level features robust to sensor noise with a feed-forward neural network that produces an HI based on user-defined monitoring conditions. This approach supports system health monitoring using the conditional HI, as well as prognostics using RUL interval predictions. Extensive experiments were conducted using NASA’s turbofan engine degradation dataset. The results show that the proposed method achieves a superior RUL prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods and that uncertainties can be effectively managed.},

Incurring the advantages of kernel-depend extreme learning machine (KELM), this study offers a grey wolf optimization-based KELM (GWO-KELM) for effective prediction of discharge coefficient through submerged radial gates. Additionally, support vector machine (SVM) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) methods are also presented for comparative purposes. To build prediction models using GWO-KELM, GPR, and SVM, an extensive experimental database was established, consisting of 2125 data samples gathered by the US Bureau of Reclamation. From simulation results, it is observed that the proposed GWO-KELM approach with radial basis function and input parameters of the ratio of the downstream flow depth to the gate opening and submergence ratio provides the best performance with the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.983, the determination coefficient (DC) of 0.966 and the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.027. The obtained results showed that the proposed GWO-KELM with RBF kernel function gives better prediction accuracy than employed GPR and SVM approaches. Furthermore, the obtained results showed that the employed kernel-depend methods are capable of a statistically predicting the discharge coefficient under varied submergence conditions with satisfactory level of accuracy. Amon theme, proposed hybrid GWO-KELM method gave the most accurate results (R = 0.873, DC = 0.744, and RMSE = 0.035) for extremely highly submerged flow. Moreover, the results reflected that the employed kernel-depend methods give better predictions than the developed dimensionless formulas.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain knowledge signifies a useful fundamental knowledge to safeguard faith in transboundary transmittals for main banks and financial institutions. In the study of group decision-making, the most important issue is how to coordinate opinions from different blockchains to reach a compromise under uncertainty. To tackle uncertainties surrounding multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems in real-life scenes, we introduce a trapezoidal fermatean fuzzy set which generalizes trapezoidal fuzzy sets and fermatean fuzzy sets. The trapezoidal fermatean fuzzy model enables the degrees of membership, abstention, and non-membership to be expressed by linguistic terms. We define the operational laws of trapezoidal fermatean fuzzy numbers, and Einstein aggregation operator based on the trapezoidal fermatean fuzzy number. This makes it more flexible and descriptive to model the attitudes of Blockchain knowledge in MAGDM applications. Since multi-input arguments are interconnected and Blockchain knowledge has a lot of options perception, we also define the TOPSIS technique to facilitate the fusion of trapezoidal fermatean fuzzy information. With the aid of the trapezoidal fermatean fuzzy-TOPSIS technique, the main goal of this research is to present a general MAGDM framework by integrating the step with the complex proportional assessment. A trapezoidal fermatean positive ideal solution always wants the maximum value of the benefit criteria and the minimum value of the cost criteria. On the other hand, the trapezoidal fermatean negative ideal solution always wants the maximum value of the cost criteria and the minimum value of the benefit criteria. An integrated trapezoidal fermatean fuzzy-TOPSIS framework is established. In the proposed decision framework, the trapezoidal fermatean fuzzy-TOPSIS method is utilized to identify the subjective weights of decision attributes, and the trapezoidal fermatean fuzzy-TOPSIS approach is used to rank alternatives. Lastly, a case study concerning blockchain knowledge assessment is presented to demonstrate that the suggested scheme is feasible and effective. Furthermore, sensitivity and comparison analyses are conducted to show the robustness and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {As a vital step of text classification (TC) task, the assignment of term weight has a great influence on the performance of TC. Currently, masses of term weighting methods can be utilized, such as term frequency-inverse documents frequency and term frequency-relevance frequency (TF-RF). It can be found that they are both consisted of local part (TF) and global part (e.g., IDF, RF). However, most of these methods adopt the logarithmic processing on their respective global parts, so it is natural to consider whether the logarithmic processing applies to all these methods or not. Actually, for a specific term weighting method, due to its different ratio of local weight and global weight resulting from logarithmic processing, it usually shows diverse text classification results on different text sets, which shows poor robustness. To explore the influence of logarithmic processing imposed on the TC performance of term weighting methods, TF-RF is selected as the representative because it can achieve relatively stable performance among these methods adopting logarithmic processing. Then, in order to balance the local part and global part of TF-RF, an improved term weighting method based on TF-RF is proposed, named as term frequency-exponential relevance frequency (TF-ERF). And two groups of experiments are conducted on TF-ERF and other existing term weighting methods based on two general standard corpora. The results show that the improved term weighting method TF-ERF has better text classification performance and robustness.},

Thus, aside the COVID-19 pandemic, dealing with fake news and myths about the virus constitute an infodemic issue, which must be tackled by ensuring only valid information. In this context, this study proposed the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and the classifier vote ensemble (SCLAVOEM) method as a fake news classifier and a hyper parameter optimization approach for predictive modelling of COVID-19 infodemic tweets. Hyper parameter optimization variables were deployed across specific points of the proposed model and a minority oversampling of training sets was applied within imbalanced class representations. Experimental applications by the SCLAVOEM for COVID-19 infodemic prediction returned 0.999 and 1.000 weighted averages for F-measure and area under curve (AUC), respectively. Thanks to the SMOTE, the performance increases of 3.74 and 1.11\%; 5.05 and 0.29\%; 4.59 and 8.05\% was seen in three different data sets. Eventually, the SCLAVOEM provided a framework for predictive detecting ‘fake tweets’ and three classifiers: ‘positive’, ‘negative’ and ‘click-trap’ (piège à clics). It is thought that the model will automatically flag fake information on Twitter, hence protecting the public from inaccurate and information overload.},

The classification algorithm makes use of the training datasets to build a model which can be used for allocating unclassified records to a defined class. In this paper, the coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (CHIO) algorithm is used to boost the efficiency of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) when solving classification problems. First, the PNN produces a random initial solution and submits it to the CHIO, which then attempts to refine the PNN weights. This is accomplished by the management of random phases and the effective identification of a search space that can probably decide the optimal value. The proposed CHIO-PNN approach was applied to 11 benchmark datasets to assess its classification accuracy, and its results were compared with those of the PNN and three methods in the literature, the firefly algorithm, African buffalo algorithm, and β-hill climbing. The results showed that the CHIO-PNN achieved an overall classification rate of 90.3\% on all datasets, at a faster convergence speed as compared outperforming all the methods in the literature.},

Moreover, results for several countries from different regions of the world have been obtained. Furthermore, comparative study has been carried out for the countries under consideration. The comparison was performed for the data of different countries on same dates of each month. However, the calculations are carried out for thirteen consecutive weeks, to investigate the rate of spread and the control of the disease in these countries. This guides us to some important concepts like factors favoring the spread of virus and those resisting the spread. Different regions are studied and their data have been evaluated to know which regions are the most effected. This study helps to know the important factors about the behavior of the coronavirus in different environments, such as lockdowns, temperatures, humidity and other restrictions.

  abstract     = {Vehicular delay-tolerant networks follow a store–carry–forward mechanism to overcome the state of broken links between source and destination, which is crucial for autonomous vehicle networks. These networks depend upon the mobility of vehicular-relay nodes, which can adopt the store–carry–forward arrangement and provide consent to utilize their resources for packet forwarding. In reality, vehicular-relay nodes drop packets because of a lack of resources and selfish behavior, leading to potential failures in networks. The reason for this failure in performance is the absence of an efficient relay node selection strategy. Typically, vehicular delay networks can provide communication solutions in challenging conditions when other traditional networks fail to perform due to disconnection. However, if the routing strategy does not consider nodes’ selfish nature and relay nodes’ inefficiency, packet drops continue, and the approach will fail to perform. This paper proposes a routing strategy, known as the best-choice vehicular-relay selection strategy for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) transmission, to overcome this breakdown situation. The proposed strategy selects the best-performing vehicular-relay nodes and restricts the packet replication to low-performing vehicular nodes. The proposed routing strategy selects the best-choice relay nodes based on their past performance. Numerical analysis and our simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms some of the leading routing strategies in its class by increasing the delivery probability, decreasing the overhead ratio, average latency, and the number of dropped packets in the vehicular network.},

  abstract     = {The highly spreading virus, COVID-19, created a huge need for an accurate and speedy diagnosis method. The famous RT-PCR test is costly and not available for many suspected cases. This article proposes a neurotrophic model to diagnose COVID-19 patients based on their chest X-ray images. The proposed model has five main phases. First, the speeded up robust features (SURF) method is applied to each X-ray image to extract robust invariant features. Second, three sampling algorithms are applied to treat imbalanced dataset. Third, the neutrosophic rule-based classification system is proposed to generate a set of rules based on the three neutrosophic values , the degrees of truth, indeterminacy falsity. Fourth, a genetic algorithm is applied to select the optimal neutrosophic rules to improve the classification performance. Fifth, in this phase, the classification-based neutrosophic logic is proposed. The testing rule matrix is constructed with no class label, and the goal of this phase is to determine the class label for each testing rule using intersection percentage between testing and training rules. The proposed model is referred to as GNRCS. It is compared with six state-of-the-art classifiers such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), and random forest classifiers (RFC) with quality measures of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. The results show that the proposed model is powerful for COVID-19 recognition with high specificity and high sensitivity and less computational complexity. Therefore, the proposed GNRCS model could be used for real-time automatic early recognition of COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one among the common disease associated with the human eye that can cause blindness. Detection of DR is very important as the disease will damage the eye with the passage of time. A computer-aided diagnosis-based system is used nowadays to assist the medical practitioner to correctly detect DR during the early stages. In this work, a retinal image’s classification is proposed, which is composed of three major blocks. Initially, the images are preprocessed using CLAHE and DNCNN neural networks, which will reduce the induced noise in the images. Preprocessed images then segmented using morphological and K-mean algorithms. The enhanced images have shown a better peak signal-to-noise ratio. The segmented images are then fed to the proposed EyeNet, which is a transfer learning-based model. The architecture of EyeNet is based on ResNet-18. The network is trained on more than 1500 images from clinical, DRIVE, and STARE databases and has shown an accuracy of 99.76\%.},

The result indicates that the variables of a hub airport, OD-Pair HHI and throughput have a more significant effect on SBT than the duration of each flight phase does (i.e., aircraft taxi-in and taxi-out time, airborne time, etc.). Fierce competition has prompted airlines to improve their on-time performance (OTP), instead of scheduling shorter block times. Moving forward, if the departure airport is a major one, the SBT will increase by 3.43 min, indicating that airport throughput is a primary determinant in adding or shortening SBT in China&#39;s aviation system.},

Moreover, based on the ideas in the derivation of the Maximum Principle of Pontryagin, we have derived the maximum principle of Pontryagin using the approach of Classical Calculus of Variations modified along the line of brief perturbation and derived an expression for the change in the value of performance index over each discretized interval. First, we derived an expression for the difference in the performance index due to perturbation in control $$\mathbf{u}$$ that differs slightly from $${\boldsymbol{u}}^{\boldsymbol{*}}$$ . Then, using the calculus of variations once again, we derived the formula for calculating the difference in the performance index using the brief perturbation suggested by Agashe. Also, we have given three examples of linear and non-linear systems for establishing the expediency of our derivations.

The selected seven air quality pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, NH3, and O3) at 223 monitoring stations and temperature recorded in New Delhi were used to investigate the spatial pattern of air quality throughout the lockdown. The results showed that the air quality has improved across the country and average temperature and maximum temperature were connected to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This outcomes indicates that there is no such relation between climatic parameters and outbreak and its associated mortality.

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and then moved to almost every country showing an unprecedented outbreak. The world health organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, millions of people were infected, and millions have lost their lives all around the globe. By the end of 2020, effective vaccines that could prevent the fast spread of the disease started to loom on the horizon. Nevertheless, isolation, social distancing, face masks, and quarantine are the best-known measures, in the time being, to fight the pandemic. On the other hand, contact tracing is an effective procedure in tracking infections and saving others’ lives. In this paper, we devise a new approach using a hybrid harmony search (HHS) algorithm that casts the problem of finding strongly connected components (SCCs) to contact tracing. This new approach is named as hybrid harmony search contact tracing (HHS-CT) algorithm. The hybridization is achieved by integrating the stochastic hill climbing into the operators&#39; design of the harmony search algorithm. The HHS-CT algorithm is compared to other existing algorithms of finding SCCs in directed graphs, where it showed its superiority over these algorithms. The devised approach provides a 77.18\% enhancement in terms of run time and an exceptional average error rate of 1.7\% compared to the other existing algorithms of finding SCCs.},

  abstract     = {To offer better treatment for a COVID-19 patient, preferable medicine selection has become a challenging task for most of the medical practitioners as there is no such proven information regarding it. This article proposes a decision-making approach for preferable medicine selection using picture fuzzy set (PFS), Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory of evidence and grey relational analysis (GRA). PFS is an extended version of the intuitionistic fuzzy set, where in addition to membership and non-membership grade, neutral and refusal membership grades are used to solve uncertain real-life problems more efficiently. Hence, we attempt to use it in this article to solve the mentioned problem. Previously, researchers considered the neutral membership grade of the PFS similar to the other two membership values (positive and negative) as applied to the decision-making method. In this study, we explore that neutral membership grade can be associated with probabilistic uncertainty which is measured using D–S theory of evidence and FUSH operation is applied for the aggregation purpose. Then GRA is used to measure the performance among the set of parameters which are in conflict and contradiction with each other. In this process, we propose an alternative group decision-making approach by the evidence of the neutral membership grade which is measured by the D–S theory and the conflict and contradiction among the criteria are managed by GRA. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated to solve the COVID-19 medicine selection problem.},

  abstract     = {The COVID19 pandemic globally and significantly has affected the life and health of many communities. The early detection of infected patients is effective in fighting COVID19. Using radiology (X-Ray) images is, perhaps, the fastest way to diagnose the patients. Thereby, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be considered as applicable tools to diagnose COVID19 positive cases. Due to the complicated architecture of a deep CNN, its real-time training and testing become a challenging problem. This paper proposes using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) instead of the last fully connected layer to address this deficiency. However, the parameters’ stochastic tuning of ELM’s supervised section causes the final model unreliability. Therefore, to cope with this problem and maintain network reliability, the sine–cosine algorithm was utilized to tune the ELM’s parameters. The designed network is then benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, and the results are verified by a comparative study with canonical deep CNN, ELM optimized by cuckoo search, ELM optimized by genetic algorithm, and ELM optimized by whale optimization algorithm. The proposed approach outperforms comparative benchmarks with a final accuracy of 98.83\% on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 2.33\% compared to a canonical deep CNN. Even more critical, the designed network’s training time is only 0.9421 ms and the overall detection test time for 3100 images is 2.721 s.},

  abstract     = {The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is related to new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has mobilized several scientifics to explore clinical data using soft-computing approaches. In the context of machine learning, previous studies have explored supervised algorithms to predict and support diagnosis based on several clinical parameters from patients diagnosed with and without COVID-19. However, in most of them the decision is based on a “black-box” method, making it impossible to discover the variable relevance in decision making. Hence, in this study, we introduce a non-supervised clustering analysis with neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) as a strategy of decision-making. We propose to identify potential variables in routine blood tests that can support clinician decision-making during COVID-19 diagnosis at hospital admission, facilitating rapid medical intervention. Based on SOM features (visual relationships between clusters and identification of patterns and behaviors), and using linear discriminant analysis , it was possible to detect a group of units of the map with a discrimination power around 83\% to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. In addition, we identified some variables in admission blood tests (Leukocytes, Basophils, Eosinophils, and Red cell Distribution Width) that, in combination had strong influence in the clustering performance, which could assist a possible clinical decision. Thus, although with limitations, we believe that SOM can be used as a soft-computing approach to support clinician decision-making in the context of COVID-19.},

A vital step in the battle against it is the successful screening of infected patients, together with one of the effective screening methods being radiology examination using chest radiography. Recognition of epidemic growth patterns across temporal and social factors can improve our capability to create epidemic transmission designs, including the critical job of predicting the estimated intensity of the outbreak morbidity or mortality impact at the end. The study’s primary motivation is to be able to estimate with a certain level of accuracy the number of deaths due to COVID-19, managing to model the progression of the pandemic. Predicting the number of possible deaths from COVID-19 can provide governments and decision-makers with indicators for purchasing respirators and pandemic prevention policies. Thus, this work presents itself as an essential contribution to combating the pandemic. Kalman Filter is a widely used method for tracking and navigation and filtering and time series. Designing and tuning machine learning methods are a labor- and time-intensive task that requires extensive experience. The field of automated machine learning Auto Machine Learning relies on automating this task. Auto Machine Learning tools enable novice users to create useful machine learning units, while experts can use them to free up valuable time for other tasks. This paper presents an objective method of forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak using Kalman Filter and Auto Machine Learning. We use a COVID-19 dataset of Ceará, one of the 27 federative units in Brazil. Ceará has more than 235,222 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 8850 deaths due to the disease. The TPOT automobile model showed the best result with a 0.99 of $$R^2$$ score.},

  abstract     = {Accurate forecast of natural gas consumption is of significance for policy makers to formulate energy plans, save costs and improve energy structure. This study designs a novel three-parameter discrete direct grey model denoted as TDDGM, which overcomes existing modeling drawbacks about the accumulating generation for monotonous series. Moreover, the optimal initial condition of the proposed model is deduced by the ordinary least square method and the final recursive function is derived. Error checking method of TDDGM and five different numerical cases are introduced to verify the superiority and effectiveness of the new approach. The results show that TDDGM performs better than other several benchmark models in multiple tests. Finally, it is utilized to forecast China’s natural gas consumption and the predicted results will maintain a steady upward trend, reaching 322.06 billion cubic meters in 2022. The research results have positive significance for enriching grey system theory and improving energy structure in China.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is a novel pandemic disease. Covid-19 originates from SARS-COV2 and represents the cause of a potentially fatal disease as a global public health problem. However, we have to renew our knowledge about the symptoms of this disease day by day. If we look generally, although the main symptoms seen in this epidemic are fever, cough and shortness of breath, cases without symptoms are also reported. Moreover, in severe cases, pneumonia, severe respiratory failure, kidney failure and death may develop. In this paper, it is suggested that all the different symptoms that may occur in various regions of the world should be taken into consideration and each region should be evaluated within itself. Moreover, in order to have an idea of the general situation, it was taken into account in the average case. For this, two algorithms were built by using soft set theory. The first of the algorithms focuses on the analysis of the relationships between the symptoms and aims to measure a possible effect of the symptoms on each other. The second one aims to identify the most dominant symptom. The results obtained by utilizing both algorithms argue that it is more useful to examine different regions in order to better manage the epidemic. Moreover, some consistent results have been obtained as to which parameters a person should show first in order to Covid test.},

  abstract     = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has a limitation of early convergence and needs to be improved to find the global optima. The main objective here is to improve its exploration capability without deteriorating the exploitation capability. For this purpose, a modified version of PSO, namely Elitist Random Swapped Particle Swarm Optimization (ERSPSO), has been proposed. The elitist (fittest) particles in the swarm guide the other particles to improve their position. To enhance exploration in the search process a swapping of the randomly selected parts of the elitist particle positions (candidate solution) has been made. Consequently, a perturbation is applied to further improve the exploration. The proposed ERSPSO has been applied to the full benchmark set of 25 functions (CEC 2005) as well as complex real life problems like ‘Gene selection by sample classification’. The new variant ERSPSO has been validated by the statistical metrics, convergence plot, sensitivity analysis using convergence behaviour, p-values using Wilcoxon rank sum test and Friedman rank test. For sample classification in Gene selection, VkNN (a new variant of kNN) is proposed which performs better than kNN in classification accuracy. The combined ERSPSO-VkNN is tested in 6 microarray datasets including 4 diseases. In most of the datasets (5 datasets out of 6) ERSPSO-VkNN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. In different datasets, the percentage of classification accuracy of ERSPSO-VkNN varies between 89.29 and 100\%. Finally, a biological verification is performed to show that many of the selected genes are biologically significant according to the reporting in current literature.},

Each player has an accurate prediction of other players’ behavior and acts consistent with such a rational prediction. This paper aims to apply the game theory idea of equilibrium as a decision-making tool to develop a simple method for solving a multi-objective decision-making problem with any number of players to achieve an equilibrium point. Game theory and Nash equilibrium have been used to determine the equilibrium point of multi-objective decision-making problems of production planning in non-cooperative environments. A mixed and conditional N-player model was proposed as a development of the Nash model. The method was applied to a second-square planning problem with multiple constrained objectives (with linear constraints) in order to allocate a larger share of the sales market in a situation where all objectives were in conflict with each other. Effective solutions were first obtained using the bl constraint method, and then, an effective equilibrium point was extracted using the proposed method. Since the problem-solving method was discrete, the effective equilibrium point was reduced, and the results were used for making decisions about six products in the competitive market.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the effect of two water reducer polymers with smooth and rough surfaces on the compression strength of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) was investigated. Three different initial ratios between water and cement (w/c) 0.5, 0.6, and 1 were used in this study. The amount of polymer contents varied from 0 to 0.06\% (\%wt) for the cement paste with an initial w/c of 0.5. The cement paste&#39;s polymer contents ranged between 0 and 0.16\% (\%wt) with an initial w/c of 0.6 and 1 were investigated. SEM test was conducted to identify the impact of polymers on the behavior of cement paste. The compression strength of OPC cement increased significantly by increasing the polymer contents. Because a fiber net (netting) around cement paste particle was developed when the polymers were added to the cement paste, which leads to decrease the void between the particles, binding the cement particles, therefore, increased the viscosity and compression strength of the cement rapidly. In this analysis, the hardness of cement paste with polymer contents has been evaluated and modeled using four different model technics: more environmentally sustainable construction, and lower cost than conventional building materials and early-age strengths of the cement. To overcome the mentioned matter, this study aims to establish systematic multiscale models to predict the compression strength of cement paste containing polymers and to be used by the construction industry with no theoretical restrictions. For that purpose, comprehensive data of 280 tested cement paste modified with polymers have been conducted, analyzed, and modeled. Linear, nonlinear regression, M5P-tree, and artificial neural network (ANN) technical approaches were used for the qualifications. In the modeling process, the most relevant parameters affect the strength of cement paste, i.e., polymer incorporation ratio (0–0.16\% of cement&#39;s mass), water-to-cement ratio (0.5–1), and curing ages (1–28 days). According to the correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error, and the root-mean-square error, the compression strength of cement paste can be well predicted in terms of w/c, polymer content, and curing time using four various simulations techniques. Adding polymer creates an amorphous gel that fills the porous between the particles of the cement, which causes a reduction in the voids and porosity and enhances the dry density of the cement; subsequently, the compression strength of the cement-grouted sands increases significantly. Among the used approaches and based on the training data set, the model made based on the nonlinear regression, ANN, and M5P-tree models seems to be the most reliable models. The sensitivity investigation concludes that the polymer content is the most affected parameter for predicting the compression strength of cement paste.},

  abstract     = {Generating personalized responses is one of the major challenges in natural human–robot interaction. Current studies in this field mainly focus on generating responses consistent with the robot’s pre-assigned persona, while ignoring the user’s persona. Such responses may be inappropriate or even offensive, which may lead to the bad user experience. Therefore, we propose a bilateral personalized dialogue generation (BPDG) method for dyadic conversation, which integrates user and robot personas into dialogue generation via designing a dynamic persona-aware fusion method. To bridge the gap between the learning objective function and evaluation metrics, the conditional mutual information maximum (CMIM) criterion is adopted with contrastive learning to select the proper response from the generated candidates. Moreover, a bilateral persona accuracy metric is designed to measure the degree of bilateral personalization. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves the improvement on the random personalized test set of 23.99 in bilateral persona accuracy, 1.1 in BLEU, 0.83 in F1, 0.02 in distinct score, and the improvement on the biased personalized test set of 5.56 in bilateral persona accuracy, 7.51 in BLEU, 2.12 in F1, 0.02 in distinct score. On the manual evaluations, the proposed method can generate more fluency, bilateral persona-consistent, and context-consistent responses compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

The dynamic and algebraic model of the neural network is derived based on the optimization conditions of the quadratic problem and their relationship with the projection theory. The proposed method prevents the chattering by selecting proper parameters of the twisting reaching law. The convergence of the neural network is analysed using the Lyapunov stability theory. A singular value-based analysis is employed for robustness of the proposed method. The stability conditions of the discrete-time closed-loop system are analysed by studying eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix using the singular value approach.

We develop a deterministic cost minimization problem first then we fuzzify the model by considering the production rate, the demand rate and all the cost components as lock fuzzy numbers. We convert the fuzzy model into equivalent game problem by considering Gaussian normal strategic probabilities. The model has been solved with the help of different key vectors employed by the decision maker. We have shown that the value of the game might be changed with the change of different key vectors.

  abstract     = {The colorization of grayscale images is a challenging task in image processing. Recently, deep learning has shown remarkable performance in image colorization. However, the detail loss and color distortion are still serious problem for most existing methods, and some useful features may be lost in the processes of various convolutional layers because of the vanishing gradient problem. Therefore, there is still a considerable space to reach the roof of image colorization. In this work, we propose a deep convolutional auto-encoder with special multi-skip connections for image colorization in YUV color space, and the specific contributions or designs of this work are shown as the following five points. First, a given gray image is used as the Y channel to input a deep learning model to predict U and V channel. Second, the adopted encoder-decoder consists of a main path and two branch paths, and the branch path has two skip connection ways that include one shortcut in each three layers and one shortcut in each six layers. Third, the convolutional kernel size is set as 2*2 that is a special consideration in the path of one shortcut in each six layers. Fourth, a composite loss function is proposed based on the mean square error and gradient that is defined to calculate the errors between the ground truth and the predicted result. Finally, we also discuss the reasonable network parameters, such as the way of shortcut connection, the convolutional kernel size of shortcut connection, and loss function parameters. Experiments on different image datasets show that the proposed image colorization model is effective, and the scores of the PNSR, RMSE, SSIM, and Pearson correlation coefficient are, respectively, to 27.0595, 0.1311, 0.561, and 0.9771.},

This model will be used later to automatically control the movements of a bot. The result is an artificial agent that mimics the human player. We have implemented, tested and evaluated this technology from two different points of view: performance by using classical metrics (accuracy, ROC area and PRC area) and believability by using a Turing test for trained bots. The results obtained are interesting and promising, showing that this method can be a good alternative to design and implement the behaviour of intelligent agents in video game development.},

  abstract     = {Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is a broadening of intuitionistic fuzzy set that can represent the situations where the sum of membership and the non-membership values exceeds one. Adding parameterization to PFS, we obtain a structure named as Pythagorean fuzzy soft set (PFSS). It has a higher capacity to deal with vagueness as it captures both the structures of a PFS and a soft set. Several practical situations demand the measure of similarity between two structures, whose sum of membership value and non-membership value exceeds one. There are no existing tools to measure the similarity between PFSS and this paper put forward similarity measures for PFSS. An axiomatic definition for similarity measure is proposed for PFSS and certain expressions for similarity measure are introduced. Further, some theorems which express the properties of similarity measures are proved. A comparative study between proposed expressions for similarity measure is carried out. Also, a clustering algorithm based on PFSS is introduced by utilizing the proposed similarity measure.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled significant progress in the single image super-resolution (SISR) field in recent years. However, most super-resolution methods based on deep neural networks obtain spatial information using a single-size convolution kernel, which leads to insufficient local feature extraction. In addition, since convolution serves for local operations, it fails to capture the image’s inherent attributes. This paper tackles these problems by proposing a novel multi-scale dense attention network (MSDAN) based on the attention mechanism and multi-scale feature extraction. The network employs multi-scale dense blocks (MSDB) that utilize convolution kernels of different sizes to extract feature information of distinct scales. Additionally, the attention is used to model global features effectively and strengthen the network’s expressiveness. Hierarchical feature fusion is followed by multi-level feature extraction, which fuses each unit’s feature map output. Finally, the image is reconstructed using up-sampling. The experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms other several state-of-the-art super-resolution reconstruction algorithms regarding objective evaluation indicators and visual effects on datasets Set5, Set14, BSD100 and Urban100.},

This paper aims to propose a vulnerability model that utilizes a dual-stage min–max game for the resource allocation process of CPS. Moreover, a novel Improved Chaotic Elephant Herding Optimization (ICEHO) Algorithm is employed in the allocation of resources, thereby minimizing the damaged cost value. In ICEHO, the random parameters are chaotically tuned to obtain the best optimal value, thereby reducing several computational and complexity issues. In addition to this, the ICEHO is implemented in solving the nonlinear problems that occur during resource allocation.

  abstract     = {As one of the evolutionary algorithms, firefly algorithm (FA) has been widely used to solve various complex optimization problems. However, FA has significant drawbacks in slow convergence rate and is easily trapped into local optimum. To tackle these defects, this paper proposes an improved FA combined with extremal optimization (EO), named IFA-EO, where three strategies are incorporated. First, to balance the tradeoff between exploration ability and exploitation ability, we adopt a new attraction model for FA operation, which combines the full attraction model and the single attraction model through the probability choice strategy. In the single attraction model, small probability accepts the worse solution to improve the diversity of the offspring. Second, the adaptive step size is proposed based on the number of iterations to dynamically adjust the attention to the exploration model or exploitation model. Third, we combine an EO algorithm with powerful ability in local-search into FA. Experiments are tested on two group popular benchmarks including complex unimodal and multimodal functions. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IFA-EO algorithm can deal with various complex optimization problems and has similar or better performance than the other eight FA variants, three EO-based algorithms, and one advanced differential evolution variant in terms of accuracy and statistical results.},

  abstract     = {Identifying risky components is crucial to improving product reliability in the final redesign of products. Design failure mode and effects analysis has become a prevalent application in product redesign as a useful risk assessment method. However, critical data, which contain failure causality relationships (FCRs) between failure modes, correlations among risk factors, and user attention index of the product component, are not considered. This study develops an improved approach for identifying the target risky components considering importance index, user attention, and FCRs based on the design risky component (DRC) and nonlinear optimization model. The DRC, which integrates the customer requirement level, quality test level, and failure risk information of product components, is proposed to represent the risk degree of product components. The nonlinear optimization models are constructed to derive the weights of risk factors and final redesign of product components. Firstly, a two-stage fuzzy quality function deployment is established to map the importance index of customer requirements under a trapezoidal fuzzy number. A local–global normalization measure is implemented to calculate the index of user attention based on quality test data. Secondly, the FCRs of failure modes between or within product components are characterized by a directed network model. In this network, the failure modes are modeled as vertices, and the causality relationships among failure modes are modeled as directed edges. The values of the directed edges are characterized by weighted risk priority numbers, and the weight of risk factors is optimized by a nonlinear optimization model. Then, the FCRs incorporate the internal failure effect and the external failure effect, which are characterized by PROMETHEE II with the net flow. A 0–1 optimization model with the maximum redesign value and resource constraints of product components is constructed to decide on the final redesign of target risky components. Finally, a real-world case of display product is conducted to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective in identifying risk components.},

Data mining has already become more popular in recent years. In this research paper, we propose a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method under T-spherical fuzzy environment for selecting an optimal data mining strategy which is an important part of modern decision-making research. The information aggregation operators play an important role in solving MAGDM problems. Some point aggregation operators based on the 2-tuple linguistic T-spherical fuzzy numbers, including 2-tuple linguistic T-spherical fuzzy point weighted averaging (2TLT-SFPWA) operator, 2-tuple linguistic T-spherical fuzzy point weighted geometric (2TLT-SFPWG) operator, 2-tuple linguistic T-spherical fuzzy generalized point weighted averaging (2TLT-SFGPWA) operator and 2-tuple linguistic T-spherical fuzzy generalized point weighted geometric (2TLT-SFGPWG) operator, are proposed which competently capture all the aspects of human opinions expressible in terms of yes, no, cessation and denial with no limitation. The proposed aggregation operators are valid and have some basic properties which are keenly analyzed. Furthermore, the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method is developed on the basis of 2-tuple linguistic T-spherical fuzzy point aggregation operators. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed work along with comparative analysis which verifies the reliability and efficacy of its outcomes. In the end, we conclude some results from the numerical analysis, i.e., to balance the long-term development of e-commerce, data mining can mine massive amounts of data which boosts the growth of e-commerce in future.},

In addition to the routing and scheduling decisions, the crew size for each route also has to be decided. Adapted from iterative three-component heuristic (I3CH), an enhanced heuristic is designed for this problem. Integrating two effective methods and the alteration between feasible and infeasible regions, the proposed heuristic finally consists of three components, including (i) an iterated local search in feasible region, (ii) a tabu search in infeasible region, and (iii) a route recombination for a high-quality solution. Besides, due to the particularity of deliverymen assignment, some adaptive changes must be made accordingly compared with the original I3CH. The TOPTWMD instances are generated by modifying the Solomon instances. To evaluate the performance of the enhanced heuristic, computational experiments are conducted on a set of 138 instances for comparing enhanced heuristic with CPLEX and original I3CH. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and the stability of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, additional analyses verify that the joint use of the three components and the alteration between feasible and infeasible regions make significant contributions to the performance of the enhanced heuristic.},

  abstract     = {The trisecting–acting–outcome model of a three-way decision is a practical approach to solving complex problems, consisting of three components: trisecting, acting, and outcome. Trisecting means dividing a complex problem into three parts based on an evaluation function, and acting means designing the corresponding action to apply to these three parts. The outcome denotes evaluation effectiveness based on the first two steps. Measuring this outcome is a challenging and moving question after trisecting-and-acting (T &amp;A). This paper proposes a method to measure outcome based on object changes before and after T &amp;A based on top-down and bottom-up perspectives, depending on the decision needs. First, evaluation functions are constructed that extend the traditional evaluation functions to measure changes. Then, based on the introduced evaluation functions, qualitative and quantitative of three-way changes are introduced and analyzed. Furthermore, we present the processes that determine the optimal strategy with the quantitative analysis. The analysis of several examples shows the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed method.},

The chaotic dynamical behaviors such as symmetry, chaoticity, bifurcation and boundedness are discussed in detail for the finance system with state variables; interest rate, investment demand and price index. The complex composite symmetrical attractors of finance system with different magnitudes are obtained. Moreover, with the help of multilevel-logic pulse signal, the generation of two pairs of different magnitudes symmetrical attractors are explored. The novel grid composite multiscroll chaotic attractors is one of the most interesting result is found in the finance system. By adjusting the parameters of multilevel-logic pulse signals, the finance system is controlled and a novel grid composite multiscroll chaotic attractor is explored in this article.},

Ensure that QoSR is aware of the environment of the network of vehicles, including location of vehicles, direction, and speed. This study is to reduce the effects of unpredictable problems on the best pathway to replace the broken path/link. A QoSR with Particle Swarm Optimization (QoSR-PSO) is used in this article for improving QoSs in vehicular ad hoc networks. By modeling the behavior of a group of particles, particle swarm optimization algorithms find the best possible solution to the problem. In order to perform simulation experiments, NS2 simulator and VanetMobisim have been used. The comparison results with benchmark studies show the improvement in packet delivery rate (PDR), delay, Packet Drop, and overload.},

Swine Flu, HIV/AIDS, corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19), etc., are some of the global pandemics in the world. The major cause of becoming pandemic is community transmission and lack of social distancing. Recently, COVID-19 is such a largest outbreak all over the world. This disease is a communicable disease which is spreading fastly due to community transmission, where the affected people in the community affect the heathy people in the community. Government is taking precautions by imposing social distancing in the countries or state to control the impact of COVID-19. Social distancing can reduce the community transmission of COVID-19 by reducing the number of infected persons in an area. This is performed by staying at home and maintaining social distance with people. It reduces the density of people in an area by which it is difficult for the virus to spread from one person to other. In this work, the community transmission is presented using simulations. It shows how an infected person affects the healthy persons in an area. Simulations also show how social distancing can control the spread of COVID-19. The simulation is performed in GNU Octave programming platform by considering number of infected persons and number of healthy persons as parameters. Results show that using the social distancing the number of infected persons can be reduced and heathy persons can be increased. Therefore, from the analysis it is concluded that social distancing will be a better solution of prevention from community transmission.},

  abstract     = {The aim is to explore the development trend of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) and predict the infectivity of 2019-nCoV (2019 Novel Coronavirus), as well as its impact on public health. First, the existing data are analyzed through data pre-processing to extract useful feature factors. Then, the LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) prediction model in the deep learning algorithm is used to predict the epidemic situation in Hubei Province, outside Hubei nationwide, and the whole country, respectively. Meanwhile, the impact of intervention time changes on the epidemic situation is compared. The results show that the prediction results are almost consistent with the actual values. Specifically, Hubei Province abolishes quarantine restrictions after the Spring Festival holiday, and the first COVID-19 peak is reached in late February, while the second COVID-19 peak has been reached in early March. Finally, the cumulative number of diagnoses reaches 85,000 cases, with an increase of 15,000 cases compared with the nationwide cases outside Hubei under the continuous implementation of prevention and control measures. Under the prediction of the proposed LSTM model, if the nationwide implementation of prevention and control interventions is postponed by 5 days, the epidemic will peak in early March, and the cumulative number of diagnoses will be about 200,000; and if the intervention measures are implemented five days earlier, the epidemic will peak in mid-February, with a cumulative number of diagnoses of approximately 40,000. Meanwhile, the proposed LSTM model predicts the RMSE values of the epidemic situation in Hubei Province, outside Hubei nationwide, and the whole country as 34.63, 75.42, and 50.27, respectively. Under model comparison analysis, the prediction error of the proposed LSTM model is small and has better applicability over similar algorithms. The results show that the LSTM model is effective and has high performance in infectious disease prediction, and the research results can provide scientific and effective references for subsequent related research.},

  abstract     = {We describe in this paper an approach for predicting the COVID-19 time series in the world using a hybrid ensemble modular neural network, which combines nonlinear autoregressive neural networks. At the level of the modular neural network, which is formed with several modules (ensembles in this case), the modules are designed to be efficient predictors for each country. In this case, an integrator is used to combine the outputs of the modules, in this way achieving the goal of predicting a set of countries. At the level of the ensembles, forming a part of the modular network, these are constituted by a set of modules, which are nonlinear autoregressive neural networks that are designed to be efficient predictors under particular conditions for each country. In each ensemble, the results of the modules are combined with an aggregator to achieve a better and improved result for the ensemble. Publicly available datasets of coronavirus cases around the globe from the last months have been used in the analysis. Interesting conclusions have been obtained that could be helpful in deciding the best strategies in dealing with this virus for countries in their fight against the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the proposed approach could be helpful in proposing strategies for similar countries.},

It provides a novel way for knowledge acquisition, especially when dealing with vagueness and uncertainty. Many mathematical modelings have been presented recently to control the pandemic nature of COVID-19 and along with its control model as well. Decision-based treatment recommendation has not yet been found so far in any of the articles. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach of three-way decision based on linguistic information of a COVID-19 susceptible person. To present this, we have discussed the probabilistic rough fuzzy hybrid model with linguistic information. This model helps us to guess the infected person and decide whom to send for self-isolation, home quarantine and medical treatment in an emergency situation. The significance of the proposed hybrid model has been discussed by presenting a comparative study and reported along with justifications too.},

  abstract     = {The outbreaks of Coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic have increased the pressure on healthcare and medical systems worldwide. The timely diagnosis of infected patients is a critical step to limit the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The chest radiography imaging has shown to be an effective screening technique in diagnosing the COVID-19 epidemic. To reduce the pressure on radiologists and control of the epidemic, fast and accurate a hybrid deep learning framework for diagnosing COVID-19 virus in chest X-ray images is developed and termed as the COVID-CheXNet system. First, the contrast of the X-ray image was enhanced and the noise level was reduced using the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and Butterworth bandpass filter, respectively. This was followed by fusing the results obtained from two different pre-trained deep learning models based on the incorporation of a ResNet34 and high-resolution network model trained using a large-scale dataset. Herein, the parallel architecture was considered, which provides radiologists with a high degree of confidence to discriminate between the healthy and COVID-19 infected people. The proposed COVID-CheXNet system has managed to correctly and accurately diagnose the COVID-19 patients with a detection accuracy rate of 99.99\%, sensitivity of 99.98\%, specificity of 100\%, precision of 100\%, F1-score of 99.99\%, MSE of 0.011\%, and RMSE of 0.012\% using the weighted sum rule at the score-level. The efficiency and usefulness of the proposed COVID-CheXNet system are established along with the possibility of using it in real clinical centers for fast diagnosis and treatment supplement, with less than 2 s per image to get the prediction result.},

In this paper, real-time data are filtered and forwarded to the right processing node by using the proposed topic-based hierarchical publish/subscribe messaging middleware in the distributed scalable network of collaborating computation nodes instead of classical approaches of centralized computation. This enables processing streaming medical data in near real time and makes a warning system possible. End users have the capability of filtering/searching. The returned search results can be images (COVID-19 or non-COVID-19) and their meta-data are gender and age.

This paper proposes an innovative Bagging-based cross-media retrieval algorithm (called BCMR) based on this concept. First, we use bootstrap sampling to take a random sample from the original set. The amount of sample abstracted by bootstrapping is set to be the same as the amount of sample abstracted by the original dataset. Secondly, 50 bootstrap replicates are used to train 50 weak classifiers. In our experiments, we used homogeneous individual classifiers and eight different baseline methods. Last but not least, we generate the final strong classifier from 50 weak classifiers using the sample voting integration strategy. Using collective wisdom, we can get rid of bad decisions, giving the integrated model a much better generalization ability. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that BCMR can significantly improve cross-media retrieval accuracy.},

In this study, machine learning techniques were employed to balance the real estate market, affected by the tourism sector in Alanya district of Antalya province, Turkey, and examine changes in value objectively and scientifically. First, the criteria affecting the real estate value were determined as structural and spatial, and data on real estate were obtained from the online real estate website. Then, the values of the real estate in the selected application area were predicted using machine learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machines). Unlike studies in the literature, algorithm-based valuation using machine learning algorithms was performed instead of mathematical modeling. When analyzed for performance metrics, the best result was achieved with the support vector machines algorithm (0.73). Objective methods should be used to balance the exorbitant differences between real estate values, to regulate market conditions and to carry out a real estate valuation process free from speculative effects in coastal areas where tourism factor is effective. This study indicated the applicability of algorithm-based machine learning techniques in real estate valuation.},

To address this problem, we have proposed a robust model called BFHumor, a BERT-Flair-based Humor detection model that detects humor through news headlines. It is an ensemble model of different state-of-the-art pre-trained models utilizing various NLP techniques. We used public humor datasets from the SemEval-2020 workshop to evaluate the proposed model. As a result, the model achieved outstanding performance with 0.51966 as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and 0.62291 as accuracy. In addition, we extensively investigated the underlying reasons behind the high accuracy of the BFHumor model in humor detection tasks. To that end, we conducted two experiments on the BERT model: vocabulary level and linguistic capturing level. Our investigation shows that BERT can capture surface knowledge in the lower layers, syntactic in the middle, and semantic in the higher layers.},

  abstract     = {Stock markets are a popular kind of financial markets because of the possibility of bringing high revenues to their investors. To reduce risk factors for investors, intelligent and automated stock market forecast tools are developed by using computational intelligence techniques. This study presents a hyperparameter optimal genetic programming-based forecast model generation algorithm for a-day-ahead prediction of stock market index trends. To obtain an optimal forecast model from the modeling dataset, a differential evolution (DE) algorithm is employed to optimize hyperparameters of the genetic programming orthogonal least square (GpOls) algorithm. Thus, evolution of GpOls agents within the hyperparameter search space enables adaptation of the GpOls algorithm for the modeling dataset. This evolutionary hyperparameter optimization technique can enhance the data-driven modeling performance of the GpOls algorithm and allow the optimal autotuning of user-defined parameters. In the current study, the proposed DE-based hyper-GpOls (DEHypGpOls) algorithm is used to generate forecaster models for prediction of a-day-ahead trend prediction for the Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 (ISE100) and the Borsa Istanbul 100 (BIST100) indexes. In this experimental study, daily trend data from ISE100 and BIST100 and seven other international stock markets are used to generate a-day-ahead trend forecaster models. Experimental studies on 4 different time slots of stock market index datasets demonstrated that the forecast models of the DEHypGpOls algorithm could provide 57.87\% average accuracy in buy–sell recommendations. The market investment simulations with these datasets showed that daily investments to the ISE100 and BIST100 indexes according to buy or sell signals of the forecast model of DEHypGpOls could provide 4.8\% more average income compared to the average income of a long-term investment strategy.},

  abstract     = {Microarray is a high-throughput sequencing technology, which can be used to classify cancer types and select the highly relevant cancer biomarkers (i.e., genes). To improve the availability of ever-increasing microarray data, data-integrative analysis becomes a hot research direction. However, the complexity of gene expression data still brings many challenges to the data integration methods: (1) the relevant biomarker selection in multiple high-dimensional datasets; (2) the batch effects between datasets; (3) the high noise in features and samples; (4) the large-scale data analysis with high computational cost. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Distribute-based Biological data-Integrative Analysis model—DBIA. DBIA is based on the $$L_{1/2}$$ regularized logistic regression ( $$L_{1/2}$$ LR) model and the alternating direction multiplication algorithm (ADMM) for data integration. The regularization model is an effective method for selecting latent cancer-relevant genes and improving the accuracy of cancer classification. Moreover, we adopt the $$L_{1/2}$$ LR model to reduce the noise and dimensionality of the data. ADMM is employed to reduce the batch effects between datasets, analyze multiple datasets in parallel, and save the computational cost of large-scale data analysis. Experimental results on the simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that DBIA achieves the good prediction performance with a shorter time, lower hardware requirements, and strong robustness. The genes selected by DBIA have a certain biological significance.},

  abstract     = {In this study, forecasting the number of immigrants on the Turkey’s maritime line for use in a national security project carried out by Turkish Government within the scope of fight against uncontrolled immigration is discussed for the first time. Handling with the immigration problem is one of the biggest concerns of Turkey as unsupervised immigration can adversely affect the demographic and economic structure of the country. Precautions are needed as the short-, medium- and long-term impacts of undetected immigrants on the country’s ecosystem are unpredictable, but due to the uncertainties inherent in immigration, the cost of using government resources such as patrol vehicles to capture undocumented immigrants can be extremely high. In order to both minimize the expenditure problem and keep immigration under control by providing a proper scan, forecasting the number of immigrants on the maritime line route is seen as an important problem and studied by probabilistic and non-probabilistic models. Since the data for 2020 and 2021 could not be attained yet due to COVID-19, in order to obtain forecasts and compare actual observations for 2019, which is the primarily focus of the research in this study, the dataset of interest on the number of daily immigrants between years 2016 and 2019 is obtained from Turkish Coast Guard Command within Ministry of Interior of Republic of Turkey. To obtain the most accurate forecasts, seven distinguished forecasting methods, from simple to complex, are implemented. Then, the forecast combination approach with meta-fuzzy functions which combines all methods is proposed. Consequently, the forecasting results are acquired and evaluated by using R. The evaluation of the results is made by using widely considered measurement accuracy metric root mean square error. According to the final assessments, the proposed approach gives more accurate forecasting results for the expected number of immigrants on the Turkey’s maritime line and these results become an input to the national security project.},

  abstract     = {Extreme learning machine (ELM) as a type of feedforward neural network has been widely used to obtain beneficial insights from various disciplines and real-world applications. Despite the advantages like speed and highly adaptability, instability drawbacks arise in case of multicollinearity, and to overcome this, additional improvements were needed. Regularization is one of the best choices to overcome these drawbacks. Although ridge and Liu regressions have been considered and seemed effective regularization methods on ELM algorithm, each one has own characteristic features such as the form of tuning parameter, the level of shrinkage or the norm of coefficients. Instead of focusing on one of these regularization methods, we propose a combination of ridge and Liu regressions in a unified form for the context of ELM as a remedy to aforementioned drawbacks. To investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm, comprehensive comparisons have been carried out by using various real-world data sets. Based on the results, it is obtained that the proposed algorithm is more effective than the ELM and its variants based on ridge and Liu regressions, RR-ELM and Liu-ELM, in terms of the capability of generalization. Generalization performance of proposed algorithm on ELM is remarkable when compared to RR-ELM and Liu-ELM, and the generalization performance of the proposed algorithm on ELM increases as the number of nodes increases. The proposed algorithm outperforms ELM in all data sets and all node numbers in that it has a smaller norm and standard deviation of the norm. Additionally, it should be noted that the proposed algorithm can be applied for both regression and classification problems.},

  abstract     = {Data fusion is an efficient way to achieve an improved accuracy and more specific inferences by fusing and aggregating data from different sensors. However, due to the increasing complexity of spatial data with massive and multi-source heterogeneous characteristics, the existing methods cannot satisfy quite well the requirement for the integrity of data and the accuracy of fusion results in some specific situations. By considering the geographical properties of spatial data, a multi-source heterogeneous spatial big data fusion method based on multiple similarity and voting decision (SDFSV) is proposed in this paper, which develops a three-step record linking algorithm to improve the quality of entity recognition for the incremental fusion of massive data. Then, a one-time voting algorithm is introduced into the proposed method, so that the data conflicts can be significantly reduced and thus the accuracy of the data fusion can be improved. And a relation deduction method based on rule and entity recognition is presented to enhance the data integrity. In addition, in order to promote traceability and interpretability of fusion results, it is necessary to construct a data traceability mechanism. Experimental results show that SDFSV has an improved performance by using the data of Beijing Medical Institutions collected from 10 data sources.},

Considering these two supply chains could choose between the centralized (C) and decentralized (D) channel structures, current research establishes four channel models, namely, Models DD, DC, CD and CC, wherein Model DD(CC) means that both supply chains adopt channel D(C) and Model DC(CD) refers to GSSC adopting channel D(C) while TSSC using channel C(D). Furthermore, an evolutionary game is developed to explore the ESSs of the dynamic competitive system. The research results show that the stronger the integration between upstream and downstream firms of GSSC is, the higher green service the supply chain would provide when TSSC adopts channel D. Besides, when the market competition is sufficiently low, only point (0,0) is the ESS; when it is moderate, there exist two ESSs, i.e., ESS (0,0) and ESS (1,1); when it is extremely high, only point (1,1) is the ESS. The numerical examples show that the green service level increases in market competition while some retailing and wholesale prices under specific models would not be affected by it or show an inverted U shape, and the initial states of two supply chains’ channel strategies significantly impact the system’s ESSs.},

Notably, the main objective of this work is to obtained the finite-time synchronization criterion for the resulting synchronized error system over finite bound with the developed non-fragile controller. For that, some consignment of sufficient conditions is derived systematically by implementing Lyapunov’s indirect method and finite-time stability theory which ensures the finite-time stochastic synchronization of the stipulated neural networks. Later on, the controller gain fluctuations that obeying certain white noise sequels derived from Bernoulli distribution are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

In the beginning, we define dominating set of a rough fuzzy digraph based on its lower and upper dominating sets and evaluate its domination number. We characterize bounds for the dominating set of rough fuzzy digraphs and analyze the behavior of the domination number on union, intersection and complement of rough fuzzy digraphs. Furthermore, we conceptualize rough fuzzy dipath graphs and rough fuzzy dicycle graphs and generalize expressions for computing their domination numbers. In addition, we demonstrate an application of dominating set in decision-making problem to select the best set of cities in a country that can supply a commodity to the whole country with minimum cost. Finally, we construct a framework and develop an algorithm which effectively tackles with decision-making problems concerning such complex networks.},

Firstly, the criteria PIFN weights are calculated using comparison matrices with the help of decision-makers (DMs), and then, FTOPSIS is done to obtain the final ranking.

The retailer reworks faulty items to make them non-defective, and the retailer receives a discount on the cost of purchasing defective items. The presented inventory system addresses the uncertainty in inventory costs and also considers the deterioration of items with prioritized maximum product life. In this study, our aim is to minimize the total inventory cost when demand rate as a function of quality and power pattern of time under crisp and generalized triangular neutrosophic environments. Based on the payment deal, interest charges are imposed only when the payment delay has passed a particular allowable time limit. The neutrosophic number, which provides three different types of membership functions representing truth, hesitation, and falseness, is used in the inventory model to handle the cost pattern’s uncertainty. A particle swarm optimization approach is used to analyze the proposed inventory model, and the results are validated using a numerical example and sensitivity analysis for various parameters.},

Many scholars have proposed a lot of distance measures between the intuitionistic fuzzy sets. However, there are few works about the interval-valued intuitionistic multiplicative (IVIM) distance measure. The few research achievements are not sufficient to deal with the problems involving the distance between two interval-valued intuitionistic multiplicative sets (IVIMSs). Thus, there still exist some shortages in fully describing the difference between two IVIMSs. In this paper, we first propose an improved distance measure, the projection-based distance measure, which can reflect the difference between two objects more accurately with IVIM information. After that, a new method is introduced to determine the experts’ weights based on the projection-based distance measure. Then, to handle the group decision making problem in which the weights of experts are unknown, we use the proposed projection-based distance measure to construct the similarity matrix in Boole clustering method. Finally, the clustering method is applied to the customer classification problem to test the reliability of the method.},

  abstract     = {The selection of a proper international freight transport route is one of the crucial tasks for decision-makers since it can affect costs, efficiency, and transportation performance. Besides, the selection of suitable and appropriate freight routes can also reduce external costs of transportation such as emissions, noise, traffic congestions, accidents, and so on. Route selection in international transportation is a complicated decision-making problem as many conflicting factors and criteria affect the assessment process. It has been observed that there is no mathematical model and methodological frame used for solving these selection problems, and decision-makers make decisions on this issue based on their own experiences and verbal judgments in the research process. Therefore, a methodological frame is required to make rational, realistic, and optimal decisions on route selection. From this perspective, the current paper proposes using the IVAIF CODAS, an extended version of the traditional CODAS techniques, and using the Atanassov interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVAIFS) for processing better the existing uncertainties. The proposed model is applied to solve the route selection, a real-life decision-making problem encountered in international transportation between EU countries and Turkey. According to the results of the analysis, option A6 (i.e., Route-6 (Bursa–Istanbul–Pendik–Trieste (Ro-Ro)–Austria–Frankfurt/Germany) has been determined as the best alternative. These obtained results have been approved by a comprehensive sensitivity analysis performed by using different MCDM techniques based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Hence, it can be accepted that the proposed model is an applicable, robust, and powerful mathematical tool; also, it can provide very reliable, accurate, and reasonable results. As a result, the proposed model can provide a more flexible and effective decision-making environment as well as it can provide valuable advantages to the logistics and transport companies for carrying out practical, productive, and lower cost logistics operations.},

  abstract     = {The brain is a significant organ that controls all activities of the body parts. A Brain Tumor (BT) is a group of tissues, which are structured by the gradual accumulation of irregular cells. The tasks namely (a) identification, (b) segmentation along with (c) identification of the infected region in BT utilizing MRIs is slow and wearisome. Here, BT Detection (BTD) in MRI images has been proposed utilizing Adaptive-ANFIS (Adaptive-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) classifier with the segmentation of tumor along with edema. Primarily, the input RGB is transmuted into a Grayscale Image (GSI). During pre-processing, the non-brain tissues are eradicated utilizing the Skull Stripping Algorithm (SSA). Next, the resulted image is segmented into ‘2’ parts: (a) tumor and (b) edema utilizing Modified Region Growing (MRG) and Otsu’s thresholding. Then, as of the segmented “tumor part” image, the DWT, WST, Edge, and color histogram features are extracted. Then, the required features are selected as of the extracted features by employing the MGWO algorithm. After that, those features being selected are given to the Adaptive-ANFIS, which categorizes the tumor as (a) Benign and (b) Malignant. The adaptive process is conducted by the K-Means Clustering (KMC) algorithm. Experiential results examined the performances defined by the proposed as well as the prevailing system regarding specificity, accuracy, sensitivity, recall, and precision.},

The primary goal of this research is to investigate a fractal model of straight convective fins with a constant thermal conductivity that varies with temperature. From the thermo-geometric fin parameter, one can determine the temperature of the fin. A method that has been developed to solve the fractal order energy equation is called the Maclaurin series method (MSM). The applied method is designed for engineers and is straightforward, effective, and efficient. The simulation results are presented in figures for temperature and fin tip temperature. The findings are used in thermal design to investigate straight fins with thermal conductivity both constant and dependent upon temperature. Furthermore, the outcome of the MSM approach is compared to established literature solutions, and an excellent agreement is observed. Nevertheless, its efficiency and usefulness culminate in contrast with the numerical solution.},

Furthermore, the deterioration of perishable products and machine breakdowns during production run time complicate the production. To handle such things, this paper incorporates the proportion of defective items and the proportion of scrap items with a uniform distribution to attain an optimal solution. The uncertainties in the data related to the proportion of scrap items, and the repair time are treated as pentagonal fuzzy numbers. An optimization model to minimize the total cost is stated with fuzzy parameter features. A graded mean differentiation method is used to defuzzify the fuzzy output. The major outcome acquired from this model is the optimal total cost, order quantity, and expected total profit of the production process. Additionally, a value-added process for degradable items has been used to develop an economic production quantity model. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to show how the optimal values vary when the various cost parameters are varied.},

The current EI index is a measure of homophily applied to networks with the presence of disjoint groups, although disjoint groups on a large scale rarely exist in many empirical networks. In addition, the combination of edge and node weights in the evaluation of the EI index is also proposed. We tested the measure in two networks in different contexts. The first is a co-authorship network, where researchers, actors in the network, are divided according to the time of Ph.D. completion. The second network is formed by trade relations between countries of the American continent, where countries are grouped according to the Human Development Index. The application of the proposed measure in these two networks is justified by the imprecision of the information or by the difficulty of allocating nodes in a specific group, being necessary to define affiliation levels.

  abstract     = {The main purpose of identifying and locating the retina vessels is to specify from the fundus image the various tissues of the vascular structure, which can be wide or tight. The classification of vessels in the retinal image often confronts several challenges, such as the low contrast accompanying the fundus image, the inhomogeneity of the background lighting, and the noise. Moreover, fuzzy c-means (FCM) is one of the most frequently used algorithms for medical image segmentation due to its effectiveness. Hence, many FCM method derivatives have been developed to improve their noise robustness and time-consuming. This paper aims to analyze the performance of some improved FCM algorithms to recommend the best ones for the segmentation of retinal blood vessels. Eight derivatives of FCM algorithm are detained in this study: FCM, EnFCM, SFCM, FGFCM, FRFCM, DSFCM_N, FCM_SICM and SSFCA. The performance analysis is conducted from three viewpoints: noise robustness, blood vessels segmentation performance, and time-consuming. At first, the noise robustness of improved FCM clustering algorithms is evaluated using a synthetic image degraded by various types and levels of noise. Then, the ability of the selected algorithms to segment retinal blood vessels is assessed based on images from the DRIVE and STARE databases after a pre-processing phase. Finally, the time consumption of each algorithm is measured. The experiments demonstrate that the FRFCM and DSFCM_N algorithms achieve better results in terms of noise robustness and blood vessels segmentation. Regarding the running time, the FRFCM algorithm requires less time than other algorithms in the segmentation of retinal images. The results of this study are extensively discussed, and some suggestions are proposed at the end of this paper.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the application of Probabilistic Linguistic Term Sets (PLTS) in Multiple Attribute Group Decision Making (MAGDM) when the weights cannot be determined. Firstly, as an improvement of PROMETHEE, the PAMSSEM method has substantial advantages in handling mixed data and missing data. It can not only make use of the preference threshold as well as the irrelevant threshold to express the preference degree of the decision-maker (DM) but likewise express the compensation limit that DM is willing to accept through the rejection threshold. Simultaneously, the MAUT method cleverly employs the marginal utility function to redistribute the evaluation values under the same attribute within a fixed interval, making the decision matrix standard and reliable. To comprehensively utilize the advantages of these two methods, we integrated the PAMSSEM II and MAUT methods in the probabilistic linguistic environment to form the PL-MAUT-PAMSSEM II method followed by applying it to the problem of inbound tourism destination selection. Secondly, in the process of data processing, an equivalent conversion function will be used to convert the PLTS and the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (HPFS) to each other to make the calculation between the matrices feasible and use the entropy method to calculate the weights to ensure the decision-making process. Finally, taking the sample deviation value as the inspection standards, the big data analysis compared with other methods is carried out through a large number of sample examples to scientifically validate the superiority of the newly proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The recommendation system (RS) suffers badly from the cold start problem (CSP) that occurs due to the lack of sufficient information about the new customers, purchase history, and browsing data. Moreover, data sparsity problems also arise when the interaction is made among a limited number of items. These issues not only pose a negative impact on the recommendation but also significantly condense the diversity of choices available on the particular platform. To tackle these issues, a novel methodological approach called sparsity and cold start aware hybrid recommended system (SCSHRS) has been designed to suppress data sparsity and CSP in RS. The performance of the proposed SCSHRS method is tested on MovieLens-20 M, Last.FM and Book-Crossing data sets and compared with the prevailing techniques. Based on the evaluation reports with the standards, the proposed SCSHRS system gives Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 40\%, and, precision (0.16), recall (0.08), F-measure (0.1), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain of 0.65. This study completely describes the SCSHRS mechanism and its comparison with other pre-proposed historic and traditional processes based on collaborative filtering.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an integrated approach, of a multi-criteria decision-making framework and fuzzy multi-objective programming to optimize dispatching and rebalancing for Ride-sharing Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (RAMoD) systems, whereby, a fleet of self-driving electric vehicles are coordinated to service on-demand travel requests and eventually allowing multiple passengers to share rides. Specifically, the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and the Fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution are first integrated in order to analyze customer preferences, prioritize their attitudes toward autonomous vehicles, and then to rank fleet vehicles according to these prioritizations. Next, leveraging the ranks of vehicles, we introduce a new Multi-Objective Possibilistic Linear Programming (MOPLP) model, considering realistic constraints and handling the uncertain nature of some critical data affecting RAMoD systems. Three conflicting goals are considered simultaneously which are (i) to minimize the lost customer requests, (ii) to minimize the total transportation cost and (iii) to improve customer satisfaction. This MOPLP model is converted to an equivalent crisp MOLP through applying appropriate strategies and the goal programming method is called to solve this MOLP and find an efficient compromise solution. Finally, the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach are presented through an illustrative example. Collectively, this work provides a unified framework for controlling and analyzing RAMoD systems, which includes a wide range of modeling options (e.g., the inclusion of the uncertain future demand), and provides the first correlation between the dispatching and rebalancing decisions, and the process of analyzing customer preferences toward autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {In hub-and-spoke systems, hub location and allocation decisions depend on some parameters, such as transportation demand. When demand is time-dependent, a function can be estimated that reflects demand changes over time. In real-world conditions, due to the lack of knowledge and the nature of transportation demand, the coefficients of this function cannot be determined precisely. In this case, these coefficients are considered as uncertain parameters. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model for a sustainable multi-period hub location problem when demand changes are based on a linear function of time, and the coefficients of this function are fuzzy parameters. In the proposed model, it is possible to increase the capacity of hubs and hub links and transfer the capacity between hubs through modules. Also, the model determines the best timing for implementing the decisions. The objectives include minimizing system costs, minimizing emissions, and maximizing job opportunities related to sustainability aspects. We linearize the model and present a crisp counterpart formulation. Then, the computational results and sensitivity analysis are presented. Results show that the cost of designing the hub network with economic and social considerations is higher than the cost of designing the network with economic and environmental considerations. Ignoring the uncertainty in the problem can lead to non-optimal solutions. Also, the impact of increasing the number of hubs on reducing emissions after a threshold is marginal. We also introduce some valid inequalities to strengthen the formulation. The results indicate the acceptable performance of valid inequalities.},

  abstract     = {Everything in the world almost resembles each other which could find out with the help of some measures. Similarity measure (SM) is one of them that play a dominant role in decision-making (D $$M_{g}$$ ). The higher the value of the SM, the more the things will match perfectly. Weights of criteria appear to specify that the decision-makers (DMs) recognize the significance of public views and their influence on reaching an ideal solution. Sometimes DMs hesitate or they are uncertain to assign the weights to the criteria because of their similar nature. Linear programming (LP) technique has been implemented to evaluate the weights of criteria to reduce the complexity of DMs so that they can avoid biasedness. An extension of fuzzy sets (FSs) named dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFSs) is utilized to handle ambiguous and uncertain information. Based on the Hausdorff metric and the Hamming distance, SM is developed to establish the multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to resolve the problems. Moreover, based on the proposed SM, the technique for order of preference similar to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) is extended to strengthen the obtained outcomes. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is validated by considering a practical example. To support the outcomes obtained by using the proposed model, sensitivity analysis (SA) and time complexity (TC) analysis have been performed. A comprehensive comparison with other techniques is performed to validate the proposed MCDM model.},

The symmetry and periodicity about the origin are maintained by the sine trigonometry function and thus fulfill the ambitions of decision makers toward the selection of best options for decision making. This article exploits the tremendous characteristics of sine function under the prevalent model of FFS to establish some useful sine trigonometric operational laws. Furthermore, some novel aggregation operators including sine-trigonometric Fermatean fuzzy averaging and geometric operators based on sine trigonometric operational laws are proposed along with their noticeable properties. Another noticeable contribution of this article is the designing of a compact algorithm, embedding the decision-making caliber of the proposed operators, to aptly address the multi-attribute decision-making problems. Thereafter, two multi-criteria decision-making problems for the evaluation of internet finance soft power and selection of a perfect sportswear brand are presented to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed algorithm. A comparative study with Fermatean fuzzy TOPSIS method and existing aggregation operators is conducted to highlight the dominance, novelty and authenticity of the proposed operators.},

Finally, Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) was used to prioritize the identified success factors. The results indicate that “DevOps security pipeline,” “use system orchestration” and “attempt matrix organization and transparency” factors are the highest ranked success factors for the successful implementation of DevOps practices.

  abstract     = {Several practical problems incorporate uncertainty and erroneous information within its framework of definition. Many distinguished models have already been developed to manage such unreliability, like probabilistic models, and so forth. However, to revitalize the problems where uncertainty is not probabilistic, or the information is vaguely accessible, other tools like fuzzy logic and fuzzy linguistic-based approach have emerged. The efficacy of a linguistic-based approach pertains to a problem of decision making involving qualitative information where precise numerical modeling appears to be inappropriate. The 2-tuple linguistic model formalized by Herrera and Martínez in year 2000, has upgraded several linguistic processes for solving complex decision-making issues. Its successful application in different fields has impelled several researchers to work in its extension. This study aims to offer a systematic literature review on a 2-tuple linguistic model as well as discuss its extensions. The manuscript lays out a brief review of 188 articles published between 2000 and 2019. Based on the 188 selected articles, the following questions can be justified: (1) What is the fuzzy linguistic approach? (2) What is the linguistic model based on the 2-tuples and its foundation? (3) Why the 2-tuple model preferred over other existing classical linguistic models? (4) What are the extensions of the 2-tuple model? Moreover, (5) What are the major applications of a 2-tuple model witnessed in varied disciplines, specifically decision analysis? Therefore, seeking answers to these questions indicate current trends in research. Further, it provides the direction for scholars to work in this field and overcome the challenges associated with the prevailing 2-tuple model.},

  abstract     = {The control of spreading of COVID-19 in emergency situation the entire world is a challenge, and therefore, the aim of this study was to propose a spherical intelligent fuzzy decision model for control and diagnosis of COVID-19. The emergency event is known to have aspects of short time and data, harmfulness, and ambiguity, and policy makers are often rationally bounded under uncertainty and threat. There are some classic approaches for representing and explaining the complexity and vagueness of the information. The effective tool to describe and reduce the uncertainty in data information is fuzzy set and their extension. Therefore, we used fuzzy logic to develop fuzzy mathematical model for control of transmission and spreading of COVID19. The fuzzy control of early transmission and spreading of coronavirus by fuzzy mathematical model will be very effective. The proposed research work is on fuzzy mathematical model of intelligent decision systems under the spherical fuzzy information. In the proposed work, we will develop a newly and generalized technique for COVID19 based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) methods under spherical fuzzy environment. Finally, an illustrative the emergency situation of COVID-19 is given for demonstrating the effectiveness of the suggested method, along with a sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis, showing the feasibility and reliability of its results.},

  abstract     = {Neural network (NN) classifiers are very popular tools for solving classification tasks. Mostly known NN classifier is a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Although MLP has a good correct classification ratio, its structure could be very complex and network training may work for a long time. Pi-sigma NN (PSNN) is higher-order NN (HONN), which used higher-order correlations among the input components to establish a HONN, and the PSNN utilizes the product of neurons as the output units. By contrast with MLP and PSNN, single multiplicative neuron (SMN) is simple concerning its structure and mathematical model. The absence of the hidden layer(s) could be an advantage for easy implementation, and the mathematical model can be easily interpreted. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid NN classifier based on simple adaptive neurons and SMN which form the SMN as a whole, where input units are constituted by adaptive neurons. In contrast with conventional NN, our proposed classifier can use fewer learning parameters. To train this network, we use a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm. For the investigation of the generalization capability of the proposed classifier, we compare this method to other NN classifiers: MLP and PSNN together with other classification procedure classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy time series, based on type-1 fuzzy sets, continue to have a wide range of use in the literature. These methods use only membership values to determine the fuzzy relations. However, intuitionistic fuzzy time series models use both membership values and non-membership values. So it can be considered that the use of intuitionistic fuzzy time forecasting models will be able to increase the forecasting performance because the intuitionistic fuzzy sets have more information than fuzzy sets. Therefore, intuitionistic fuzzy time series models have started to employ for forecasting the real-life series in the fuzzy time series literature. A novel, explainable, robust high-order intuitionistic fuzzy time series forecasting method is proposed based on a newly defined model. In the proposed method, the intuitionistic fuzzy c-means algorithm is used for the fuzzification of observations, and a robust regression method employed for determining fuzzy relations. With the use of robust regression in determining the fuzzy relationships, all inputs of the proposed method can be explainable and they can be tested and commented on statistically. Applications of this study are made by using energy data of Primary Energy Consumption between the years 1965 and 2016 for 23 countries in the region of Europe-Eurasia. The forecasting performance of the proposed method is compared with the performance of some selected benchmarks, and the obtained results are discussed.},

The resident network (RN) based DNN model was applied to address these issues recently. This paper improved the RN and developed a rectified linear unit (ReLU) based conditional generative adversarial nets (cGAN) to classify plantar pressure images. A foot scan system collected the plantar pressure images, in which normal (N), planus (PL), and talipes equinovarus feet (TE) data-sets were acquired subsequently. The 9-foot types named N, PL, TE, N-PL, N-TE, PL-N, PL-TE, TE-N, and TE-PL were classified using the proposed DNN models, named resident network-based conditional generative adversarial nets (RNcGAN). It improved the RN structure firstly and the cGAN system hereafter. In the classification of plantar pressure images, the pixel-level state matrix can be direct as an input, different from the previous image classification task with image reduction and feature extraction. cGAN can directly output the pixels of the image without any simplification. Finally, the model achieved better results in the evaluation indicators of accuracy (AC), sensitivity (SE), and F1-measurement (F1) by comparing to artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Fast Region-based Convolution Neural Network (Fast R-CNN), visual geometry group (VGG16), scaled-conjugate-gradient convolution neural networks (SCG-CNN), GoogleNet, AlexNet, ResNet-50–177, and Inception-v3.

The discovery of semantic web services is an important concept for the comprehensiveness of individual web services in creating new intelligent systems that meet the complex needs of users and is an important technology in the domain of web services. One of its main goals is to reuse existing web services and combine them in a process that has attracted a lot of attention from different communities like the Internet of Things (IoT). Currently, the discovery of web services in the most common category includes four main methods and a set of sub-methods. Most semantic web service discovery methods are done using semantic descriptions of web services using ontology based on existing pattern recognition approaches. In this research, a new approach is presented that in the first step, the web services description language (WSDL) is scanned and the infrastructure is examined. In the second step, by adding the technique of extracting background information that can be received from the WSDL, the field limitations and existing patterns are considered and detected by semantic spacing on the discovering web services. Also, web services whose parameters contain synonymous synonyms, irregular composite fragments, and similar abbreviations with high accuracy in a cluster contract. The proposed approach is based on a semantic pattern recognition using data mining and finally, the output of the proposed method is single and combined services that have high accuracy and speed of the proposed algorithm in web service discussions.},

In addition to their hard work and rigorous and effective training, the skill of the athletes is a key factor for achieving good results. In this study, an artificial intelligence (AI) evaluation algorithm is developed to help rowing athletes excel in the sporting events. The AI algorithm uses the analytic hierarchy process to invite experts and scholars in the rowing field to answer a questionnaire. The technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution is then applied to calculate the ranking of selection indicators, to construct an evaluation model for rowing athletes. The key findings indicate that physicality (or the body structure) is the highest priority among the four main aspects of talent identification; this is followed, in descending order, by specialism, reaction, and psychological elements. The proposed AI strategy was established as the most beneficial decision model and can be used to identify talented rowers in the future.},

  abstract     = {Image dehazing has always been a challenging topic in image processing. The development of deep learning methods, especially the generative adversarial networks (GAN), provides a new way for image dehazing. In recent years, many deep learning methods based on GAN have been applied to image dehazing. However, GAN has two problems in image dehazing. Firstly, For haze image, haze not only reduces the quality of the image but also blurs the details of the image. For GAN network, it is difficult for the generator to restore the details of the whole image while removing the haze. Secondly, GAN model is defined as a minimax problem, which weakens the loss function. It is difficult to distinguish whether GAN is making progress in the training process. Therefore, we propose a guided generative adversarial dehazing network (GGADN). Different from other generation adversarial networks, GGADN adds a guided module on the generator. The guided module verifies the network of each layer of the generator. At the same time, the details of the map generated by each layer are strengthened. Network training is based on the pre-trained VGG feature model and L1-regularized gradient prior which is developed by new loss function parameters. From the dehazing results of synthetic images and real images, the proposed method is better than the state-of-the-art dehazing methods.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain technology has become more important in recent years in Internet of Things (IoT) manufacturing. Many IoT manufacturing factories have successively invested in the blockchain architecture in the system to manage the data of the IoT manufacturing system for intelligence prediction. The blockchain-based system architecture can ensure the process of data transmission and preservation. However, any node must hold complete blockchain information. When there are thousands of nodes, the cost of hard disk space for storing these data will increase drastically as the number of nodes increases. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposed a blockchain structure to reduce the space and network transmission costs. This architecture divides the traditional blockchain into two parts, which are divided into private blockchain and public blockchain according to the edge and the cloud. Each workshop will manage its own private blockchain, and the cloud will manage itself public blockchain. Under the proposed structure, each working node only needs to maintain the blockchain at its edge node and does not need to communicate with other edge node. The experimental results can effectively intelligence predict the space cost of node expansion, and it can also avoid the unnecessary network communication overhead caused by the traditional architecture. It can improve the space used of blockchain and reduce the network transfer time, and the cost of expanding nodes can be greatly reduced.},

  abstract     = {Today, emerging technologies such as 5G Internet of things (IoT), virtual reality and cloud-edge computing have enhanced and upgraded higher education environments in universities, colleagues and research centers. Computer-assisted learning systems with aggregating IoT applications and smart devices have improved the e-learning systems by enabling remote monitoring and screening of the behavioral aspects of teaching and education scores of students. On the other side, educational data mining has improved the higher education systems by predicting and analyzing the behavioral aspects of teaching and education scores of students. Due to an unexpected and huge increase in the number of patients during coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, all universities, campuses, schools, research centers, many scientific collaborations and meetings have closed and forced to initiate online teaching, e-learning and virtual meeting. Due to importance of behavioral aspects of teaching and education between lecturers and students, prediction of quality of experience (QoE) in virtual education systems is a critical issue. This paper presents a new prediction model to detect technical aspects of teaching and e-learning in virtual education systems using data mining. Association rules mining and supervised techniques are applied to detect efficient QoE factors on virtual education systems. The experimental results described that the suggested prediction model meets the proper accuracy, precision and recall factors for predicting the behavioral aspects of teaching and e-learning for students in virtual education systems.},

The crowd-sourcing has several ben- efits such as increased speed, flexibility and efficiency in terms of collecting and processing the data. One of the major demands in this crowdsourcing is to find the truthfulness of the obtained data and to ascertain trustworthiness of the sources. Several existing approaches are used for truth discovery among crowd-sourced-based applications. But they work efficiently only for structured data and the accuracy levels are dependent on the availability of ground truth values. To over- come the above-mentioned issues a novel truth discovery model is proposed. In this work it uses knowledge extraction and truth discovery phases to process the data. Reliability scores are assigned to trustworthy users based on the frequency with which they provide true values over a period of time. It works on both categorical and continues data. So, finally the proposed model is tested on three real-valued data sets. Experimental results prove to provide better performance than the conventional approaches.},

Sales plans, ECG forecasts, meteorological circumstances, and even COVID-19 spreading projections are among its uses. These implementations have inspired several scientists to develop an optimum forecasting method; however, the modeling method varies as the implementation domain evolves. Telemetry data prediction is an important component of networking and information center control software. As a generalization of such a fuzzy system, the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzified set was created, which has proven to become a highly valuable tool in dealing with indeterminacy (hesitation) as in-network. Indeterminacy is frequently overlooked in applying fuzzified time-series prediction for no obvious cause. We introduce the concept of intuitionistic fuzzified time series within a current study to deal with non-determinism with time-series prediction. Also, it seems to be an intuitionistic fuzzified time-series prediction framework. Using time-series information, the suggested intuitionistic fuzzified time-series predicting approach employs intuitionistic fuzzified logical relationships. The suggested method&#39;s effectiveness is tested using two-time sequence data sets. By contrasting the predicted result with some other intuitionistic timing series predicting techniques utilizing root-mean-square inaccuracy and averaged predicting errors, the usefulness of the suggested intuitionistic fuzzified time-series predicting approach is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious viral disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Different prediction techniques have been developed to predict the coronavirus disease’s existence in patients. However, the accurate prediction was not improved and time consumption was not minimized. In order to address these existing problems, a novel technique called Biserial Targeted Feature Projection-based Radial Kernel Regressive Deep Belief Neural Learning (BTFP-RKRDBNL) is introduced to perform accurate disease prediction with lesser time consumption. The BTFP-RKRDBNL techniques perform disease prediction with the help of different layers such as two visible layers namely input and layer and two hidden layers. Initially, the features and data are collected from the dataset and transmitted to the input layer. The Point Biserial Correlative Target feature projection is used to select relevant features and other irrelevant features are removed with minimizing the disease prediction time. Then the relevant features are sent to the hidden layer 2. Next, Radial Kernel Regression is applied to analyze the training features and testing disease features to identify the disease with higher accuracy and a lesser false positive rate. Experimental analysis is planned to measure the prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and prediction time for different numbers of patients. The result illustrates that the method increases the prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity by 10, 6, and 21\% and reduces the prediction time by 10\% as compared to state-of-the-art works.},

The storage and processing of medical data irrespective of the physical location of lab are explored in this research with Cloud computing. Extracting valid information from a medical image is of high importance in the medical arena. The information loss may lead to the misinterpretation of medical image analysis, which in turn can affect the treatment process to be prolonged or can be deviated from the real phase of examination. Evaluating the entropy from the medical images using the multi-level segmentation using the differential evolution technique on the fuzzy parameters applied on the chest X-ray images resulted in the extraction of the rib cages from the image, thus producing an image with the region of lung alone for the diagnostic purposes. The quality of the information obtained has been evaluated based upon the entropic value. The multi-level segmentation applied on the chest X-ray images using the differential evolution accelerated the optimum fuzzy parameters for the multi-level segmentation. The multi-level algorithmic approach with 4 threshold levels applied had resulted in four different thresholding, out of which the optimum threshold value has been chosen by the algorithm to provide the output. The results thus obtained, outperformed the conventional approach of Otsu segmentation and 3-level segmentation. The computational and storage power of cloud added strength to image data processing. The cloud computing facility by Matlab Cloud NVIDIA eased the processing rather than the conventional computing.},

This paper mainly studies and explores the compound fault diagnosis for the cooling dehumidifier. Firstly, the dehumidifier data acquisition system is built, which can be applied to the data acquisition, work status simulation and fault diagnosis. Secondly, a compound fault diagnosis model based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) improved by kernel principle component analysis (KPCA) and adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) is proposed. Aiming at the problems that the selection of RBF width depends on expert experience and knowledge, the network structure scale is large or the training speed is slow in the conventional RBFNN models; on the one hand, AGA and K-means clustering algorithm are employed to automatically optimize the RBF width, the number of hidden layer neurons and the neuron centers, which guarantees the model has small structure and fast running speed on the premise of sufficient output precision, and the local optimization problem of K-means clustering algorithm is well suppressed by AGA group calculation; this also ensures the performance of RBFNN; on the other hand, KPCA is employed to reduce the dimension of the model input data, which not only effectively extract the nonlinear features, but also further simplify the network structure. Finally, the proposed method is validated and compared with the conventional models. The results show that this proposed model can not only be effectively applied to the dehumidifier compound fault diagnosis, but also has prominent application advantages.},

  abstract     = {Self-e-learning platform of gesture recognition system (GRS) is failed to retrain maximum accuracy of gesture recognition via targeted special people observation. This occurs when there is a constant flow of action come gestures and similarity index gestures in the words. Some of the letters in Indian Sign Language (ISL) have similarity index gestures (like e, f, m, and n), while others use action come gestures (say h, j, y). Many new and updated gestures for the English alphabet have been introduced ISL recently, including the similarity index gesture and the action come gesture. In spite of this, GRS is unable to adjust to the continuous changes that occurred over the poses of gestures. Global Gestures Synchronous is required for better classification of similarity index gesture and action come gesture in special people e-learning education platform. In this work, we propose a hybrid pretrained 3D convolutional neural network (HP 3D-CNN) framework to distinguish between similarity index gestures and action come gestures with the help of a gradient-based machine learning (GML) classifier. This research investigates a Probability of Concurrent Gestures (PPCG) model for estimating the likelihood that two gestures will occur simultaneously based on their similarity index and the direction of action. We break down the difficult joint prediction problem into simpler marginal sub-prediction problems. Our GML model efficiently classifies both similarity index gesture and action come gesture in the joint prediction space in which the marginal prediction model and the conditional prediction model are processed. The results show that the proposed model successfully combines the characteristics of the interacting agents to increase the likelihood of making accurate predictions of their joint action. The acquired positive feature characteristic is then used to categorise gestures in an HP 3D-CNN framework. Finally, we use the industry standard ISL benchmark database to assess the performance of our proposed GML classifier. We have shown that our HP 3D-CNN framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on a variety of metrics, including Accuracy, F-measure, Recall, Precision, Dice, and Jaccard indexes.},

  abstract     = {In neighborhood rough set theory, attribute reduction based on measure of information has important application significance. The influence of different decision classes was not considered for calculation of traditional conditional neighborhood entropy, and the improvement of algorithm based on conditional neighborhood entropy mainly includes of introducing multi granularity and different levels, while the mutual influence between samples with different labels is less considered. To solve this problem, this paper uses the supervised strategy to improve the conditional neighborhood entropy of three-layer granulation. By using two different neighborhood radii to adjust the mutual influence degree of different label samples, and by considering the mutual influence between conditional attributes through the feature complementary relationship, a neighborhood rough set attribute reduction algorithm based on supervised granulation is proposed. Experiment results on UCI data sets show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the traditional conditional neighborhood entropy algorithm in both aspects of reduction rate and reduction accuracy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to the evaluation of fatigue life influencing factors of titanium alloy welded joints. The results of coupling relationship analysis show that the effect of joint type should be most seriously considered in the calculation of stress concentration factor. The results of influencing factors analysis show that the stress range has the highest weight among all the fatigue life influencing factors of titanium alloy welded joint.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a surrogate merit function (SMF) is proposed to be evaluated instead of the traditional merit functions (i.e., penalized weight of the structure). The standard format of the conventional merit functions needs several expensive trial-and-error tuning processes to enhance optimization convergence quality, retuning for different structural model configurations, and final manual local search in case optimization converges to infeasible vicinity of global optimum. However, on the other hand, SMF has no tunning factor but shows statistically stable performance for different models, converges directly to outstanding feasible points, and shows other superior advantages such as reduced required iterations to achieve convergence. In other words, this new function is a no-hassle one due to its brilliant user-friendly application and robust numerical results. SMF might be a revolutionary step in commercializing design optimization in the real-world construction market.},

  abstract     = {Fluctuations in the output power of photovoltaic (PV) under climate changes such as variations in temperature and radiation is an important challenge for these resources. Therefore, it is very important to keep the output power of solar systems constant without any fluctuation at their maximum power point in the event of climate change. The aim of this paper is to suggest a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method to cancel the output power oscillation of PV systems in severEe weather conditions, especially under radiation and temperature changes. In order to find the optimal parameters of the MPPT controller, the improved shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (ISFLA) and fuzzy controller are used. In addition, to fine-tune the member functions (MFs) of FLC, the combination of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and the ISFLA algorithm are employed. The ISFLA is an effective solution to cope with the stochastic behavior of the PV system under changing the radiation and ambient temperature. A storage system is also used to provide more stability and reliability for the system. Simulation results show that the recommended scheme provides excellent tracking efficiency from 98.1 to 99.6\%. The case study under partial shading conditions also confirms the 16\% improvement in the efficiency of the proposed method and more stability compared to the conventional P&amp;O MPPT controller.},

  abstract     = {Decision making is a universal behavior based on human cognitive information. In the real world, information related to human cognition is characterized by uncertainty and partial reliability, which is challenging to express with traditional and precise concepts. To better describe this type of uncertain information, Z-number is introduced by Zadeh, which contains uncertain information with both probability and fuzziness. Recently, Yager proposed the fusion of multiple multi-criteria aggregate functions, especially the fusion of multiple OWA-type aggregate functions, to deal with the group decision problem. However, such aggregation functions exhibit limitations in facing the uncertainty of expert information in real-world decision-making scenarios. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper extends Yager’s aggregation method to the Z-number field and further propose a new group decision-making method based on the OWA aggregation operator and Z-number. The maximum entropy optimization model based on a genetic algorithm is used to determine the hidden probability distribution in Z-numbers to aggregate the Z-numbers, which solves the problem of information loss caused by ignoring the hidden probability distribution in the existing Z-number aggregation methods, and greatly preserves the original meaning of Z-number. Some numerical examples are used to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, a comparative analysis with existing methods expounds on the superiority of the proposed method.},

This paper further studies fuzzy similarity and equivalence relations using fuzzy graphs, and obtains some new results. The defects of transitive closure method are analyzed, and an improved clustering algorithm is given, but it cannot eliminate the inconsistency phenomenon in classification hierarchy structure. To solve this problem, the optimal fuzzy equivalence relation of similarity relation is studied. An optimization model which can derive it exactly is given, but it is too complex for applications. An effective approximation algorithm to get the optimal equivalence relation is thus presented. Several examples and some discussions are also given to illustrate the given methods.},

  abstract     = {In this work, our target point is to focus on rough approximation operators generated from infra-topology spaces and examine their features. First, we show how infra-topology spaces are constructed from $$N_j$$ -neighborhood systems under an arbitrary relation. Then, we exploit these infra-topology spaces to form new rough set models and scrutinize their master characterizations. The main advantages of these models are to preserve all properties of Pawlak approximation operators and produce accuracy values higher than those given in several methods published in the literature. One of the unique characterizations of the current approach is that all the approximation operators and accuracy measures produced by the current approach are identical under a symmetric relation. Finally, we present two medical applications of the current methods regarding Dengue fever and COVID-19 pandemic. Some debates regarding the pros and cons of the followed technique are given as well as some upcoming work are proposed.},

Firstly, we introduce $${\mathcal {E}}_j$$ -neighborhoods and $${\mathcal {C}}_j$$ -neighborhoods which depend on vertices and edges of a simple directed graph by using j-neighborhoods for $$j\in {\text {out}, \text {in}, \cap , \cup }$$ . Then, we apply these neighborhoods to present the concepts of $${\mathcal {E}}_j$$ -approximations and $${\mathcal {C}}_j$$ -approximations. We investigate their main properties and relationships among them. Besides, we define the accuracy measures of a subgraph with the help of these approximations and show that $${\mathcal {C}}_j$$ -accuracy measures are the highest when we compare these accuracy measures with the previous one. Furthermore, we generate new nano topologies via obtained approximations and illustrate that these topologies may not be comparable. Finally, we give an application in physics to elucidate the current approximations are more general. Throughout the paper, we summarize all comparisons with tables and give counterexamples to support the study.},

  abstract     = {Because of the complexity of data sets from the real world, it is difficult to classify the data sets clearly and effectively, thus we prefer to adopt fuzzy clustering approaches to analyze the data sets. However, due to the variety of fuzzy clustering algorithms, the different number of clusters will lead to different clustering results. The number of clusters is closely related to the clustering division, so how to determine the number of fuzzy clustering (k ) has become a problem. Until now, many researchers have proposed utilizing fuzzy clustering validity indexes to deal with this kind of problem. However, the effectiveness index of fuzzy clustering can only be evaluated on the basis of the fuzzy clustering algorithm FCM to divide the clusters. When the range of k value is too large, FCM’s clustering for different k values is quite time-consuming. From this perspective, this paper proposes a fuzzy clustering optimal k selection method based on multi-objective optimization (FMOEA-K). Different from the traditional methods, this method combines the fuzzy clustering effectiveness index with multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOEA), and uses multi-objective optimization algorithm to search the appropriate cluster center concurrently. Because of the concurrency of the multi-objective optimization algorithm, the calculation time is shortened. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional method, the FMOEA-K can shorten the calculation time and improve the accuracy of calculating the optimal k value.},

To predict the sudden change in online group opinion, the evolution of online group opinion is considered as a complex system. The resilience index, which measures the accumulated pressure of this complex system, is developed as an indicator to predict the sudden change in group opinion. The employees’ opinion of Dada, a crowdsourcing logistics platform in China, is taken as an example. Text data of group opinion are treated. The methods of fitting the catastrophe model and building the resilience index model for group opinion of Dada forum are demonstrated. Verification is performed. The method of searching thresholds of the resilience index is designed, and two thresholds are obtained. The factors that influence the thresholds are investigated. The proposed resilience index and its modeling method have contributions to researches on online group opinion as well as complex systems, and have practical implications for business enterprises in face of customer group opinion in marketing and governments confronted with public group opinion.},

This equation is useful in the study of mechanical wave propagation in viscoelastic media, transport in amorphous semiconductors, and non-Markovian diffusion processes with memory. The collocation approach uses the spline basis function for space integration and a weighted finite difference strategy for temporal domain integration. The technique’s stability is examined using the von Neumann scheme, and it is determined to be unconditionally stable. The suggested approach is determined to be fourth-order convergent in space for a specific choice of parameters and $$(2-\beta )$$ order convergent in time. We provide some numerical examples to support our theoretical approach. The numerical order of convergence matches the theoretical order completely. The $$L_{2}$$ errors are computed, and the results are compared to earlier works.},

Based on NPDCML system, a new image encryption scheme is proposed, which adopts the method of diffusion before confusion. After a round of diffusion, the image is scrambled by decomposing the bit plane, and the image is further encrypted by the way of mutual diffusion of high bit plane and low bit plane. Through the analysis of various test results, the encryption scheme can resist most common attacks, and it is proved that NPDCML system has good chaotic characteristics and cryptographic advantages.},

  abstract     = {The sensor nodes are devices with extra capabilities of sensing, communicating and processing of the recorded data. The sensor-based wireless and IoT-enabled networks can contribute a precarious part of army command, defense control, defense communications, computerized based intelligence and surveillance, and above all the targeting systems. Examples of defense applications include monitoring of own army forces and enemy forces; monitoring of ammunition, monitoring of equipment, targeting at certain regions; and nuclear as well as biotechnology-based attack detection. With the advent of AI and latest technologies, a technical paradigm shift can be seen in monitoring the faults in sensor nodes that are capable to collect the data and entire decisions are inferred on the basis of this data. By deploying sensors in critical areas, all the movements can be followed in detail. Hence, instant fault location measurement of sensor nodes with the least complex approaches is the need of the hour. Therefore, a novel soft computing-based approach is proposed in this paper for measuring the fault in locations of sensor-based networks using fuzzy logic and neural networks with high accuracy. The proposed technique allows lower consumption of energy while locating the faults. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed fault location scheme with respect to the network node loss, measurement error, and measurement time taken for detecting faults in locations of sensor nodes. The proposed fuzzy and neural network-based method outperforms the existing benchmarked techniques considered for comparative study.},

  abstract     = {Managing multiple symmetric keys is a critical issue when symmetric cryptography is adopted to protect the confidentiality of the outsourced data in cloud storage. Hierarchical key management utilizing key derivation is a widely studied mechanism. In this mechanism, a large number of keys can be derived from a handful of keys and organized by a hierarchical structure. However, the distribution of multiple derived keys was rarely discussed in the literature. How to minimize the traffic cost of key distribution, especially in the dynamic scenario, is still an open issue. In this paper, we study how to (i) construct a binary key-derivation tree to support in-situ updates, (ii) minimize the traffic cost of distributing derived keys in both static and dynamic cases via the minimal key set. A new key node structure is designed to keep the node positions unchanged during the update process and simplify the generation of the minimal key set. Based on the design, we develop a basic generation algorithm which is the basis of our final algorithm. In addition, the key distribution and re-derivation processes are also expounded as the essential parts of the complete scheme. We also evaluate the performance overheads by extensive experiments and analyze the reduced traffic cost theoretically. The results show the proposed algorithm is efficient and practical in cloud storage systems.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous wireless sensor network (HWSN) is one of the promising wireless technologies which play an effective role in the remote areas monitoring applications like military surveillance, disaster relief operations, seismic activity monitoring, earthquake detection, etc. In such applications, the network energy consumption is the most prominent issue in sensor network due to its large overhead, uneven load balancing, and poor communication among the nodes. Thus, there is a necessity to develop energy efficient techniques that balance the communication load and overheads among the sensor nodes and make sensor networks energy efficient. The clustering is the most significant way to make network energy efficient and maximize the lifespan of the networks which divides the sensor nodes into groups proficiently. It performs a commanding role in the effectual use of energy dissipation for its batteries which directly affect the network lifespan. In this work, we propose an energy efficient cluster head (CH) selection technique for prolonging lifespan in HWSNs. In this methodology, a weighted threshold-based probabilities formula is proposed which considers the different types of energies of the networks and node density within sensing range for the most effective election of the cluster heads. The proposed threshold formula consists of different parameters, namely the current energy of the networks, node’s initial and residual energy, and node density within the sensing range area of the nodes which helps in electing the cluster heads proficiently. This method contributes a dynamic clustering method to decreasing energy consumption and avoids the load over the cluster heads. The overall performance of the projected protocol investigated within the MATLAB deliberates the simulation specification, namely throughput, alive–dead nodes energy utilization. Thus, the final results after the simulation of the suggested protocol beat the other hugest existing protocols; further, the performance of the proposed methodology is 115.40\% higher in the network lifetime with admiration to SEP protocol.},

The image-based 3D face reconstruction method is the mainstream technology of 3D face reconstruction. This paper uses the 3D face reconstruction algorithm to analyze the 3D reconstruction of a static image face and the structure and realization of the computer standardized management system. In the process of high-resolution two-channel matching, combined with multilevel reconstruction technology, a better initial disparity map is obtained by comparison. Then, the improved disparity map optimization algorithm is used to optimize the initial value, so that the result of the cloud point is smoother on the model surface while maintaining good detail accuracy. The AdaBoost face detection algorithm based on embedded images is used to obtain the image representing the region, and grayscale conversion and normalization processing are performed. Finally, the Poisson surface reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct a 3D high-precision face model. The experimental results in this paper show that the AdaBoost face detection algorithm can effectively separate and express face features, reduce the feature dimensions to compactly represent the data and correctly classify expressions. The 3D face reconstruction technology based on static images can increase the recognition rate of a face by 24\% and can also increase the texture mapping effect of the local area of the face by 13\%.},

  abstract     = {Generally, defence applications need the high secured communication over the channel. Most of the defence-based communications are performed through the audio and speech signals in the secured environment. To provide security to these digital media and speech signals, considerably advanced technologies are implementing in the last two decades. However, digital media transmission over the secured and unsecured channels creating several big problems in defence data transfer applications due to equivalence of works, plasticity, ease of replication and unauthorized use in the digital format of data. The possible solution is to secure digital media by cover writing the speech signals by using speech steganography, so the digital media effectively hid over the speech. To overcome these problems, this article is mainly focussing on securing the speech and message through the hybrid speech steganography approach. This system is implemented with the spread spectrum-based redundant discrete wavelet transform (SS-RDWT) with additional pause removal properties. The input cover speech signal contains a larger size, and system requires the higher power usage, computational time and extra storage capacity. Thus, an intelligent pause detection protocol (IPDP) is implemented to remove the pauses and reduces the size of the speech signal. The performance of the IPDP protocol is improved by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure. Finally, SS-RDWT speech steganography is implemented along with the IPDP-MLE-based pause removal mechanism. The simulation results show that the proposed method gives better performance against various noise attacks and improved the robustness, imperceptibility and security as compared to the conventional approaches.},

Due to high demand of satellite images in many application areas, searching and classification of relevant images is very much crucial. Content-based satellite image retrieval (CBSIR) extracts similar satellite images from its related query image. Most of the traditional approaches are not efficient for providing better retrieval performance as per the nature of images. The retrieval accuracy of the system mainly depends on proper weight assignment to the multiple low-level image features. Assignment of weights for image features is also a tricky and complex task. In this study, an attempt has been made to develop an automated method for automatic weight assignment to the image features. For this a pair-wise has been done between image features which lead to a new approach for automatic weight assignment. The novelty of the proposed approach is the suitable and automatic weight assignment to the features as per the nature of satellite image. The proposed approach is implemented with the help of a famous analytical hierarchical process. Total 21 classes of satellite images are taken from UC Merced Land use dataset. The performance of the proposed approach has been tested through precision and recall of CBSIR system. Significant improvement in precision and recall values has been achieved through the proposed approach. This system will also be very useful in army and military applications because the used dataset also includes image classes such as airplane, forest, residential areas and harbor and run way.},

This paper proposes the embedded auto-encoder network model; specifically, the auto-encoder is embedded into the encoder unit and the decoder unit of the prototype auto-encoder, respectively. To ensure effectively cluster high-dimensional objects, the encoder of model first encodes the raw features of the input objects, and obtains a cluster-friendly feature representation. Then, in the model training stage, by adding smoothness constraints to the objective function of the encoder, the representation capabilities of the hidden layer coding are significantly improved. Finally, the adaptive self-paced learning threshold is determined according to the median distance between the object and its corresponding the centroid, and the fine-tuning sample of the model is automatically selected.

The concept behind automatic target detection in war is military object recognition from the captured images. For object recognition in the given image, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are used efficiently. However, CNN suffers from a problem of location invariant and their performance depends mainly on the size of the training set. Generally, the available training data will be in less proportion for military objects due to its operational and security issues. Due to these two issues of CNN, the performance of CNN may degrade abruptly. To address military object recognition, a relatively new neural network architecture based on capsule network (CapsNet) is introduced in this paper. A variant of CapsNet called the multi-level CapsNet framework is projecting in this paper for efficient military object recognition under the case of a small training dataset. The validation of the introduced framework is done on a dataset of military objects collected from the Internet. The dataset contains particularly five different military objects and similar civil ones. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can accomplish a high recognition precision, superior to many other algorithms such as conventional support vector machines and transfer learning-based CNNs.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging virtualization technology, the Linux container provides a more lightweight, flexible, and high-performance operating-system-level virtual run-time environment. Its appearance has profoundly changed the development and deployment of multi-tier distributed applications. However, the imperfect system resource isolation features and the kernel-sharing mechanism will introduce significant security risks to the cloud platform. In this paper, we present DockerWatch, a real-time detection system for malware detection in the container-based cloud platform. DockerWatch uses a non-intrusive manner to extract executable files inside the containers, then uses the ensemble of various static features and behavior-based graphs as the analysis vector to learn the robust representations of malicious patterns. Consequently, a two-phase hybrid detection method based on deep learning is proposed to accelerate and enhance the detection performance, aiming to address the trade-off between fast and high-performance real-time detection. Extensive experiments are conducted and compared with extensive existing related methods using real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our system. The results show that DockerWatch achieves excellent detection performance with acceptable run-time performance overhead introduced into the platform.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud representation is a challenge to extracting sufficient semantic information while ensuring that the sparsely point cloud spatial structure is complete. Benefiting from the Transformer network, recent studies have promoted the development of point cloud representation by extracting refined attention features based on global context. However, there is still undesired semantic information loss in the feature extraction stage. Hence, this paper proposes a novel architecture for 3D point cloud representation, namely Relation-Shape Transformer Network (RS-TNet), to address above problem while maintaining the merits of relation-shape embedding mechanism so as to generate rich and robust local semantic features. Specifically, RS-TNet can achieve coarse-to-fine grained semantic information coverage by integrating the global multi-head self-attention and local Relation-Feature extraction module simultaneously. Moreover, theoretical analysis demonstrates that RS-TNet can explicitly introduce the spatial relation of points by learning underlying shapes. In this way, extracted features are of more shape awareness and robustness. As a result, the proposed RS-TNet achieves 90.9\% class accuracy and 85.6\% Intersection-over-Union on ModelNet40 and ShapeNet datasets, respectively. Further, ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our RS-TNet in point cloud classification and part segmentation tasks.},

  abstract     = {With the fast advancement of computer technology, the communication industries have used innovative approaches broadly to improve transmission media and facilitate communication. A transmission medium, often known as a line, is a path that allows data to be transmitted between the sender and recipient. Data are transferred using electromagnetic impulses. Between the sender and the destination, there is a wire-based linkage for the transfer of data. The transmission medium&#39;s primary function is to transport bits of data over a network. Transmission line technology has advanced quickly to facilitate easier communication between sender and recipient. Transmission lines are upgraded and communication is improved using upgraded cables like optical fiber and coaxial cable. Communication is still absolutely necessary even when there is heavy jamming and poor propagation, especially when there are interruptions brought on by fabricated nuclear disasters. For component detection in transmission media/lines, various techniques are employed. In the study that is being reported, we used two MCDM-based techniques for decision-making: The technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Criteria Importance Through Inter Criteria Correlation (CRITIC). Here, in order to improve our decision-making, we choose seven criteria and eight choices. Each criterion is given a weight using the CRITIC approach, and the TOPSIS technique is used to select the best method out of those that are accessible. The choice with the best value is placed at the top, while the choice with the worst value is placed at the bottom. The results of the study that was provided indicate that the best strategy was chosen among the available options, and this study can be used as a recommendation for future planning and decision-making.},

To solve the scheduling problem of a smart building, we propose bacterial foraging ant colony optimization (HB-ACO). The primary objective of scheduling is to shift load from on-peak hours to off-peak hours to reduce electricity cost and peak-to-average ratio. A comparison of these algorithms is also presented in terms of performance parameters, electricity cost, reduction of PAR, and user comfort in terms of waiting time. The proposed techniques are evaluated using two pricing schemes: (1) time of use and (2) critical peak pricing. Moreover, coordination among home appliances is presented for real-time scheduling. We represent this as a knapsack problem and solve it through ant colony optimization algorithm. The HB-ACO shows better performance than ACO and BFA in reducing electricity cost, PAR, and increased user comfort, which is evident from the simulation results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an efficient and highly accurate method for data stream classification, called discriminative associative classification. We define class discriminative association rules (CDARs) as the class association rules (CARs) in one data stream that have higher support compared with the same rules in the rest of the data streams. Compared to associative classification mining in a single data stream, there are additional challenges in the discriminative associative classification mining in multiple data streams, as the Apriori property of the subset is not applicable. The proposed single-pass H-DAC algorithm is designed based on distinguishing features of the rules to improve classification accuracy and efficiency. Continuously arriving transactions are inserted at fast speed and large volume, and CDARs are discovered in the tilted-time window model. The data structures are dynamically adjusted in offline time intervals to reflect each rule supported in different periods. Empirical analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed method in the large fast speed data streams. Good efficiency is achieved for batch processing of small and large datasets, plus 0–2\% improvements in classification accuracy using the tilted-time window model (i.e., almost with zero overhead). These improvements are seen only for the first 32 incoming batches in the scale of our experiments and we expect better results as the data streams grow.},

  abstract     = {A real-time and accurate storm surge prediction model is of great scientific value and practical significance in reducing human casualties and economic losses in coastal areas. For this purpose, a novel storm surge multi-step forecasting framework integrating time-varying filtered empirical modal decomposition (TVF-EMD), fast Fourier transform (FFT), phase space reconstruction, convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) is proposed in this study. Among the supplementary strategies, the TVF-EMD is used to extract the fluctuation features of the storm surge data and decompose the storm surge time series into a number of IMFs; the FFT is employed to calculate the frequency values of each IMF, and the subsequences with similar frequency values are combined and reconstructed. Meanwhile, CNN is adopted to predict the preprocessed high-frequency components, while the low-frequency is predicted by LSTM. Subsequently, the ultimate prediction results of the raw storm surge are calculated by superimposing the predicted values of all components. Three datasets collected from southeastern coastal region of China and five relevant comparison models are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach, where the corresponding results demonstrate that: (1) data preprocessing strategy applying TVF-EMD and FFT can significantly improve forecasting performance; (2) the TVF-EMD decomposition method is more effective under the influence of low sampling rate and noise; (3) by observing the characteristics of the subsequence, the prediction by modules can achieve better results. In addition, in order to apply the model to engineering, the proposed model is transferred to the small data domain as a pre-trained model using a transfer learning approach. According to the prediction results of Wenzhou station in the 7821-storm surge event, it can be found the proposed model still has good robustness and generalization ability even though the new sample data is small. This also proves that the model has strong practical value in coastal storm surge warning as well as disaster prevention and mitigation. Overall, the storm surge prediction framework proposed in this study has higher prediction accuracy and transferability, and can provide scientific and reasonable theoretical guidance for the emergency management to develop disaster prevention strategies.},

The integration of deep learning technology with image watermarking is currently reshaping the application and promotion of relevant techniques developed so far. This paper presents a novel type of blind color image watermarking method that embeds a downsized color image into a host color image. Watermarking implementation involves partitioning the host image into non-overlapping blocks of 8 × 8 pixels, performing discrete cosine transform (DCT) for each block of every channel, and then manipulating the magnitudes of three designated DCT coefficients subject to a minimization constraint. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed image watermarking method outperformed six other methods in terms of zero-normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC). Moreover, watermark imperceptibility, as reflected by the measured peak signal-to-noise ratio and mean structural similarity metrics, remained satisfactory. In addition to this new style of color image watermarking, we employed a deep residual network to reduce noise and increase the resolution of the retrieved watermarks. Overall, the residual network achieved a satisfactory ZNCC level (&gt; 0.88) when the watermark images were super-resolved by a factor of sixteen.},

  abstract     = {Dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) is an effective knowledge acquisition tool for ordered data, and to meet the needs of practical applications, the DRSA-based extended models have been widely studied. Nevertheless, the collected data in practical applications are always polluted by noise and most of these extended models are very susceptible to noise. In addition, with the arrival of new attributes and the removal of obsolete attributes, the ordered data have the characteristic of attributes evolving over time (i.e., dynamic ordered data). How to efficiently mining knowledge from dynamic ordered data is a meaningful topic. Motivated by these two issues, we first propose a robust fuzzy dominance rough set model to combat noise interference and then develop incremental update approximation mechanisms based on the proposed model for dynamic ordered data. Firstly, the vaguely quantified fuzzy dominance rough set (VQFDRS) and its matrix representation are introduced. Subsequently, we develop the incremental mechanisms to update the approximations of VQFDRS when multiple attributes are added to or deleted from an ordered data, respectively. Then, on this basis, a static calculation approximations algorithm and two incremental calculation approximations algorithms are designed, respectively. Finally, a series of numerical comparative experiments are performed on six public datasets. Experimental results indicate that the VQFDRS has good robustness, and the incremental algorithms are highly efficient compared with static algorithm under the dynamic data environment.},

Essentially, the proposed strategies control the contribution of different fuzzy rules so that the proposed model can well model the dynamic behavior of time series. Fuzzy C-Means clustering technique is an alternative way to construct fuzzy rules. Particle swarm optimization serves as a tool to optimize the parameters of the model (e.g., transition matrix and emission matrix). We construct and investigate the performance of the HMM-based fuzzy model by using a series of synthetic and publicly available multivariate time series. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model shows better performance than the fuzzy rule-based models used without the involvement of HMMs.},

  abstract     = {Game theory has found significant applications in a wide range of fields to deal with competitive environments between individuals or organizations. The researchers investigated several augmentations of ordinary game theory to deal with uncertainty and ambiguity in payoffs and goals. However, the quantifiable parts of the problems have been studied in matrix games with payoffs expressed by interval numbers, fuzzy numbers, and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In several situations, qualitative information is critical in describing the payoffs of a game problem. Experts frequently prefer expressing their perspective in natural linguistic terms rather than numerical values in real-life decision-making challenges. This linguistic representation has been utilized to resolve plenty of decision-making problems. This paper explores the theory of matrix games under a qualitative information environment. We use linguistic interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (LIVIFNs) to describe the payoff values as suggested by experts. The LIVIFNs are more efficient tools that provide experts with a flexible information modeling capability to describe their ambiguous and uncertain perceptions in the form of linguistic terms. The solution of this class of matrix games is attained by resolving a duo of linear or nonlinear programming problems originating through nonlinear bi-objective programming problems. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the suggested approach.},

  abstract     = {Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) based on interval intuitionistic fuzzy value (IVIFV) is a process of aggregating decision criteria represented by multiple interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to select the optimal alternative. Among them, an aggregation operator is an indispensable tool, and the properties of an aggregation operator directly affect the decision results. Existing aggregation operators based on IVIFV have satisfactory results in eliminating the correlation between criteria and removing the influence of outliers on the results. However, there are some unreasonable results due to some undesired properties of IVIFVs. In this paper, IVIFV operation under the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) framework is applied to combine the power average and Muirhead mean operators and interval intuitionistic fuzzy power Muirhead mean operators under DST framework are presented. Then a method based on the presented operators for MCDM problems is proposed. Finally, a set of numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method not only retains the robustness of the power average operator and the capability of the Muirhead mean operator, but also eliminates a shortcoming that existing interval intuitionistic fuzzy operators cannot handle the case where the weights are in IVIFVs.},

  abstract     = {By incorporating three-way decision model into formal concept analysis (FCA) methodology, an emerging novel data analysis methodology, termed three-way concept analysis (3WCA), has been widely used in both computer science and social science areas. However, the construction of three-way concept lattice is quite time-consuming and proved as an NP-complete problem. Thus, it makes the knowledge discovery from three-way concept lattice difficult. To facilitate the knowledge acquisition in three-way concept lattice, both attribute reduction and three-way concept stability are utilized for pruning the size of three-way concept lattice and extracting informative three-way concepts. Aiming to extract hidden knowledge efficiently, this paper first attempts to figure out the relations of three-way concept stability in the original three-way concept lattice and reduced three-way concept lattice. We then propose a theorem on the invariance of three-way concept stability for attribute reduction of three-way concept lattice. To validate the correctness of our finding, we also conducted an empirical case study.},

The AOA is designed according to physical principles and has been the object of many scholars’ research because of its simple and reliable performance. In the course of the study, this paper finds that the AOA is flawed. In the iterative update of the algorithm, the buoyancy principle applied to the object is not completely followed. Through the investigation and analysis of this problem, it is found that the algorithm design which follows the buoyancy principle completely is more advantageously and persuasively, and named the corrected algorithm CAOA. The performance of the CAOA and other comparison optimization algorithms is tested in benchmark functions CEC2017 under equal conditions to verify the ideas proposed in this paper. In the solution accuracy with dimensions of 30 and 50, the comprehensive score of the CAOA is 31 and 33 and ranks first in all algorithms. In the statistical analysis, the CAOA compared with other algorithms one by one, and achieved the best results in all test functions. When compared with other algorithms, the CAOA ranked first. It is hoped that the verification of the ideas in this paper will help the AOA to develop better and optimize the development of the algorithm.},

Numerical and new semi-analytical methods have been employed to solve the problem to define the exactness of the results. The influence of physical parameters governing the problem is investigated and illustrated in detail in the diagram. Results show that velocity profile and micro-rotation velocity increased when the magnetic parameter increased. Furthermore, the velocity is increased by increasing the rotation parameter. Also, in the case of the temperature profile, the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers have an inverse effect, and Prandtl number and Brownian motion have a direct effect. Other results indicate that concentration value declines by increasing the thermophoretic parameter and Reynolds number. Results compared to the prior research display good accuracy and efficiency. The study demonstrates that the method provides quantifiable reliable outcomes while requiring less computing work than conventional techniques. This method offers significant advantages in terms of simplicity, applicability, computational efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Evaluating the negation of an uncertain event is an open issue. Yager (IEEE Trans Fuzzy Syst 23:1899–1902, 2004) suggested a transformation for evaluating the negation of a probability distribution. He used the idea that any event whose outcome is not certain can be negated by supporting the occurrence of other events with no bias or prejudice for any particular outcome. Various authors have tried to generalize the negation transformation proposed by Yager (IEEE Trans Fuzzy Syst 23:1899–1902, 2004). However, we need to focus on developing the basic structure of negation so that the behaviour of the process modelled by negation transformation can be understood in detail. Yager’s negation is based on distribution of maximum entropy. If a probability distribution is uncertain(a state other than maximum entropy), the more the iterations of negation, the more uncertain this probability event becomes, eventually converging to a homogeneous state, i.e. maximum entropy. In other words, it is the realization of the process. What is noted that during each negation, Yager’s method ensures that the negation is intuitive; the next negation weakens the probability of the event occurring in the previous step. Since negation involves reallocation of probabilities at each step in such a way that the reallocation at each step can be determined from the reallocation at the previous step, it is clear that Yager’s negation has various attributes similar to that of a Markov chain. In the present work, we have shown that Yager’s definition of negation can be modelled as a Markov chain which is irreducible, aperiodic with no absorbing states. Two examples have been discussed to strengthen and support the analytical results. Also, we have defined an information generating function (IGF) whose derivative evaluated at specific points gives the moments of the self-information of negation of a probability distribution. The properties of the generating function along with its relationship with the information generating function proposed by S. Golomb (IEEE Trans Inf Theory 12:75–77, 1966) have been explored. A closer look at the properties of IGF confirms the existence of Markovian structure of Yager’s negation.},

Although the normal cloud model can depict the fuzziness and randomness of the index, it ignores the changing tendency in ranking. It requires the index subjecting a normal distribution that may not match the actual state of the indicator distribution. A novel evaluation model based on the connection cloud and game theory was presented to address multiple uncertainties. In this model, the stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties of evaluation indexes distributed in the finite intervals are first simulated for the interval-valued evaluation standard by the connection cloud model. Then, the combined weight is assigned based on the game theory considering the harmony between the conflicting subjective and objective weights. The aggregated value of the connection degrees is further specified to describe the certainty-uncertainty relationship between the sample and evaluation standard of each rating level and the conversion tendency of the evaluation from a unified view dialectically. Furthermore, a case study on the pavement performance evaluation and comparisons with other models confirmed the feasibility and validity of the proposed model. The results show that the evaluation model presented here can effectively depict actual distribution characteristics and multiple uncertainties of indexes and thoroughly explore the inherent information importance.},

  abstract     = {The growth of information technology has opened the gate for the organizations to maintain their data in various forms and at various volumes. This increases the volume and dimension of data being maintained. However, they store their data in their data servers or in cloud environment. Such data have been used to generate various intelligence to support various problems. To support such analysis process, different data have been used and the big data comes to play in this part. Optimizing techniques to help improve the process of ETL could greatly help in real-time analysis of data. ETL optimization could be achieved through several factors simplest being increasing the frequency of the process. Other ways to achieve optimization are through the use of various architectures, programming models, intelligence in transformation and security. To improve the performance of ETL, an efficient dynamic multi-variant relational intelligent ETL framework has been presented in this article. The distributed approach maintains various ontology’s and data dictionaries which have been dynamically updated by different threads of ETL process. Initially, the process is start by applying the extraction process which extracts the data from different sources and finds set of dimensions and their characteristics. Such data extracted have been verified over the data dictionary. Further, the relational score has been measured for each data source with the existing one. Similarly, the method computes the value of multi-variant relational similarity (MVRS) for the data obtained from a single source. This will be performed by different threads of ETL process. According to the value of MVRS, the method performs map reduce and merging of data. According to the value of MVRS the method selects the data node and merges the data to store in the data warehouse. The threads of ETL are capable of reading the changes in data dictionaries and ontology’s to iterate the process of transformation and loading. The method improves the performance of ETL with least time complexity and higher performance.},

  abstract     = {Awareness and attention of drivers while driving show a vital role in decreasing the number of collisions. In the modern decades, in-car entertainment is a major cause of degradation of drivers&#39; performance and losing consciousness. However, there are other factors such as drowsiness and tiredness that have an important part as well. Earlier detection of this degradation in behavior can be used to provide suggestions to the driver while driving. The main motive behind the work is to mitigate the effects of manually labeling the data which costs lot of time and also would result in inaccurate labels. The proposed work has 2 parts: Feature reconstruction and Stacking for classification. The Feature reconstruction phase involves clustering of data from different sensors and labeling the style of driving. Then ensemble-based Stacking classifiers which are optimized with artificial bee colony algorithm is adopted for the driving style classification. The performance analysis is done by applying the stacking classifier to data from OBD. The Stacking classifier is able to achieve an accuracy of above 98\% irrespective of the classical learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer is defined as unregulated cell proliferation due to irreversible DNA damage. Melanoma is one kind of skin cancer generated by melanocytes, which could result in serious health issues. Early detection of this skin cancer based on image processing assist therapists in its treatment. Computational pathology has the unique capability of spatially dissecting specific interfaces on digitized histology images. The main objective of this research is to classify skin cancer using a deep learning model. This work proposes a hybrid context-aware convolutional neural network with recurrent neural network (CA-CNN-RNN) based on skin cancer histology images. This model encodes the local representation of the histological images into high-dimensional features and hence aggregates the features by considering their spatial configuration for performing final classification. The dataset for this work is made up of H&amp;E-stained images from the database of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Using the hybrid CA-CNN-RNN model, the experiment on histological image of melanoma disease was performed and validated with several classification models like DarkNet-53, VGG-19, ResNet50, and Inception. The data set is utilized to evaluate the model in order to provide results, which are analyzed using parameters like as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The experimental analysis reveals that the CA-CNN-RNN performed better with the DarkNet-53 model. The proposed model achieved 97.14 accuracy, 96.49 precision, 98.21 recall, and 96.50 f-score.},

  abstract     = {Cloud technology provides services for storing and accessing a large amount of data with ease of access and less cost. Sensitive data such as patients&#39; electronic health information should be encrypted before outsourcing into the cloud. Many traditional encryption methods are used for protecting data in the cloud, but unable to perform computation on encrypted data. Homomorphic encryption operates directly on the ciphertext. In this study, a Secure Partially Homomorphic Encryption (SPHE) algorithm is proposed to secure the outsourced data and perform multiplication and division operations on the ciphertext. The access control policy in the cloud environment is more flexible. An attacker can easily collect sensitive data by abusing the access policy of another user. Therefore, the database privacy is compromised. Creating a role hierarchy and managing the session is difficult in the cloud environment. The above issues motivate us to develop a model which is the integration of the proposed scheme SPHE with role-based user policy. The model is implemented in Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and AWS (Amazon Web Service) Toolkit for Eclipse and deployed in Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (EB) environment. This model is particularly used for securing the patient e-health details and performing computation on outsourced data. The patient details are encrypted by the algorithm SPHE and uploaded in AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket. The users are created by AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service and the access level policy is defined based on user roles in EB environment. The proposed model performance is studied by comparing with other partially homomorphic methods Elgamal, Pailler, and Benaloh. This model achieves data integrity and data confidentiality using the role-based user policy with SPHE.},

In a state feedback control design that precisely tracks the position of the coil current and coil voltage of actuated levitation system, we first derived the mathematical model in the form of a state–space model from the MagT. model; then, we implemented the saturated control input to encounter the uncertainties. A new event-triggered mechanism, in which the threshold parameter remains constant with resulting states, is utilized to save the constrained network resources and improve information exchange efficiency. Using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, a defensive control is established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for the resultant system. Finally, it is shown through the most practical approach example that the proposed method in this paper is effective for ensuring better system performance.},

The bit error rate is one of the most powerful tool to measure reliable throughput at the end-user. The selection of antennas and the corresponding RF chains also plays the most significant role to the context. Many conventional beams spaces non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques are available. However, favorable communication is one of the major problem, and this is due to unfavorable power allocation at Far sector users and Edge sector users along with near sector users. In this paper, we introduced the sector multi-beam space optimal bit error rate NOMA (SMBS-OBER-NOMA) which further reduces the errors due to Intra-/Inter-successive Interference Cancellation and also, further power errors due to power allocation are addressed. Simulation results show that the proposed method reduces optimal bit error rates and complexity.},

By analyzing the power distribution of cyclic correlation of transmitted signal, RFI and AWGN, by appropriately selecting the time delay variable and cyclic frequency of the OFDM/OQAM signal, the signal and interference plus noise power could be efficiently isolated in the power domain, which formed the SINR estimation method. Computer simulation results verify that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of second-order and fourth-order moments (M2M4) method and the complexity of the new method is also lower than that of M2M4 method.

This synthesis technique employs all three design parameters known as the excitation amplitude, inter-element spacing, and the excitation phase to obtain the desired radiation pattern. The objective of this synthesis process involves defining the extent of the effective flat top, ripples through the flat top, and the sidelobe level. Linear array configuration produces desired sector patterns, and the comparisons of these patterns are performed in θ- domain. The consistency of the algorithm is evaluated by extending the study to different LAA lengths.

The main problem behind search data on the web is organizing user search information based on their preferences into dynamic query formations and data coming from associated web links in an automated way on web services on high-quality sparse data. Vast amounts of data with the Dynamic nature of web interfaces explore or achieve high efficiency and coverage of all deep web interfaces that turn out to be a challenging issue. To handle such issues, we propose and introduce a novel and efficient two-phase deep learning data crawler framework (NTPDCF). The first phase initiates in gathering accurate and highly relevant links using the search engine, and the second phase explores fast and in-site relevant website links using adaptive site ranking. The approach focuses on drilling relevant site data and top-k ranking with different relations based on dynamic features with user preferences in single- and multi-query formation with adaptive weight features. The method promises to visualize improved results with efficient data exploration over the traditional approach concerning real-time defense and e-commerce related to web-based services.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is considered as a key component for the autonomous vehicles of futuristic transport systems. The extraction and fitting problems of lane markers from the road images have been addressed in recent research studies. However, these are still ineffective under curved lane and color light conditions. Illumination changes and the road structure mainly affect the efficiency of lane detection which may lead to traffic accidents especially in case of a curved road. In this work, a novel method based on a low complexity but efficient functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) model is proposed to estimate the entire lane by interpolating the lane markers under different road scenarios. The road image is divided into regions and the extracted lane markers from each region are employed in the proposed trigonometric, polynomial, exponential, and Chebyshev functional expansion based FLANN models for the estimation of the lane curvature. The performance of each model is evaluated and tested on road images using three standard datasets. In terms of mean accuracy and computational time out of four FLANN models, the Chebyshev FLANN (CFLNN) outperforms other three proposed methods. The detection accuracy of CFLANN model is found to be 94.3\% which is higher than the results reported by other three models.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the amount of Internet information data has exploded, and the problem of “information overload” has become a huge challenge for Internet development. Through the prior knowledge of the known data distribution, combined with sample training data to estimate the mathematical model of the overall data. Intelligent recommendation methods based on knowledge graphs and Bayesian networks are a hot spot in the current Internet research, and they are of great significance to search engines and e-commerce. This paper studies the fusion of knowledge graph and Bayesian belief network and its application in personalized recommendation and designs a Bayesian network that describes the purchase behavior of users based on the purchase records of customers across the network. User recommendation is the process of fusing knowledge graphs and Bayesian network reasoning. For the design of the recommendation network, a random reasoning algorithm with approximate reasoning is selected in consideration of calculation scale and accuracy. This paper uses the content filtering technology of KNN algorithm to supplement the sparse matrix, which can improve the quality of collaborative filtering recommendation, thereby improving the quality of final recommendation. In this paper, based on the knowledge graph, the EPCA algorithm and the robust recommendation algorithm are merged to form a robust collaborative recommendation model based on Bayesian probability matrix decomposition. The robust recommendation algorithm further improves the robustness of the recommendation algorithm by introducing the suspected users and target items detected by the EPCA algorithm. Research shows that the PS value of the VarSelect SVD algorithm used in this paper is approximately between 0.36 and 1.04. Compared with the first two algorithms, the PS value of VarSelect SVD has been significantly reduced, and the algorithm robustness has been significantly improved.},

This paper proposes a manifold fitting algorithm for the variable-scale spectral graph theory and estimates the deviation of the manifold structure caused by noise. Considering the scale variations in frequency-domain analysis based on spectral graph theory, details of the data under the effect of small scale and characteristics of data shape under the effect of large scale are highlighted. This study uses the average calculation and meanshift method to obtain two types of mean vectors from each neighborhood, which are essential in suppressing noise and maintaining shape, respectively. Therefore, manifold fitting is carried out from two aspects, specifically weakening noise and characterizing the manifold shape. To obtain a closer estimate of the deviation caused by noise to the manifold structure, this study also estimates the neighborhood distribution of data under the effect of medium scale, obtains the covariance information of each neighborhood, and uses the variance information to estimate the manifold structure deviations.},

  abstract     = {In the computer vision applications such as security surveillance and robotics, pedestrian identification shows much attention in the last decade. This is usually achieved by human biometrics. Besides human biometrics, sometimes it is required to identify pedestrians at a distance. This could be accomplished based on a fact of different whole-body appearances. The real-time pedestrian identification is a challenging task due to several factors such as illumination effects, noise, change in viewpoint, and video resolution. The more recent, the deep neural network (DNN) shows a massive performance for various real-world applications. In this article, we present a real-time architecture for pedestrian identification using motion-controlled DNN. In the proposed architecture, the motion vectors are calculating using optical flow and then utilized in the next step, named features extraction. Two types of features, such as HOG and DNN, are computing. The pre-trained VGG19 CNN model is employing and trained through transfer learning. The deep learning features are extracted from two layers—fully connected layers 7 and 8. Also, we proposed a feature selection method named Bayesian modeling along with LSVM. The best selected features of both HOG and DNN are finally fused in one matrix for final identification. The multi-class support vector machine classifier is used for final identification. The videos are recording in the real-time environment for the experimental process and achieve an average accuracy of 98.62\%. Overall, identification accuracy shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Usual practices involve producing a convict’s sketch through the crime observer’s explanations. Nevertheless, researches have effectively proved the failure of customary practices as they carry a maximum level of discrepancies in the process of identification. The advent of computer vision techniques has replaced this traditional procedure with intelligent machines capable of ruling out the possible discrepancies, thus assisting the investigation process and considering the relevant points mentioned earlier. This research paper has investigated an adversarial network toward achieving color photograph images out of sketches, which are then classified using pre-trained transfer learning models to accomplish the identification process. Further, to enhance the adversarial network’s performance factor in terms of photogeneration, we also employed a novel sketch generator based on the gamma adjustment technique. Experimental trials are steered with image datasets open to the research community. The trials’ outcomes evidenced that the proposed system achieved the lowest similarity score of 91\% and the average identification accuracy of more than 70\% on all the datasets. Comparative analysis portrayed in this work also attests that the proposed technique performs ably better than any other state-of-the-art techniques.},

This article mainly studies the application of remote sensing image processing technology based on mobile augmented reality technology in surveying and mapping engineering. First, perform grayscale processing on the image in the experiment, then remove the noise in the image and smooth the image through the median filter method and finally use the Canny operator to perform edge detection to obtain a binarized image containing only the target object, and this is done by image feature extraction. After using three-dimensional scanning modeling to extract the image feature points, the target manager is used for sample analysis. Obtain the projection matrix through the interface, and then perform coordinate conversion to complete the positioning of the target scene. In this paper, the BRISK feature point detection algorithm with fast speed and small calculation is used to detect the target, and SVM is used for remote sensing feature classification. Experimental data show that the recognition success rate of the algorithm is 84\%.

After tracking the skeletons, activities are recognized from each individually tracked skeleton independently. Different rules are defined to recognize discrete skeleton positions and classify a particular order of multiple postures into activities. During the experimentation, we examine about 14 activities and found that the proposed method is robust and efficient concerning multiple views, scaling and phase variation activities during different realistic acts. A self-generated dataset in the controlled environment is used for the experiment. About 2 min of data was collected. Data from two different males were collected for multiple human activities.

Consequently, this research addresses the general problem of designing an agent-based autonomous flight control (AFC) architecture of a UAV to facilitate autonomous routing/navigation in uncharted and unascertained environments of organized foyer surroundings. The specific problem of this research is the indoor environment because of the perplexing characteristics of the required flight mechanics. We design the AFC agent architecture to consist of data acquisition, perception, localization, mapping, control, and planning modules. The AFC agent performs search and survey missions that entail commanding the UAV while performing object classifications and recognition tasks. The agent implements several image handling algorithms to detect and identify objects from their colors and shapes. It captures the video images acquired from a solitary onboard, front-facing camera which are handled off-board on a computer. We conduct tests on the AFC agent, and the results show that the agent successfully controls the UAV in three performed test cases and a total of nine implemented missions. The AFC agent detects and identifies all the assigned objects with a recall score of 1.00, a precision score of 0.9563, an accuracy score of 0.9573, an F1 score of 0.9776, an efficiency score of 0.5239, a detection total time score of 225.5 s, and an identification total time of 275 s and outperforms a human operator.},

Due to low performances from various cyber attacks, the adoption of recommender system is in the initial stage of defense systems. One of the most common attacks for recommender system is shilling attack. There are some existing techniques for identifying the shilling attacks built in the user ratings patterns. The performance of ratings on target items differs between the attack user profiles and actual user profiles. To differentiate the certain profiles, the affected profiles are known as attack profiles. Besides the shilling attacks, real cyber attacks are taking place in the community which are being solved by Petri Net methods. These attacks can be falsely predicted (shilling attacks) by the users which can raise security threats. For identifying various shilling attacks without a priori knowledge, Recommendation System suffers from low accuracy. Basically, recommendation attack is split into nuke and push attack that encourage and discourage the recommended target item. The strength of shilling attack is usually measured by filler size and attack size. An experiment over unsupervised machine learning algorithms with filler size 3\% over 3\%, 5\%, 8\% and 10\% attack sizes is presented for Netflix dataset. Furthermore, we conducted an experiment on data of 26 K videos on the Trending YouTube Video Statistics, to predict the user preferences for a particular genre of videos using Machine Learning Algorithms.

  abstract     = {Optimizing aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) planning, i.e., reviewing aircraft history based on when and where the aircraft should be serviced, is essential to ensuring aviation safety and operations. This paper examines a method for optimizing the scheduling of MRO operations for complex products. It has been shown in the literature that scheduling optimization of MRO operations is an NP-hard problem. In this study, the planning problem for MRO service resources is first analyzed, a mathematical model for the MRO process planning problem is established, and a multi-objective mathematical model for minimizing makespan time, maintenance time, and cost is proposed to represent the planning problem. Then, to optimize the makespan time, maintenance time, and cost, we first generate the maintenance, repair and overhaul transaction path (MROTP) data to utilize the PLM system efficiently, which ensures the effective operation of MRO actions throughout the aircraft lifecycle. MROTP data are obtained with engineering studies in our proposed research, and received data are retained in the PLM system. Finally, the modified ACO algorithm that performs scheduling optimization of the MRO process and the integration process of PLM with MRO operations is presented. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated by simulations in MATLAB software with the data obtained from the leading MRO company in Turkey. The Gurobi Solver is used to obtain the optimal solution by converting the problem into mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The experimental setup is run using Gurobi with a 1-hour time limit, and the best solution is considered with an average run time calculated in seconds. When solving complicated instances, the MILP model-based approach is challenging. The study and comparison of the findings demonstrate that the proposed ACO-based algorithms have an advantage in planning MRO operations. The proposed ACO algorithm performs better than the other metaheuristic algorithms and the MILP model regarding maintenance time and cost.},

Since traditional traffic accident prediction often applies classical prediction algorithms to a small portion of data, the obtained models can only predict a small range of traffic accidents. Most accident prediction models are limited by the lack of data features, do not consider the problems of practical application scenarios, and do not incorporate regional heterogeneity, so the prediction accuracy of accident prediction models is poor. This paper analyzes and summarizes the relationship between traffic accidents and influencing factors from five aspects, such as people, vehicles, roads and environment, and proves the influence of regional heterogeneity on accidents, which paves the way for traffic accident prediction. The data and heterogeneous spatial data are preprocessed and feature selected, respectively. Logistic regression and random forest algorithm are used to train the corresponding prediction models. The results show that the prediction model combined with regional heterogeneity has better comprehensive performance than the original data.},

  abstract     = {In the past few decades, the automatic text summarization process has become an essential area in research. The automatic text summarization process extracts the essential and the most-resourceful information the users need, and various users in many fields easily handle it. This work extracts linear and non-linear information using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Then, the extracted features are given into the Bag of Features (BoF) which is provided as an input to the classifier model known as Multi-layered CNN for feature representation. This process is known as BoF-CNN. The multiple layers of the CNN model analyse the given features and provide the weighted score for the keywords based on the higher needs. The importance/classification is provided. The combinations of features are weighted with the graph model when placed in BoF. The proposed model effectively analyses the features and classifies the text based on weight. The simulation is done in MATLAB 2020a environment and provides better results when analysing incoming data.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an application-based network belonging to the class of mobile ad hoc networks. The nodes in the VANET are interconnected and communicate through wireless media and the Internet. This subsequently leads to data security issues. Several secured communication and routing protocols for VANET have been proposed so far. However, security complaints are still rising. The motivation is to provide a secured communication strategy (SCS) in which each node of VANET needs to be authenticated and authorized to participate in the communication network. The SCS comprises two phases, namely node authentication and authorization phases. The details of every node are collected and saved in the authentication phase and validated in the authorization phase. Whenever a new node is admitted into the VANET functionalities, it must fulfill the requirement of answering a set of credentials given by the admin. The logistic regression model is used to overcome the computation complexity. The simulation of SCS is carried out in NS2 software, and the results are verified in terms of throughput, packet delivery ratio, packet loss, and delay. The performance is evaluated by comparing the results with earlier methods to prove its efficiency.},

Several examples are given to illustrate that, the new definition is a nontrivial generalization for classical inner product spaces, and so it has rich contents in fuzziness. By virtue of this definition, some elementary properties are described in terms of the families of semi-inner products and a fuzzy version of Pythagorean theorem is given.

The discount rate is determined by the unambiguity degree of the linguistic set. With a fixed discount rate, the situation when the evidential global linguistic terms entropy (EGLTE) reaches its maximum is also discussed in our paper.

The main results include that strong mixing implies ergodicity and weak mixing implies weak ergodicity. Moreover, limit properties of mixing capacity preserving dynamical systems and connections between a capacity preserving dynamical system and its product system are also discussed.

This condition represents an ill-structured problem under uncertainty, which requires a set of specific tools to be solved. This study relies on an integrated approach composed of the interval type-2 fuzzy best–worst method (IT2F-BWM) and the interval type-2 fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (IT2F-DEMATEL) method, to handle the complexities that SMEs experience in the transition to Industry 4.0.

Furthermore, the IT2F-DEMATEL results showed that the “organizational” dimension exerted the highest degree of impact. The most effective criteria (sub-dimensions) were “the lack of a skillful management team,” “the need for advanced skills,” and “having insufficient knowledge of and little interest in Industry 4.0 and its outcomes,” which fell under the “organizational,” “technological,” and “strategic” dimensions, respectively. The findings could help firms and enterprises to gain adequate knowledge of Industry 4.0 before implementing it, while clarifying how such entities can enhance their organizations and overcome obstacles by training their human resources.},

Every element of our lives, including arts and crafts, has been favorably influenced by the introduction of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). In today&#39;s modern era, the technologies have revolutionized the way art is created, consumed, and distributed. Machine learning and human emotions are the two most important aspects of interactive and high-quality art design. In the teaching and learning of art-related courses, AI and machine learning are used to develop students&#39; creative talents more successfully than traditional learning methods. With the use of information technology, designers build and design more productive artwork in very little time and with much less effort. In the evolution and creation of interactive and intelligent digital art, artificial intelligence and machine learning are playing a highly positive role. Art developed with the use of these approaches is capable of conveying human emotions and sentiments precisely and correctly. The proposed study presents a comprehensive overview of various AI-grounded smart and intelligent applications employed for the betterment and development of art design. The study provided a summary of the existing approaches used in the area of art design for the designing of high-quality and precise artwork. Then, based on the proposed overview, various features are extracted from the existing literature. From these extracted features, important features were selected for the decision-making procedure and ranking.

It is demonstrated that mp-residuated lattices are strongly tied up with the dual hull-kernel topology. Mainly, it is shown that a residuated lattice is mp if and only if its minimal prime spectrum, equipped with the dual hull-kernel topology, is Hausdorff if and only if its prime spectrum, fitted with the dual hull-kernel topology, is normal. For a residuated lattice $${\mathfrak {A}}$$ and a subalgebra $${\mathfrak {S}}$$ , the notion of disjunctive $${\mathfrak {S}}$$ -regular and $${\mathfrak {S}}$$ -mp-residuated lattices are introduced and investigated. It is shown that a residuated lattice $${\mathfrak {A}}$$ is purified if and only if it is $$\beta ({\mathfrak {A}})$$ -mp if and only if it is disjunctive $$\beta ({\mathfrak {A}})$$ -regular, where $$\beta ({\mathfrak {A}})$$ is the set of complemented elements of $${\mathfrak {A}}$$ . Some topological characterizations for purified residuated lattices are extracted and proved that a residuated lattice $${\mathfrak {A}}$$ is purified if and only if its minimal prime spectrum, equipped with the dual hull-kernel topology, is a profinite space.

  abstract     = {In the current internet of things era, various devices can provide more services by connecting to the Internet. However, the explosive growth of connected devices will cause cloud core overload and significant network delays. To overcome these overload and delay problems, the mobile edge computing (MEC) network is proposed to provide most of the computing and storage near the radio access network to reduce the traffic of the core cloud network and provide lower latency for the terminal. Mobile edge computing can work with third parties to develop multiple services, such as mobile big data analysis and context-aware services. However, while using the service, it may also encounter a large amount of popular data being accessed in a short period of time. Without proper handling of replica generation and deployment, even in low-latency environments, it can still kill the benefits of MEC due to increased access time. Although many scholars have proposed related issues for copy replication, there are still.parts that can be improved. To avoid the situation of insufficient availability of replicas, replica replication is performed, but infinite replicas may lead to a significant increase in traffic and waste of resources. And when deploying replicas, it is necessary to avoid placing them on congested nodes and consider how to achieve better load balancing. To improve the above problems, we synthesize the advantages of previous algorithms, make up for the shortcomings, and propose an adaptive replica configuration mechanism to predict the popularity of files and replicate replicas to low-blocking nodes. This method spreads the subsequent access workload by copying the popular file in advance to improve the system&#39;s overall performance.},

  abstract     = {As a useful extension of rough sets, multigranulation rough sets (MGRSs) can be used to deal with a variety of complex data. Numerous significant advances have been achieved by generalizing MGRSs. However, most of the existing findings of MGRSs are sensitive to misclassification and noise in data. Furthermore, the studies of attribute reduction based on MGRSs have received little attention. To fill such gaps, this paper proposes an extended model of MGRSs named variable precision multigranulation rough sets (VPMGRSs) by introducing rough membership function and approximation parameters in variable precision rough sets (VPRSs) into the multigranulation environment. After giving some basic properties of VPMGRSs, we investigate the relationships between VPMGRSs and VPRSs, pessimistic MGRSs, and generalized MGRSs. In addition, several VPMGRSs-based attribute reductions are introduced, and it is proved that some of them are equivalent when the parameters in the model meet specific requirements. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm for $$\alpha $$ -lower distribution reduct and illustrate its effectiveness and efficiency by a comparative experiment on real datasets.},

  abstract     = {This study adheres to a set of guidelines for performing an SLR. The mission of the SLR is to find publications, publishers, deep learning types, improved and amended deep learning techniques, impacts, proactive approaches, key parameters, and applications in ship detection by SAR images, as well as extract current research directions, limitations, and unsolved challenges to give understanding and suggestions for future research. To minimize any complications, the information was gathered from significant research publications published in decent journals between 2016 and 2022. The proceedings of conferences and seminars, as well as other online resources, are not included. A total of 81 primary studies were selected based on pre-determined exclusion, inclusion, and quality characteristics. The literature review addressed several important issues, including key methods considered by researchers in the field of ship identification by SAR images, various types of DL limitations and their alternating solutions proposed for ship detection by SAR imagery analysis, and several types of proactive approaches suggested in the literature to mitigate risks associated with ship detection by SAR images, and types of SAR imageries significances reported in the ship detection analysis. Despite substantial research and development of various deep learning algorithms, the findings demonstrate that there is still a scarcity of organized knowledge that allows deep learning to be applied for essential applications in the ship detection by SAR imagery field. Furthermore, DL techniques to recognize ships in SAR images have not been fully exploited, necessitating future research. The findings point to the necessity for more research into deep learning approaches, as well as the development of an authentic process for correct results extracted from SAR data for ship detection. Researchers will be able to view current studies on deep learning techniques with the help of the recommended research, which can then be used as evidence for future research.},

Here, we demonstrate that the so-called kappa function and its special cases are viable alternatives to some elements of quadratic scoring rule prospects theory. After, we present the tau-eta scoring rule prospect and show that it may be treated as a generalization of the quadratic scoring rule prospect. Furthermore, we prove that if this new prospect for an uncertain event is evaluated using specific kappa functions as utility functions, then (1) the weighting measure of the event is a function of the optimal value of its reported probability, (2) the inverse of the latter function, and (3) the (risk-) corrected reported probability of the event, also as a function of the optimal value of its reported probability, all have a common formula. The parameters of the common formula are unambiguously determined by four tuning parameters. Lastly, we show that with our approach, by fitting one of the abovementioned functions to corresponding empirical data, we can immediately obtain the other two functions as well.},
