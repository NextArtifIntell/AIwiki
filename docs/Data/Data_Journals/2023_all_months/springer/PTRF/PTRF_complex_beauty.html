  abstract     = {We study the asymptotic behavior of the normalized maxima of real-valued diffusive particles with mean-field drift interaction. Our main result establishes propagation of chaos: in the large population limit, the normalized maxima behave as those arising in an i.i.d. system where each particle follows the associated McKean–Vlasov limiting dynamics. Because the maximum depends on all particles, our result does not follow from classical propagation of chaos, where convergence to an i.i.d. limit holds for any fixed number of particles but not all particles simultaneously. The proof uses a change of measure argument that depends on a delicate combinatorial analysis of the iterated stochastic integrals appearing in the chaos expansion of the Radon–Nikodym density.},

  abstract     = {Consider a system of homogeneous interacting diffusive particles labeled by the nodes of a unimodular Galton–Watson tree, where the state of each node evolves infinitesimally like a d-dimensional diffusion whose drift coefficient depends on (the histories of) its own state and the states of neighboring nodes, and whose diffusion coefficient depends only on (the history of) its own state. Under suitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients, an autonomous characterization is obtained for the marginal distribution of the dynamics of the neighborhood of a typical node in terms of a certain local equation, which is a new kind of stochastic differential equation that is nonlinear in the sense of McKean. This equation describes a finite-dimensional non-Markovian stochastic process whose infinitesimal evolution at any time depends not only on the structure and current state of the neighborhood, but also on the conditional law of the current state given the past of the states of neighborhing nodes until that time. Such marginal distributions are of interest because they arise as weak limits of both marginal distributions and empirical measures of interacting diffusions on many sequences of sparse random graphs, including the configuration model and Erdös–Rényi graphs whose average degrees converge to a finite non-zero limit. The results obtained complement classical results in the mean-field regime, which characterize the limiting dynamics of homogeneous interacting diffusions on complete graphs, as the number of nodes goes to infinity, in terms of a corresponding nonlinear Markov process. However, in the sparse graph setting, the topology of the graph strongly influences the dynamics, and the analysis requires a completely different approach. The proofs of existence and uniqueness of the local equation rely on delicate new conditional independence and symmetry properties of particle trajectories on unimodular Galton–Watson trees, as well as judicious use of changes of measure.},

  abstract     = {Consider a branching Markov process with values in some general type space. Conditional on survival up to generation N, the genealogy of the extant population defines a random marked metric measure space, where individuals are marked by their type and pairwise distances are measured by the time to the most recent common ancestor. In the present manuscript, we devise a general method of moments to prove convergence of such genealogies in the Gromov-weak topology when $$N \rightarrow \infty $$ . Informally, the moment of order k of the population is obtained by observing the genealogy of k individuals chosen uniformly at random after size-biasing the population at time N by its kth factorial moment. We show that the sampled genealogy can be expressed in terms of a k-spine decomposition of the original branching process, and that convergence reduces to the convergence of the underlying k-spines. As an illustration of our framework, we analyse the large-time behavior of a branching approximation of the biparental Wright–Fisher model with recombination. The model exhibits some interesting mathematical features. It starts in a supercritical state but is naturally driven to criticality. We show that the limiting behavior exhibits both critical and supercritical characteristics.},

Fields 148, no. 3/4 (2010), 403–456 we derived a quenched large deviation principle for the empirical process of words obtained by cutting an i.i.d. sequence of letters according to an independent renewal process. We derived a representation of the associated rate function for stationary word processes in terms of certain specific relative entropies. Our proof of this representation is correct when the mean word length is finite, but is flawed when the mean word length is infinite. In this paper we fix the flaw in the proof. Along the way we derive new representations of the rate function that are interesting in their own right. A key ingredient in the proof is the observation that if the rate function in the annealed large deviation principle is finite at a stationary word process, then the letters in the tail of the long words in this process are typical.},

It is known (Bahl et al. in Parking on supercritical Galton–Watson trees, arXiv:1912.13062 , 2019; Goldschmidt and Przykucki in Comb Probab Comput 28:23–45, 2019) that the parking process on $$ \mathbb {B}$$ exhibits a phase transition in the sense that either a finite number of cars do not manage to park in expectation (subcritical regime) or all vertices of the tree contain a car and infinitely many cars do not manage to park (supercritical regime). We characterize those regimes in terms of the law of A in an explicit way. We also study in detail the critical regime as well as the phase transition which turns out to be “discontinuous”.},

Assuming the radial symmetry of the initial data we introduce a novel “probabilistic” notion of solution, which can accommodate the discontinuities in time (of the radius) of the evolving aggregate. Our main result establishes the global existence of a probabilistic solution satisfying the natural upper bound on the sizes of the discontinuities. Moreover, we prove that the upper bound is sharp in dimensions $$d\geqslant 3$$ , in the sense that none of the discontinuities in the solution can be decreased in magnitude.

For special choices of parameters the flow is periodic, and this allows us to perform a saddle point analysis for the correlation kernel. In these cases we compute the local correlations in the smooth disordered (or gaseous) region. The special example in which the flow has period six is worked out in more detail, and we show that in that case the boundary of the rough disordered region is an algebraic curve of degree eight.},

The components of the right edge evolve as multiplicative random walks on positive definite matrices with one-sided interactions and can be viewed as a d-dimensional generalisation of log-gamma polymer partition functions. We establish intertwining relations to prove that, for suitable initial configurations of the triangular process, the bottom edge has an autonomous Markovian evolution with an explicit transition kernel. We then show that, for a special singular initial configuration, the fixed-time law of the bottom edge is a matrix Whittaker measure, which we define. To achieve this, we perform a Laplace approximation that requires solving a constrained minimisation problem for certain energy functions of matrix arguments on directed graphs.},

Firstly, we obtain a central limit type theorem, i.e. the deviation between the slow component $$X^{\varepsilon }$$ and the solution $${\bar{X}}$$ of the averaged equation converges weakly to a limiting process. More precisely, $$\frac{X^{\varepsilon }-{\bar{X}}}{\sqrt{\varepsilon }}$$ converges weakly in $$C([0,T],\mathbb {R}^n)$$ to the solution of certain distribution dependent stochastic differential equation, which involves an extra explicit stochastic integral term. Secondly, in order to estimate the probability of deviations away from the limiting process, we further investigate the Freidlin–Wentzell’s large deviation principle for multi-scale McKean–Vlasov stochastic system when the small-noise regime parameter $$\delta \rightarrow 0$$ and the time scale parameter $$\varepsilon (\delta )$$ satisfies $$\varepsilon (\delta )/\delta \rightarrow 0$$ . The main techniques are based on the Poisson equation for central limit type theorem and the weak convergence approach for large deviation principle.},

The weight of each edge e is independently drawn from the distribution $${\mathcal {P}}$$ if $$e \in M^*$$ and from $${\mathcal {Q}}$$ if $$e \notin M^*$$ . We show that if $$\sqrt{d} B({\mathcal {P}},{\mathcal {Q}}) \le 1$$ , where $$B({\mathcal {P}},{\mathcal {Q}})$$ stands for the Bhattacharyya coefficient, the reconstruction error (average fraction of misclassified edges) of the maximum likelihood estimator of $$M^*$$ converges to 0 as $$n\rightarrow \infty $$ . Conversely, if $$\sqrt{d} B({\mathcal {P}},{\mathcal {Q}}) \ge 1+\epsilon $$ for an arbitrarily small constant $$\epsilon &gt;0$$ , the reconstruction error for any estimator is shown to be bounded away from 0 for both the sparse (fixed d) and dense (growing d) regimes, resolving the conjecture in Moharrami et al.

We determine an explicit formula for the density of the expectation of the Baxter permuton. This answers a question of Dokos and Pak (Online J Anal Comb 9:12, 2014). We also prove that all pattern densities of the Baxter permuton are strictly positive, distinguishing it from other permutons arising as scaling limits of pattern-avoiding permutations. Our proofs rely on a recent connection between the Baxter permuton and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) coupled with the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). The method works equally well for a two-parameter generalization of the Baxter permuton recently introduced by the first author, except that the density is not as explicit. This new family of permutons, called skew Brownian permuton, describes the scaling limit of a number of random constrained permutations. We finally observe that in the LQG/SLE framework, the expected proportion of inversions in a skew Brownian permuton equals $$\frac{\pi -2\theta }{2\pi }$$ where $$\theta $$ is the so-called imaginary geometry angle between a certain pair of SLE curves.},

We prove that the typical graph exhibits sharp singularities as the constraining densities vary between different curves of extreme values, and we determine the precise nature of the singularities. The extension to graphs with fixed densities of edges and k-cycles for odd $$k&gt;3$$ is straightforward and we note the simple changes in the proof.},

These results generalize those of Driver–Hall–Kemp and Ho–Zhong for the case $$\tau =s.$$ We also establish a remarkable “model deformation phenomenon,” stating that all the Brown measures with s fixed and $$\tau $$ varying are related by push-forward under a natural family of maps. Our proofs use a first-order nonlinear PDE of Hamilton–Jacobi type satisfied by the regularized log potential of the Brown measures. Although this approach is inspired by the PDE method introduced by Driver–Hall–Kemp, our methods are substantially different at both the technical and conceptual level.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a pathwise construction of multi-soliton solutions for focusing stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equations with linear multiplicative noise, in both the $$L^{2}$$ -critical and subcritical cases. The constructed multi-solitons behave asymptotically as a sum of K solitary waves, where K is any given finite number. Moreover, the convergence rate of the remainders can be of either exponential or polynomial type, which reflects the effects of the noise in the system on the asymptotical behavior of the solutions. The major difficulty in our construction of stochastic multi-solitons is the absence of pseudo-conformal invariance. Unlike in the deterministic case (Merle in Commun Math Phys 129:223–240, 1990; Röckner et al. in Multi-bubble Bourgain–Wang solutions to nonlinear Schrödinger equation, arXiv: 2110.04107 , 2021), the existence of stochastic multi-solitons cannot be obtained from that of stochastic multi-bubble blow-up solutions in Röckner et al. (Multi-bubble Bourgain–Wang solutions to nonlinear Schrödinger equation, arXiv:2110.04107 , 2021), Su and Zhang (On the multi-bubble blow-up solutions to rough nonlinear Schrödinger equations, arXiv:2012.14037v1 , 2020). Our proof is mainly based on the rescaling approach in Herr et al. (Commun Math Phys 368:843–884, 2019), relying on two types of Doss–Sussman transforms, and on the modulation method in Côte and Friederich (Commun Partial Differ Equ 46:2325–2385, 2021), Martel and Merle (Ann Inst H Poincaré Anal Non Linéaire 23:849–864, 2006), in which the crucial ingredient is the monotonicity of the Lyapunov type functional constructed by Martel et al. (Duke Math J 133:405-466, 2006). In our stochastic case, this functional depends on the Brownian paths in the noise.},

(J Stat Phys 163(2):211–238, 2016) relates this model to a standard dimer model but on a non-bipartite graph. The Kasteleyn matrix of this dimer model describes a walk with transition weights that are negative along the free boundary. Yet under certain assumptions, which are in particular satisfied in the infinite volume limit in the upper half-plane, we prove an effective, true random walk representation for the inverse Kasteleyn matrix. In this case we further show that, independently of the value of $$z&gt;0$$ , the scaling limit of the centered height function is the Gaussian free field with Neumann (or free) boundary conditions. It is the first example of a discrete model where such boundary conditions arise in the continuum scaling limit.},

One corollary is that spin–spin correlations are maximised when the external field vanishes and the boundary condition is free, which proves a conjecture of Shlosman. In particular, the random field Ising model on $${\mathbb {Z}}^d$$ , $$d\geqslant 3$$ , exhibits exponential decay of correlations in the entire high temperature regime of the pure Ising model. Another corollary is that the pure Ising model in $$d\geqslant 3$$ satisfies the conjectured strong spatial mixing property in the entire high temperature regime.},

  abstract     = {We prove a Berry–Esseen theorem and Edgeworth expansions for partial sums of the form $$\displaystyle S_N=\sum \nolimits _{n=1}^{N}f_n(X_n,X_{n+1})$$ , where $$\{X_n\}$$ is a uniformly elliptic inhomogeneous Markov chain and $$\{f_n\}$$ is a sequence of uniformly bounded functions. The Berry–Esseen theorem holds without additional assumptions, while expansions of order 1 hold when $$\{f_n\}$$ is irreducible, which is an optimal condition. For higher order expansions, we then focus on two situations. The first is when the essential supremum of $$f_n$$ is of order $$O(n^{-{\beta }})$$ for some $${\beta }\in (0,1/2)$$ . In this case it turns out that expansions of any order $$r&lt;\frac{1}{1-2{\beta }}$$ hold, and this condition is optimal. The second case is uniformly elliptic chains on a compact Riemannian manifold. When $$f_n$$ are uniformly Lipschitz continuous we show that $$S_N$$ admits expansions of all orders. When $$f_n$$ are uniformly Hölder continuous with some exponent $${\alpha }\in (0,1)$$ , we show that $$S_N$$ admits expansions of all orders $$r&lt;\frac{1+{\alpha }}{1-{\alpha }}$$ . For Hölder continues functions with $${\alpha }&lt;1$$ our results are new also for uniformly elliptic homogeneous Markov chains and a single functional $$f=f_n$$ . In fact, we show that the condition $$r&lt;\frac{1+{\alpha }}{1-{\alpha }}$$ is optimal even in the homogeneous case.},

Let G and $$G&#39;$$ be G(n, p) Erdős–Rényi graphs marginally, identified with their adjacency matrices. Assume that G and $$G&#39;$$ are correlated such that $${\mathbb {E}}[G_{ij} G&#39;_{ij}] = p(1-\alpha )$$ .

Observing $$G^\pi $$ and $$G&#39;$$ , we aim to recover the matching $$\pi $$ . In this work, we show that for every $$\varepsilon \in (0,1]$$ , there is $$n_0&gt;0$$ depending on $$\varepsilon $$ and absolute constants $$\alpha _0, R &gt; 0$$ with the following property. Let $$n \ge n_0$$ , $$(1+\varepsilon ) \log n \le np \le n^{\frac{1}{R \log \log n}}$$ , and $$0&lt; \alpha &lt; \min (\alpha _0,\varepsilon /4)$$ .

This is the first polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the exact matching between vertices of correlated Erdős–Rényi graphs with constant correlation with high probability.

Moreover, for any Cayley graph of any finitely generated virtually nilpotent group, any “conjugation-invariant” metric is the scaling limit of some FPP with stationary edge weights on that graph.

  abstract     = {We consider last passage percolation on $$\mathbb {Z}^2$$ with general weight distributions, which is expected to be a member of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In this model, an oriented path between given endpoints which maximizes the sum of the i.i.d. weight variables associated to its vertices is called a geodesic. Under natural conditions of curvature of the limiting geodesic weight profile and stretched exponential decay of both tails of the point-to-point weight, we use geometric arguments to upgrade the tail assumptions to prove optimal upper and lower tail behavior with the exponents of 3/2 and 3 for the weight of the geodesic from (1, 1) to (r, r) for all large finite r, and thus unearth a connection between the tail exponents and the characteristic KPZ weight fluctuation exponent of 1/3. The proofs merge several ideas which are not reliant on the exact form of the vertex weight distribution, including the well known super-additivity property of last passage values, concentration of measure behavior for sums of stretched exponential random variables, and geometric insights coming from the study of geodesics and more general objects called geodesic watermelons. Previous proofs of such optimal estimates have relied on hard analysis of precise formulas available only in integrable models. Our results illustrate a facet of universality in a class of KPZ stochastic growth models and provide a geometric explanation of the upper and lower tail exponents of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution, the conjectured one point scaling limit of such models. The key arguments are based on an observation of general interest that super-additivity allows a natural iterative bootstrapping procedure to obtain improved tail estimates.},

In particular, if the diffusion is absent, then all smooth solutions with finite second moment can exist only locally in time. Nevertheless, one can ask whether global existence can be restored by adding a suitable noise to the equation, so that the dynamics are now stochastic. Inspired by the work of Buckmaster et al. (Int Math Res Not IMRN 23:9370–9385, 2020) showing that, with high probability, the inviscid SQG equation with random diffusion has global classical solutions, we investigate whether suitable random diffusion can restore global existence for a large class of active scalar equations in arbitrary dimension with possibly singular velocity fields. This class includes Hamiltonian flows, such as the SQG equation and its generalizations, and gradient flows, such as those arising in aggregation models. For this class, we show global existence of solutions in Gevrey-type Fourier–Lebesgue spaces with quantifiable high probability.},

Taking inspiration from the theories of dissipative operators in Hilbert spaces and of Wasserstein gradient flows for geodesically convex functionals, we study local and global well posedness of evolution equations driven by dissipative MPVFs. Our approach is based on a measure-theoretic version of the Explicit Euler scheme, for which we prove novel convergence results with optimal error estimates under an abstract stability condition, which do not rely on compactness arguments and also hold when $${\textsf {X} }$$ has infinite dimension. We characterize the limit solutions by a suitable Evolution Variational Inequality (EVI), inspired by the Bénilan notion of integral solutions to dissipative evolutions in Banach spaces. Existence, uniqueness and stability of EVI solutions are then obtained under quite general assumptions, leading to the generation of a semigroup of nonlinear contractions.},

If F is the distribution function of $$\tau _v$$ , there are different regimes: if F(0) is small, this weight typically grows like a linear function of the distance, and when F(0) is large, the weight is typically of order one. In between these is the critical regime in which the weight can diverge, but does so sublinearly. We study a dynamical version of critical FPP on the triangular lattice where vertices resample their weights according to independent rate-one Poisson processes. We prove that if $$\sum F^{-1}(1/2+1/2^k) = \infty $$ , then a.s. there are exceptional times at which the weight grows atypically, but if $$\sum k^{7/8} F^{-1}(1/2+1/2^k) &lt;\infty $$ , then a.s. there are no such times. Furthermore, in the former case, we compute the Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions of the exceptional set and show that they can be but need not be equal. These results show a wider range of dynamical behavior than one sees in subcritical (usual) FPP.},

  abstract     = {The Fredrickson-Andersen 2-spin facilitated model on $${{\mathbb {Z}}} ^d$$ (FA-2f) is a paradigmatic interacting particle system with kinetic constraints (KCM) featuring dynamical facilitation, an important mechanism in condensed matter physics. In FA-2f a site may change its state only if at least two of its nearest neighbours are empty. Although the process is reversible w.r.t. a product Bernoulli measure, it is not attractive and features degenerate jump rates and anomalous divergence of characteristic time scales as the density q of empty sites tends to 0. A natural random variable encoding the above features is $$\tau _0$$ , the first time at which the origin becomes empty for the stationary process. Our main result is the sharp threshold $$\begin{aligned} \tau _0=\exp \Big (\frac{d\cdot \lambda (d,2)+o(1)}{q^{1/(d-1)}}\Big )\quad \text {w.h.p.} \end{aligned}$$ with $$\lambda (d,2)$$ the sharp threshold constant for 2-neighbour bootstrap percolation on $${{\mathbb {Z}}} ^d$$ , the monotone deterministic automaton counterpart of FA-2f. This is the first sharp result for a critical KCM and it compares with Holroyd’s 2003 result on bootstrap percolation and its subsequent improvements. It also settles various controversies accumulated in the physics literature over the last four decades. Furthermore, our novel techniques enable completing the recent ambitious program on the universality phenomenon for critical KCM and establishing sharp thresholds for other two-dimensional KCM.},

Define the coverage threshold $$R_n$$ to be the smallest r such that A is covered by the balls of radius r centred on $$X_1,\ldots ,X_n$$ . We obtain the limiting distribution of $$R_n$$ and also a strong law of large numbers for $$R_n$$ in the large-n limit. For example, if A has volume 1 and perimeter $$|\partial A|$$ , if $$d=3$$ then $$\mathbb {P}[n\pi R_n^3 - \log n - 2 \log (\log n) \le x]$$ converges to $$\exp (-2^{-4}\pi ^{5/3} |\partial A| e^{-2 x/3})$$ and $$(n \pi R_n^3)/(\log n) \rightarrow 1$$ almost surely, and if $$d=2$$ then $$\mathbb {P}[n \pi R_n^2 - \log n - \log (\log n) \le x]$$ converges to $$\exp (- e^{-x}- |\partial A|\pi ^{-1/2} e^{-x/2})$$ . We give similar results for general d, and also for the case where A is a polytope. We also generalize to allow for multiple coverage. The analysis relies on classical results by Hall and by Janson, along with a careful treatment of boundary effects. For the strong laws of large numbers, we can relax the requirement that the underlying density on A be uniform.},

We also show several applications of our general results: one is a moment-based bound on $$N_X(\mathbb {E}\!\left[ X\right] )$$ , which is an important quantity in randomized approaches to cubature construction or measure reduction problem. Another application is the determination of the canonical convex body included in a random convex polytope given by independent copies of X, where our combinatorial approach allows us to generalize existing results in random matrix community significantly.},

We illustrate the usefulness of the formulas by two applications. The first one is a strong convergence result for solutions of general block Toeplitz systems for a multivariate short-memory process. The second application is closed-form formulas for the inverses of truncated block Toeplitz matrices corresponding to a multivariate ARMA process.

Its invariant law is the beta Hermite ensemble of random matrix theory, a non-product log-concave distribution. We explore the convergence to equilibrium of this process for various distances or divergences, including total variation, relative entropy, and transportation cost. When the number of particles is sent to infinity, we show that a cutoff phenomenon occurs: the distance to equilibrium vanishes abruptly at a critical time. A remarkable feature is that this critical time is independent of the parameter beta that controls the strength of the interaction, in particular the result is identical in the non-interacting case, which is nothing but the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. We also provide a complete analysis of the non-interacting case that reveals some new phenomena. Our work relies among other ingredients on convexity and functional inequalities, exact solvability, exact Gaussian formulas, coupling arguments, stochastic calculus, variational formulas and contraction properties. This work leads, beyond the specific process that we study, to questions on the high-dimensional analysis of heat kernels of curved diffusions.},

  abstract     = {We provide a probabilistic description of the stationary measures for the open KPZ on the spatial interval [0, 1] in terms of a Markov process Y, which is a Doob’s h transform of the Brownian motion killed at an exponential rate. Our work builds on a recent formula of Corwin and Knizel which expresses the multipoint Laplace transform of the stationary solution of the open KPZ in terms of another Markov process $$\mathbb T$$ : the continuous dual Hahn process with Laplace variables taking on the role of time-points in the process. The core of our approach is to prove that the Laplace transforms of the finite dimensional distributions of Y and $$\mathbb T$$ are equal when the time parameters of one process become the Laplace variables of the other process and vice versa.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel analogue for finite exchangeable sequences of the de Finetti, Hewitt and Savage theorem and investigate its implications for multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) and Bayesian statistics. If $$(Z_1, \ldots ,Z_N)$$ is a finitely exchangeable sequence of N random variables taking values in some Polish space X, we show that the law $$\mu _k$$ of the first k components has a representation of the form $$\begin{aligned} \mu _k=\int _{\mathcal{P}_{\frac{1}{N}}(X)} F_{N,k}(\lambda ) \, \text{ d } \alpha (\lambda ) \end{aligned}$$ for some probability measure $$\alpha $$ on the set of $$\frac{1}{N}$$ -quantized probability measures on X and certain universal polynomials $$F_{N,k}$$ . The latter consist of a leading term $$N^{k-1}\! /\prod _{j=1}^{k-1}(N\! -\! j) \lambda ^{\otimes k}$$ and a finite, exponentially decaying series of correlated corrections of order $$N^{-j}$$ ( $$j=1, \ldots ,k$$ ). The $$F_{N,k}(\lambda )$$ are precisely the extremal such laws, expressed via an explicit polynomial formula in terms of their one-point marginals $$\lambda $$ . Applications include novel approximations of MMOT via polynomial convexification and the identification of the remainder which is estimated in the celebrated error bound of Diaconis and Freedman (Ann Probab 8(4):745–764, 1980) between finite and infinite exchangeable laws.},

  abstract     = {We study scaling limits of a family of planar random growth processes in which clusters grow by the successive aggregation of small particles. In these models, clusters are encoded as a composition of conformal maps and the location of each successive particle is distributed according to the density of harmonic measure on the cluster boundary, raised to some power. We show that, when this power lies within a particular range, the macroscopic shape of the cluster converges to a disk, but that as the power approaches the edge of this range the fluctuations approach a critical point, which is a limit of stability. The methodology developed in this paper provides a blueprint for analysing more general random growth models, such as the Hastings-Levitov family.},

  abstract     = {Consider the switch chain on the set of d-regular bipartite graphs on n vertices with $$3\le d\le n^{c}$$ , for a small universal constant $$c&gt;0$$ . We prove that the chain satisfies a Poincaré inequality with a constant of order O(nd); moreover, when d is fixed, we establish a log-Sobolev inequality for the chain with a constant of order $$O_d(n\log n)$$ . We show that both results are optimal. The Poincaré inequality implies that in the regime $$3\le d\le n^c$$ the mixing time of the switch chain is at most $$O\big ((nd)^2 \log (nd)\big )$$ , improving on the previously known bound $$O\big ((nd)^{13} \log (nd)\big )$$ due to Kannan et al. (Rand Struct Algorithm 14(4):293–308, 1999) and $$O\big (n^7d^{18} \log (nd)\big )$$ obtained by Dyer et al. (Sampling hypergraphs with given degrees (preprint). arXiv:2006.12021 ). The log-Sobolev inequality that we establish for constant d implies a bound $$O(n\log ^2 n)$$ on the mixing time of the chain which, up to the $$\log n$$ factor, captures a conjectured optimal bound. Our proof strategy relies on building, for any fixed function on the set of d-regular bipartite simple graphs, an appropriate extension to a function on the set of multigraphs given by the configuration model. We then establish a comparison procedure with the well studied random transposition model in order to obtain the corresponding functional inequalities. While our method falls into a rich class of comparison techniques for Markov chains on different state spaces, the crucial feature of the method—dealing with chains with a large distortion between their stationary measures—is a novel addition to the theory.},

More precisely, in dimension $$d=2$$ we prove that $$\eta _1 \le 1/3$$ for continuous Gaussian fields with rapid correlation decay (e.g. the Bargmann–Fock field), and in $$d \ge 3$$ we prove $$\eta _1 \le d/3$$ for finite-range fields, both discrete and continuous, and $$\eta _1 \le d-2$$ for fields with rapid correlation decay. Although these results are classical for Bernoulli percolation (indeed they are best-known in general), existing proofs do not extend to dependent percolation models, and we develop a new approach based on exploration and relative entropy arguments. The proof also makes use of a new Russo-type inequality for Gaussian fields, which we apply to prove the sharpness of the phase transition and the mean-field bound for finite-range fields.},

  abstract     = {The Sine-Gordon model is obtained by tilting the law of a log-correlated Gaussian field X defined on a subset of $${\mathbb {R}}^d$$ by the exponential of its cosine, namely $$\exp (\alpha \smallint \cos (\beta X))$$ . It has gathered significant attention due to its importance in quantum field theory and to its connection with the study of log-gases in statistical mechanics. In spite of its relatively simple definition, the model has a very rich phenomenology. While the integral $$\smallint \cos (\beta X)$$ can be defined properly when $$\beta ^2&lt;d$$ using the standard Wick normalization of $$\cos (\beta X)$$ , a more involved renormalization procedure is needed when $$\beta ^2\in [d,2d)$$ . In particular it exhibits a countable sequence of phase transitions accumulating to the left of $$\beta =\sqrt{2d}$$ , each transition corresponding to the addition of an extra term in the renormalization scheme. The final threshold $$\beta =\sqrt{2d}$$ corresponds to the Kosterlitz–Thouless (KT) phase transition of the $$\log $$ -gas. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic approach to renormalization of the two-dimensional boundary (or 1-dimensional) Sine-Gordon model up to the KT threshold $$\beta =\sqrt{2d}$$ . The purpose of this approach is to propose a simple and flexible method to treat this problem which, unlike the existing renormalization group techniques, does not rely on translation invariance for the covariance kernel of X or the reference measure along which $$\cos (\beta X)$$ is integrated. To this purpose we establish by induction a general formula for the cumulants of a random variable defined on a filtered probability space expressed in terms of brackets of a family of martingales; to the best of our knowledge, the recursion formula is new and might have other applications. We apply this formula to study the cumulants of (approximations of) $$\smallint \cos (\beta X)$$ . To control all terms produced by the induction procedure, we prove a refinement of classical electrostatic inequalities, which allows us to bound the energy of configurations in terms of the Wasserstein distance between $$+$$ and − charges.},
