Reward Tampering describes the problem where AI agents bypass their intended objective, enabling unintended and potentially harmful behaviours. This paper investigates whether the creative potential of evolutionary algorithms could help ensure trustworthy solutions when facing this problem. The reason why evolutionary algorithms may help combat reward tampering is that they are able to find a diverse collection of different solutions to a problem within a single run, aiding the search for desirable solutions. Four different evolutionary algorithms were deployed in tasks illustrating the problem of reward tampering. The algorithms were designed with varying degrees of human expertise, measuring how human guidance influences the ability to discover trustworthy solutions. The results indicate that the algorithms’ ability to find and preserve trustworthy solutions is very dependent on preserving diversity during the search. Algorithms searching for behavioural diversity showed to be the most effective against reward tampering. Human expertise also showed to improve the certainty and quality of safe solutions, but even with only a minimal degree of human expertise, domain-independent diversity management was found to discover safe solutions.},

  abstract     = {The development of control laws for underactuated mechanical systems with pendulum-like behaviors is of paramount importance due to their use in the modeling of more complex systems and other challenging tasks. The underactuated feature describes constraints in the maneuverability and capabilities of a mechanical system with the advantage of offering less energy consumption. In this work, a novel methodology for solving the automation of evolved nonlinear controllers for the swing-up phase of switching control laws for underactuated inverted pendulums is proposed. Automatic synthesis of linear controllers with optimal performance applied to linear systems modeled as transfer functions is a forward leap proposed by Koza in 2003. Our proposed approach introduces the nonlinear nature within the automated construction of a set of swing-up controllers integrating an evolutionary process based on Genetic Programming (GP). The presented framework is based on an analytic behaviorist setup that merges Control Theory (CT) with GP. CT is applied to formulate the mathematical description of the problem and the design of the fitness function that guides the automated synthesis; GP is implemented as an evolutionary engine for the construction of the solutions. The advantage is that the symbolic feature of GP is exploited to develop large sets of nonlinear controllers that can be further studied with analytic tools from the CT approach. The proposed framework is applied to an underactuated two-link inverted pendulum giving a set of 13,590 evolved nonlinear swing-up controllers with the same and better fitness value than a state-of-the-art human-made design.},

The modification proposed in this study expands the original GAAM’s capabilities by allowing not only feature selection but also feature reduction. To obtain this effect, we applied the concept of ranks used in the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) and the concept of penalty term used in the Holland genetic algorithm. With those two concepts, we managed to balance the importance of two competing criteria in the GAAM fitness function: classification accuracy and the feature subset’s size. To assess the algorithm’s effectiveness, we evaluated it on eleven datasets with different characteristics and compared the results with eight reference methods: GAAM, Melting GAAM, Holland GA with a penalty term, NSGA-II, Correlation-based Feature Selection, Lasso, Sequential Forward Selection, and IniPG (an algorithm for particle swarm optimisation). The main conclusion drawn from this study is that the genetic algorithm with aggressive mutation and decreasing feature set (GAAMmf) introduced in this paper returned feature sets with a significantly smaller number of features than almost all reference methods. Furthermore, GAAMmf outperformed most of the methods in terms of classification accuracy (except the original GAAM). In contrast to Holland GA and NSGA-II, GAAMmf was able to perform the feature reduction task for all datasets, regardless of the initial number of features.},

  abstract     = {A main goal of synthetic biology is the design of logic gates that can reprogram cells to perform various user-defined tasks. One approach is the use of ribozyme-based logic gates (ribogates) consisting of catalytic RNA strands. However, existing ribogate design approaches face limitations in terms of complexity, diversity, ease of use, and reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called Truth-Seq-Er, which generates diverse and complex ribogate designs while improving user-friendliness and accessibility. Truth-Seq-Er uses a quality diversity approach and a novel technique called viability nullification to design 1, 2, and 3-input integrated ribogates that implement both linearly separable and inseparable functions. By requiring only a target Boolean function as input, the algorithm eliminates the need for domain knowledge and streamlines the design process. The diverse designs generated by Truth-Seq-Er are robust against unexpected requirements and provide a large, unbiased dataset for characterizing candidate ribogates. Moreover, we propose a graph-based model for ribogate operation and analyze the design principles shared by different ribogate families. The results demonstrate the potential of Truth-Seq-Er in advancing ribogate design and contributing to the development of novel synthetic biology and unconventional computing applications. Truth-Seq-Er is available for download at https://github.com/nickkamel/Truth_Seq_Er_CLI .},

  abstract     = {The spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has challenged many countries. To curb the effect of the pandemic requires the development of low-cost and rapid tools for detecting and diagnosing the patients. In this regard, chest X-ray scan images provide a reliable way of detecting the patients. One limitation, however, is the need for experts to analyse the images and identify the cases which can be a burden, when a large number of images are to be processed. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to extract rapidly, from the X-ray images, the regions in which there exist indications of COVID-19 infection. To identify the regions, image segmentation is required which is performed in this paper with a novel optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm uses probabilistic representation for the solutions. To improve the optimization process, we propose a diversity preserving operator. For multi-level image thresholding via optimization algorithms, different fitness functions have been proposed in the literature. In the proposed method in this paper, we use three fitness functions to benefit from the advantages of all. A fitness swapping scheme is proposed which swaps between the fitness functions in the optimization process. Also, a diversity preserving operator is proposed in this paper which compares the individuals and reinitializes the similar ones to inject diversity in the population. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of COVID-19 benchmark images and experimental analysis suggest better performance for the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The Transformation-Interaction-Rational is a representation for symbolic regression that limits the search space of functions to the ratio of two nonlinear functions each one defined as the linear regression of transformed variables. This representation has the main objective to bias the search towards simpler expressions while keeping the approximation power of standard approaches. The performance of using Genetic Programming with this representation was substantially better than with its predecessor (Interaction-Transformation) and ranked close to the state-of-the-art on a contemporary Symbolic Regression benchmark. On a closer look at these results, we observed that the performance could be further improved with an additional selective pressure for smaller expressions when the dataset contains just a few data points. The introduction of a penalization term applied to the fitness measure improved the results on these smaller datasets. One problem with this approach is that it introduces two additional hyperparameters: (i) a criterion for when the penalization should be activated and, (ii) the amount of penalization to the fitness function. One possible solution to alleviate this additional burden of correctly setting these hyperparameters is to pose the search as a multi-objective optimization problem by minimizing the approximation error and the expression size. The main idea is that the selective pressure of finding non-dominating solutions will return the simplest model for each particular approximation error in the pareto front. In this paper, we extend Transformation-Interaction-Rational to support multi-objective optimization, specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, and apply that to the same benchmark. A detailed analysis of the results show that the use of multi-objective optimization benefits the overall performance on a subset of the benchmarks while keeping the results similar to the single-objective approach on the remainder of the datasets. Specifically to the small datasets, we observe a small (and statistically insignificant) improvement of the results suggesting that further strategies must be explored.},

  abstract     = {Denoising autoencoder genetic programming (DAE-GP) is a novel neural network-based estimation of distribution genetic programming approach that uses denoising autoencoder long short-term memory networks as a probabilistic model to replace the standard mutation and recombination operators of genetic programming. At each generation, the idea is to capture promising properties of the parent population in a probabilistic model and to use corruption to transfer variations of these properties to the offspring. This work studies the influence of corruption and sampling steps on search. Corruption partially mutates candidate solutions that are used as input to the model, whereas the number of sampling steps defines how often we re-use the output during model sampling as input to the model. We study the generalization of the royal tree problem, the Airfoil problem, and the Pagie-1 problem, and find that both corruption strength and the number of sampling steps influence exploration and exploitation in search and affect performance: exploration increases with stronger corruption and lower number of sampling steps. The results indicate that both corruption and sampling steps are key to the success of the DAE-GP: it permits us to balance the exploration and exploitation behavior in search, resulting in an improved search quality. However, also selection is important for exploration and exploitation and should be chosen wisely.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation consists of classifying each pixel of an image and constitutes an essential step towards scene recognition and understanding. Deep convolutional encoder–decoder neural networks now constitute state-of-the-art methods in the field of semantic segmentation. The problem of street scenes’ segmentation for automotive applications constitutes an important application field of such networks and introduces a set of imperative exigencies. Since the models need to be executed on self-driving vehicles to make fast decisions in response to a constantly changing environment, they are not only expected to operate reliably but also to process the input images rapidly. In this paper, we explore genetic programming (GP) as a meta-model that combines four different efficiency-oriented networks for the analysis of urban scenes. Notably, we present and examine two approaches. In the first approach, we represent solutions as GP trees that combine networks’ outputs such that each output class’s prediction is obtained through the same meta-model. In the second approach, we propose representing solutions as lists of GP trees, each designed to provide a unique meta-model for a given target class. The main objective is to develop efficient and accurate combination models that could be easily interpreted, therefore allowing gathering some hints on how to improve the existing networks. The experiments performed on the Cityscapes dataset of urban scene images with semantic pixel-wise annotations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, our best-performing models improve systems’ generalization ability by approximately 5\% compared to traditional ensembles, 30\% for the less performing state-of-the-art CNN and show competitive results with respect to state-of-the-art ensembles. Additionally, they are small in size, allow interpretability, and use fewer features due to GP’s automatic feature selection.},

However, the implications of criteria used to determine affinity between tags with respect evolutionary dynamics have not been directly studied. We investigate differences between tag-matching criteria with respect to geometric constraint and variation generated under mutation. In experiments, we find that tag-matching criteria can influence the rate of adaptive evolution and the quality of evolved solutions. Better understanding of the geometric, variational, and evolutionary properties of tag-matching criteria will facilitate more effective incorporation of tag matching into genetic programming and artificial life systems. By showing that tag-matching criteria influence connectivity patterns and evolutionary dynamics, our findings also raise fundamental questions about the properties of tag-matching systems in nature.},

  abstract     = {We present an extension of SonOpt, the first ever openly available tool for the sonification of bi-objective population-based optimisation algorithms. SonOpt has already introduced benefits on the understanding of algorithmic behaviour by proposing the use of sound as a medium for the process monitoring of bi-objective optimisation algorithms. The first edition of SonOpt utilised two different sonification paths to provide information on convergence, population diversity, recurrence of objective values across consecutive generations and the shape of the approximation set. The present extension provides further insight through the introduction of a third sonification path, which involves hypervolume contributions to facilitate the understanding of the relative importance of non-dominated solutions. Using a different sound generation approach than the existing ones, this newly proposed sonification path utilizes pitch deviations to highlight the distribution of hypervolume contributions across the approximation set. To demonstrate the benefits of SonOpt we compare the sonic results obtained from two popular population-based multi-objective optimisation algorithms, Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D), and use a Multi-objective Random Search (MRS) approach as a baseline. The three algorithms are applied to numerous test problems and showcase how sonification can reveal various aspects of the optimisation process that may not be obvious from visualisation alone.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the implementation of a novel evolvable hardware controller used in evolutionary robotics. The evolvable hardware consists of a Cartesian based array of logic blocks comprised of multiplexers and logic elements. The logic blocks are configured by a bit stream which is evolved using a genetic algorithm. A comparison is performed between an evolvable hardware and an artificial neural network controller evolved using the same genetic algorithm to produce the gait of a hexapod robot. To compare the two controllers, differences in their evolutionary efficiency and robot performance are investigated. The evolutionary efficiency is measured by the required number of generations to achieve an optimal fitness. An optimal hexapod controller allows the robot to walk forward in a straight line maintaining a constant heading and body attitude. It was found that the evolutionary efficiency and performance of the evolvable hardware and artificial neural network were similar, however the EHW was the most evolutionary efficient requiring less generations on average to evolve. Both evolved controllers were evaluated in simulation, and on a physical robot using a softcore processor and custom hardware implemented on a FPGA. The implementation showed that the controllers performed equally well when deployed, allowing the hexapod to meet the optimal gait criteria. These findings have shown that the evolvable hardware controller is a valid option for robotic control of a multilegged robot such as a hexapod as its evolutionary efficiency and deployed performance on a real robot is comparable to that of an artificial neural network. One future application of these evolvable controllers is in fault tolerance where the robot can dynamically adapt to a fault by evolving the controller to adjust to the fault conditions.},

In this article, hyperheuristic optimisation solutions via evolutionary optimisation of deep neural network topologies and genetic programming of machine learning pipelines will be investigated. Wavelet extractions from signals recorded during physical activities present a binary problem for detecting fall compensation. The earlier results show that a Gaussian process model achieves an accuracy of 86.48\%. Following this, artificial neural networks are evolved through evolutionary algorithms and score similarly to most standard models; the hyperparameters chosen are well outside the bounds of batch or manual searches. Five iterations of genetic programming scored higher than all other approaches, at a mean 90.52\% accuracy. The best pipeline extracted polynomial features and performed Principal Components Analysis, before machine learning through a randomised set of decision trees, and passing the class prediction probabilities to a 72-nearest-neighbour algorithm. The best genetic solution could infer data in 0.02 s, whereas the second best genetic programming solution (89.79\%) could infer data in only 0.3 ms.},

  abstract     = {Many of the stories we are exposed to are built from small schemas of connected events involving a set of characters–boy meets girl leads to a relationship or crime leads to revenge. The present paper proposes an evolutionary solution to the task of putting together a story by combining a set of such schemas. This approach presents three challenges: how to mix up the elements in the different schemas, how to instantiate the characters across the schemas and how to tell acceptable combinations from the rest. The present paper applies an evolutionary solution that relies on a genetic representation for these combinations of schemas, and applies as fitness functions a set of metrics on compatibility constraints across schema combinations. Outputs of this procedure are evaluated by human judges in comparison with baseline solutions in which the values for genes are assigned at random. The proposed solution generates a population of story drafts that resemble plot descriptions for simple stories. The results of the comparative evaluation by human judges are positive. The genetic representation of pattern combinations and the metrics on compatibility across pattern pairs provide a valid evolutionary solution for constructing simple plots.},
