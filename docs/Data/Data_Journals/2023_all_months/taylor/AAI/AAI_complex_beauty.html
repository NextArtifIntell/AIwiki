  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought unprecedented growth and productivity in every socioeconomic sector. AI adoption in education is transformational through reduced teacher workload, individualized learning, intelligent tutors, profiling and prediction, high-precision education, collaboration, and learner tracking. This paper highlights the trajectory of AI research in higher education (HE) through bibliometric analysis and topic modeling approaches. We used the PRISMA guidelines to select 304 articles published in the Scopus database between 2012 and 2021. VOSviewer was used for visualization and text-mining to identify hotspots in the field. Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis reveals distinct topics in the dynamic relationship between AI and HE. Only 9.6% of AI research in HE was achieved in the first seven years, with the last three years contributing 90.4%. China, the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom dominated publications. Four themes emerged – data as the catalyst, the development of AI, the adoption of AI in HE and emerging trends and the future of AI in HE. Topic modeling on the abstracts revealed the 10 most frequent topics and the top 30 most salient terms. This research contributes to the literature by synthesizing AI adoption opportunities in HE, topic modeling and future research areas.},

However, due to the multiple target points of warehouse inspection, the low efficiency of planning intelligent robot inspection paths is a problem that needs to be solved. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes an HPSO-ACO algorithm based on hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) to optimize the parameters of the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, and establishes a path optimization model for intelligent inspection robots in warehouse management. Compared with HPSO algorithm and ACO algorithm, the experimental results show that the proposed method has faster convergence speed, fewer iterations, and shorter optimal path under the same conditions, which provides a theoretical reference for path optimization for inspection robot.},

However, due to the large number of patrol target points, the automatic path planning of the patrol robot is difficult and inefficient. In order to solve this problem, the hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm is combined with A-star algorithm, and a path optimization method for inspection robot based on HPSO-A-star model is proposed. First, the grid model of the map is established, A-star algorithm calculates the path between two inspection points, and then HPSO algorithm realizes the nonlinear planning of the path according to the length of different paths, so as to find an optimal inspection route. The comparative experimental analysis results show that the path planned by HPSO algorithm is 5.71% shorter than that planned by PSO algorithm; the smaller the map grid size is, the shorter the calculated optimal path length is, but it will consume more computing resources. Finally, the HPSO-A-star algorithm is compared with the PSO-A-star algorithm; the experimental results show that the path of the HPSO-A-star algorithm is shortened by 29.79%, and the HPSO-A-star algorithm can better realize the path planning of the patrol robot.},

  abstract     = {Automated decision-making techniques play a crucial role in data science, AI, and general machine learning. However, such techniques need to balance accuracy with computational complexity, as their solution requirements are likely to need exhaustive analysis of the potentially numerous events combinations, which constitute the corresponding scenarios. Intuition is an essential tool in the identification of solutions to problems. More specifically, it can be used to identify, combine and discover knowledge in a “parallel” manner, and therefore more efficiently. As a consequence, the embedding of artificial intuition within data science is likely to provide novel ways to identify and process information. There is extensive research on this topic mainly based on qualitative approaches. However, due to the complexity of this field, limited quantitative models and implementations are available. In this article, the authors have extended the evaluation to include a real-world, multi-disciplinary area in order to provide a more comprehensive assessment. The results demonstrate the value of artificial intuition, when embedded in decision-making and information extraction models and frameworks. In fact, the output produced by the approach discussed in their article was compared with a similar task carried out by a group of experts in the field. This demonstrates comparable results further showing the potential of this framework, as well as artificial intuition as a tool for decision-making and information extraction.},

Scholars and research institutions at home and abroad have made a lot of research and achieved good results.

In article, an optimized design scheme for motion recognition research of dance video based on computer vision and image processing is proposed. The collected dance video is preprocessed, including grayscale, background subtraction and filter denoising, so as to extract the character features in the video image. Then, the method of self-organizing mapping neural network (SOM) in computer vision is used to realize the recognition of dance movements. Finally, the simulation test and analysis are carried out. The simulation results show that the proposed arithmetic has a certain accuracy, which is 9.34% higher than the traditional arithmetic. The research of motion recognition method based on dance video will also play a certain reference role for the research of human motion recognition in a large number of real and complex environments, and enrich the application field of motion recognition technology.},

  abstract     = {Whether a basketball player’s movements are standard or not is a key indicator to evaluate a basketball player and a key point for basketball player training. In order to improve the training effect of basketball players, effective and fast accurate recognition of basketball players’ action trajectories is crucial. In order to solve the problems of inadequate extraction of limb action features and loss of detail information due to multiple scales of limb action features caused by traditional recognition algorithms, an action trajectory recognition algorithm based on the improved EfficientDet-D0 is proposed. The algorithm firstly adds a spatial attention mechanism in the backbone network of EfficientDet-D0, where can locate the limb action trajectory features in the image more accurately. Secondly, in the feature fusion network, in order to describe the high-frequency detail information lost by downsampling, the idea of Laplace pyramid is used to fuse the detail feature maps in the top-down fusion path, and cross-level connections are added to make full use of the feature information of different resolutions, so that the acquired high-level feature map information is richer. Finally, the whole network is trained using the migration learning technique and Adam optimizer. The experimental results show that the model achieves a PCP value (percentage correct parts) of 95.6% on the upper limb pose dataset and takes only 5.34 s for 1000 tests. Compared with the traditional algorithm, it has a higher accuracy rate and stronger robustness, with strong practical applicability, realizing the effective and accurate recognition of basketball players’ upper limb action trajectories in real time.},

This manuscript focuses on investigating path planning problems using deep reinforcement learning and multi-sensing information fusion technology. The manuscript elaborates on the significance of path planning, providing comprehensive research encompassing path planning algorithms, deep reinforcement learning, and multi-sensing information fusion. Also, the fundamental theory of deep reinforcement learning is introduced, followed by the design of a multimodal perception module based on image and lidar. A semantic segmentation approach is employed to bridge the gap between simulated and real environments. To enhance strategy, a lightweight multimodal data fusion network model is carefully developed, incorporating modality separation learning. Overall, in this paper, we explore the use of a deep reinforcement learning architecture for conducting path planning experiments with mobile robots.

The national focus on mass entrepreneurship and innovation has shifted from quantitative to qualitative improvements, with greater attention being paid to improving substance rather than expanding scope. There is a growing trend among colleges to recognize innovation and entrepreneurial management as a significant achievement in college education and teaching. By prioritizing innovation and entrepreneurship management and professional education, the aim is to cultivate college students with an entrepreneurial spirit, and to develop inventive and entrepreneurial talent.

  abstract     = {Risk management is essential to every organization’s management plan. It is the strategy by which organizations handle the risks involved with their actions to profit or avoid making decisions that will cost them financially in each activity. Identifying and mitigating potential digital threats and developing and implementing procedures to significantly reduce the likelihood of an organization being targeted by cyberattacks are at the core of effective risk management. This is especially true regarding the risks associated with an organization’s digital footprint. A particularly significant threat to reputation, but also at the same time indirect and direct costs, is the data breach that occurs when a security incident occurs about the data for which the organization is responsible, which results in a violation of confidentiality, availability, or the integrity of the data it manages. On the other hand, the rapid development of technology has transformed the agricultural industry, allowing for large-scale farming based on machine learning and other advanced tools. However, this transformation also exposes farms to cyber risks that can lead to costly data breaches. In this study, we propose a framework for incorporating explainable machine learning (exML) techniques into large-scale farming to enhance cyber risk analysis, mitigate cyber threats, and foster a sustainable rural economy. Specifically, given that an organization needs to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to avoid possible data breaches, this work presents an analytical stochastic modeling of risk with a multi-criteria objective function of low complexity, a factor in an incentive system, to model investment value and cost balancing. The motivation behind the proposed method is to improve cybersecurity, protect data and reputation, foster a sustainable rural economy, leverage explainable machine learning, and adapt to the changing technological landscape. By addressing these motivations, the method aims to provide a comprehensive and effective approach to cyber risk analysis in large-scale farming.},

One of its key strengths lies in the social aspect, enabling people to connect and interact with friends, family, and even strangers in a virtual environment that mirrors real-world interactions. These interactions can take place through lifelike avatars, enabling individuals to engage in conversations, activities, and collaborations as if they were physically present. Furthermore, the metaverse empowers educational institutions to leverage its capabilities for immersive and interactive learning experiences. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and metaverse technologies, preschool education can be transformed into a secure and enriching environment for young learners. Machine learning algorithms can adapt and personalize educational content based on individual students’ needs and progress, ensuring a tailored and effective learning experience. Within the metaverse, preschoolers can explore virtual worlds, participate in interactive simulations, and engage in educational games designed to enhance their cognitive and social development. These experiences can be designed to align with educational frameworks and curricula, providing a structured and engaging learning environment. However, as the metaverse evolves and new features are introduced, it is vital to address potential cybersecurity concerns. The seamless integration of various technologies and the vast amount of user data being generated within the metaverse necessitate robust security measures.

  abstract     = {The rapid digital revolution in recent decades has resulted in an overwhelming amount of information, particularly in the realm of modern education systems and related materials. This phenomenon, often referred to as information overload, necessitates the development of educational systems that can effectively search, classify, and categorize this vast amount of available information. Of utmost importance for such educational information systems is the safeguarding of personal data, which refers to information that can identify an individual or their family. School records, for example, contain various types of personal data such as the individual’s name, address, contact details, disciplinary history, as well as their grades and progress checks. Even if individuals choose to make this data public, it remains inherently personal. Another category of data involves more sensitive topics such as student biometrics (e.g. fingerprints, photographs), religious beliefs, health information (e.g. allergies), or dietary restrictions, which may imply religious or health-related aspects. Processing data in this category can pose risks to individuals; hence, strict rules and appropriate consent are necessary to ensure their protection. To address these challenges, this research paper proposes a zero-knowledge proof intelligent recommendation system designed to protect students’ data privacy in the digital age. The proposed method incorporates an Intelligent Recommendation System (IRS) that utilizes an optimized version of the Matrix Factorization technique, calculated as an Eulerian Walk chart. Furthermore, the Schnorr Zero-Knowledge Proof format, based on the discrete logarithm problem, ensures the privacy of personal data during message exchange between educational entities.},

  abstract     = {The global tobacco industry has made significant strides in reducing the harmful emissions of tobacco by focusing on the development of non-burning cigarette products. Among these innovations, electrically heated noncombustible cigarette smoking sets have garnered attention. However, one of the challenges faced by these products is the reliance on empirical values for temperature control, resulting in subpar taste and low production rates. To address these issues, this research introduces an optimization strategy that utilizes advanced algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and traditional non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). By leveraging these algorithms, this study aims to optimize the performance of electrically heated noncombustible cigarette smoking sets. The research methodology encompasses a comprehensive review of relevant literature and the systematic introduction of a simulation method. Through the proposed approach, a finite element model verification is conducted, which demonstrates a minimal maximum relative error between the model values of the objective function and the simulation values of the optimized parameters. As a result, this multi-objective optimization approach proves to be highly effective in enhancing the performance of electromagnetic cigarette heaters. It not only addresses the taste and production rate issues associated with existing electrically heated noncombustible cigarette smoking sets but also provides a scientifically grounded method for optimizing these devices. This research paves the way for further advancements in the tobacco industry, contributing to the development of safer and more satisfying alternatives to traditional cigarettes.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the contour path of fused deposition 3D printing slices to mitigate the limitations of inefficiency and time consumption associated with the process. The proposed algorithm leverages the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) and an improved whale optimization algorithm to plan the printing order of each contour and optimize the network parameters, respectively. In particular, the algorithm transforms the running trajectory planning problem of the assembled tool head into a travel problem, which allows for a more efficient path planning approach. The HNN is then employed to determine the optimal path for each contour, with the network optimization process utilizing a nonlinear weight update method to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional HNN that is prone to generating invalid paths and falling into local optimality during operation. The network optimization process is designed to automatically adjust the link weights between neurons within a specific range, thereby ensuring that the network reaches the desired energy minima and outputs the optimal path for 3D printed slice contours. The proposed algorithm was tested in part printing experiments, and the results demonstrated a significant reduction in single-layer contour path lengths, printing times, and an enhancement in dimensional accuracy and surface quality of the printed parts compared to the traditional parallel scanning method. The proposed algorithm represents a significant contribution to the field of 3D printing, as it provides an efficient and effective approach for optimizing the contour path of fused deposition 3D printing slices. The findings of this study hold significant implications for improving the efficiency and quality of 3D printing and could potentially lead to further advancements in the field.},

  abstract     = {At a new historical crossroads, China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a major measure to coordinate sustained economic growth at home, maintain a peaceful and stable environment in the surrounding region, and foster regional economic and commercial cooperation in the region. The BRI, a major initiative, can not only drive national economic growth but also has far-reaching significance for promoting world economic prosperity and peace. The national plan clearly pointed out that in the face of the new international pattern and situation, China should improve its new opening-up system and promote construction for the BRI in the future. In this context, research on the benefits and security issues for foreign investment under the BRI has become an important topic. This work combines it with artificial intelligence to propose a neural network (IPSO-DBN) for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of Chinese outbound investment. First, this work applies DBN to evaluate the benefits and security for outbound investment under the BRI. This work introduces a policy of linearly decreasing weights and an adaptive learning factor into the PSO algorithm to construct IPSO. Then, the IPSO is utilized to optimize initial weights for DBN, and the problem of initial weights are random and easy to fall local optimal solution is improved to construct IPSO-DBN. Second, this work puts forward a series of suggestions for Chinese enterprises to invest abroad in response to the current investment problems under the BRI Third, this work has carried out various experiments on IPSO-DBN and Chinese enterprises’ foreign investment proposals, and the experimental results have verified the feasibility of the method designed in this work.},

The construction of a CBEC realizes the integration and utilization of resources between the CBEC trading platform as the core element and other components of the system, cross-border logistics, payment enterprises, suppliers, and demanders, and improves the overall economic benefits. A model of economic progress at the expense of the environment emerges in the radical development of companies that do not consider the environment and simply earn high incomes at the cost of consuming resources. In this context, it is of great theoretical and empirical importance to examine how to improve the production efficiency of the CBEC supply chain, improve ecological quality and realize the production mode of “low input, high output, and low pollution.” In this study, we evaluate the green development of the CBEC industry and study the factors that affect its efficiency level.

  abstract     = {The urgent and indispensable requirement for secure and efficient remote work compels organizations to reconsider their approach to safeguarding themselves against cyber threats. The shift toward remote work amplifies the need to redirect more network traffic toward cloud-based applications rather than relying solely on the internal network. The growing adoption of the hybrid work model necessitates system administrators to increasingly provide access to applications and services beyond the conventional boundaries of enterprise networks. Ensuring privacy goes beyond mere compliance with regulations; it is crucial for demonstrating transparency and accountability, which are essential in building trust with stakeholders. Employing a zero-trust approach can proactively enhance privacy by implementing access controls based on the principle of least privilege and predefined purposes. Such an approach helps to limit potential damages and enhances the resilience of complex information systems. This work proposes an innovative privacy-preserving and zero-trust computational intelligent hybrid system. Building upon the zero-trust architecture, this system ensures a protected environment while preserving privacy. It achieves this by employing multi-level trust fields within a corporate network, where every access request undergoes comprehensive authentication, authorization, and encryption before being granted access. The system’s efficacy is validated within a sports training application environment, with stringent authorization requirements and the corresponding need to safeguard personal privacy. By implementing the proposed system, the application environment can effectively mitigate privacy risks while providing secure access only to authorized individuals. The hybrid system’s computational intelligence further enhances its ability to adapt to evolving threats and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. In summary, the current landscape of remote work necessitates organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and privacy. By embracing a zero-trust approach and implementing the privacy-preserving and zero-trust computational intelligent hybrid system, organizations can ensure robust protection, maintain privacy compliance, and establish a trusted foundation for remote work environments.},

  abstract     = {Computer technology has had a significant impact on the field of education, and its use in classrooms has facilitated the spread of knowledge and has helped students become well-rounded citizens. However, as the number of users accessing wireless networks for computer-based learning continues to grow, the scarcity of spectrum resources has become more apparent, which makes it crucial to find intelligent methods to improve spectrum utilization in wireless networks. Dynamic spectrum access is a critical technology in wireless networks, and it primarily focuses on how users can efficiently access licensed spectrum in a dynamic environment. This technology is a crucial means to tackle the problem of spectrum scarcity and low spectrum utilization. This work proposes a novel approach to address the issue of dynamic channel access optimization in wireless networks and investigates the dynamic resource optimization problem with deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed approach focuses on the optimization of dynamic multi-channel access under multi-user scenarios and considers the collision and interference caused by multiple users accessing a channel simultaneously. Each user selects a channel to access and transmit data, and the network aims to develop a multi-user strategy that maximizes network benefits without requiring online coordination or information exchange between users. What makes this work unique is its utilization of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that keeps an internal state and combines observations over events. This approach allows the network to utilize the history of processes to estimate the true state, providing valuable insights into how deep reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to optimize dynamic channel access in wireless networks. The work’s contribution lies in demonstrating that this approach is an effective means to solve the dynamic resource optimization problem, enabling the development of a multi-user strategy that maximizes network benefits. This approach is particularly valuable as it does not require online coordination or information exchange between users, which can be challenging in real-world scenarios. The proposed approach presents an important contribution to the field of dynamic spectrum access and wireless network optimization. As the demand for computer-based learning continues to increase, the use of intelligent methods to improve spectrum utilization in wireless networks will become even more critical. The findings of this work could have significant implications for the future of computer-based learning and education, enabling more efficient use of wireless networks and the creation of well-rounded citizens.},

In this paper, a novel working shaft speed control method for complex hydraulic drive system is proposed. First, a mathematical model of the operation of the working shaft and related components is established, and the fuzzy PID controller is designed to regulate the working shaft speed of the complex hydraulic drive system based on fuzzy rules. A whale optimization algorithm improved by intuitionistic fuzzy entropy is proposed to optimize the parameters of fuzzy PID controller in light of the possibility that the selection of parameters of fuzzy PID controller will have an impact on the final control effect. By applying an improved fuzzy PID controller to fit working shaft speed of three complex hydraulic drive system, the control performance of the controller is evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate that the tracking accuracy and immediate efficiency of the proposed method for working shaft speed control of the complex hydraulic drive systems are significantly better than those of the fuzzy PID controller and the fuzzy PID controller optimized with the unimproved whale optimization algorithm, proving the proposed method has strong engineering practical application capacity and can more effectively fulfill the working shaft speed control needs of the complex hydraulic drive system.},

The detection of abnormal behavior of drivers is important to improve safety in public transportation. The anomaly measurement is not only determined by objective rules such as laws, but also distinguished due to the biological characteristics. The same driving behavior may present completely opposite judgment results for different categories of drivers. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method that measures the preference path length of drivers for various driving operations via pheromones, and identifies abnormal driving behavior by calculating the cumulative conversion probability of operation switching. An improved ant colony algorithm based on fixed point simplicial theory is proposed to improve the convergence efficiency by optimizing the initial population state. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect abnormal driving behavior and significantly reduce false alarms.},

  abstract     = {The phenomenon of economic globalization has led to a greater intermingling of economy and culture, which has brought about new demands for innovative talent cultivation in universities. To meet these demands, universities need to cultivate more students with high language ability who are capable of communicating and exchanging ideas between different cultures. This requires universities to innovate their language cultivation programs and improve students’ language ability and cultural literacy. The cultivation of international language ability, particularly in English language and literature, plays a vital role in enhancing students’ comprehensive language literacy. However, traditional teaching methods have been found to be less effective in achieving desired learning outcomes. As such, there is a need to adopt more innovative teaching methods that stimulate students’ interest in learning and facilitate their experience of English language and literature in authentic cultural contexts. One promising approach to achieve these objectives is through the integration of smart classroom teaching and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This approach offers a range of benefits, including personalized learning experiences, real-time feedback, and interactive engagement. Furthermore, the application of AI technology can assist teachers in guiding students to experience the cultural background of English language and literature in English situations, helping students to exercise their English language application skills. This paper proposes a method and application assessment for designing a smart classroom for English language and literature based on AI technology. The primary aim of this approach is to help students become familiar with the English context and cultural background, thereby improving their overall language proficiency. The proposed approach seeks to facilitate a more engaging and effective learning experience for students, allowing them to develop their language skills and cultural literacy in a meaningful and impactful way.},

This paper studies basketball teaching in colleges and universities based on the applied explainable association rule algorithm and cluster analysis. It is concluded that the p value of positioning shooting in the basic basketball technology test between the experimental class and the control class before the experiment is 0.883, which is greater than 0.06, indicating that there is no significant difference between the experimental class and the control class before the experiment. The p value of round-trip straight dribble in the whole field is 0.735, which is greater than 0.07, indicating that there is no significant difference between the experimental class and the control class before the experiment. This teaching mode plays a significant role in cultivating beginners’ learning interest and enthusiasm, preliminarily mastering movement skills and establishing solid technical concepts. With the complex emotional experience of the association rule algorithm, it is of great significance for teachers to grasp students’ various emotional experiences in learning, cultivate students’ team consciousness by cluster analysis, guide and dredge their negative emotions, and develop students’ sense of cooperation, team spirit and democratic spirit, personal responsibility and personality.},

  abstract     = {Since all information depends solely on the training data, machine learning algorithms typically do not employ external knowledge or other experiences during the learning process. Methods for machine learning have been rigorously tested against novel varieties of highly technical “black box” or “white box” adversarial attacks. By employing attacks, attackers can change systems to serve a harmful end goal. When authorized implementers and eavesdroppers are geographically close together, it is difficult to perform secure beamforming in waveform applications, for instance, leading to erroneous beam forms and, as a result, disastrous beam leakages. As a result, the first move in a prospective black-box offense will be based on the waveform features of a learning signal. By including a non-orthogonality concept into the physical layer signal waveform, the Waveforms Eavesdropping Prevention Framework (WEPF) proposed in this work aims to boost machine learning security to address these difficulties. The implementation scenario is based on a waveforms scenario used to categorize the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) for insects, a crucial tool for researching the feeding conduct of piercing-sucking insects and the transition mechanism between viruses and insects. An attribute vector with six dimensions, consisting of low-frequency wavelet energy (LFWE) in the second and third layers of the Wavelet Kernel Extreme Learning Machine, fractal box dimension (FBD), the Hurst exponent (HE), and spectral centroid (SC) in the first two layers of the HHT, was used to test the proposed framework. Two adversarial scenarios were explored. However, the suggested architecture secures all waveform signals, demonstrating the method’s effectiveness in lowering the risk of eavesdropping or tampering with the waveforms used in advanced machine-learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Neural machine translation (NMT) is applied to generate a more reliable and accurate translation practice as the most cutting-edge technology. In recent years, NMT has achieved gratifying results. However, the main obstacle for market-oriented NMT application systems appears to suffer from weak translation quality that fails to meet users’ needs. This paper focuses on the machine translation of political documents and implements six dominant NMT application systems in the market to evaluate their translation quality. The evaluation process further employs both BLEU and NIST technical evaluation algorithms and re-verifies the results with the manual evaluation method called the “Score Ranking System” to compare the performances of the six NMTs in Chinese-English translations of political documents. Through diagnosis and evaluation of the problems and errors in NMTs, the paper eventually proposes the “Cue Lexicon+” model to remedy prominent problems. Besides, the “NMT+ Lexicon Intelligent Translation Assistant” soft is developed and the “Cue Lexicon+” is integrated into the NMT application systems to further improve the translation quality, providing a reference and research basis to increase the performance and update the NMT application systems.},

  abstract     = {The development of society is greatly influenced by the physical strength of its individuals. As heirs of social construction, college students play a crucial role in national progress, and their physical health is an essential component of their well-being. However, the increasing competition for talent in today’s rapidly advancing world has led to significant pressure on college students in various aspects of their lives. Despite the importance of physical exercise, students often lack the time and knowledge to engage in appropriate exercise programs that suit their individual needs. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved K-means algorithm for the classification of college students’ physical health data. The traditional K-means algorithm is known to be sensitive to noisy data, and thus, we introduce a variance-like weighting mechanism to improve its clustering accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm can quickly and accurately cluster physical health data to provide a classification of each student’s physical fitness. By using the physical classification of each student, we can recommend more suitable exercise programs to prioritize physical health management. This study highlights the significance of physical health in college students and encourages education departments to improve the efficiency of physical health management.},

We propose an automatic recognition and classification algorithm for music spectra, which takes into account emotional cues that can be extracted from music to improve classification accuracy. To achieve this goal, we set different weight coefficients, which are continuously adjusted based on the convergence process of the previous iteration. The size of each weighting coefficient is adaptively controlled to reduce the number of iterations of the reconstruction process, thereby reducing the algorithm’s computational complexity and speeding up its convergence. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the automatic classification method of music genres, which integrates emotion and intelligent algorithms, can significantly improve the accuracy of automatic music genre classification. Moreover, our approach reduces the algorithm’s computational complexity, resulting in a faster convergence speed. Our proposed approach provides a promising solution for automatic music genre classification that takes into account emotional cues. The integration of emotion and intelligent algorithms can help achieve higher accuracy and reduce computational complexity, making the proposed method applicable in various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {It is true that with society entering a new era, the pressure of competition for employment of college students is increasing, and society has higher requirements for the quality of high-tech talents, which can result in mental health issues for college students. Therefore, focusing on psychological education for college students and improving their psychological quality is essential. The analysis and countermeasure research on psychological characteristics has become crucial in this context. To address this issue, this work proposes an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) Deep Belief Network (DBN) method to analyze the psychological characteristics of college students. The proposed method first uses DBN to analyze the psychological characteristics of college students. Secondly, the learning factors and inertia weights in PSO are dynamically adjusted to construct IPSO to address the problem of slow overall convergence speed caused by the initial randomization of weights in the DBN training process. IPSO is then combined with DBN to adjust the initial weights for DBN training. This work also proposes a series of countermeasures from different aspects to strengthen mental health education for college students. The validity of IPSO-DBN for college students’ psychological characteristics analysis is verified through comprehensive and systematic experiments, and the feasibility of college students’ mental health education countermeasures is confirmed via comparison. Overall, this work provides an innovative and effective approach for analyzing college students’ psychological characteristics and developing countermeasures to improve their mental health. It shows the potential of combining artificial intelligence with psychological education and highlights the importance of strengthening psychological health education for college students.},

  abstract     = {The finite volume neural network (FINN) is an exception among recent physics-aware neural network models as it allows the specification of arbitrary boundary conditions (BCs). FINN can generalize and adapt to various prescribed BC values not provided during training, where other models fail. However, FINN depends explicitly on given BC values and cannot deal with unobserved parts within the physical domain. To overcome these limitations, we extend FINN in two ways. First, we integrate the capability to infer BC values on-the-fly from just a few data points. This allows us to apply FINN in situations, where the BC values, such as the inflow rate of fluid into a simulated medium, are unknown. Second, we extend FINN to plausibly reconstruct missing data within the physical domain via a gradient-driven spin-up phase. Our experiments validate that FINN reliably infers correct BCs, but also generates smooth and plausible full-domain reconstructions that are consistent with the observable data. Moreover, FINN can generate precise predictions orders of magnitude more accurate compared to competitive pure ML and physics-aware ML models – even when the physical domain is only partially visible, and the BCs are applied at a point that is spatially distant from the observable volumes.},

  abstract     = {Providing personalized recommendation service for users and improving the accuracy of recommendation and user satisfaction are the main research tasks of current travel recommendation systems. The intelligent recommendation model of tourist places requires the algorithm to be able to accurately recommend tourist attractions according to the user’s interests. Big data and artificial intelligence technologies have driven the development of intelligent recommendation systems. However, realistic data are often sparse, and the lack of common rating items among users makes some traditional similarity measures impossible to calculate. In addition, traditional collaborative filtering algorithms ignore the issue of user preferences, which can cause a decrease in recommendation accuracy. To address these issues, this paper analyzes the factors affecting users’ interest preferences in terms of their global and local rating information. The interest preferences of users are calculated by computing the probability distribution of user rating information globally and using Hamming approach degree. A similarity algorithm about user preferences is derived using Jeffries-Matusita distance. The similarity algorithm is effectively combined with the traditional similarity algorithm to propose a model of collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm for tourist attractions based on user preferences under sparse data. The paper aims to improve the accuracy of tourist attraction recommendation systems by incorporating user preferences and addressing the issue of sparse data and the lack of common rating items among users that traditional similarity measures cannot calculate. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm model outperforms the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm and other algorithms. And it also has high accuracy rate on more sparse tourism data set.},

Moreover, this paper improves the operation effect of the teaching system, increases the calculation speed, and adopts the NR method for algorithm-sensitive faults to ensure the reliability of the power flow results. The proposed teaching system was tested in a simulated teaching environment to evaluate its effectiveness.

  abstract     = {Translation as a bridge between different cultures has received significant attention in recent years, especially with the rise of globalization and the increasing communication between nations. Translation has become a crucial tool for connecting people, promoting cross-cultural understanding, and facilitating international trade, academic exchange, and outbound tourism. With the advancement of information technology, research on improving English translation algorithms has become a hot topic. This is due to the complexities and variability of language, where words can have different meanings in different contexts. To address the issue of semantic coherence in current English translation proofreading systems, this paper proposes a semantic ontology translation model that utilizes fuzzy mapping to translate English and selects the most semantically appropriate translation using a decision function. The contributions of this research are twofold. Firstly, it provides a new approach to English translation proofreading by incorporating semantic ontology and fuzzy mapping. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through the improved efficiency and accuracy of English proofreading. The key findings of this study show that the proposed semantic ontology translation model can significantly improve the semantic coherence of English translation proofreading. This makes this article different from other studies by offering a unique solution to the problem of semantic coherence in English translation proofreading.},

However, many existing studies often learn the final embedded representation of items and users through IDs of user and item, which cannot make well explanation why user choose the item. By making good use of item’s attribute, the networks will gain better interpretability. In this article, we construct a heterogeneous tripartite graph consisting of user-item-feature, and propose the attention interaction graph convolutional neural network recommendation algorithm (ATGCN). We embed multi-feature fusion of users and items into the user feature interaction layer by using multi-head-attention, which explore the user’s potential preference to update the user’s embedded representation. Through the neighborhood aggregation of graph convolution, the feature neighbors’ aggregation of items is constructed to achieve higher-order feature fusions, and the neighborhood aggregation of users and items is carried out on the historical interaction information. Then, the final embedding vector representations of user and item are obtained after many iterations. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on three publicly available datasets and ATGCN has improved 1.59%, 2.03%, and 1.27% in normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), Precision and Recall, respectively.},

With the rapid development of new technologies such as knowledge economy and big data, the traditional human resource performance appraisal model had certain limitations and was not objective, which had been difficult to adapt to the increasingly highly integrated development needs of modern enterprises. Therefore, this paper used big data analysis and new technical means to put forward the study of human resource performance evaluation model based on Bayesian network, aiming to provide some theoretical reference for modern enterprise human resource management. First of all, it summarized the related concepts of performance appraisal and its important position in enterprise management, analyzed the characteristics of human resources performance appraisal indicators and their mutual relations, and expounded the common methods and characteristics needed to build a performance appraisal system. Secondly, it summarized the relevant theory of Bayesian network and its advantages in solving complex random problems, and proposed a performance appraisal model based on Bayesian network for the needs of enterprise human resources management. Finally, the balanced scorecard method was used to build a performance appraisal system, and the performance appraisal model proposed in this paper was tested by experiments, and compared with the traditional method. The results showed that the performance appraisal model proposed in this paper had significant advantages and could be better applied to the performance appraisal management of enterprise human resources. The research of this paper can not only provide theoretical guidance for further research on enterprise human resource allocation and management, but also provide reference for performance appraisal in other fields.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world scenarios, data are provided as a potentially infinite stream of samples that are subject to changes in the underlying data distribution, a phenomenon often referred to as concept drift. A specific facet of concept drift is feature drift, where the relevance of a feature to the problem at hand changes over time. High-dimensionality of the data poses an additional challenge to learning algorithms operating in such environments. Common scenarios of this nature can for example be found in sensor-based maintenance operations of industrial machines or inside entire networks, such as power grids or water distribution systems. However, since most existing methods for incremental learning focus on classification tasks, efficient online learning for regression is still an underdeveloped area. In this work, we introduce an extension to the SAM-kNN Regressor that incorporates metric learning in order to improve the prediction quality on data streams, gain insights into the relevance of different input features and based on that, transform the input data into a lower dimension in order to improve computational complexity and suitability for high-dimensional data. We evaluate our proposed method on artificial data, to demonstrate its applicability in various scenarios. In addition to that, we apply the method to the real-world problem of water distribution network monitoring. Specifically, we demonstrate that sensor faults in the water distribution network can be detected by monitoring the feature relevances computed by our algorithm.},

The study proposes the concepts of punctum and studium image based on semiology and uses an interpretable moderated mediation model to examine the effects of punctum image, studium image, flow experience, and human interaction on behavioral intention. The proposed research collected data from 440 tourists who visited a destination and used a structural equation model to analyze the relationships among the variables. The study employed bootstrapping to test the significance of the mediating effects and conducted a moderated mediation analysis to examine the moderating role of human interaction. The findings of the study indicate that punctum image has a positive effect on studium image and behavioral intention. Studium image is found to mediate the relationship between punctum image and behavioral intention. Additionally, the study shows that there are multiple mediations of studium image and flow experience between punctum image and behavioral intention. Finally, the study finds that human interaction plays a moderating role in two of the mediating effects. The results of this research have important theoretical and managerial implications. The study highlights the importance of punctum image in destination branding and suggests that destinations should focus on creating memorable and distinctive images to attract tourists. The study also emphasizes the role of studium image and flow experience in shaping tourists’ behavioral intentions, which could help destinations to design more effective marketing strategies. Finally, the study underscores the importance of human interaction in shaping tourists’ experiences and suggests that destinations should focus on providing high-quality human interactions to enhance tourists’ experiences and satisfaction.

  abstract     = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) offer improved efficiency and convenience through innovative embedded devices. However, the development of these technologies has often neglected security measures, leading to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Conceding that a CAV system is compromised, it can result in unsafe driving conditions and pose a threat to human safety. Prioritizing both security measures and functional enhancements on development of CAVs is essential to ensure their safety and reliability and enhance consumer trust in the technology. CAVs use artificial intelligence to control their driving behavior, which can be easily influenced by small changes in the model that can significantly impact and potentially mislead the system. To address this issue, this study proposed a defense mechanism that uses an autoencoder and a compressive memory module to store normal image features and prevent unexpected generalization on adversarial inputs. The proposed solution was studied against Hijacking, Vanishing, Fabrication, and Mislabeling attacks using FGSM and AdvGAN against the Nvidia Dave-2 driving model, and was found to be effective, with success rates of 93.8 % and 91.2 % in a Whitebox setup, and 74.1 % and 64.4 % in a Blackbox setup for FGSM and AdvGAN, respectively.

  abstract     = {Target variant detection has been challenging for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and the performance of the target variant recognition needs to be further enhanced. SAR images are widely used in the field of target recognition and are important to support reconnaissance operations. This paper proposes a novel research approach to improve the efficiency of target recognition. First, the theory surrounding sparse representation and dictionary learning is presented. Secondly, a SAR image target recognition model is constructed according to the theory. Meanwhile, a dynamic joint sparse representation model is proposed based on multi-information and applied to SAR image target recognition when sparse representation is under consideration. Finally, experiments are set up to validate the proposed model. The results are presented as follows: 1. the recognition rate range of the sample SAR image target is 0.811–0.995 and 0.867–0.990, respectively, when the two cases, without registration processing and with registration processing, utilize the recognition method of dictionary learning and sparse representation. 2. with the increase in dictionary size, the average recognition rate of SAR images based on multi-information dynamic joint sparse representation also increases under the conditions of no logarithm transformation and median filtering and after logarithm transformation and median filtering are run. Then, the average recognition rate range is 0.63–0.9 and 0.65–0.96, respectively. Thus, the recognition rate is improved by 5%-10%. 3. the recognition approach based on the sparse representation of multi-information dynamic joint has distinct sparse degrees of SAR image recognition in the case of logarithmic transformation and median filtering when the sample image has been registered and not been registered. The relative average recognition rates were 0.950–0.970 and 0.955–0.977, respectively. The key contribution of the research is to offer a workable solution to the issues plaguing SAR target variant recognition and to improve the significant limitations in the state-of-the-art literature thoroughly.},

  abstract     = {Seed orientation is an important factor in high-speed automatic seeders used for sowing crops such as garlic cloves and corn kernels. However, obtaining accurate seed orientation angles can be challenging due to high-frequency noise points and false top features in seed images, which can negatively impact the orientation effect. In this paper, we introduce a directional adjustment method based on the polar radius distribution map to address this issue. Our method involves two main steps. Firstly, we use the morphological opening operation to process speckles and some seed apex parts and use the region marker to obtain the original polar radius distribution curve signal. Secondly, we use the wavelet packet transform to analyze the original polar radius distribution curve signal, which yields a direction rotation angle after analysis and calculation and enables the determination of seed orientation. Our experimental results show that our method can better identify the germination location at the top of the seed, and the calculated rotation angle is more conducive to seed direction adjustment than the rotation angle directly determined by the maximum polar radius in the polar radius vector. This is due to the advantage of higher frequency resolution of wavelet packet analysis, which enables us to obtain a polar radius distribution curve signal with low noise, better smoothness, and more realistic reflection of the edge characteristics of the seed contour boundary. The proposed method provides an effective solution for accurately adjusting the orientation of garlic cloves and corn kernels and potentially other crops that require automation technology. Our key finding is that using the polar radius distribution map and wavelet packet transform can yield better results in seed orientation adjustment, by removing high-frequency noise points and false top features and improving the accuracy of seed rotation angle calculation.},

The concept of adaptation refers to the implementation of settings in a digital learning environment based on the diversity of students’ characteristics and needs, adopting a highly reasoning educational design, based on which the system adapts the form and content of children’s literature lessons. To implement the adaptation in a modern learning environment, this work proposes the design of a High Reasoning Intelligent Library System that provides personalized support for children’s literature at an individual or group level, taking into account their unique characteristics, their evolution during their studies, but also to provide them with the possibility of involvement in the educational process. The proposed approach is a mathematical model expressed in mathematical equations and explanations. Mathematical models make it easier and cheaper to consider more system states than would likely be possible with actual experimental models. The proposed method uses intuitive disambiguation and fuzzy indexes to integrate the educational material based on its optimal adaptation in each case.},

  abstract     = {Taekwondo is a martial art emphasizing defense, protection, and moral and spiritual values. Evaluating the effectiveness and quality of Taekwondo sports training is a complex task that requires the consideration of various factors, such as the learners’ skills, physical condition, and psychological state. Traditional methods for evaluating sports training effectiveness and quality have limitations, such as being subjective, time-consuming, and not considering individual differences. This paper proposes a new approach to evaluating the effectiveness and quality of Taekwondo sports training using optimization algorithms. Specifically, three optimization algorithms, TLBO, DSLTLBO, and GWO, are compared and analyzed for their suitability at different levels. These algorithms can automatically adjust the sports training plan based on individual differences and learner feedback, which can address the limitations of traditional evaluation methods. Validity statistics and moral/spiritual level assessment are used to evaluate the training results and process quality. The results indicate that different optimization algorithms are appropriate for learners at different levels. Diversified algorithm forms are recommended for a comprehensive evaluation of the sports plan. This paper provides insights into optimizing Taekwondo sports training and highlights the importance of cultivating moral and spiritual values through this martial art. The proposed approach can potentially improve the effectiveness and quality of Taekwondo sports training and can be extended to other sports or physical activities.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis aims to attain the sentiment polarity of the text, which is a coarse-grained approach and does not focus on the targets . On the other hand, an aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has recently gained boosting interest. The ABSA is a fine-grained sentiment assignment to determine the sentiment tendency toward a specific aspect. Most previous methods employ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) coupled with attention mechanisms to accomplish this task. However, such RNN-based models tend to be complex and require much training. Recently, a growing number of BERT-style models have been emerging and presenting better results in ABSA tasks . Nevertheless, these methods cannot well distinguish the various logical relationships between aspects that exist in the data and thus do not model the relationship between aspects. In the manuscript, a prompt-enhanced sentiment analysis (PESA) is proposed. Hence, a novel and efficient approach could retrieve the training set that is most similar to the input text and represents the mutual information between aspects by utilizing the [MASK] token. Moreover, the proposed model only needs to forward once if a sentiment analysis of multiple aspects is required in the inference stage. The language representation model BERT is employed to boost the performance of the proposed method. Comprehensive experiments and conducted analysis indicate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.},

This study examines the moral hazard game model of concealed behaviors of instructors with overconfidence in four risk preference combinations based on fair fundamental assumptions and comparisons with rational teachers with the same risk preference. In addition, this research formulates the ideal incentive contract for each circumstance. It creates a model of the assessment system of college professors’ morality in conjunction with their real teaching environment. In addition, the simulation model is used to assess the influence of the assessment system on the morality of college instructors. The experimental investigation indicates that the assessment technique of college professors’ morality presented in this work, taking intelligent emotion detection and data mining algorithm into account, has some influence. The model and data mining algorithm are applied to evaluate college teachers’ morality, the method effect is statistically evaluated, and the results showing the superiority of the proposed method are obtained.},

However, working out harmony is not a simple task. It requires knowledge, experience, and an intense study of music theory, which takes time to reach good skills. Thus, systems capable of automatically harmonizing melodies are beneficial for experienced and novice musicians. In this paper, a comparative study between distinct architectures and ensembles of Artificial Neural Networks was proposed to solve the problem of musical harmonization, seeking consistent results with rules of music theory: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function network (RBF), Echo State Network (ESN), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). For this, a processed and defined melody with symbolic musical data serves as input to the system, having been trained from a musical database that contains melody and harmony. The output is the chord sequence to be applied to the melody. The results were analyzed with quantitative measures and the ability to melody adaptation. The performances were favorable to the MLP, which could generate harmonies according to the objectives.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, analysis dictionary learning (ADL) model has attracted much attention from researchers, owing to its scalability and efficiency in representation-based classification. Despite the supervised label information embedding, the classification performance of analysis representation suffers from the redundant and noisy samples in real-world datasets. In this paper, we propose a joint Dual-Structural constrained and Non-negative Analysis Representation (DSNAR) learning model. First, the supervised latent structural transformation term is considered implicitly to generate a roughly block diagonal representation for intra-class samples. However, this discriminative structure is fragile and weak in the presence of noisy and redundant samples. To highlight both intra-class similarity and inter-class separation for class-oriented representation, we then explicitly incorporate an off-block suppressing term on the ADL model, together with a non-negative representation constraint, to achieve a well-structured and meaningful interpretation of the contributions from all class-oriented atoms. Moreover, a robust classification scheme in latent space is proposed to avoid accidental incorrect predictions with noisy information. Finally, the DSNAR model is alternatively solved by the K-SVD method, iterative re-weighted method and gradient method efficiently. Extensive classification results on five benchmark datasets validate the performance superiority of our DSNAR model compared to other state-of-the-art DL models.},

Only occasionally, a learning infant would receive a matching verbal description of an action it is committing, which is similar to supervised learning. Such a learning mechanism can be mimicked with deep learning. We model this weakly supervised learning paradigm using our Paired Gated Autoencoders (PGAE) model, which combines an action and a language autoencoder. After observing a performance drop when reducing the proportion of supervised training, we introduce the Paired Transformed Autoencoders (PTAE) model, using Transformer-based crossmodal attention. PTAE achieves significantly higher accuracy in language-to-action and action-to-language translations, particularly in realistic but difficult cases when only few supervised training samples are available. We also test whether the trained model behaves realistically with conflicting multimodal input. In accordance with the concept of incongruence in psychology, conflict deteriorates the model output. Conflicting action input has a more severe impact than conflicting language input, and more conflicting features lead to larger interference. PTAE can be trained on mostly unlabeled data where labeled data is scarce, and it behaves plausibly when tested with incongruent input.},

  abstract     = {Reversible lanes play an important role in alleviating urban traffic congestion and improving the utilization of road resources. However, most of the reversible lanes currently implemented are timed and fixed, and there is little research on the safety of reversible lanes without isolation facilities. In view of the existing problems of reversible lanes, this paper proposed a real-time dynamic reversible lane safety control model. The influencing factors of reversible lane safety control are analyzed first, and then determine model parameters of the no-entry zone and the buffer zone in the conflict area. Moreover, model parameters of emptying, exit, and recovery zones in the operation process were determined as well. Additionally, this paper discussed the length of reversible lanes and the timing of signals. The surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM) is adopted to analyze vehicle trajectory data for traffic simulation under different traffic flows. The experiment results show that the proposed reversible lane safety control scheme can keep the vehicle’s traffic conflict rate below 5%, which can effectively ensure the safe operation of the reversible lane.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is present everywhere in the lives of individuals. Unfortunately, several cases of discrimination by AI systems have already been reported. Scholars have warned on risks of AI reproducing existing inequalities or even amplifying them. To tackle these risks and promote responsible AI, many ethics guidelines for AI have emerged recently, including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) principles and practices. However, little is known about the DEI content of these guidelines, and to what extent they meet the most relevant accumulated knowledge from DEI literature. We performed a semi-systematic literature review of the AI guidelines regarding DEI stakes and analyzed 46 guidelines published from 2015 to today. We fleshed out the 14 DEI principles and the 18 DEI practices recommended underlying these 46 guidelines. We found that the guidelines mostly encourage one of the DEI management paradigms, namely fairness, justice, and nondiscrimination, in a limited compliance approach. We found that narrow technical practices are favored over holistic ones. Finally, we conclude that recommended practices for implementing DEI principles in AI should include actions aimed at directly influencing AI actors’ behaviors and awareness of DEI risks, rather than just stating intentions and programs.},

  abstract     = {In today’s world, agriculture is one of the most important assets as it affects the economy of the country. Biotic stress caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses is common in plants; hence plant disease recognition is essential as it could identify diseases at the early stages of infection. Most of the previous plant disease works involve PlantVillage dataset, which is taken in a controlled environment. In this paper, the Banana leaf dataset is used which is combined from two datasets. CNNs are becoming more popular in many forms, such as pre-trained models, and in this research, we employed a pre-trained model in conjunction with an ML classifier to predict plant disease. Pre-trained models such as VGG 16, RESNET, MobileNet, InceptionResNetV2, Inception, and Xception models were deployed for feature extraction. Based on the above models, the proposed Xception-RF model achieved 100% accuracy with no misclassified classes. Using an Xception model with depth-wise convolutions reduces the number of parameters and the cost of implementation. The proposed work merges machine learning and deep learning by extracting features using CNN and then using ML-based RF for classification, which has resulted in an increase in performance in terms of accuracy.},

The public requirements for residential safety and convenience are also increasing. Meanwhile, with the improvement of indigenous medical technology and quality of life, people’s average lifespan is gradually increasing. However, countries around the world are facing the problem of aging societies. Hand gesture recognition is gaining popularity in the fields of gesture control, robotics, or medical applications. Therefore, how to create a convenient and smart control system of home appliances for the elderly or the disabled has become the objective of this study. It aims to use Google MediaPipe to develop a hand tracking system, which detected 21 key points of a hand through the camera lens of a mobile device and used a vector formula to calculate the angle of the intersection of two lines based on four key points. After the angle of bending finger is obtained, users’ hand gesture can be recognized. Our experiments have confirmed that the recognition precision and recall values of hand gesture for numbers 0–9 reached 98.80% and 97.67%, respectively; and the recognition results were used to control home appliances through the low-cost IoT-Enabled system.},

Although current transfer-learning-based detection methods outperform meta-learning-based methods, their data organization fails to fully utilize the diversity of the source domain data. In view of this, Data Resampling (DR) organization is proposed to fine-tune the network, which can be employed as a component of any model and dataset without additional inference overhead. In addition, in order to improve the generalization of the model, a Cross-Iteration Metric-Learning (CIML) branch is embedded in the few-shot object detector, thus actively improving intra-category feature propinquity and inter-category feature discrimination. Our generic DR-CIML approach obtained competitive scores in extensive comparative experiments. The nAP50 performance on PASCAL VOC improved by up to 6.3 points, and the bAP50 performance reached 81.0, surpassing the base stage model (80.8) for the first time. The nAP75 performance on MS COCO improved by up to 1.6 points.},

In the CatBoost-DF, a cascading strategy is introduced to strengthen the association between each layer of CatBoost. To verify the accuracy and robustness of CatBoost-DF, experiments collected physiological and environmental data from hundreds of subjects with the help of sensor devices and questionnaires. Compared with existing state-of-the-art machine learning methods, CatBoost-DF shows significant superiority, with a prediction accuracy of 90%, which is 4%-39% higher than other models. Moreover, the study explored the effects of seasonal and gender factors on thermal sensation. Result shown that different seasons have different thermal sensation for males and females.

Machine learning and deep learning trends have emerged as important innovations in this field. We propose to utilize crop, weather, and soil data from agricultural datasets to evaluate yield prediction behavior. Paddy being a staple food crop in India is chosen for this research. In this paper, we propose hybrid architecture for paddy yield prediction, namely, MLR-LSTM, which combines Multiple Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory to utilize their complementary nature. The results are compared with traditional machine learning methods such as Support vector machine, Long short-term memory and Random forest method. Evaluation metrics such as Coefficient of Determination (R 2 ), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), F1 score, Recall, and Precision are used to evaluate the hybrid method and traditional models. The results obtained from the proposed hybrid method indicates that the hybrid model delivers better R 2 , RMSE, MAE, MSE values of 0.93, 0.1549, 0.199, and 0.024 respectively.},

CVD is the leading cause of death in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), accounting for more than 45% of all CVD-related deaths. The development of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs is significantly aided by artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, including machine learning and deep learning models. However, the KSA has a limited supply of CR, and AI methods are unavailable. This review aims to assess contemporary research on AI approaches’ application, potential, and efficacy in CR as a call to action for harnessing it in the KSA. Using the keywords artificial intelligence, AI, machine learning, deep learning models, cardiac rehabilitation, and Saudi Arabia, electronic databases of PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, PEDro, and SCOPUS were searched to find relevant articles. Evidence from the literature supports the idea that using AI techniques in CR can improve the ability to effectively diagnose more patients in areas without doctors in Saudi Arabia. Using AI in CR has constrained CR resources, which will lessen the need for outsourcing and enhance healthcare. Patients can receive an accurate diagnosis online thanks to machine learning algorithms and the expanding capabilities of AI.},

  abstract     = {Process mining uses event logs to improve business processes, but such logs may contain privacy information. One popular research problem is the privacy protection of event logs. Publishing logs with differential privacy is one of major research directions. Existing research achieves privacy protection primarily by injecting random noise into event logs, or merging similar information. The former ignores the fact that injecting random noise will produce apparently unreasonable activity traces, and the latter will cause a loss of process information in the process mining perspective. To solve the above problems, this article proposes a differential algorithm based on randomized response to model Petri nets for the original event logs, select the important labels in the logs by the weak sequential relationship of control flow between activities, inject noise into the Petri net model based on the important labels using the randomized response approach, and establish a differential Petri net model. Experiments on public datasets show that the event logs produced by the approach proposed do not contain unreasonable traces. Compared with the baseline approach, the proposed approach performs better on Fitness metrics with consistent privacy requirements and retains more process variants, reducing the loss of original event log process information.},

  abstract     = {Posture variation and self-occlusion are well-known factors that can compromise the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems. There are a variety of ways to combat the challenges listed above, include using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Nevertheless, many GAN methods cannot guarantee high-quality frontal-face images, which can improve recognition accuracy and verification when applied to multiple datasets. Recent results have proven that the two-pathway GAN (TP-GAN) method is superior to many traditional GAN deep learning methods that provide better face-texture details due to a unique architecture that enables the method to perceive global structure and local details in a supervised fashion. Although the TP-GAN overcomes some of the difficulties associated with generating photorealistic frontal views through the use of texture information provided by landmark detection and synthesis functions, it is difficult to replicate across different datasets. Particularly, under extreme pose scenarios, TP-GAN fails to further boost photo-realistic face frontalization image samples, minimizes the training time, and reduces computational resources, all of which result in substantially lower performance. This paper proposes simple adaptive strategies for overcoming TP-GAN’s inherent limitations. First, we incorporate the powerful discrimination capabilities of a decision forest into the discriminator of a TP-GAN. This method will result in a more stable discriminator model over time. Secondly, we acclimate a data augmentation technique along with a method which reduces training errors and accelerates the convergence of existing learning algorithms. Our proposed approaches are evaluated on three datasets, Multi-PIE, FEI and CAS-PEAL. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that our proposed approaches can enhance TP-GAN performance by restoring identity information contaminated by variations in posture and self-occlusion, resulting in high quality visualizations and rank-1 individual face identification.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence applications have revolutionized business, industry, and education. Applications developed for other sectors are being adapted for education. The amount of data being generated by educational institutions is used to make recommendations for a wide range of areas. The study uses bibliometric analysis to evaluate the development and growth of recommender systems in higher education. Two hundred seventy-two (272) articles published between 2007 and 2021 in the Scopus database were utilized to collect data. The study examines the different patterns such as publication trends, the relative growth rate (RGR) and doubling time (DT) for publications. Results show a steady increase in publications, with 2017 recording the highest number of publications. China, Spain and the United States have the highest publications. The mean RGR decreased, and the mean doubling time increased in the three-five-year periods. The study identified sixteen themes covered by the research articles analyzed. Most articles focused on e-learning, followed by classroom activities and, thirdly, those focusing on course selection. The study provides essential insights into current and future research on recommender systems in higher education. This analysis helps researchers, policymakers, and practitioners better understand the development of recommender systems in higher education and possible practice implications.},

  abstract     = {Model-based clustering technique is an optimal choice for the distribution of data sets and to find the real structure using mixture of probability distributions. Many extensions of model-based clustering algorithms are available in the literature for getting most favorable results but still its challenging and important research objective for researchers. In the model-based clustering, many proposed methods are based on EM algorithm to overcome its sensitivity and initialization. However, these methods treat data points with feature (variable) components under equal importance, and so cannot distinguish the irrelevant feature components. In most of the cases, there exist some irrelevant features and outliers/noisy points in a data set, upsetting the performance of clustering algorithms. To overcome these issues, we propose a fuzzy model-based t-clustering algorithm using mixture of t-distribution with an L 1 regularization for the identification and selection of better features. In order to demonstrate its novelty and usefulness, we apply our algorithm on artificial and real data sets. We further used our proposed method on soil data set, which was collected in collaboration with and the assistance of Environmental laboratory Karakoram International University (GB) from various point/places of Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. The comparison results validate the novelty and superiority of our newly proposed method for both the simulated and real data sets as well as effectiveness in addressing the weaknesses of existing methods.},

Furthermore, by hiring the fuzzy PDC, explicit design criteria are further developed for the regarded system. Noticeably, the new design method can cope with controller synthesis of the admissibility and D-admissibility issues.

  abstract     = {There is an increased demand for detecting online hate speech, especially with the recent changing policies of hate content and free-of-speech right of online social media platforms. Detecting hate speech will reduce its negative impact on social media users. A lot of effort in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field aimed to detect hate speech in general or detect specific hate speech such as religion, race, gender, or sexual orientation. Hate communities tend to use abbreviations, intentional spelling mistakes, and coded words in their communication to evade detection, which adds more challenges to hate speech detection tasks. Word representation from its domain will play an increasingly pivotal role in detecting hate speech. This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging domain-specific word embedding as features and a bidirectional LSTM-based deep model as a classifier to automatically detect hate speech. This approach guarantees that the word is assigned its negative meaning, which is a very helpful technique to detect coded words. Furthermore, we investigate the use of the transfer learning language model (BERT) on the hate speech problem as a binary classification task as it provides high-performance results for many NLP tasks. The experiments showed that domain-specific word embedding with the bidirectional LSTM-based deep model achieved a 93% f1-score, while BERT achieved 96% f1-score on a combined balanced dataset from available hate speech datasets. The results proved that the performance of pre-trained models is influenced by the size of the trained data. Although there is a huge variation in the corpus size, the first approach achieved a very close result compared to BERT, which is trained on a huge data corpus, this is because it is trained on data related to the same domain. The first approach was very helpful to detect coded words while the second approach achieved better performance because it is trained on much larger data. To conclude, it is very helpful to build large pre-trained models from rich domains specific content in current social media platforms.},

  abstract     = {Renewable energy can help India’s economy and society. Solar energy is everywhere and can be used anywhere, making it popular. Solar energy’s drawbacks are weather and environmental dependencies and solar radiation variations. Solar Radiation Forecasting (SRF) reduces this drawback. SRF eliminates solar power generation variations, grid overvoltage, reverse current, and islanding. Short-term solar radiation forecasts improve photovoltaic (PV) power generation and grid connection. Previous promising SRF studies often fail to generalize to new data. A biogeography-based optimization artificial neural network (BBO-ANN) model for SRF is proposed in this work. 5-year and 6-year data are used to train and validate the model. The data was collected from India’s Jaipur Rajasthan weather station from 2014 to 2019. This work used biogeography-based optimization (BBO) to optimize and adjust the inertia weight of artificial neural networks (ANN) during training. The BBO-ANN model developed in this study had a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3.55%, which is promising compared to previous SRF studies. The BBO-ANN SRF model introduced in this work can generalize well to new data because it was able to produce equally accurate autumn and winter forecasts despite the great climatic variation that occurs during the summer and spring.},

Fuzzy logic system is applied to tackle the uncertain nonlinear dynamics in the system and the unknown parameters are estimated by adaptive laws. An event-triggered control scheme is designed to reduce communication burden. The proposed distributed controller can guarantee that all signals of the system are bounded, the constrained states never breach the time-varying constraints, finite-time tracking can be achieved with a bounded error and the Zeno behavior does not occur.

Traditional prediction is not generally based on the time series obtained from multiple meteorological stations and from a spatial perspective. In this study, a deep convolution neural network with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) is constructed to extract the spatiotemporal features of temperature and the correlation between meteorological elements. The accuracies of the simulated and the predicted temperatures are spatially visualized by using the Kriging interpolation method. The accuracy of air temperature obtained from the CNN-LSTM was compared with those obtained from the CNN and the LSTM to verify its performance. The results show that there were prominent spatial variations in the temperature, with a latitudinal zonal structure in the southern Ningxia and a radial zonal structure in the northern Ningxia, China. The accuracies of the simulated and predicted temperature were high in areas with a small range of the annual temperature. The accuracies of the mean monthly temperature simulated by the CNN-LSTM in spring and autumn were higher than that in the summer. The predicted annual average temperature increased each year from 2020 to 2025. The CNN-LSTM had a higher accuracy of simulating and predicting the temperature as well as a better generalization ability than the CNN and LSTM.},

However, for different periods of different disease, it is difficult to distinguish due to similar symptoms and fine-grained, so there are few related studies. In this study, we proposed a convolutional neural network based on contrastive learning to identify fine-grained potato diseases. Different from the previous unsupervised contrastive learning used in pre-training, the proposed model adds a projection head to the backbone network of Vgg16 to extract the contrastive representation features, and then integrates the contrastive loss with the classification loss to form a joint loss. Finally, an end-to-end supervised contrastive convolutional neural network is constructed, which is easier to train while reducing the transmission error. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves an average recognition accuracy of 97.24%, which is higher than 90.28% of Resnet50, 90.62% of Resnet101, 93.06% of AlexNet, 94.44% of Inception V3, and 94.79% of Vgg16.

This study proposes the CNN-TRI model to overcome these limitations. Specifically, this study applies a multi-channel CNN model to extract semantic features in the review text and convert star ratings into a high-dimensional feature vector to avoid information loss. Next, element-wise operation and multilayer perception are applied to extract linear and nonlinear interactions to learn interaction effectively. Results measured by real world online reviews collected from Amazon.com show that CNN-TRI significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

  abstract     = {When scale builds up in a transmission pipeline, it narrows the pipe’s interior and causes losses in both power and efficiency. A noninvasive instrument based on gamma-ray attenuation is one of the most reliable diagnostic procedures for determining volumetric percentages in a variety of circumstances. A system with a NaI detector and dual-energy gamma generator simulations ( 241 Am and 13 3 Ba radioisotopes) is recommended for simulating a volume percentage detection system utilizing Monte Carlo N particle (MCNP). Three-phase flow consisting of oil, water, and gas moves through a scaled pipe of variable wall thicknesses in a stratified flow regime with changing volume percentages. After gamma rays are emitted from one end of the pipe, a detector take in the photons coming from the other end. Four temporal features, including kurtosis and mean value of the square root (MSR), skewness, and waveform length (WL) picked up by the detector, were thus obtained. By training two GMDH neural networks with the aforementioned inputs, it is possible to forecast volumetric percentages with an RMSE of less than 0.90 and independently of scale thickness.

  abstract     = {Lung cancer is the most common and second leading cause of cancer with lowest survival rate due to lack of efficient diagnostic tools. Currently, researchers are devising artificial intelligence based tools to improve the diagnostic capabilities. The machine learning (ML) requires hand-crafted features to train the algorithms. To extract most relevant features is still a challenging task in the field image processing. We first extracted the texture gray level co-occurrence matrix features. We fed these features to traditional ML algorithms such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The SVM yielded an accuracy of 83.0%, whereas KNN produced an accuracy of 97.0%. We then optimized and employed the ensemble extreme boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, which improved the detection performance with precision, recall, and accuracy of 100%. We also optimized and employed the deep learning ResNet101 to distinguish the small cell cancer from non-small cell lung cancer and obtained the 100% performance with these evaluation performance measures. The results revealed that proposed approach is more robust than traditional ML algorithms. Based on these results, the proposed methodology can be very helpful in the early detection and treatment of lung cancer for better diagnosis system.},

  abstract     = {Conversational Agents (CA) are increasingly being deployed by organizations to provide round-the-clock support and to increase customer satisfaction. All CA have one thing in common despite the differences in their design: they need to be trained with users’ intents and corresponding training sentences. Access to proper data with acceptable coverage of intents and training sentences is a big challenge in CA deployment. Even with the access to the past conversations, the process of discovering intents and training sentences manually is not time and cost-effective. Here, an end to end automated framework that can discover intents and their training sentences in conversation logs to generate labeled data sets for training intent models is presented. The framework proposes different feature engineering techniques and leverages dimensionality reduction methods to assemble the features, then applies a density-based clustering algorithm iteratively to mine even the least common intents. Finally, the clustering results are automatically labeled by the final algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning and data mining are being used in different fields like data analysis, prediction, image processing, etc., and particularly in healthcare. Over the past decade, several types of research have been carried out focusing on machine learning and data mining application to generate intuitions from historical data and make predictions about the results. Machine learning algorithms play a vital role in improving healthcare systems due to continuous research in machine learning applications. Several researchers have used algorithms of machine learning to develop systems for decision support, analyze clinical aspects, use historical data to extract useful information, make future predictions and categorize diseases, etc. to help physicians make better decisions. In this study, we used an ensemble modeling voting technique for the classification of the birth dataset. Ensemble models combine individual machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy by predicting from the combined output of the base classifiers. Gradient boosting classifier (GBC), random forest (RF), bagging classifier (BC), and extra trees classifier (ETC) were used as base learners for making a voting ensemble model for the classification of the birth dataset. The results produced have shown that the voting classifier of support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extra trees classifier, and bagging classifier has given the best results with the proportion of 94.78%, gradient boosting classifier has 84.39% accuracy, the random forest has 94.26% accuracy, extra trees classifier have 94.02% accuracy and bagging classifier has 93.65% accuracy. The accuracy achieved by ensemble modeling is far higher than the machine learning algorithms. Ensemble models increase the accuracy of machine learning algorithms by reducing variance and classification errors. The development of such a system will not only help health organizations to take effective measures to improve the maternal health assessment process but will also open the doors for interdisciplinary research in two different fields in the region.},

In the prisoner’s dilemma, studies typically emphasize the priority of maximizing the gain of each individual. In this paper, however, we focus on maximizing the benefit of the larger group, not each individual. It is worth noting that regardless of individual strategies in the prisoner’s dilemma, there is always a certain level of defection. These individual defections can be analyzed in a collective group setting from the perspective of game theory. We look into how much defection is required, if necessary, in order to optimize a group’s advantages, and analytically identify the specific effects of defection for the purpose of maximizing group benefit.},

  abstract     = {Allergenic pollen affects the quality of life for over 30% of the European population. Since the treatment efficacy is highly related to the actual exposure to pollen, information about the type and number of airborne pollen grains in real-time is essential for reducing their impact. Therefore, the automation of pollen monitoring has become an important research topic. Our study is focused on the Rapid-E real-time bioaerosol detector. So far, vanilla convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the only deep architectures evaluated for pollen classification on multi-modal Rapid-E data obtained by exposing collected pollen samples of known classes to the device in a controlled environment. This study contributes to the further development of pollen classification models on Rapid-E data by experimenting with more advanced concepts of CNNs, residual, and inception networks. Our experiments included a comprehensive comparison of different CNN architectures, and obtained results provided valuable insights into which convolutional blocks improve pollen classification. We propose a new model which, coupled with a specific training strategy, improves the current state-of-the-art by reducing its relative error rate by 9%.},

To fill this gap, the main goal of this paper is to investigate the impacts of AI-based conversational agent on firms’ operational performance. In addition, the moderating effect of time blocks is also investigated. We address questions using the event study method and a proprietary data set from a telecom firm in China. Results show that the introduction of an AI-based conversational agent increases the average call length and has no significant influence on call numbers. Moreover, there is a heterogeneous effect among different time blocks. Our findings provide important implications for the operational management of call center.},

  abstract     = {Sound event detection involves detecting acoustic events of multiple classes in audio recordings, along with the times of occurrence. Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) Task 4 for sound event detection in domestic environments is a contest on this task. In this paper, we engineer sound event detection systems using the data provided and the performance metrics defined in this contest. Note the performance metrics of polyphonic sound detection scores (PSDS) in 2 scenarios are adopted recently to be practical and effective. Our system development started with a basic system through reference to various systems in the contests of previous years. We developed a system similar to that used by the winning team in DCASE Challenge 2021. A clip-level consistency branch is then added to the model architecture to increase the performance of the PSDS in scenario 2, which focuses on identifying different event classes. In addition, we use knowledge distillation with the mean teacher model to improve system performance. In this way, the model can learn from the pre-trained model without being fully restricted by its performance. Finally, we further enhance the system robustness through consistency criteria in the second stage of training. On the official validation set of Domestic Environment Sound Event Detection (DESED) dataset, our final system achieves 0.418 and 0.661 on the PSDS in the two scenarios. It outperforms the 2021 baseline system with 0.341 and 0.546 on both scores quite significantly.},

Motivated by emerging Deep Learning (DL) techniques, a DL model that can estimate the attitude of a rotating object represented by Euler angles is developed. Instead of synthetic data for training and validation of the model, customized data is experimentally created using the laboratory testbed developed at the Naval Postgraduate School. The data consists of Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) images of a 3D-printed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) model with varying attitudes and associated Euler angle labels. In the testbed, the estimated attitude is used to aim a laser beam to a specific point of the rotating model UAV object. The attitude estimation model is trained with 1684 UAV images and validated with 421 UAV images not used in the model training. The validation results show the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) angle estimation errors of 6.51 degrees in pitch, 2.74 degrees in roll, and 2.51 degrees in yaw. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is also integrated to show the reduced RMS estimation errors of 1.36 degrees in pitch, 1.20 degrees in roll, and 1.52 degrees in yaw.},

In order to improve the robustness of rumor detection models under adversarial conditions, we propose a robust detection method based on the ensemble of multi-defense model on the basis of several mainstream defense methods such as data enhancement, random smoothing, and adversarial training. First, multiple robust detection models are trained based on different defense principles; then, two different ensemble strategies are used to integrate the above models, and the detection effect under different ensemble strategies is studied. The test results on the open-source dataset Twitter15 show that the proposed method is able to compensate for the shortcomings of a single model by ensembling different decision boundaries to effectively defend against mainstream adversarial text attacks and improve the robustness of rumor detection models compared to existing defense methods.},
