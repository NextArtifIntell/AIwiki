  abstract     = {The knowledge of experienced users in solving real-world optimization problems can be formulated as inter-variable relationships to guide an optimization algorithm towards good solutions faster. Alternatively, such interactions can be learned algorithmically during the optimization by analysing good solutions—a process called innovization . Any common pattern extracted from good solutions can be used as a repair operator to modify candidate solutions. The key aspect is to strike a balance between the relevance of the pattern and the extent of its use in the repair operator. This article proposes a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm framework that combines problem-specific knowledge and online innovization approaches to solve two real-world large-scale multi-objective problems: a 879- and 1479-variable truss design and a 544-variable solid fuel rocket design. Four repair operators suitable for uncovering monotonic relations involving multiple decision variables are proposed. Performance variations resulting from different combinations of initial user knowledge and repair operators are also presented.},

The objective function is weighted quadratic tardiness minimization. Since the problem under study is NP-hard, an iterated greedy algorithm is introduced where the parameters are selected according to a variable neighbourhood descent framework. In the authors&#39; innovative algorithm, in the first iteration of the search process, the parameters are initialized with a fixed number. In the remaining iterations, such parameters are reduced deterministically, aiming to explore distinct values throughout the search process. The proposal is compared with five other algorithms proposed for closely related problems, considering two performance measures: the Relative Deviation Index (RDI) and the Success Rate (SR). The proposed algorithm produced average values of RDI and SR of 1.2% and 86.9%, respectively. The computational results demonstrated that the authors&#39; proposal outperformed all the other five algorithms under comparison.},

  abstract     = {The confidence bound (CB) is one of the most popular acquisition functions for Bayesian optimization (BO). It realizes the balance between local exploitation and global exploration through an explicit trade-off coefficient. In practice, researchers tend to employ fixed or random trade-offs for CB, which however is inflexible in tackling challenging optimization scenarios. Therefore, this article presents an adaptive CB acquisition function, called ACB, to address the issue. Specifically, this article uses Lipschitz conditions to identify a set of potentially optimal trade-off coefficients dynamically by the estimated prediction mean and the leave-one-out cross-validation variance. Thereby, the proposed ACB achieves adaptive trade-off between exploitation and exploration by cycling through the set of dynamically updated coefficients. This article verifies the superiority of the proposed ACB by comparing it against current CB-based BOs using different trade-off strategies on nine numerical examples and the design optimization of a supercritical carbon dioxide centrifugal compressor.},

Specifically, the problem is first formulated as a finite Markov decision process by introducing state representation, an action space and a reward function. Then, a new double-deep Q-learning network is incorporated to create a selection strategy for optimal actions in different states. The results of experiments conducted in this study show that the average efficiency of the double-deck traversable crane is approximately 12% higher than that of regular cranes, and the application of deep reinforcement learning in crane scheduling is feasible and effective.},

To solve such problems efficiently, a knowledge transfer (KT) assisted efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm is proposed, called the KT-EGO, which extends the EGO algorithm for solving problems over higher dimensions ( i.e.d &gt;20). Specifically, the original design space is divided into several low-dimensional subset design spaces. More importantly, in order to extract information from the subset design spaces to accelerate the progress of full optimization, a surrogate-based data fusion strategy is proposed in the KT-EGO. And further, a searching strategy with an adaptive variable range is devised to enhance the exploitation of promising areas. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is compared against state-of-the-art algorithms over 12 benchmark functions and a 28-dimensional engineering optimization for the design of a compressor blade, which fully validates the effectiveness of the KT-EGO for solving HEB problems.},

Bifurcation cause the objective function to oscillate, leading to convergence failure. Therefore, a constraint for preventing bifurcation in constant-output-force mechanisms is proposed. Moreover, a minimum scale constraint method that extends the design domain is utilized in the proposed optimization algorithm. The relationship between the minimum length scale and the force variation in the optimized CCFM is obtained and discussed, and an optimized CCFM is fabricated and tested. The optimized CCFM exhibits a force variation of 0.7% over a constant-force stroke of 26% of the CCFM length and is thus competitive among recently proposed CCFMs.},

Firstly, the hierarchical modelling technique is adopted to estimate the relationship model with noisy data. Secondly, the hyperparameters are estimated by the Gibbs technique, and the Bayesian averaging method is used to measure the parameter uncertainty. Finally, a novel optimization model integrated with the Bayesian averaging and quality loss function is developed to find the optimal solution. Two case studies are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed approach obtains smaller quality loss than the existing ones.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an augmented Lagrangian-based topology optimization approach to minimize the volume fraction subject to multiple nodal displacement constraints. The proposed method puts the multiple constraint equations in the objective function and transforms it into a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems. This study explains the theoretical aspects of the employed augmented Lagrangian approach in depth. Sensitivity expression in terms of design variables is identified by exercising the differentiate-then-discretize mechanism, and utilizes a moving asymptote algorithm to sort out a sequence of optimization subproblems. The optimized results are compared and analysed with those from conventional aggregation-based topology optimization. However, the predefined aggregation approach indicates a dependency on the supplied parameters. The numerical two- and three-dimensional examples reveal the viability and reliability of the suggested augmented Lagrangian scheme, which shows advantages in terms of robustness and efficiency.},

In this article, a dynamic operation optimization (DOO) problem is refined from the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steel-making process, and the system model is formulated by a data analytics method. This prevents to solve the optimization problem with derivative-based optimization methods. To circumvent these difficulties, a surrogate-model-based derivative-free optimization algorithm is proposed for solving the DOO problem. In order to establish the surrogate model with the least number of function evaluations, a subset selection strategy is designed to find a sparse structure for the optimization problem, based on which a set of simple bases is determined to establish the surrogate model. Moreover, this also reduces the scale of the parameter optimization problem. Numerical experiments on actual production data verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This study focuses on waiting time constraints to achieve high-quality wafers, with missing operations, to manufacture different types of orders, which are common scheduling requirements in semiconductor manufacturing systems. Waiting time constraints limit the waiting times between consecutive machines. Although sequential steps are modelled as a flow shop, some jobs can skip some steps in the flow shop. Such jobs can accordingly skip certain machines in the flow shop, which is called ‘missing operations’. This research investigates a scheduling problem for a flow shop with waiting time constraints and missing operations. A mathematical programming formulation and scheduling algorithms are proposed to operate such a flow shop efficiently. Through computational experiments, the proposed algorithms were evaluated, and analysis of various parameters for waiting time constraints and missing operations was conducted.},

This article presents a framework integrating opportunistic maintenance scheduling and upgrade decision for the leased system throughout its life cycle based on a real-time prognostic method. With machine-level prognosis updating, system-level opportunistic predictive maintenance is dynamically achieved by leasing profit-saving calculations during each leasing period. Between successive leasing contracts, the optimal upgrade levels are dynamically determined through upgrade profit-saving maximization. A numerical example of a leased manufacturing line demonstrates the long-term economic effectiveness of this policy. The proposed framework extends traditional opportunistic maintenance policies in both the machine-level prognosis and the system-level upgrade decision.

Once a feasible region has been located, the two terms of the constrained expected improvement function are utilized to exploit and explore the feasible region in phase II. As the kriging models are accurate enough in the concerned region, a local search is processed to improve the optimal solution in phase III. The capability of the BOCGO algorithm is demonstrated by comparison with two classical and two state-of-the-art algorithms on 20 problems and an engineering simulation problem.

A cable crossings repair heuristic is then introduced in order to fix infeasible points from the first heuristic. Finally, the negative cycle cancelling refining heuristic takes over to improve feasible points. The latter iteratively swaps connections, intending to find cycles with negative costs to reduce investment expenditure. The applicability of the workflow is empirically demonstrated through a set of large-scale real-world offshore farms.

Selecting an MAR–JSR pair that performs efficiently is a challenge. This study proposes a simulated-annealing-based hyper-heuristic (SA-HH) for assembling an heuristic scheme (HS) consisting of MAR–JSR pairs with a set of problem state features. Two variants of SA-HH, i.e. SA-HH based on HS with problem state features (SA-HH PSF ) and without problem state features (SA-HH NO − PSF ), are investigated. In terms of the best makespan, SA-HH PSF outperforms or is comparable with over 75% of benchmark algorithms on 8 out of 10 instances in the Brandimarte dataset.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses a particular bus Crew Scheduling Problem (CSP) that arises in a public transport company in Spain. The classical CSP problem tries to create bus driver schedules covering all the bus schedules published by the company. The problem posed does not require satisfying any restriction due to the lack of drivers. This relaxed restriction emerged in the time of Covid-19 for different reasons. This is why the need arose in the company for a tool that allows optimizing the daily work of the drivers. The objective function of the problem requires servicing the greatest number of passengers possible, instead of minimizing the schedule cost. A model and strategies for solving the problem exactly are introduced: clustering, re-optimization, etc. Additionally, a re-optimization model is proposed using prior feasible solutions to speed up the resolution of the problem. The integration and practical use of the solutions obtained and their corresponding monitoring in the decision-making process of the company are described.},

After a natural disaster, multiple concurrent emergencies in distinct locations often make resource allocation challenging for the disaster management authority. This article focuses on disaster resource allocation based on a novel three-player, non-cooperative, single-stage, strategic game where the emergency locations are considered as the players. The decision-making authority solves a game-theoretic algorithm to determine a suitable strategy for allocating indivisible resources among three disaster locations where the available resources are insufficient to satisfy all the players simultaneously. Based on a unique non-monetary cost function, each player incurs a penalty for any possible allocation strategy. Mathematical analysis shows that, for the proposed game, at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) always exists, which can be a desirable allocation to the players. Payoff dominance and utopia-point-based solutions are used to select a single PSNE from a set of multiple PSNEs.},

In the rescheduling process, the generated sequence with an uncertain repair time is modified by three typical adjustments of the route-change and the right-shift: (1) the route-change and the right-shift are combined to gain the best improvement; (2) one operation can be inserted after the last operation on any machine that has no impact on the related operations to improve the final solution; and (3) the lowest cost modification option is chosen to generate a new schedule to adapt to breakdown. The objective of these adaptive methods is to reduce the makespan and idle time of each machine when a random failure happens.

To address this problem, a conventional piecewise linear (PWL) method and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regression approach are adopted. Although the optimal solution cannot be determined using a PWL approximation for the fuel consumption map, it can be obtained using an MLP regression. Furthermore, the PWL method achieves better results than the MLP approach in terms of the accuracy of its bilinear approximation. Obtaining the optimal solution using MILP helps in acquiring a Lagrange multiplication of the design variables by solving the dual problem, which allows an efficient design revision strategy to be obtained.},

The adaptive variable neighbourhood search algorithm and Lagrangian relaxation algorithm are developed to tackle large-size instances. The results demonstrate that the bi-objective model is effective at finding the compromise solution considering travel time and energy consumption simultaneously. The decrease in travel time is obtained at the expense of increasing energy consumption and vice versa .

As the optimized topologies for each component are determined by several structural conditions, simultaneously optimizing the joint location as well as the optimized topology is regarded as one of the difficult problems. Because joint connections are normally defined at nodes, inevitably the optimized locations of joints are mesh dependent. To contribute to these research topics, this research presents a new method for controlling the optimized location of joints. In particular, a joint dispersal constraint is developed in order to control the number and optimized locations of optimized joints. With the developed scheme, it is possible to find optimized joints as well as optimized topology while maintaining a minimum distance between all joints. To show the effectiveness of the present optimization scheme, several numerical optimization problems are solved.},

The challenge is to strategically position HSFs to cover all residents of a subdistrict at every service range level with a minimum cost. To this end, this location determination issue was formulated into a hierarchical discrete unit disk cover (H-DUDC) problem. An algorithmic solution using a multi-layered greedy heuristic was developed to solve the H-DUDC problem, and its effectiveness was validated through a practical case study. The experimental results indicate that the HSF concept is an effective tool for optimizing service resource distribution and balancing the use of public services in different sub-zones of a residential area.},

The advantages of explicit and clear geometric profile descriptions in dealing with heat dissipation are explored. Sensitivity derivation with respect to the explicit topological geometric variables of the MMC-based method is established for two objective functions. Numerical examples are presented, with extensive discussion and comparisons of the key factors of maximum temperature gradient, temperature variance and maximum temperature based on the two objective functions. These discussions demonstrate the scope of application of the objective functions. Compared with density-based topology design optimization, the present MMC-based method describes the geometric profile of the heat dissipation structure accurately and achieves a more accurate and efficient heat dissipation performance of the structure.},

In many studies, jobs are prioritized independently according to their features or properties. This article develops a new perspective by introducing the self-attention mechanism into scheduling for the first time. The job similarities are characterized by the dot-product of processing time matrices and taken as job priorities. Based on this idea, a new priority rule denoted by PR SAT is proposed, and a heuristic named NEHLJP2 is presented with makespan minimization. The computational results with the Taillard and VRF benchmarks and 640 random instances demonstrate that the new priority rule and heuristic dominate the existing ones at a nominal cost of computation time.},

The proposed framework is demonstrated using six metaheuristic techniques in a biorefinery case study. It provides better solutions than the standard penalty function approach to handle constraints. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was able to determine a solution with the least violation using the standard penalty approach. With the help of the proposed strategy, PSO determines a solution with 45% improvement in the total lifecycle cost.

This article considers the DARP with customer-adaptive ride times under different service conditions and strategies. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model that minimizes service cost and customer inconvenience. A hybrid genetic–variable neighbourhood search algorithm (GAVNS) is proposed to solve the problem. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of GAVNS with that of an approximate column generation algorithm, and to evaluate the application of different strategies on service efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Sequence-dependent set-up times are embedded in two ways: forward and backward set-ups. EMBO designs a mixed neighbourhood search and acceptance criteria to help it escape from local optima, and a diversification mechanism to enhance the global exploration ability. Three types of experiment and two scenarios, with low and high set-up times, are conducted to test the performance of the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and EMBO. The first experiment compares three MILP models (no, low and high set-up times) to illustrate the significance of set-up times. The final two experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EMBO by comparison with the MILP model and six state-of-the-art methods.},

MGA solved all of the existing benchmarks in less than 1 min without a significant optimality gap. MGA also found qualified solutions for large-scale instances of up to 2000 vertices in a reasonable time. As a realistic application of MLSTP, a forest fire detection system was developed and successfully simulated for the Iranian Arasbaran forest using a wireless sensor network (WSN).

The stresses have been obtained using the finite element method applied to the continuum bi-dimensional elastic structures. The sensitivity analysis has been carried out by the adjoint method, including design-dependent surface loads. Three examples have been investigated. The first is the piston head problem, a benchmark for design-dependent pressure loads. In this example, the algorithm convergence is demonstrated. The other two are benchmarks for stress-based problems: the simply supported beam and the L-bracket.

However, there is little evidence on the impact of the shifting phenomenon on road maintenance requirements.

The linear elasticity or eigenvalue problem is solved on a coarse mesh, while the level set equation and the smoothing step are both discretized on a fine mesh. A variety of numerical results are given to demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The aging of concrete structures has become a serious problem in Japan, and periodic maintenance is essential for preventing accidents caused by structural aging. In this study, a method for estimating defects in concrete using data from hammering tests on a concrete plate using machine learning was developed. A neural network based on self-attention (SAN) to estimate the three-dimensional position and size of the defects was constructed. Moreover, a dataset was created from the topology of the internal defects and the acceleration response waveform when a concrete plate was struck. The entire plate was represented as a non-dimensional density matrix. The SAN used scalograms of the acceleration responses as the input. Furthermore, two types of data augmentation (‘Flip’ and ‘Rotate’) were proposed. The use of both data augmentation techniques achieved the highest accuracy. By setting an appropriate number of rotations, the model was able to estimate all defects in the dataset.},

This study suggests a novel lightweight design process that incorporates these two factors. In this process, the assembly connection was modelled with the finite element model and validated by experiments. The non-probabilistic uncertainty was described using the multidimensional parallelepiped model, and then the corresponding non-probabilistic reliability-based design optimization method was applied to ensure the safety of structures. The proposed design process was applied to the structural design of the upper beam of a forming machine. The results showed that ignoring the assembly connection and non-probabilistic uncertainty may lead to an unsafe structural design, and thus they should be considered in the lightweight structural design of machines. Moreover, the weight reduction by 30.43% for the upper beam achieved using the proposed method demonstrated its effectiveness.},

As this routing problem is an NP-hard problem, a novel graph transformation method and a tailored branch-and-bound algorithm with reference lower bounds are designed.

However, regardless of how the parameters alter with the fixed layout, some potential optimal solutions may be lost. It is feasible to achieve the genuine global optimum when the parameter space of the layout is liberated. On the other hand, the shape and layout parameters have different physical properties. The complexity of optimization can be reduced if these can be organized according to their properties. Therefore, a surrogate-based bilevel shape optimization (SBSO) method is presented, in which surrogate models are updated iteratively until the optimum is found. The upper level aims at maximizing the LDR, while the lower level aims to maximize the volume. SBSO is tested on 12 benchmark cases, several existing algorithms and shape optimization of a BWBUG, and all show excellent performance.},

The problem was solved with two well-known metaheuristics, namely the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and cellular genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization (MOCell), and their performance was compared using several metrics. Their parameters were tuned with a thorough study, and several evolutionary operators designed for the problem were considered.

Solving for a robust optimum solution, however, can be computationally costly. To reduce the computational cost, a new robust optimization method, surrogate feasibility testing–cutting robust optimization (SFTC-RO), is proposed that solves two optimization subproblems. In the first subproblem, a scenario robust optimization problem is solved using a local optimization technique. In the second subproblem, a feasibility check and constraint cut of the feasible domain are performed via operations on a surrogate model of the constraints. The two subproblems are iteratively solved until convergence at a robust optimum solution. Results from numerical and engineering examples show that on average the proposed method can obtain robust optimal solutions at a lower computational cost and with better scalability than an existing method from the literature.},

It is common practice to train hierarchical surrogate models on objective functions in order to speed up the optimization process. These operate under the assumption that there is a correlation between the different fidelities that can be exploited to gain information cheaply. However, limited guidelines are available to help divide the available computational budget between multiple fidelities in practice. This article evaluates a range of different choices for a two-fidelity setup that provide helpful intuitions about this trade-off. An heuristic method is presented based on subsampling from an initial Design of Experiments to find a suitable division of the computational budget between the fidelity levels. This enables the setting up of multi-fidelity optimizations that utilize the available computational budget efficiently, independently of the multi-fidelity model used.},

To further improve the performance of intelligent evolutionary algorithms for energy cost optimization, hybrid coding and selection schemes of the algorithms are researched.

  abstract     = {Efficient Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) are crucial for modern society. Their operation requires large amounts of energy with significant financial impact for the utility providers. Existing solution methods are often oversimplified and can only solve the problem for very small, schematic networks. This article studies a pumping scheduling problem for WDSs in which, besides scheduling the operation of pumps over a planning horizon, several constraints regarding hydraulic properties are considered. The goal is to provide a pumping plan of minimum cost that satisfies all demand and respects operational and hydraulic constraints. This work proposes a nonlinear and non-convex formulation as well as a high-performance heuristic. The physical hydraulic behaviour is ensured via hydraulic simulation software. The present method significantly improved the best solutions for several benchmark instances by up to 17%. The solutions also reduce the energy consumed during peak periods, when the electrical grid is most strained.},

  abstract     = {Polynomial regression (PR) has been widely used to model simulations and experimental engineering data. The regression relationship of engineering data often varies greatly in different sub-sample spaces, making it difficult to evaluate accurately using a unified PR model. To solve this issue, a decision tree-assisted polynomial regression (DTPR) model is proposed in this article, in which a new decision tree is designed to partition the sample space according to the regression relationship. To make a prediction for a new sample, it is first compared from the root node of the decision tree until it reaches a leaf node; then, the output is obtained through the PR model of the leaf node. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model can show competitive performance in both mathematical functions and engineering cases. The proposed model is applied to the cutting force analysis of cutters of a tunnel boring machine to demonstrate its advantages.},

The efficacy of the HHO method is demonstrated on five different ED problems, namely, valve-point effects, prohibited feasible area, ramp rate limits and multiple fuels. The simulated outcomes of the recommended method are comparable to those obtained by established artificial intelligence methods. Comparative and statistical analyses demonstrate that the proposed HHO algorithm performs well and can produce superior results to some other well-known and established algorithms, namely, differential evolution (DE), success-history based adaptive differential evolution with linear population size reduction (L-SHADE) and covariance matrix adaptation–evolution strategy (CMA-ES).},

  abstract     = {Combined heat and power systems are known for their high efficiency. On the other hand, economic dispatching of these systems is very important in terms of total efficiency and reliability of the power system. The novelty of this study is to use the Filled Function Method (FFM) to solve this optimization problem in a way different from that to be found in the literature. Moreover, the Taguchi method is combined with the FFM for the first time to obtain the best initial parameters. So the proposed hybrid deterministic optimization algorithm is called the Taguchi-based Filled Function Method (TFFM). The most important advantage of the suggested TFFM is that it always gives the same result for the same inputs and all the solutions are in the feasible region. The method is applied to four different test systems and the results obtained are compared with those of recent powerful optimization algorithms. With the proposed optimization method, a significant performance increase of 5.676% was achieved.

However, the efficiency of the underlying resource utilization is limited in this mode. The space window, a recently developed concept, has the potential to optimize the underlying resource utilization. In this article, the impacts of this concept on the performance of shared mobility in major urban centres, e.g. New York City (NYC), is investigated. To this end, a dynamic routing framework with a spatiotemporal window in L1-norm and a dispatching mechanism are introduced. The operation data demonstrates a 15% reduction of the total distance travelled and the number of vehicles needed if passengers walk a few blocks. These results indicate that a spatiotemporal window holds the promise of a more environmentally friendly, energy efficient and intelligently shared mobility platform with alleviated congestion.},

Combined with the increasing scale of cloud computing, this increases the complexity of task scheduling in cloud computing. On the other hand, the quality and responsiveness of a task scheduling process should be pursued to meet the desired service features of the market. A task scheduling problem with time-dependent resource availability is formulated, and an heuristic algorithm that derives a high-quality solution to the problem within a very short time is designed to address these challenges.

Two objectives have been considered, i.e. minimizing the maximum completion time and total energy consumption. To begin, each feasible solution is encoded as a one-dimensional vector with the factory assignment, operation scheduling and speed setting assigned. Next, two initialization schemes are presented to improve both quality and diversity, which are based on distributed assembly attributes and the slowest allowable speed criterion, respectively. Then, to accelerate the convergence process, a novel Pareto-based crossover operator is designed. Because the populations have different initialization strategies, four different mutation operators are designed. In addition, a distributed local search is integrated to improve exploitation abilities. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and effective for solving the EEDABFSP.},

First, a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) model is proposed to predict the demand intensity due to seasonal situations using the ticket reservation data. Then, some regression models as price elasticity functions are used to quantify the effects of price, seasonal conditions and competition on the company’s sales.

  abstract     = {Quality improvement is the most effective activity for the process and product development cycle, while minimizing the process and product variation. For this particular purpose, robust design models are proposed to reduce the process and product variance. However, the majority of robust design models in the literature deals with certain situations. This article has four objectives. First, an experimental design matrix is generated for both qualitative and quantitative input variables under uncertainty. Secondly, triangular fuzzy numbers are used to measure the values of a response variable while dealing with an α-level cut strategy. Fitted fuzzy mean, standard deviation and variance response functions are also obtained. Thirdly, a fuzzy mixed-integer robust design optimization model is proposed to obtain the optimum operating conditions of input variables under uncertainty. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy-based methodology development for an uncertain environment.},

The traditional multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm was modified to solve this situation, and performed better with respect to both accuracy and search speed in validation experiments. Based on the modified algorithm and multi-layer artificial neural networks, the shape of the impeller blades of an industrial inline pump was optimized to improve the comprehensive performance under multiple operating conditions. The non-uniform rational B-spline was applied in the parametric design of the blade geometry, and 14 design variables of the spline were finally utilized in the iteration. With constraint of the computational head, the efficiencies of the part-load condition, the nominal condition, and the overload condition were selected as the objective functions. After optimization, a dramatic efficiency rise was obtained in all the three specified operating conditions, and correlation between the inflow conditions before the impeller and the performance of the inline pump was indicated.},

Among all interval programming problems, the interval bilevel programming problem has always known as one of the hardest problems to solve. In this work, an efficient solution method is developed for general interval linear bilevel programs in which all coefficients and right-hand vectors are given by intervals. Firstly, a decomposition scheme is adopted to transform the original problem into two simplified subproblems in which only the follower&#39;s problem involves interval coefficients. Secondly, a genetic algorithm, one of the more effective evolutionary algorithms, is designed to search these intervals, and linear program optimality conditions are utilized to evaluate each individual in populations. Finally, by comparing the fitness values according to pre-determined rules, the best and the worst optimal solutions to the interval linear bilevel programming problem can be achieved. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and can obtain larger intervals of the optimal values on some computational examples than those in the literature.},

To overcome this weakness, unlike previous methods, a Bayesian reliability-based robust design optimization method is proposed in the presence of both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. The proposed formulation is presented as a multi-objective optimization problem. The univariate dimension reduction method is used to approximate the mean and variance of the design function. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. To find the final optimum design from the Pareto front, Shannon’s entropy-based technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) algorithm is applied.

As the decision variables of this problem are high-dimensional binary variables, the Wasserstein similarity metric is introduced as a distance measure among different solutions to capture the similarity among solutions properly.

Moreover, a real industrial dataset is contributed. The representation method represents the job data by referring to the bag-of-words model. The evolutionary algorithm uses DRL to initialize the genetic algorithm (GA)&#39;s population and further evolves the population through the GA to obtain the final scheduling result.

Although considering multi-echelon deterioration makes the mathematical model complicated, a heuristic algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal values of the delivered batches at each echelon and price to maximize the total profit. Analysis shows that two-echelon deterioration does not significantly affect price, but does affect the number of displayed items. When items deteriorate at the buyer’s warehouse and shelf, the shelf size should be larger than the situation in which items only deteriorate on the shelf. Furthermore, the number of shipments at both buyer and vendor levels decreases as the deterioration rate increases.},

Local volume constraints are introduced in the conventional formulation of the topology optimization problem for maximum stiffness design instead of the global volume constraint. The local constraints are applied, dividing the interior of a given design shape into quadrangular subdomains with variable aspect ratios. The localized material within these subordinate cells is allowed to flow between two discrete material models, ‘real’ and ‘virtual’, where two separate criteria are considered for the rejection and admission of elements. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, showing that detailed porous designs are efficiently achieved with the proposed strategy.

In the new priority rule, the quartile deviation of job processing times is included for the first time, and the new tie-breaking rule is designed to break ties effectively in the insertion phase. Then, an improved constructive heuristic, PW_NEHCG, is presented by effectively combining NEHCG with an improved profile-fitting approach.

Therefore, an approximate single-loop chaos control method is proposed to address this challenge by estimating MPTP using conjugate gradient search directions. An oscillation criterion is also proposed to track the oscillation of MPTP in every iteration. When this criterion is satisfied, the chaos control theory is used to update the current MPTP. The proposed method is tested on six mathematical and two engineering RBDO examples from the literature. Monte Carlo simulations are performed on the obtained solutions for estimating their reliability.

This method employs the probability improvement function as a probabilistic distribution function and obtains multiple sampling points with a certain probability from a candidate set composed of the exploitation–exploration trade-off points in each iteration. In addition, two acceleration strategies are proposed to speed up the sequential optimization process. Several typical benchmark functions and an engineering problem are applied to test the performance of IMSK and compare it to that of different versions of MPS.

  abstract     = {The effects of different design sensitivity schemes for an appropriate incorporation of the loading position uncertainty into a gradient-based topology optimization procedure are explored intensively, so that the robust optimal design of a continuum structure can be efficiently performed over the prescribed uncertain region. Three compliance sensitivity schemes are tested and the distinctive strategy offering the most reliable and competitive material layout of the load-bearing components is obtained from comprehensive comparisons. Three benchmark examples are used to demonstrate the diverse configurations of the material layouts. The numerical results show that the scheme with the largest absolute design sensitivity can most adequately integrate the load uncertainties into the topology optimization algorithm to make the structural performance insensitive to, or have less degradation in the presence of perturbations in the loading points.},

There are four objectives to be minimized: the deviations in grades and ore proportion in particle size ranges of the plant goals, the deviation in the waste mass to achieve the stripping rate, and the number of truck trips between mining fronts and discharges. The problem was solved through the lexicographical goal programming (LGP) method, which generates solutions that can guarantee a more comprehensive analysis of the decision-making process. The LGP method was tested by using several scenarios of a Brazilian mining company. These scenarios differ in the number of excavators and the tolerances concerning meeting the plants&#39; ore grades.

However, real demand may differ from predictions, and replanning may be warranted by changing conditions. A mixed-integer mathematical model was proposed by minimizing both the production cost and the cost of deviating from established plans. In addition, a hybrid dynamic programming-based heuristic was proposed. Extensive experiments were conducted on randomly generated instances. The influences on the solutions are analysed by varying the holding cost per unit and the deviation cost. Finally, the proposed heuristic is applied to enterprise practice, and the results indicate that the total cost can be expected to be reduced by 14.55% on average.},

The MSPSO introduces two additional operators, a double angle operator and a multiple subswarm operator, into the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO). The former aims to identify the search range of possible solutions and the latter facilitates search efficiency after the search range has been located. Numerical and engineering applications, including two benchmark functions, a space truss structure and a large-span arch bridge, are used to examine the feasibility of the proposed method. The results indicate that MSPSO can identify multiple alternative solutions effectively while PSO only finds the global optimal solution, and these solutions provide more options for the selection of the best physical representation of the structure.},

Secondly, three different constraint programming formulations are proposed for the first time, generating efficient schedules within a few seconds. Thirdly, a real-time rescheduling perspective is further studied, since the ridesharing becomes dynamic when a schedule must be provided instantly.

In this study, a full parametric model of a tower crane was established based on the data provided by an enterprise to minimize manufacturing costs. The maximum error was within 9.5% of the actual costs for the enterprise. The main procedure was developed using the plant growth simulation algorithm (PGSA) to solve the numerical model, which requires the subprocedures of finite element analyses and manufacturing cost computations. The results showed that the optimal plan decreased the manufacturing cost of the tower crane by 15.94%, which was 2209.5 yuan lower than that of the lightest weight design.},

To implement the algorithm, a consistent sensitivity analysis including design-dependent loads has been developed by the adjoint method. A series of tests has been performed to explore and validate the method through three numerical examples: an L-bracket; a doubly supported beam with one pre-existing crack notch; and a cantilever beam.

Furthermore, when the characteristic size of the macroscopic deformation field of the structure is reduced to the microscale or nanoscale, the size effect causes the structure’s mechanical response to be inconsistent with the macroscale structure.

During real operation, however, these assumptions are violated, which implies that the calibration might in fact not be optimal. Therefore, in order to achieve reliable performance in a real-world setting, these uncertainties have to have been considered already during the calibration process. In this article, a stochastic optimization approach that takes the mentioned operating uncertainties into account by including probability distributions of the disturbances, is suggested. Furthermore, an approximation is derived of the distribution of the optimization performance criterion that greatly reduces the computational load during optimization compared with Monte Carlo sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed probabilistic approach leads to lower expected values of emissions and consumption when compared with deterministic optimization approaches ignoring the stochastic influences.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the numerical manifold method (NMM), coupled with material interpolation, is applied to the topology optimization of continuum structures. Quadrilateral element (Q4) meshes are used in the NMM for mathematical cover. The order of the local approximation function is increased to improve the accuracy of the analysis. This method usually leads to linear dependency of the global degrees of freedom, as reflected in the rank deficiency of the global approximation space. However, using Q4 elements, the rank deficiency value is not fixed with mesh refinement. The presented solution handles this problem, and the efficiency of the proposed method is investigated with four examples. The results indicate that the high-order numerical manifold method (HONMM) has great accuracy in the analysis and works well for topology optimization problems. One advantage of using the combined HONMM with material interpolation in topology problems is chequerboard-free patterns, owing to mathematical cover and high-order analysis.},

  abstract     = {In military manufacturing enterprises, exceptionally high product performance standards are generally met by using heat treatment followed by machining. These procedures are typically parallel batch-processing (BP) scheduling problems and job-shop problems, respectively. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is created to describe the problem with a machine availability constraint, which is divided into two stages: BP and machine processing (MP). Furthermore, an auction-based approach is developed in which jobs are categorized into batches during the BP stage and resources are allocated to operating machines during the MP stage. A local search operator is then applied to optimize the obtained feasible solutions. Benchmark instances are enlarged to adapt to the proposed problem. The approach is tested and compared to existing algorithms, and statistical analysis is performed using SPSS Statistics. The results show that the auction-based approach is effective and stable, and has absolute advantages in solving large-scale instances.},

  abstract     = {This article makes an attempt to build on the extant literature on time–cost trade-off in a transportation problem. The idea is to agglomerate the world of multiple shipment options along with the uncertainty in demand/supply requirements to the traditional set-up. The article introduces a bi-objective transportation model with multi-choice cost and time coefficients along with interval demand and supply constraints. Such a transportation framework is more generalized and provides a much broader view to a decision-maker. The research proposes an efficient iterative algorithm for generating the Pareto frontier that solves a minimum cost flow problem at each iteration. The special structure of this network flow problem is exploited to obtain computationally efficient results. The proposed method is applied to a real-world case study of UPS Express Critical in the United States. The analysis suggests that significant savings in cost and time objectives can be achieved over the traditional set-ups.},

The composite exponential filter functions and Taylor expansion are applied to obtain the approximate explicit functions between structural performance and topological design variables based on the results of static and buckling analyses. The dual-sequence quadratic programming algorithm is applied to solve the explicit topology optimization model. In addition, an adaptive image filter technology is developed to overcome the numerical instability problem that occurs in the finite element model of discs with significant changes in mesh size. Finally, some designs of torsional disc structures are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this method.},

The results show that Kriging surrogates can successfully identify delamination even in the presence of matrix cracking. The technique demonstrated here that combines model order reduction with Kriging surrogates provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for damage identification using ERT.},

  abstract     = {In modern power systems, the unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) is the most attractive and promising solution for mitigating the power quality problem. Increasing utilization of dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs) for active–reactive power sharing in all operating conditions reduces the burden on UPQC and results in improved efficiency and reliability of the system. By controlling the power angle between source and load voltage, VA loading of a DVR can be controlled. This article presents a novel algorithm using variable phase angle control based on JAYA optimization (Jaya is a Sanskrit word meaning victory or triumph). The main objective is to determine an optimum power angle at which VA loading of the UPQC will be minimum without compromising the compensation capabilities. The performance of UPQC with JAYA optimization has been compared with the particle swarm optimization and teaching learning based optimization algorithms, and without optimization approaches to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. This research work will help to develop an instantaneous VA loading based efficient control strategy for UPQC.},
