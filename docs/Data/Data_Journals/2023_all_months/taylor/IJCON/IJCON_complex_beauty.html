  abstract     = {Event-triggered finite-time formation control is considered for second-order leader-following multi-agent systems with nonlinear term time delay in this study. Collision avoidance radius is designed for a class of second-order nonlinear multiagent systems to avoid collisions between agents. Collision avoidance control is realised by detecting the flight radius. Control cost is economised, and communication volume is reduced by controlling key nodes and designing an event-triggered control strategy. The system can realise formation control in finite time by designing an FTC function. Some sufficient conditions for the formation of the second-order multi-agent system in finite time are obtained by using Lyapunov stability theory and analysis. The integral sliding mode control algorithm and finite-time stability theory are used to enhance the robustness of the system, and the upper bound of finite time is given. At the same time, the ability of the designed event-triggered function to avoid Zeno behaviour is proven. Finally, the feasibility of the results is verified through a numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {A finite-time resilient consensus protocol (RCP) is developed for a connected network of agents, where communication between agents occurs locally, a few of the agents are malicious (MA), and the non-malicious or cooperating (CO) agents do not know the locations of the MA ones. Networks with a single leader and several followers as well as leaderless networks are considered. Agents are modelled with first-order dynamics, and the inputs to each CO agent that enable consensus are designed using the principles of sliding mode control (SMC). An SMC-based consensus protocol (CP), derived using the Laplacian matrix of the graph describing the network that permits consensus amongst CO agents, is first illustrated; that MA agents can prevent consensus with the use of this CP is also discussed. The SMC-based RCP proposed in this paper requires that the CO agents know the bounds, defined by a statistical distribution, of other CO agents, and that the subgraph of the CO agents be connected; knowledge of MA agents is not needed. With these assumptions, in the case of networks with a single MA agent, CO agents can reach a consensus by disregarding information transmitted by this agent if its state violates some statistical properties. On the other hand, multiple MA agents can be disregarded without the need for these assumptions, owing to the relations that hold with the occurrence of sliding mode. The RCP consists of a message-passing algorithm whose basis can be found in the distributed computing literature. The proposed RCP can also be applied for a leader-follower network.},

First, the optimal filtering algorithm for WNCSs with Markovian packet losses is obtained. However, it cannot be applied in practice as its running time increases exponentially with time. Then a computationally efficient filtering algorithm is developed by approximating the probability density function of the estimated value to a Gaussian distribution, where the approximation is obtained by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Finally, the upper and lower bounds of the performance of the KLD-based approximate filter and sufficient conditions of its stability are obtained.

Firstly, the Gauss time grid strategy is introduced to obtain a nonuniform Gauss time grid to calculate the original control profiles. By employing the curve integral formula to analyse the control arc length, an adaptive time grid refinement concept is proposed and the refinement process is derived in detail. The initial time grid nodes are then adaptively subdivided and combined. Finally, the control arc length-based nonuniform time grid refinement optimisation method is implemented. Numerical tests are carried out on common aero hypersonic vehicles and comparisons are made with other CVP methods. The test results reveal that the proposed approach can efficiently improve the downrange and decrease the path constraint oscillation.},

Similar to Lichtenstern et al. [Optimal life-cycle consumption and investment decisions under age-dependent risk preferences. Mathematics and Financial Economics , 15 , 275–313], by using a separation approach, the problem is divided into two sub-problems, including the consumption-legacy problem and the terminal wealth-only problem. For each sub-problem, the analytical expressions for the optimal strategies and value functions are derived by using the martingale method. In such a way, we obtain the optimal strategies for the original problem by merging the solutions of the two individual problems.

  abstract     = {In continuous-time system identification, refined instrumental variable methods are widely used in open and closed-loop settings. Although their robustness and performance are well documented for stable systems, these estimators are not reliable for estimating unstable continuous-time models. The main difficulty we encounter in modeling unstable systems with refined instrumental variables is that the filtered regressor and instrument vectors, as well as the filtered output, become severely ill-conditioned if the model is unstable during the iterative process. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by including a tailor-made all-pass filter in the prefiltering step. This approach is used for obtaining an extension of the least-squares state-variable filter method, as well as extensions for the refined instrumental variable method for continuous-time systems (RIVC) and its simplified embodiment (SRIVC), that admit the identification of unstable systems and are shown to minimise the prediction error upon convergence and as the sample size goes to infinity. In addition, several implementations of these methods are proposed depending on the intersample behaviour of the input (zero and first-order hold, multisine and arbitrary). The particular case when the plant has integral action is explicitly considered in this work. In an indirect system identification setting, an extension of the closed-loop version of the SRIVC method is also proposed and discussed in detail. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the performance of our methods.},

The adaptive finite-time synchronisation between perturbed drive and response systems is obtained by means of higher order super-twisting terminal sliding mode control (SMC) strategy. The main innovative part of this work is the proposition of a newly designed adaptive finite-time dual-layer estimator (DLE) with two-level observation to exactly estimate the imposed perturbations on the both drive and response systems considering unknown upper bounds. The estimated signals are utilised in the proposed continuous super-twisting sliding mode controller for the purpose of addressing robust finite-time synchronisation problem for a class of chaotic systems. Numerical simulations and achieved results are illustrated to present the efficiency of the investigated approaches.},

The augmented delay system is then transformed into the controllable canonical form by using state and linear transformations. To introduce preview compensation, a virtual optimal preview control (PC) law is designed for the uncontrollable subsystem. Next, a sliding mode control (SMC) law is cooperated with the virtual optimal PC law to ensure the robustness of the overall system in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances.

The corresponding entry in the right eigenvector is called the algebraic trait for the structurally balanced property of a node. This paper aims to explore the algebraic trait for the structurally balanced property of a node under a signed digraph with a spanning tree by using a geometric-based method. Such a geometric point of view reveals the relationships of the links in a network for structurally balanced and structurally unbalanced nodes. The structurally balanced property of a node is determined by its parent nodes, and the connections between itself and its parent nodes. First of all, a hierarchical structure of its parent nodes is proposed, based on which the Laplacian matrix of the underlying topology can be written as a lower triangular matrix. Then, according to the lower triangular Laplacian matrix, the mathematical expression of the right eigenvector associated with the zero eigenvalue is derived. Based on this, as well as the definition of the structurally balanced node, the algebraic trait for the structurally balanced property of a node is obtained. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify theoretical results.},

In particular, it is well adapted to deal with the trajectory tracking control of a half-car kinematic model since only one simple design condition provides the control law that imposes to the closed-loop system, asymptotic tracking of a given trajectory with a prescribed yaw angle orientation. Norm bounded additive matched disturbances are considered in order to establish a trade-off between robustness and speed of convergence.

By integrating the tan-type barrier Lyapunov function, sign function and integral Lyapunov functions into the adding a power integrator technique, and choosing the appropriate designed functions and parameter update laws, a unified adaptive state-feedback controller, which can deal with both constrained and unconstrained systems, is constructed. It is proved that all the closed-loop signals are bounded, the symmetric output constraint is not violated, and system states converge to zero asymptotically.

For the piezoelectric actuating systems, the output actuating performance is affected not only by the internal non-smooth hysteresis but also by the operating load and the excitation frequency. To improve the actuating precision, predicting the nonlinear behaviour of the piezoelectric actuating system is essential for effective designs of control approaches. In this paper, a modified rate-dependent Prandtl–Ishlinskii model is presented to explore the coupling effects analytically between the internal hysteresis and the operating frequency with the external loads and predict the output behaviour of the piezoelectric actuating system accurately. The proposed modelling method is testified on a piezoelectric actuating platform under broad ranges of excitation frequencies (1–80 Hz) and external loads (0–0.5 kg), and the comparison results using the rate-dependent Prandtl–Ishlinskii (RDPI) model are also provided to prove the precision of the proposed method. Combining with the modified RDPI model, a guaranteeing preselected tracking controller is developed to ensure the output performance, and a set of tracking experiments under different frequencies with load is performed. The experimental results compared with PID control performance validate the effectiveness of the proposed prescribed performance control method and its high actuating performance against the adverse effects from the external hysteresis nonlinearities and external loads.},

In this paper, we develop several fixed time stability results for discrete autonomous systems including a fixed-time Lyapunov theorem that involves a Lyapunov difference that satisfies an exponential inequality of the Lyapunov function giving rise to a minimum bound on the settling-time function characterised by the primary and secondary branches of the Lambert W function. Using these results, we develop an optimal control framework by exploiting connections between Lyapunov theory for fixed time stability and Bellman optimal control theory. In particular, we show that fixed time stability of the closed-loop nonlinear system is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov function that serves as the solution to the steady state Bellman equation guaranteeing both fixed time stability and optimality.},

Iterative dynamic programming (IDP), an algorithm based on dynamic programming, is used as the optimisation procedure. A preliminary IDP run with fixed time stages is used to locate the position of the singular arcs. The result is then refined by incorporating a continuous equation for the singular section, in an IDP run with flexible stage lengths. The use of a continuous equation for the singular arc results in better values of the performance index than previously obtained, using IDP. A significant reduction in computation time is observed for problems with a single control variable. The information from the preliminary run was found to be useful in solving problems where state constraints are additionally present. Although IDP is used as the optimisation method in this paper, the idea is general in nature and can be applied to any heuristics based optimisation procedure.},

  abstract     = {Based on Lyapunov finite-time stability theory and backstepping strategy, we put forward a novel fixed-time bounded H infinity tracking control scheme for a single-joint manipulator system with input saturation. The main control objective is to maintain that the system output variable tracks the desired signal at fixed time. The advantages of this paper are the settling time of the tracking error converging to the origin is independent of the initial conditions, and its convergence speed is more faster. Meanwhile, bounded H infinity control is adopted to suppress the influence of external disturbances on the controlled system. At the same time, the problem of input saturation control is considered, which effectively reduces the input energy consumption. Theoretical analysis shows that the tracking error of the closed-loop system converges to a small neighbourhood of the origin within a fixed time. In the end, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The output takes the form of either a Dirichlet or Neumann trace. The output delay can be arbitrarily large. The control strategy is composed of a finite-dimensional observer that is used to observe a delayed version of the first modes of the PDE and a predictor component that is employed to obtain the control input to be applied at the current time. For any given value of the output delay, we assess the stability of the resulting closed-loop system provided the order of the observer is selected large enough. Taking advantage of this result, we discuss the extension of the control strategy to the case of simultaneous input and output delays.},

Assuming that the linear time-invariant (LTI) system does not have any fixed-modes with respect to the control structure, the pole placement at the desired locations becomes theoretically feasible. In this paper, the structural output feedback controller design is transformed into equivalent problems based on a graph-theoretic approach. Two augmented structures are established and formulated as the solution of a set of binary linear programs (BLP). The first one facilitates the incorporation of the maximum number of edges in the principal bipartite graph and the second one results in the least order of dynamic control for the principal block. Next, the distributed design problem is segmented into two stages: (i) design of a set of static control loops based on convex optimisation, to maximise the controllability/observability radius and (ii) design of the control loops corresponding to the principal bipartite graph based on the reduced-order observer-based control. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated in terms of the pole-placement accuracy, control effort, robustness to perturbations in system dynamics, and effect of controller order reduction.},

The additional divide and conquer approach of the proposed algorithm improves the speed of computation and disturbance rejection capability which proves its efficacy in real-time applications. A highly nonlinear fast dynamic real-time inverted pendulum system with hybrid embedded hardware platform (ARM + FPGA) is used to validate the performance of this algorithm under constraints.

Thus, in countermeasures, a detection and mitigation control scheme propose using artificial neural network (ANN) observer-based sliding mode controller (SMC) in this study. Malicious resonance offensive uncertainties are estimated via ANN observer effectively. The estimated states and uncertainties via ANN observer are utilized as input in SMC design to select switching surface boundary limits. The asymptotic stability of proposed control scheme is analysed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. The presented control technique regulates rate of change of frequency within permissible limits with reduction in chattering and frequency oscillations even in presence of resonance offensive patterns. Detection and mitigation capability of proposed controller is illustrated by MATLAB simulations.},

This condition depends on the corresponding complementary IQCs at zero and infinite frequencies as well as all eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated with the network graph, and it covers the dc loop gain condition in the earlier literature by constructing appropriate IQC multipliers. Moreover, the robust output consensus can be preserved along a path by IQC-based conditions. Subsequently, the robust output consensus problem is also considered for homogeneous NI systems having poles at the origin by adding an assumption related to the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. Besides, sufficient IQC-based conditions for the heterogeneous case are described by different IQC multipliers. Finally, some examples are shown to illustrate the main results.},

In this paper, a third-order continuous adaptive integral recursive terminal sliding mode (3-AIRTSM) control scheme is formulated for high-performance motion control of DC motors. The residual parameter uncertainties and unmodeled disturbances are synthesised as the lumped uncertainties. Then, the derivative of the lumped uncertainties is analysed whose upper bound is denoted by system state and control signal dependent terms with unknown coefficients. Meanwhile, a novel third-order sliding mode structure including integral element is constructed to obtain the chattering-free control input. In the proposed controller, the equivalent control term functions as feedforward model compensation, and the reaching control input handles the lumped uncertainties with adaptive gain coefficients, which reduces the design conservation and avoids the high-gain feedback issue. The closed-loop system stability analysis indicates that both tracking error and gain estimation errors converge to zero in finite time under the proposed controller. Comparative experimental results verify the proposed 3-AIRTSM controller can realize the best tracking performance with the modest or the lowest control effort, compared with 3-IRTSM and 3-RTSM controllers.},

By using the active disturbance approach to design a reduced-order extended state observer, the proposed algorithm is modified to reject an unknown external disturbance. Moreover, exponential convergence is achieved through the Lyapunov theory when the disturbance is constant. When the differential of the disturbance is bounded, by adjusting the control parameter of the observer, the proposed algorithm converges to an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the optimal solution.

In particular, using extended Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov conditions characterising stochastic dissipativity we show that our optimal feedback control law satisfies a return difference inequality predicated on a difference operator of a controlled Markov dispersion process and is stochastically dissipative with respect to a specific quadratic supply rate.},

Firstly, the algebraic form of switching signal is given and a parallel system is formed by combining the switching signal and the state. Then the controllability problem of PSBCNs is transformed into the set controllability problem of the new system, further, the criterion for controllability is obtained. Secondly, the set controllability matrix of PSBCNs is constructed, and the necessary and sufficient condition of set controllability for PSBCNs is presented. In addition, a more general PSBCN is considered and the criteria for its controllability and set controllability are proposed. Finally, a practical example is given to illustrate the obtained results, which shows that our new results are correct and effective.},

A self-triggered SMPC algorithm with an improved triggering condition is designed which integrates the co-design of both the current control inputs and the maximum sampling interval, with the aim of reducing the amounts of communication transmission while guaranteeing the specific performance. To give consideration to both probabilistic guarantee and computability, chance constraints on both states and inputs are transformed into deterministic ones by leveraging Cantelli&#39;s inequality and linearisation techniques, so as to be solvable for the optimisation problem. Meanwhile, the nonconvex terms in dynamics of covariance propagation are averted through introducing the covariance upper bound control approach. The formulated online optimisation problem is convex to all decision variables. The theoretical analysis on recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability is addressed for the proposed self-triggered SMPC scheme. Finally, the efficacy and achievable performance of the proposed algorithm are showcased through numerical simulations.},

As a result, it is proven via Lyapunov&#39;s direct method that, in the presence of Rayleigh dissipation, the closed-loop equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable with a strict Lyapunov function. Since saturation occurs in the system which contains the actuator model, the proposed control law is unconstrained and can be simplified to a proportional-derivative with desired gravity compensation algorithm. As a by-product global asymptotic stability is also proven for the case where Rayleigh dissipation is null. Numerical simulations on a crank-slider mechanism are presented. Moreover, experimental results on a DC-DC buck power converter are also shown and confirm the viability of our approach.},

For a complex system with multiple secret states, it is difficult to ensure the system opacity, which makes it necessary to actively control the system to enforce their opacity. In this regard, based on the framework of partially observable and controllable discrete event system, the active current-state opacity is studied. The system being actively opaque means that we can find a control for each secret state such that the behaviour of system reaching the secret state is opaque. Under such control, the intruder is unable to confirm the current state as secret state through limited observation. We construct an active-opacity verifier and derive a necessary and sufficient condition to check the active opacity of the system.},

Different from most articles which use independent Bernoulli variables to model the cyber-attacks, this paper considers these attacks into a unified Markovian jump framework for modelling. In order to save the limited network communication resources, the improved DETS is adopted. An appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) containing the proposed improved DETS condition is constructed, and sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee finite-time H ∞ stabilisation of the system. Then, according to a set of feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the co-design of event-trigger and H ∞ controller is given.

First, a varying parameter which takes value 1 or − 1 − 1 −1 , instead of in an unbounded countable set, is specialised to capture the unknown control direction and accordingly a supervisory mechanism is delicately constructed to decide when to switch the parameter from 1 to − 1 or from − 1 to 1. A dynamic high gain, rather than a switching one, is appointed to compensate the serious system uncertainties. Then, the wanted controller is constructed, for which the design functions and design parameters are recursively generated by backstepping method (instead of analytically defined owing to the unknown control coefficients). Based on the designations and supervisory mechanism, it turns out that no Zeno phenomenon occurs, and global boundedness and convergence (to zero) hold, both for the resulting closed-loop system.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a nonrecursive identification algorithm for a class of precision motion systems with uncertain hysteresis nonlinearities. This class of precision motion systems can be modeled by a Hammerstein system with a hysteresis nonlinearity. The hysteresis nonlinearity can be symmetric, asymmetric, rate-independent, or rate-dependent. The proposed identification algorithm is a two-stage algorithm that identifies the hysteresis nonlinearity and the linear system using measurements of the input and output of the Hammerstein system. The first stage of the algorithm uses a delayed impulse signal with simple least squares to identify the linear part of the Hammerstein system. The delayed impulse signal is shown to be persistently exciting of a sufficient order for the considered model structure. The second stage of the algorithm uses a sinusoidal input and the identified linear model obtained from the first stage to construct an estimate of the unknown intermediate signal, which represents the output of the hysteresis nonlinearity. Finally, a model of the hysteresis nonlinearity is obtained using the sinusoidal input and the constructed estimate of the intermediate signal. The identification algorithm is demonstrated on an experimental setup that includes a piezoelectric actuator, which exhibits a hysteresis nonlinearity and badly damped dynamics.},

This paper investigates the estimation and tracking control in application to a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). A full state observer for the estimation of VTOL-UAV motion parameters (attitude, angular velocity, position, and linear velocity) is proposed on the Lie Group of S E 2 ( 3 ) × R 3 = S O ( 3 ) × R 9 with almost globally exponentially stable closed-loop error signals. Thereafter, a full state observer-based controller for the VTOL-UAV motion parameters is proposed on the Lie Group with a guaranteed almost global exponential stability. The proposed approach produces good results without the need for angular and linear velocity measurements (without a gyroscope and GPS signals) utilising only a set of known landmarks obtained by a vision-aided unit (monocular or stereo camera). The equivalent quaternion representation on S 3 × R 9 is provided in the Appendix. The observer-based controller is presented in a continuous form while its discrete version is tested using a VTOL-UAV simulation that incorporates large initial error and uncertain measurements. The proposed observer is additionally tested experimentally on a real-world UAV flight dataset.},

Most of the previous works on the almost periodic solution and its stability are mainly about the existence of an almost-periodic solution and its global stability. In fact, the real ecosystem presents multiple stable states due to the influence of various external factors. However, there are few researches on multiple almost-periodic solutions and local stability of Ayala-Gilpin ecosystem. Therefore, we focus on the existence and local exponential stability of multiple almost-periodic solutions for a classical nonlinear competitive Ayala-Gilpin ecosystem provided with varying-lags and control terms in this paper. Firstly, a class of functions having only two zeros in ( − ∞ , + ∞ ) is investigated. Next, based on the existence of zeros of these functions, we obtain some sufficient conditions to ensure the existence of at least four almost-periodic positive solutions by utilising theorem of coincidence degree and some inequality techniques. Furthermore, we also conclude that this ecosystem exists at least two almost-periodic positive solutions under relatively weak conditions. Finally, we build some Lyapunov functionals to discuss the local exponential stability of each almost-periodic positive solution in its own region. As an application, a numerical simulation inspect the effectiveness of our major results.},

The fundamental problem of incorporating the power take-off system efficiency is that it leads to a nonlinear and non-convex optimal control problem. The main disadvantage of the available solutions is that none solve the optimal control problem in real-time. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach based on the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme to incorporate the power take-off system&#39;s efficiency when solving the optimal control problem at each time step in a control law aimed at maximising the energy extracted. The second contribution of this paper is the derivation of a condensing algorithm O ( N 2 ) for ‘output-only’ cost functions required to improve computational efficiency. Finally, the RTI-NMPC approach is tested using a scaled model of the Wavestar design, demonstrating the benefit of this new control formulation.},

The satellite collision can be caused through a cyber-attack on a satellite by colliding it with a considered strategic satellite. Consequently, it is highly imperative that critical operational space assets be provided with autonomous collision avoidance systems. The collision avoidance methodology proposed in this paper will reduce the collision probability to an acceptable level and protect the satellite against indirect kinetic cyber-attacks initiated by designing optimal collision avoidance maneuvers using a stochastic model predictive control strategy. The collision probability is estimated using the available historical Two-Line Elements of determined objects, and the model predictive control scheme guarantees the safety of the space close approaches. The proposed and developed collision-avoidance countermeasure methodology is numerically simulated for the collision case study between the Iridium-33 and the Cosmos-2251 satellites. The results demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness, capabilities, and advantages of our proposed methodology in avoiding probable collisions due to indirect kinetic cyber-attacks.},

Following the linearisation of each step in the pathway around pre-chosen, biochemical-sound, set point, the original system is assembled as a stochastic linear system where the uncertainties in the enzymes concentrations appear as state-multiplicative stochastic terms in both the dynamical and input matrices. The effect of the three negative feedback loops that regulate the system dynamics is first investigated. Given a disturbance signal, we then study the sensitivity of the system to variations in certain kinetic and thermodynamical variables to assess the possible optimality of the system in the H 2 , H ∞ and L ∞ − L ∞ senses.},

The proposed method is developed by decoupling an Augmented CDKF (ACDKF) via U-V transformation. By modifying the measurement stage, a robust ThSCDKF is proposed to achieve a robust state estimation when we do not have prior knowledge about the statistical model of the fault or uncertainties. The stability of the proposed filters is proved by the Lyapunov theory. The proposed methods have been applied to the on-board calibration of a star sensor.

  abstract     = {To overcome the challenges, including propagation of the stochastic uncertainties through a nonlinear model and full determination of the states over the prediction horizon for successful online implementation of the stochastic nonlinear model predictive control (SNMPC) framework, this paper proposes the utilisation of unscented Kalman filter (UKF) in the context of SNMPC for the stochastic multivariable nonlinear systems to track a given trajectory in the presence of stochastic uncertainties and system constraints. Taking advantage of the UKF which estimates and propagates the entire conditional distribution of the states along the time horizon by taking into account errors due to external disturbances and measurement noises as well as errors introduced due to the imperfect knowledge of the states through the state estimation, the proposed UKF-SNMPC framework utilises the conditional mean and conditional covariance of the states to reformulate the model cost and constraint functions, which yields a tractable framework for handling nonlinear chance-constrained tracking control problems. By employing a cancellation strategy, the control law consists of two components, that is, a tracking control law is designed to follow the desired trajectory and an uncertainty compensation control law designed to accommodate the nonlinearities in the plant. The concept of ‘robust horizon’ is introduced as the terminal constraint to prevent the covariance from the explosion and guarantee the convergence of the UKF-SNMPC framework. Performance bounds of the closed-loop system are theoretically analysed. Comparative studies on numerical examples are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed UKF-SNMPC scheme.},

Despite the importance of LPV/LFR systems to the control literature, there is a lack of works on this topic. The distinctive formulation of the proposed controller designs is given by using parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions in combination with slack variables and general full-block multipliers. Such proposed formulation leads to less conservative synthesis conditions characterised in terms of a finite number of linear matrix inequalities for both state-feedback and static output-feedback controllers subject to H 2 and L 2 performances for discrete-time LPV/LFR systems. Improvements obtained by the proposed controller design conditions over existing methods in the area are assessed by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Recent results on the passivity analysis and control of physical systems, based on the balance of dissipated and internally generated energy, are generalised to nonlinear systems represented by bond graphs. For linear systems, the internally generated energy associated with modulated sources can be coupled with the dissipative field, so that if external energy sources are excluded, then the system is passive (or dissipative) if the resulting composite multiport field is passive. Such a result for linear systems was previously conveniently expressed in terms of a characteristic matrix being positive semi-definite. Parasitic elements of previous works are no longer required, which allows working on the original bond graph of lower dimension than the augmented bond graph and for no-linear systems avoid inverting the dissipative nonlinear constitutive relations. For nonlinear systems, passivity is now considered through the explicit difference between the dissipated and the internally generated energy. If this energy difference is positive, the system is passive. For control systems, the current work proposes that the controller is designed to have a structure similar to the plant (linear or nonlinear), and its parameters are chosen to assure that in closed-loop the difference between the dissipated and the internally generated energy is positive. In particular, the control parameters can be chosen to assign a desired dissipated energy or to cancel by feedback the internally generated energy and to add damping, therefore achieving sufficient conditions for the passivity of the closed-loop system.},

In particular, it is shown that smooth directional anti-derivatives always exist in the neighbourhood of regular points, whereas their existence in the neighbourhood of singular points is guaranteed just in the case that the eigenvalues of the corresponding linearised system are linearly independent over the set of non-negative integer numbers. If, additionally, the scalar function and the vector field are both analytic and the eigenvalues of the linearised system belong to the Poincaré domain, then the directional anti-derivative is analytic. Based on the theoretical results, techniques are proposed to either compute or approximate such a function. Several examples are proposed to illustrate how the directional anti-derivative can be used to solve some relevant control problems, such as determining a change of coordinates that recasts scalar and triangular nonlinear systems into linear form, and evaluating a performance index on the transient behaviour of an asymptotically stable closed loop system.},

The system is subject to full-state constraints, input saturation constraint, and external disturbances simultaneously. By introducing a hyperbolic tangent function to approximate the saturated input function, the sharp corner caused by the input saturation is avoided. In the meanwhile, an auxiliary system is constructed to compensate the approximation error. By using the barrier Lyapunov function based adaptive backstepping control, the Nussbaum-type adaptive controllers are constructed for the augmented system with unknown control direction. It not only ensures the system states are always within the constrained range, but also guarantees the tracking performance of the system, no matter whether the control direction of the system is known or not. Meanwhile, dynamic surface control is used in the controller design, which avoids ‘computation explosion’ caused by the repeated derivation of virtual control law. It improves the tracking performance of the system and reduces the burden of the controller greatly. Finally, a simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in three scenarios.},

Second, an ESO is established to estimate the differential of the output voltage and the total disturbance. Third, a NTSMC based on ESO is designed to achieve faster tracking speed and better tracking accuracy around the expected voltage. In addition, the theoretical stability of the proposed controller is analyzed by a Lyapunov stability criterion.

  abstract     = {The goal of this paper is to compute the generating series of a closed-loop system when the plant is described in terms of a Chen–Fliess series and an additive static output feedback is applied. The first step is to consider the so-called Wiener-Fliess connection consisting of a Chen–Fliess series followed by a memoryless function. To explicitly compute the generating series, two Hopf algebras are needed: the existing output feedback Hopf algebra used to describe dynamic output feedback and the Hopf algebra of the shuffle group. These two combinatorial structures are combined to compute what will be called the Wiener–Fliess feedback product. It will be shown that this product has a natural interpretation as a transformation group acting on the plant and preserves the relative degree of the plant. The convergence of the Wiener–Fliess composition product and the additive static feedback product are characterised.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of approximating an unknown function from experimental data, while approximating at the same time its derivatives. Solving this problem is useful, for instance, in the context of nonlinear system identification, for obtaining models that are more accurate and reliable than the traditional ones based on plain function approximation. Indeed, models identified by accounting for the derivatives can provide improved performance in several endeavours, such as in multi-step prediction, simulation, Nonlinear Model Predictive Control, and control design in general. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on convex optimisation, allowing us to solve the aforementioned identification problem. We develop an optimality analysis, showing that models derived using this approach enjoy suitable optimality properties in Sobolev spaces. The optimality analysis also leads to the derivation of tight uncertainty bounds on the unknown function and its derivatives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with three numerical examples, concerned with univariate function identification, multi-step prediction of the Chua chaotic circuit, and control of the inverted pendulum.},

A fast TSMC is designed for the transformed form to improve the control performance and annihilate the associated singularity problem of the conventional TSMC. Lyapunov stability theory ensures the steering of the sliding manifold and system states in fixed time. RBF neural networks are adaptively estimate the nonlinear drift functions. The theoretical design, analysis, and simulations of cart-pendulum and quadcopter demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the regular form transformation and the designed control design.

A novel robust attitude tracking control scheme is proposed by incorporating a disturbance observer and an auxiliary dynamic system into the command filtered backstepping control design. The command filtered backstepping control can avoid the ‘explosion of complexity’ problem inherently existing in the traditional backstepping control. The disturbance observer is designed to estimate the mismatched compound disturbance induced by inertia uncertainties and external disturbances. The auxiliary dynamic system is conducted to tackle the effect of input saturation. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the overall closed-loop system is rigorously proved. The proposed controller can guarantee the attitude tracking errors converge to the arbitrary small neighbourhood of zero even subject to actuator dynamics. Numerical simulations and comparisons illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control scheme.},

Proposing different, not necessarily structure preserving, reduced-order methods for each subsystem, we establish several strategies to reduce the dimension of the full system. For all these approaches, error bounds are shown depending on the truncated Hankel singular values of the subsystems. Besides the error analysis, stability is discussed.

Because saturation might prevent multi-agent systems from attaining consensus, system analysis and controller design require the characterization of the allowed region for the initial conditions. The main contributions of this work are sufficient conditions for consensus analysis and design of distributed protocols for discrete-time systems. Moreover, the conditions lead to a procedure allowing an estimate of the region of attraction. Such a procedure considers the effect of current and delayed states separately, yielding broader estimates of the allowed region for initial conditions. The results follow from the transformation of the consensus problem into a stability problem, with the subsequent employment of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory. The conditions are formulated as convex optimization problems. Finally, the paper presents examples and comparisons with previous approaches to illustrate the validity of the proposed methods.},

The connection between stability and passivity theory is the most attractive feature of controllers designed using this methodology. However, the need to solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) in closed-form has been a major challenge in applying PBC to general robotic systems. Here, we introduce a systematic approach to design controllers for a class of underactuated mechanical systems based on interconnection and damping assignment. Exploiting the universal approximation capability of neural networks, we formulate a data-driven optimisation problem that discovers solutions to the required PDEs automatically. Our approach does not destroy the passivity structure, preserving the inherent stability properties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on two benchmark problems: the inertia wheel pendulum and the ball and beam system.},

  abstract     = {The level set method is a widely used tool for solving reachability and invariance problems. However, some shortcomings, such as large amount of storage space consumption and the difficulty of constructing terminal conditions for solving the Hamilton–Jacobi partial differential equation, limit the application of the level set method in some problems, especially those with irregular target sets. This paper proposes a method that can effectively avoid the above tricky issues and thus has better generality. In the proposed method, the reachable or invariant sets with different time horizons are characterised by some non-zero sublevel sets of a value function. This value function is not obtained by solving a viscosity solution of the partial differential equation but by recursion and interpolation approximation. At the end of this paper, some examples are taken to illustrate the accuracy and generality of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes three-dimensional cooperative guidance laws with prescribed performance. To avoid degradation in performance due to error in the estimation of the time-to-go, the relative distance between the missiles and the target is chosen as a coordination variable, and a fixed-time cooperative guidance law along the direction of the line-of-sight (LOS) is proposed. The guidance laws with prescribed performance for the elevation and direction of the azimuth of the LOS are then developed by combining the LOS angle tracking error with a performance constraint function to formulate a transformed error function. The problem of prescribed performance control is transformed into that of the boundedness of the transformed error function. A fixed-time convergence disturbance observer is designed to discuss the problem whereby information on aggregate uncertainty, including on the target, is unavailable. The results of simulations show that the proposed guidance laws are effective.},

The surplus process of the insurer is a jump–diffusion model and the goal of the insurer is to maximise the expected accumulated discount dividend payment until ruin occurs or regulatory time arrives. The introduction of the external random regulatory time leads that the HJB equation associated with this control problem is a time in-homogeneous parabolic variational inequality. There is no common explicit solution to this variational inequality. We derived explicit solutions for optimal policies when both the regulatory time and the claims follow an exponential distribution. For general cases, this paper provides a Markov chain approximation method for the value function and optimal policies and presents an example to illustrate the algorithm when the random regulatory time follows the Gompertz–Makeham distribution.},

The flexible payload can be considered as an Euler–Bernoulli beam. The equations of the coupled rigid-flexible motion are established on the basis of the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equation (PDE), which can avoid system spillover instability. A novel nonlinear disturbance observer-based control approach is proposed to enhance its disturbance attenuation ability. To handle the system parametric uncertainty, we apply adaptive direct joint control to approximate the unknown parameter, which does not require endpoint boundary control. Then a Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) is adopted to eliminate the impact of output restriction. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proven by semi-group theory and LaSalle&#39;s Invariance Principle extended to an infinite-dimensional system. Finally, the performance of the direct joint control is validated via numerical simulations.},

As a result of these obstructions, continuous feedbacks cannot globally stabilise the rigid body attitude. Therefore, this paper presents an observer-based hybrid controller to overcome these restrictions. Consequently, a new kind of synergistic potential function is designed which induces a gradient vector field to globally stabilise a given set. Moreover, the gradient of the proposed potential functions is utilised to derive a hybrid observer. Furthermore, this paper considers two types of constraints: angular velocity constraint and torque constraint. Afterward, these constraints are formulated in terms of the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) optimisation problem to perform constraints satisfaction. Besides, this paper introduces a novel hybrid quantiser to deal with the problem of the low-price wireless network. Finally, a comparative study in simulations is provided to assess the performance of the proposed scheme.},

Then, the closed-loop error dynamics is derived and rewritten as a linear dynamics with nonlinear perturbation terms. Next, these terms are classified into vanishing and nonvanishing perturbations. Finally, by imposing some constraints on the nonvanishing terms, an event-triggering mechanism is constructed. By formulating the imposed constraints in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and using the ultimate boundedness theory, the ultimate error boundedness and quadratic tracking objectives are addressed in the framework of convex optimisation. The absence of the Zeno behaviour, which is an important feature of any event-triggered methodology, is also proven.

Predictive control with extended horizon brings important advantages compared to single-horizon methods, such as better steady-state performance, reduced current THD, and lower ripples in torque and stator flux. However, the computational burden is a serious obstacle because the required calculations rise exponentially with the extension of the prediction horizon. This is due to a high number of candidate voltage vectors and also predicting the values of several machine variables for these vectors. Different approaches are employed in this work to make the control method computationally tractable. A voltage vector reduction technique is utilised that significantly decreases the total number of enumerated vectors. Moreover, the stator current prediction is eliminated in the proposed method, based on the inherent features of the PMSM. The proposed method is experimentally implemented and its good performance and advantages are verified.},

That is, we derive a sufficient algebraic criterion for small-controllability of the systems, which is easier to apply than the previous one. We then show that if the state-affine nonlinear systems are bilinear, a necessary and sufficient algebraic criterion for small-controllability can be obtained using invariant sets. We also extend the derived controllability criteria to continuous-time state-affine nonlinear systems and to discrete-time multi-input state-affine nonlinear systems.

  abstract     = {The manoeuvre of a small satellite in a defined orbit at an accurate position with payload complexity and mass constraint is very challenging. Small satellites are highly prone to circumferential disturbances in space. Mathematical modelling of satellite dynamics is studied in detail. Stability regions are analysed with phase portrait. Feedback linearisation implemented with Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimation (UDE) based controller-observer is designed. The novelty of the research is to robustify the satellite by estimating the overall uncertainties and disturbances. The resultant controller requires the angular positions and angular rates of the spacecraft. The observer provides the angular rate. The closed-loop stability of the overall system has been established. The efficacy of the proposed design is demonstrated on a three-axis nanosatellite. Comparison of proposed strategy is made with other control methods through simulation in Matlab platform.},

CPL has a non-linear load nature because of the negative impedance effect. This impact causes instability in converter systems within the micro-grid. This paper proposes a super twisting-based second-order sliding mode control (SOSMC) for regulating the output voltage of a DC/DC buck converter feeding CPL. The goal of this method is to suppress the chattering effect and maintaining the robustness under load variations and parametric uncertainties. With the experimental studies constructed in the laboratory and simulations executed in Matlab environment, the proposed SOSMC was compared with classical first-order SMC for the response of the buck converter feeding CPL under various conditions. The simulation and experimental results show the proposed controller has higher tracking precision and stronger robustness during any disturbance in input voltage or CPL power, as well as reducing the chattering effect.},

The Barrier Lyapunov Function approach provides an effective tool to embed the barrier terms into the Lyapunov function, enabling the integration of barrier avoidance and closed-loop stabilisation. In the literature, previous works in the area of Barrier Lyapunov Function mostly considered a simple hyperrectangle shape of the constrained region. In this study, the complex barrier region is for the first time introduced to the Barrier Lyapunov Function framework. A novel recursive design procedure is constructed for a class of uncertain nonlinear parametric systems, ensuring the closed-loop signals are all bounded and the tracking errors are convergent.

Guidance models in two directions are used and the acceleration saturations are also considered in both two directions. In line-of-sight (LOS) direction, by applying prescribed-time multi-agent consensus theory, the problem of the times-to-go ( T g o s T g o s Tgos ) of multiple missiles converging to a same value is transformed into a stabilisation problem. Then the cooperative guidance law in LOS direction is designed based on the prescribed time integral sliding mode surface (PTISMS) and a new variable coefficient exponential reaching law, and a first-order auxiliary system is introduced to deal with the input saturation problem; based on a prescribed time linear sliding surface (PTLSMS), the cooperative guidance law in normal LOS direction is designed to ensure the LOS angle and LOS angle rate convergence within a prescribed time, and a second-order auxiliary system is designed to deal with the input saturation problem. Furthermore, the prescribed time convergence of the PTCGL is proved with the Lyapunov stability theory.

In comparison with the periodic communication way, the presented method exhibits excellent performance in alleviating communication burden and promoting control efficiency.

By characterising unmeasured dynamic uncertainty with finite-time input-to-state stability (FTISS), applying finite-time stability theory and introducing the tan-type barrier Lyapunov function, low-power and high-power terms into control design, a unified adaptive state-feedback controller, which can deal with both constrained and unconstrained systems, is constructed.

A variational Bayesian inference Neural Network (BNN) approach is first employed to learn a state-space model with uncertainty quantification from input-output data collected from the system; the model is then utilised for training MBRL to learn control actions for the system with safety guarantees. Specifically, MBRL employs the BNN model to generate simulation environments for training, which avoids safety violations in the exploration stage. To adapt to dynamically varying environments, knowledge on the evolution of LPV model scheduling variables is incorporated in simulation to reduce the discrepancy between the transition distributions of simulation and real environments. Experiments on a parameter-varying double integrator system and a control moment gyroscope (CMG) simulation model demonstrate that the proposed approach can safely achieve desired control performance.},

Both charging (Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V)) and discharging (Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)) are focused on. We first develop models of fleet dynamics in both modes. The models are 1D hyperbolic-type partial differential equations (PDEs), and their well-posed is analysed using the method of characteristics, while their discretisation is performed using the θ -scheme. Then, we design observers that provide online estimates of the state variable along the PDE domain. The design and the analysis of observers are performed using Volterra integral backstepping transformation. Finally, numerical simulations are provided that confirm the theoretical convergence results in G2V and V2G modes.},

The analysis reveals the ability of a CCLF-based control design to drive the system to an equilibrium manifold.

The approximate controllability of the aforementioned system is investigated under the assumption that the associated linear system is approximately controllable. To investigate our main results, the integral is taken in the Bochner–Stieltjes sense that makes the obtained results more general.

Recent work has proposed two methods for energy efficient input selection; a gradient-based heuristic and a greedy approximation algorithm. We propose here an alternative method for input selection based on the analytic solution of the controllability Gramian of the ‘balloon graph’, a special model graph that captures the role of both distance and redundant paths between a driver node and a target node. The method presented is especially applicable for large networks where one is interested in controlling only a small number of outputs, or target nodes, for which current methods may not be practical because they require computing a typically very ill-conditioned matrix, called the controllability Gramian. Our method produces comparable results to the previous methods while being more computational efficient.},

A sampled-data-based ETM is constructed to decide when the current data-packet should be broadcast. This scheme takes full advantage of relative error-based ETM, and thus leading to a high efficiency of data transmissions. By virtue a novel singular perturbation parameter-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, stability criteria and sufficient conditions for the consensus control algorithm and ETM are derived to guarantee that the state error dynamics is asymptotically stable. Furthermore, by using the proposed consensus controller design method, the ill-conditioned numerical issues caused by the two-time-scale property can also be avoided, and the upper bound of singular perturbation parameter is deduced explicitly. Finally, two convincing examples are employed to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed transmission scheme and consensus control protocol.},

For this, a new Lemma is obtained to handle the nonlinear functions that simplify the controller derivation steps.

The control is implemented on a part of the rigid boundary and requires only boundary measurements. The Rothe method and an elliptic approximation are used to handle the time-dependent domain due to the boundary control in the proof of global existence of a weak solution of the closed-loop system. Due to consideration of less regular initial values of the fluid velocity, the forces induced by the fluid on the part of the control boundary are not possible to be bounded. Thus, the paper derives the bound on “fluid work” in stability and convergence analysis of the closed-loop system. The advantage of considering the weak solution is its global existence and less regularity of the initial data.},

The main feature of the controller is that the attitude tracking error can converge to zero precisely within a user-predefined time, whose upper bound is an explicit parameter that can be selected arbitrarily. The whole control process is divided into two stages, and the control law is composed of an integral-type invariant partial control law and a two-stage partial control law. In the first stage, classic backstepping control technique is applied to guarantee bounded attitude tracking error. In the second stage, a novel time-varying tuning function vector is introduced into backstepping design, regulating attitude tracking error to zero accurately in a predefined time. It is analysed that the control torque is always continuous with respect to time, even at the connection time between two control stages. Simulation and comparison studies show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {The role of control system for aero-engine is to provide sufficient thrust and maintain physical and operational limits. Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) technique has been paid more attention for advantages in eliminating the effects of uncertainties arising from nonlinearity or component degradation and satisfying both safety and performance requirements in the entire flight envelope. However, due to the accuracy of aero-engine models, the implementation of the MRAC algorithm is challenging. In this paper, an MRAC architecture based on equilibrium manifold expansion (EME) model for an aero-engine is presented. An EME model is taken as the reference model in this architecture, which has high accuracy in the aero-engine modelling and contains both dynamic and steady-state characteristics of aero-engine. By using Lyapunov stability method, an MRAC based on EME model is designed and used to control the aero-engine obtaining desired performance. In the designed controller, uncertainty arising from component degradation of the aero-engine is estimated and the values of the uncertainty are replaced by the estimator. In order to indicate the control performance of the method provided in this article, the proposed MRAC architecture has been tested on a hardware-in-loop simulation platform, the simulation results have shown that compared the control performance with other traditional controllers, the aero-engine could quickly provide the desired control requirements without steady-state errors under the control of designed MRAC.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies periodic event-triggered actuation applied to PID, cascade, and decoupling control. We propose an event-triggered output feedback controller, in which the control command is actuated only when it exceeds its previous value by a certain threshold. An exponential stability condition is derived in the form of LMIs using a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional based on Wirtinger&#39;s inequality. It is shown that an observer-based controller can reject an unknown step disturbance. Using this result, we propose a way to tune the event threshold subject to a given stability margin. We apply the proposed framework to PID, cascade, and decoupling control to illustrate how the event thresholds can be tuned in practice. Numerical examples show for these three control architectures how controller–actuator communication can be reduced without performance degradation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider an optimal proportional reinsurance and investment problem for an insurer whose objective is to maximise the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth. Suppose that the insurer&#39;s surplus process follows a Brownian motion with drift. The insurer is allowed to purchase proportional reinsurance and invest in a financial market consisting of a risk-free asset and a risky asset whose price process is described by the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model. The correlation between risk model and the risky asset&#39;s price is considered. By applying dynamic programming approach, we derive the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The asymptotic expansions of the solution to the partial differential equation (PDE) derived from the HJB equation are presented as the parameter appearing in the exponent of the diffusion coefficient tends to 0. We use perturbation theory for partial differential equations (PDEs) to obtain the asymptotic solutions of the optimal reinsurance and investment strategies. Finally, we provide numerical examples and sensitivity analyses to illustrate the effects of model parameters on the optimal reinsurance and investment strategies.},

  abstract     = {In our earlier work, we introduced a discrete-event system-based fault-tolerance approach designed to handle intermittent faults. This approach is different from the typical fault-tolerant methodology as the approach does not rely on detecting faults and switching to a new supervisor; it requires a supervisor to be designed that works correctly under normal and fault conditions. This is a passive approach that relies upon inherent redundancy in the system being controlled. This is also a foundation method that should allow a wide variety of existing fault approaches to be modelled but still allow controllability and nonblocking properties to be verified. Permanent faults could be modelled in this framework, but the current method was onerous. In this paper, we introduce a new modelling approach for permanent faults that is easy to use, as well as a set of new permanent fault-tolerant definitions. They are designed to capture several types of permanent fault scenarios (generic situations such as at most one fault occurs) and to ensure that our system remains controllable and nonblocking in each scenario. New definitions and scenarios were required as the previous ones were incompatible with the new permanent fault modelling approach. Finally, we present algorithms to verify these properties, followed by complexity analyses and correctness proofs of the algorithms. An example is then provided to illustrate our approach.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a predictive control framework is presented for feedback stabilisation of nonlinear systems. To achieve this, we integrate Koopman operator theory with Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC). The main idea is to transform nonlinear dynamics from state-space to function space using Koopman eigenfunctions -- for control affine systems this results in a bilinear model in the (lifted) function space. Then, a predictive controller is formulated in Koopman eigenfunction coordinates which uses an auxiliary Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) based bounded controller as a constraint to ensure stability of the Koopman system. Remarkably, the feedback control design proposed in this work remains completely data-driven and does not require any explicit knowledge of the original system. Furthermore, due to the bilinear structure of the Koopman model, seeking a CLF is no longer a bottleneck for LMPC. Benchmark numerical examples demonstrate the utility of the proposed feedback control design.},

  abstract     = {A low-complexity interpolating control scheme based on the concept of periodic invariance is proposed. Periodic invariance allows the state trajectory to leave the controllable invariant set temporarily but return into the set in a finite number of steps. A periodic set with easy representation is considered to reduce the expensive computation of the controllable invariant set. Since this set is not a traditional invariant set, a vertex reachability problem of target sets is solved off-line for each vertex of the set and provides a contractive control sequence that steers the system state back into the original set. Online, the periodic interpolating control (pIC) scheme allows to transition between such periodic invariant sets and an inner set endorsed with positive invariance properties. Proofs of recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the pIC are given. A numerical example demonstrates that pIC provides similar performance compared to more expensive optimisation-based schemes.},

Meanwhile, a novel adaptive dynamic event-triggered consensus control protocol is developed for each AUV to achieve consensus. Third, it is shown that, with the ADEM, the minimum interevent time between any two consecutive triggering instants can be prolonged to avoid the Zeno phenomenon for each AUV.

  abstract     = {To solve the delay condition of the controller during adjacent phases and the change of the set value in multi-phase batch processes, a robust asynchronous switching predictive control scheme is proposed based on the mode-dependent average dwell time method. Firstly, the model of multi-phase batch processes including stable and unstable subsystems is established. Secondly, the LMI conditions to ensure that the system is asymptotically stable at each phase and exponentially stable at each batch are given. By solving these LMI conditions, not only the control law can be calculated, but also the shortest running time in the stable subsystems and the longest running time in the unstable subsystems can be obtained. Finally, according to these times, the controller is switched ahead of time to avoid the appearance of unstable subsystems. The comparison results of the injection moulding processes with the existing switching methods verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the robust wake steering control concept for wind farms is presented based on the control functions of the neighboring wind turbines. In wind farms, to increase the total output power, the effects of wake on downstream wind turbines should be considered. Hence, in this research, for output power maximisation, a robust Adaptive Learning Game Theory (ALGT) optimisation method is developed. The proposed procedure is based on the game theory method, but that enables coordination via repeated interactions using control functions of the neighboring turbines in a wind farm for a squarely payoff-based scenario where the turbines have access only to measurements from their neighbors. This robust optimisation method in the presence of uncertainty enables an interaction framework that creates a set of joint control functions. In this method, each turbine makes an independent decision in every iteration based on the control laws of each localised areas.},

The control law is composed by two different control structures: a Robust Model Reference Adaptive Controller (RMRAC) and an Adaptive Super-Twisting Sliding Mode (STSM) Controller. The main advantage of the control structure is its robust performance and high adaptability in face of unmodelled dynamics, presenting a fast reference tracking without chattering, since it uses a second-order Sliding Mode action into adaptive control structure. The stability and robustness analysis of the control structure are presented in discrete time, considering the overall plant, that is, in presence of matched and unmatched dynamics. In addition, the control structure performance is corroborated with simulation results, considering a non-minimum phase unstable plant. Moreover, the presented results are compared with an adaptive first-order SM control-based RMRAC, which can be clearly seen that proposed controller has better performance, mainly by means of chattering mitigation.},

The lower-order time-varying asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (TVABLF) is constructed to ensure that state constraints are not transgressed. Then, a simple backstepping-based control procedure is developed to remove the existing restrictions on a high power of piecewise TVABLF and high-order differentiability of virtual laws. In particular, a novel adaptive updating law is constructed to co-design the controller and the ET scheme by the combination of the Nussbaum gain technique, thereby solving the ET controller design difficulty resulting from unknown control coefficients. The proposed scheme can guarantee all states within the time-varying constrained areas, achieve the satisfactory tracking ability and save the communication resource.

The robots do not communicate with anybody, cannot distinguish between the partners, cannot play distinct roles in the team, and are unaware of the team size or corridor width. Every robot has access to the relative coordinates of the objects within a finite sensing range and measures its own speed. It is shown that the mission can be fully solved by a lower-level, continuous-time, and computationally inexpensive distributed control law. The proposed controller is common for all robots, individually operates at any of them and is reactive, i.e. it directly converts the current sensory data into the current control in a reflex-like fashion. The performance of the navigation algorithms is justified via a mathematically rigorous non-local convergence result for the corridors with straight parallel walls and is demonstrated via computer simulation tests in more complicated cases.},

This article presents a novel iterative optimisation procedure for the fast solution of such problems using successive convexification. The approach considers two types of nonconvexities. Firstly, equality constraints with possibly multiple univariate nonlinearities, which can arise for nonlinear system dynamics. Secondly, nonconvex sets comprised of convex subsets, which may occur for semi-active actuators. By introducing additional decision variables and constraints, the decision variable space is decomposed into affine segments yielding a convex subproblem which is solved efficiently in an iterative manner. Under certain conditions, the algorithm converges to a local optimum of a scalable, piecewise linear approximation of the original problem. Furthermore, the algorithm tolerates infeasible initial guesses. Using a single-mass oscillator application, the procedure is compared with a nonlinear programming algorithm, and the sensitivity regarding initial guesses is analysed.},

Existing results on finite/fixed-time consensus all require the considered network topologies depicted by undirected graphs or strongly connected and detail-balanced directed graphs. In this note, by resorting to a prescribed-time function and the direct Lyapunov method, it is shown that the prescribed-time bipartite consensus can be realised, which only requires the directed network topology to be strongly connected.

Through two new nonlinear forms of the small-gain theorem, the local and global stability of the controlled system are proven. Since the stability and L 2 -gain of the uncertainty block do not depend on the perturbation parameter, the designed controller can also be referred to as a robust controller. The proposed approach is used to design a stabilizing controller for the Lorenz system. The controller can globally stabilize the Lorenz system, while the previous methods can only stabilize it locally or even are unable to stabilize it. Material has been presented in ICCIA 2021.},

This is mainly due to the fact that the existing parameterisation includes the complicated signal and parameter relations introduced by the Coriolis and centrifugal forces matrix. In an insightful remark of their seminal paper, Slotine and Li suggested to use the parameterisation of the power balance equation, which avoids these terms – yielding significantly simpler designs. To the best of our knowledge, such an approach was never actually pursued in on-line implementations, because the excitation requirements for the consistent estimation of the parameters are ‘very high’. In this paper, we use a recent technique of generation of ‘exciting’ regressors developed by the authors to overcome this fundamental problem. The result is applied to general Euler–Lagrange systems and the fundamental advantages of the new parameterisation are illustrated with comprehensive simulations of a 2 degrees-of-freedom robot manipulator.},

Next, we uniquely use the Dixon resultant theory to determine the exact upper bound of the imaginary spectra, leading to the kernel and offspring hypersurfaces (KOH) in the delay domain. Furthermore, the associated standing roots of the system are analyzed to determine the precise stationary root boundaries, which constitute the potential stability changing curves together with the KOH. Finally, we resort to the Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots (CTCR) paradigm to examine the exact and complete stability of the system.},

  abstract     = {The paper discusses the design of a robust fault detection system for linear discrete-time invariant uncertain systems. The intended system consists of norm-bounded uncertainty, stochastic uncertainty, and external unknown input. Due to the mixed uncertainties, H ∞ based model matching technique is used to develop a robust system that offers maximum sensitivity to faults and minimum sensitivity to all other unknown inputs. Reference residual model is designed using co-inner-outer factorization and the fault detection system is designed so that the error between reference residual and robust residual generated by fault detection filter (FDF) is minimized in H ∞ sense. The existing condition of FDF is exploited in terms of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example and a benchmark three-tank system are simulated to illustrate the performance of the proposed fault detection system. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach by timely detecting the occurrence of the fault.},

A spherical polynomial family-based approach is adopted to analyse how much uncertainty can be tolerated, and to capture a unified framework for different cases including non-minimum phase plant and different nominal and perturbed plant structures. Results are validated using the value set concept for spherical polynomial families. The study has shown that if the relative degrees of the perturbed plant and the nominal plant are equal, then robustness is achievable even if the plant model is low order. Although non-minimum phase zeros limit the selection of DOB bandwidth, the robustness margin can be exactly determined for a given DOB bandwidth. Furthermore, it is shown that when the plant numerator and denominator have uncertain parameters, the robustness margin is not increased as with the DOB filter bandwidth in general.},

  abstract     = {For a three-link vertical underactuated manipulator with first active joint, few methods can swing its endpoint up from the vertical downward equilibrium point and stabilise it at the vertical upward equilibrium point. This paper proposes a single controller design method based on integrated trajectory to realise the above control objective effectively. To obtain the trajectories of each link from the starting states to ending states, we first plan a forward and a reverse trajectory with adjustable parameters for the active link, where the forward trajectory is from the starting states to intermediate states and the reverse one is from the ending states to intermediate states. Based on the system coupling characteristic, the adjustable parameters are optimised by the intelligent optimisation algorithm, so getting the trajectories of the passive links from the starting states to ending states. To ensure that the system with the gravity can remain at the ending states, we plan the constant trajectory for each link. Then, we integrate the optimised forward trajectory, the optimised reverse trajectory and the constant trajectory of each link into the continuous trajectory. Next, according to the integrated trajectory, we construct a linear time-varying error system, and design the single controller to make the system follow the integrated trajectory. Thus, the swing-up and stable control of the system is realised. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the validity of the control method.},

Then, the EL-PBC methodology is implemented by injecting a virtual resistor in series with the input inductor. Further, the stability analysis is also carried out. To improve the performances against input perturbations and reduce the steady state error, a PI controller is integrated with the aforesaid controller and its performances are investigated. Furthermore, the power quality of the charger is assessed and it satisfies IEC 61000-3-2 Class C standard. This controller is also compared with the benchmark PI controller.

The main idea is based on retrieving time-series data of the species&#39; concentrations from the available experimental data of reaction rates by making use of parametric Bézier curves. The least-squares method is applied to these retrieved data in order to determine the best-fitting values of the parameters in the corresponding mathematical model. Subsequently, we demonstrate the applicability of our parameter estimation method on three examples of enzymatic chemical reaction networks, including a model of ryanodine receptor adaptation and a model of protein kinase cascades. We also address the issue of identifiability of chemical reaction network models from reaction rates.},

Furthermore, combining with the AET scheme, an asynchronous sliding-mode surface is designed such that the discrete-time reduced-order sliding-mode dynamics is yielded. Third, the stability analysis for the sliding-mode dynamics is discussed and the sliding-mode parameters are solved. Moreover, in order to compensate the actuator faults, an asynchronous sliding-mode controller is synthesised, and the reachability of the sliding-mode surface is analysed.

Specifically, the control design is based on a two-layer hierarchical structure consisting of an upper layer and a lower layer. In the lower layer, each agent is represented by a linear time-invariant system and executes a local action. Moreover, each agent exchanges information with neighbouring agents in the upper layer through an undirected graph to achieve the global goal of stabilisation and disturbance attenuation for the MAS. We propose two robust control designs, namely, robust H ∞ hierarchical control and robust H 2 hierarchical control. The design of local and global feedback control laws is formulated as a constrained optimisation over linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The LMI formulation can effectively incorporate the design objective to minimise disturbance attenuation. Numerical results show that the proposed robust controls ensure robust stability of MAS and outperform the existing nominal controls by improving the disturbance attenuation.},

Utilizing it, combining with Lyapunov method and graph theory, we provide two sufficient criteria to make the drive networks and the corresponding response networks achieve exponential synchronisation which are closely related to the average multi-delay impulsive gain, semi-Markov jump, multi links and stochastic disturbance. Then we apply the theoretical results into a class of stochastic delayed oscillators networks and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the validity of our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the finite-time consensus problem of multi-agent systems with disturbances is investigated. For the first time, the dynamic event-triggered mechanism is combined with the sliding mode control algorithm to develop a novel finite-time consensus control law. The finite-time consensus of multi-agent systems can be achieved with this control protocol in spite of system disturbances. Different from the asymptotic convergence under the dynamic triggering mechanism, by introducing dynamic parameters, the new triggering mechanism can ensure the finite-time consensus of the system states. The new dynamic triggering mechanism can extend the interevent time interval to avoid Zeno behaviour. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by simulation examples.},

The first part of the proposed algorithm introduces turning points and complies with velocity and acceleration constraints. Around these points, local velocity profiles are calculated from which the global minimum-time velocity profile is determined. In the second step of the algorithm, the existing velocity profile is modified to also comply with jerk constraints. This procedure distinguishes between single-point and interval jerk violations. The main novelties of the proposed algorithm are a computationally efficient two-step approach and consistent full jerk treatment. We have also provided a comparison with an established state-of-the-art method and statistical analysis to demonstrate the low computational burden. The proposed algorithm has many applications in time-critical transportations.},

Relying only on local information, for the first time in the discrete-time domain, the model provides a time control on the evolution of the swarm/flock, that is: in fixed-time, the swarm centroid tracks a given reference trajectory; in finite-time, the connections graph becomes complete and the agents reach an aggregation inside a region of attraction centred on the moving centroid. The shape of such a region can vary among polytopes, oriented ellipsoids/spheres and straight lines by only changing the eigenvalues of a coordinates-coupling matrix. Compared to classic shape control methods where agents inter-distances must be provided, this model is more suitable for large swarms. Finally, numerical simulations and a laboratory experiment are proposed to highlight the described model properties.},

In this paper, the analytical design of a networked cascade control system exposed to communication delay and data dropout is investigated. First, an appropriate augmented continuous-time state-space model is proposed. Then, a mathematical approach is introduced to implement the augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and free-weighting matrix technique for the stability analysis purpose. The augmented representation simplifies the stability analysis of these systems significantly and makes it possible to correlate different variables in Lyapunov functional, which causes a remarkable improvement in H ∞ performance. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach.

Firstly, the mathematical model of the 3-DOF helicopter is established. Then, neural networks (NNs) are utilised to approximate and compensate the unknown functions in the presence of the controlled system. It should be stressed that hyperbolic tangent functions are introduced to reduce the negative effects caused by NN approximation errors and external time-varying disturbances. Moreover, auxiliary functions are designed to compensate filter errors, which further enhance the tracking performance of the closed-loop system.

However, the speed of convergence, computational cost, and stability are challenges to be addressed. This is especially true for optimisation-based approaches such as the norm-optimal iterative learning control (ILC). In this contribution, the convergence properties of integer-valued ILC are derived and compared against the known real-valued ILC. After an evaluation of two recently presented solutions, a new optimal set controller synthesis method for integer-valued norm-optimal ILC is presented. The approach guarantees monotonic convergence and ensures that each iteration of the ILC will require a deterministic computational effort to find the suboptimal solution, with an upper bound for the objective function of the optimisation. This deterministic computational effort makes the setup applicable for real-time implementation. Finally, an example using the introduced new approach is given to highlight its advantages.},

Moreover, we guarantee global asymptotic stability of the platoon to the desired configuration, as well as string stability. Certain macroscopic properties are also investigated. The main challenges stem from the fact that all previous objectives must be satisfied simultaneously and the fact that the control systems studied do not evolve in a finite-dimensional linear space but rather on specific sets.

The relative threshold strategy used in triggering event mechanism can adjust the update interval according to the size of the control input. The designed adaptive law with projection mapping operator can deal with undertain end load. The proposed control scheme can guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded, and the angular tracking error and vibration converge to small zero neighbourhoods by reasonable selection of design parameters.

  abstract     = {The paper proposes an approach to deal with problems stemming from inaccurate elements of car driving simulators and the disadvantages of nonlinear model-based controllers, including the Backstepping and Sliding Mode Control. For this kind of model, it is challenging to design nonlinear model-based controllers to guarantee smooth and accurate movements due to unmodelled parts in the system dynamics and the appearance of external forces. Furthermore, there are well-known demerits in the aforementioned controls, such as ‘explosion of terms’ and chattering phenomena. The main contribution focuses on constructing an adaptive and robust neural network-based controller with online learning laws, which not only ensures the high accuracy of the robot’s motion under uncertain components and external factors but also mitigate the disadvantages of conventional controllers. The stability and convergence of the proposed method are proven by Lyapunov’s stability. The simulation results show the validity and efficiency of the proposed control algorithm.},

By constructing appropriate controller and using inequality techniques, sufficient conditions for finite-time attractiveness of stochastic nonlinear systems are addressed. To estimate the control energy consumption, this paper first gives the definition of expected energy consumption for stochastic system. Furthermore, the upper bounds of control time and energy consumption are given. Afterwards, the trade-off analysis between control time and energy consumption is carried out to find a optimal control intensity choice.

We consider the decomposition of the phase space and we propose a bounded feedback control to study the weak, strong and exponential stabilisation. Firstly, we discuss the well possedness of mild solutions of the considered systems. Secondly, some sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the feedback stabilisation for the bilinear systems. The stabilisation results are given in term of observation estimates. Furthermore, an explicit decay estimate of the stabilised state is obtained in the strong stabilisation case. At the end, examples with numerical simulations are given to show the applicability of our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Optimal decision-making regarding investments is important. In this study, we examine how an individual aims to find optimal investment policies to overcome a benchmarked opponent during their lifetime. The individual evaluates the trade-off between the achievement of a performance goal and the risk of a shortfall. The dynamic programming method is applied in this study. When the individual&#39;s lifetime follows an exponential distribution, the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is an ordinary differential equation, and the explicit optimal policies for several important performance functions are derived. When the lifetime follows a general distribution, the HJB equation is a parabolic partial differential equation, and a Markov chain approximating numerical scheme is presented to estimate the value function. We further illustrate the numerical method when the random lifetime follows the Gompertz–Makeham distribution.},

  abstract     = {Runge–Kutta neural networks (RKNN) bridge the gap between continuous-time advantages and the discrete-time nature of any digital controller. RKNN defines a neural network in a continuous-time setting and explicitly discretises it by a variable sample time Runge–Kutta method. As a result, a-priori model knowledge such as the well-known continuous-time state space model can easily be incorporated directly into the neural network weights. Additionally, RKNN preserves a long-term prediction accuracy and a reduced parameter precision requirement. In this contribution, we enhance RKNN with global-asymptotic stability (GAS) and input-to-state stability (ISS) criteria. Based on a Lyapunov function, we develop constraints on the neural network weights for an arbitrary sample time. The constraints are independent of any measurements, have only a few hyperparameters, can be combined with any standard constraint optimisation algorithm and guarantee stability already during training. We apply the algorithm on two public real-world nonlinear identification tasks, an electro-mechanical positioning system and a cascaded water tank benchmark. Both benchmarks are solved with the same hyperparameters and the presented method is competitive to nonlinear identification methods beyond neural networks in the literature. In prediction configuration, all other black-box nonlinear identification approaches are outperformed regarding root mean squared error (RMSE) by an order of magnitude on the cascaded tank benchmark.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel distributed formation controller for general linear multi-agent systems with application to multiple quadcopters. First, a new locally computable state-estimate-based event-triggering communication condition is proposed for each agent. Then, the formation tracking problem is formulated as a stability analysis, controller gain and event-generator gain design problem of the closed-loop formation error dynamics. Sufficient conditions that guarantee the co-existence of a valid formation controller and an event-triggered communication mechanism are derived using a Lyapunov-based method and linear matrix inequality techniques. In addition, equivalent low (agent-sized) dimensional sufficient conditions are obtained to reduce the computational complexity. For the simulation conditions used in this research, the proposed estimate-based event-triggered communication mechanism generates less data communication instants when compared with traditional state-error-based mechanisms while still achieving similar control performance.},
