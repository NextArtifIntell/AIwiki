  abstract     = {Stochastic frontier models along the lines of Aigner et al. are widely used to benchmark firms’ performances in terms of efficiency. The models are typically fully parametric, with functional form specifications for the frontier as well as both the noise and the inefficiency processes. Studies such as Kumbhakar et al. have attempted to relax some of the restrictions in parametric models, but so far all such approaches are limited to a univariate response variable. Some (e.g., Simar and Zelenyuk; Kuosmanen and Johnson) have proposed nonparametric estimation of directional distance functions to handle multiple inputs and outputs, raising issues of endogeneity that are either ignored or addressed by imposing restrictive and implausible assumptions. This article extends nonparametric methods developed by Simar et al. and Hafner et al. to allow multiple inputs and outputs in an almost fully nonparametric framework while avoiding endogeneity problems. We discuss properties of the resulting estimators, and examine their finite-sample performance through Monte Carlo experiments. Practical implementation of the method is illustrated using data on U.S. commercial banks.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that information on the conditional distribution of an outcome variable given covariates can be used to obtain an enhanced estimate of the marginal outcome distribution. This can be done easily by integrating out the marginal covariate distribution from the conditional outcome distribution. However, to date, no analogy has been established between marginal quantile and conditional quantile regression. This article provides a link between them. We propose two novel marginal quantile and marginal mean estimation approaches through conditional quantile regression when some of the outcomes are missing at random. The first of these approaches is free from the need to choose a propensity score. The second is double robust to model misspecification: it is consistent if either the conditional quantile regression model is correctly specified or the missing mechanism of outcome is correctly specified. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the two estimators are established, and the second double robust estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. Extensive simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the utility of the proposed approaches. An application to causal inference is introduced. For illustration, we apply the proposed methods to a job training program dataset.},

We show that a network model with discrete unobserved link heterogeneity and binary (or discrete) covariates corresponds to a stochastic blockmodel (SBM). We develop a spectral estimator for the effect of covariates on link probabilities, exploiting the correspondence of SBMs and generalized random dot product graphs (GRDPG). We show that computing our estimator is much faster than standard variational expectation–maximization algorithms and scales well for large networks. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the estimator performs well under different data generating processes. Our application to Facebook data shows evidence of homophily in gender, role and campus-residence, while allowing us to discover unobserved communities.

However, estimation with existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is computationally costly, which limits its applicability to large choice datasets. This article proposes a variational Bayes method that is accurate and fast, even when a large number of choice alternatives and observations are considered. Variational methods usually require an analytical expression for the unnormalized posterior density and an adequate choice of variational family. Both are challenging to specify in a multinomial probit, which has a posterior that requires identifying restrictions and is augmented with a large set of latent utilities. We employ a spherical transformation on the covariance matrix of the latent utilities to construct an unnormalized augmented posterior that identifies the parameters, and use the conditional posterior of the latent utilities as part of the variational family. The proposed method is faster than MCMC, and can be made scalable to both a large number of choice alternatives and a large number of observations. The accuracy and scalability of our method is illustrated in numerical experiments and real purchase data with one million observations.},

We also relax the potentially problematic assumption of mutually independent structural errors in part of the previous literature to the requirement that the errors be mutually uncorrelated. Moreover, we assume the error term to be only serially uncorrelated, not independent in time, which allows for univariate conditional heteroscedasticity in its components. A small simulation experiment highlights the good properties of the estimator and the proposed moment selection procedure. The use of the methods is illustrated by means of an empirical application to the effect of a tax increase on U.S. gasoline consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.},

Our identification strategy exploits the random assignment of teachers to classrooms in MET schools. To account for noncompliance of some students and teachers to the random assignment, we develop and implement a semiparametric instrumental variables estimator. We find that changes in within-district teacher assignments could have appreciable effects on student achievement. Unlike policies that aim at changing the pool of teachers (e.g., teacher tenure policies or class-size reduction measures), alternative teacher-to-classroom assignments do not require that districts hire new teachers or lay off existing ones; they raise student achievement through a more efficient deployment of existing teachers.},

We derive the asymptotic properties of the GCov estimator and show its semi-parametric efficiency.

Similarly, our tests can be applied even when the error term and the stochastic part of the autoregressive coefficient are non iid, covering the cases of conditional volatility and shifts in the variance, again without requiring any prior knowledge as to the presence or type thereof. In order to ensure the ability to detect breaks at sample endpoints, we propose weighted CUSUM statistics, deriving the asymptotics for virtually all possible weighing schemes, including the standardized CUSUM process (for which we derive a Darling-Erdős theorem) and even heavier weights (so-called Rényi statistics).

In search of accurate PD prediction, we propose a flexible yet easy-to-interpret default-prediction single-index hazard model (DSI). By applying it to a comprehensive U.S. corporate bankruptcy database we constructed, we discover an interesting V-shaped relationship, indicating a violation of the common linear hazard specification. Most importantly, the single-index hazard model passes the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit calibration test while neither does a state-of-the-art linear hazard model in finance nor a parametric class of Box-Cox transformation survival models. In an economic value analysis, we find that this may translate to as much as three times of profit compared to the linear hazard model. In model estimation, we adopt a penalized-spline approximation for the unknown function and propose an efficient algorithm. With a diverging number of spline knots, we establish consistency and asymptotic theories for the penalized-spline likelihood estimators. Furthermore, we reexamine the distress risk anomaly, that is, higher financially distressed stocks deliver anomalously lower excess returns. Based on the PDs from the proposed single-index hazard model, we find that the distress risk anomaly has weakened or even disappeared during the extended period.},

Our main theoretical results show that the proposed Portmanteau-type test statistics have nuisance parameter-free asymptotic limits. The test statistics are easy to compute, as they only depend on the standardized residuals, and critical values are likewise easily obtained from the limiting distributions. This contrasts with some extant tests (based, e.g., on autocorrelations of squared residuals), where test statistics depend on the parameter estimator of the model and critical values may need to be bootstrapped. We show that our tests perform well in simulations. An empirical application to S&amp;P 500 constituents illustrates that our tests can uncover violations of residual serial independence that are not picked up by standard autocorrelation-based specification tests, yet are relevant when the model is used for, for example, risk forecasting.},

It is of interest to investigate whether the mean behavior of such functions is stable over time, and if not, to estimate the times at which apparent changes occur. Since the frequency of events may fluctuates over time, we propose a change point analysis that has two steps. In the first step, we segment the series into segments in which the frequency of events is approximately homogeneous using a new binary segmentation procedure for event frequencies. After adjusting the observed curves in each segment based on the frequency of events, we proceed in the second step by developing a method to test for and estimate change points in the mean of the observed functional data objects. We establish the consistency and asymptotic distribution of the change point detector and estimator in both steps, and study their performance using Monte Carlo simulations.

  abstract     = {Many panel data have the latent subgroup effect on individuals, and it is important to correctly identify these groups since the efficiency of resulting estimators can be improved significantly by pooling the information of individuals within each group. However, the currently assumed parametric and semiparametric relationship between the response and predictors may be misspecified, which leads to a wrong grouping result, and the nonparametric approach hence can be considered to avoid such mistakes. Moreover, the response may depend on predictors in different ways at various quantile levels, and the corresponding grouping structure may also vary. To tackle these problems, this article proposes a nonparametric quantile regression method for homogeneity pursuit in panel data models with individual effects, and a pairwise fused penalty is used to automatically select the number of groups. The asymptotic properties are established, and an ADMM algorithm is also developed. The finite sample performance is evaluated by simulation experiments, and the usefulness of the proposed methodology is further illustrated by an empirical example.},

  abstract     = {Frequentist model averaging is an effective technique to handle model uncertainty. However, calculation of the weights for averaging is extremely difficult, if not impossible, even when the dimension of the predictor vector, p , is moderate, because we may have 2 p 2 p 2p candidate models. The exponential size of the candidate model set makes it difficult to estimate all candidate models, and brings additional numeric errors when calculating the weights. This article proposes a scalable frequentist model averaging method, which is statistically and computationally efficient, to overcome this problem by transforming the original model using the singular value decomposition. The method enables us to find the optimal weights by considering at most p candidate models. We prove that the minimum loss of the scalable model averaging estimator is asymptotically equal to that of the traditional model averaging estimator. We apply the Mallows and Jackknife criteria to the scalable model averaging estimator and prove that they are asymptotically optimal estimators. We further extend the method to the high-dimensional case (i.e., p ≥ n ). Numerical studies illustrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both statistical efficiency and computational cost.},

However, because high-frequency trading data are not available during the close-to-open period, the volatility models often ignore volatility information over the close-to-open period and thus may suffer from loss of important information relevant to market dynamics. In this article, to account for whole-day market dynamics, we propose an overnight volatility model based on Itô diffusions to accommodate two different instantaneous volatility processes for the open-to-close and close-to-open periods. We develop a weighted least squares method to estimate model parameters for two different periods and investigate its asymptotic properties.},

Against this background, this article proposes a theoretically grounded nowcasting methodology that allows researchers to incorporate alternative Google Search Data (GSD) among the predictors and that combines targeted preselection, Ridge regularization, and Generalized Cross Validation. Breaking with most existing literature, which focuses on asymptotic in-sample theoretical properties, we establish the theoretical out-of-sample properties of our methodology and support them by Monte Carlo simulations. We apply our methodology to GSD to nowcast GDP growth rate of several countries during various economic periods. Our empirical findings support the idea that GSD tend to increase nowcasting accuracy, even after controlling for official variables, but that the gain differs between periods of recessions and of macroeconomic stability.},

Most existing regression approaches are based on the conditional mean and may require additional cluster information to accommodate data heterogeneity. In this article, we propose a novel nonparametric resolution-wise regression procedure to provide an estimated distribution of the response instead of one single value. We achieve this by decomposing the information of the response and the predictors into resolutions and patterns, respectively, based on marginal binary expansions. The relationships between resolutions and patterns are modeled by penalized logistic regressions. Combining the resolution-wise prediction, we deliver a histogram of the conditional response to approximate the distribution. Moreover, we show a sure independence screening property and the consistency of the proposed method for growing dimensions. Simulations and a real estate valuation dataset further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We study a new dataset from Russian government procurements focusing on the category of printing papers. We find that there is no unobserved heterogeneity (presumably because the job is routine), but bidders are highly asymmetric in their cost and risk-aversion. Our counterfactual study shows that choosing a type-specific cost-minimizing reserve price marginally reduces the procurement cost; however, inviting one more bidder substantially reduces the cost, by at least 5.5\%. Furthermore, incorrectly imposing risk-neutrality would severely mislead inference and policy recommendations, but the bias from imposing homogeneity in risk-aversion is small.},

Furthermore, we accommodate the idea of bagging in the portfolio testing problem, which helps to avoid sharp thresholding and reduces turnover costs substantially. Our Bagged Pretested Portfolio Selection (BPPS) approach borrows from both the shrinkage and the forecast combination literature. The portfolio weights of our strategy are weighted averages of the portfolio weights from a set of stand-alone strategies. More specifically, the weights are generated from pseudo-out-of-sample portfolio pretesting, such that they reflect the probability that a given strategy will be overall best performing. The resulting strategy allows for a flexible and smooth switch between the underlying strategies and outperforms the corresponding stand-alone strategies. Besides yielding high point estimates of the portfolio performance measures, the BPPS approach performs exceptionally well in terms of precision and is robust against outliers resulting from the choice of the asset space.},

Because of the model adaptation property, the test can fully use the model structure under the null hypothesis so that the dimensionality problem can be significantly alleviated. A discretization-expectation ordinary least squares estimation approach for partial central subspace in sufficient dimension reduction is developed as a by-product in the test construction. We suggest a residual-based wild bootstrap method to give an approximation by fully using the null model and thus closer to the limiting null distribution than existing bootstrap approximations.

In a second setting, we assume that proxy variables are only “plausibly exogenous” and suggest various types of inequality restrictions to bound the relation between structural shocks and the external variable. This can be combined with conventional sign restrictions to further narrow down the set of admissible models. Within a proxy-augmented SVAR, we conduct Bayesian inference and discuss computation of Bayes factors. They can be useful to test either the sign- or IV restrictions as overidentifying.

This rules out many empirically relevant applications, such as difference-in-difference designs. We develop a robustified version of the recently suggested SCPC method that addresses this challenge. We find that the method has good size properties in a wide range of Monte Carlo designs that are calibrated to real world applications, both in a pure cross sectional setting, but also for spatially correlated panel data. We provide numerically efficient methods for computing the associated spatial-correlation robust test statistics, critical values, and confidence intervals.},

As a first departure from the related literature, the model allows for two preference types. In the first one, agents behave according to standard expected utility theory with CARA Bernoulli utility function, with an agent-specific coefficient of absolute risk aversion whose distribution is left completely unspecified. In the other, agents behave according to the dual theory of choice under risk combined with a one-parameter family distortion function, where the parameter is agent-specific and is drawn from a distribution that is left completely unspecified. Within each preference type, the model allows for unobserved heterogeneity in consideration sets, where the latter form at the bundle level—a second departure from the related literature. Our point identification result rests on observing sufficient variation in covariates across contexts, without requiring any independent variation across alternatives within a single context. We estimate the model on data on households’ deductible choices in two lines of property insurance, and use the results to assess the welfare implications of a hypothetical market intervention where the two lines of insurance are combined into a single one. We study the role of limited consideration in mediating the welfare effects of such intervention.},

Given any fitted parametric option pricing model, we train a feedforward neural network on the model-implied pricing errors to correct for mispricing and boost performance. Using a large dataset of S&amp;P 500 options, we test our nonparametric correction on several parametric models ranging from ad-hoc Black–Scholes to structural stochastic volatility models and demonstrate the boosted performance for each model. Out-of-sample prediction exercises in the cross-section and in the option panel show that machine-corrected models always outperform their respective original ones, often by a large extent. Our method is relatively indiscriminate, bringing pricing errors down to a similar magnitude regardless of the misspecification of the original parametric model. Even so, correcting models that are less misspecified usually leads to additional improvements in performance and also outperforms a neural network fitted directly to the implied volatility surface.},

The model includes, as special cases, probit, logit, and Poisson regressions with interactive fixed effects along with unknown group membership. We discuss a computationally efficient estimation method and derive the corresponding asymptotic theory. Uniform consistency of the estimated group membership is established. To test heterogeneous regression coefficients within groups, we propose a Swamy-type test that allows for unobserved heterogeneity. We apply the proposed method to the study of market structure of the taxi industry in New York City.

The main insight of the article is that news that is more at odds with agents’ prior beliefs generates an increase in uncertainty; news that is more consistent with their prior beliefs generates a decrease in uncertainty. We illustrate this insight theoretically and then estimate the model empirically using data on U.S. output and professional forecasts to provide novel measures of news shocks and uncertainty. We then estimate impulse responses from the identified shocks to show that news shocks can affect macroeconomic variables in ways that resemble the effects of uncertainty shocks. Our results suggest that controlling for news can potentially diminish the estimated effects of uncertainty shocks on real variables, particularly at longer horizons.},

The idea is to allow for nonuniform kernel functions in the spot volatility estimates or the aggregated returns. This finding highlights a critical difference between the leverage effect and integrated volatility functionals, where the uniform kernel is optimal. Another distinction between these two cases is that the overlapping estimators of the leverage effect are more efficient than the nonoverlapping ones. We offer two perspectives to explain these differences: one is based on the “effective kernel” and the other on the correlation structure of the nonoverlapping estimators. The simulation study shows that the proposed estimator with a nonuniform kernel substantially increases the estimation efficiency and testing power relative to the existing ones.},

Applications in which the optimization problems arise include estimation under shape restrictions, estimation of models of discrete games, and estimation based on grouped data. The partially identified parameters are characterized by restrictions that involve the unknown population means of observed random variables in addition to structural parameters. Inference consists of finding confidence intervals for functions of the structural parameters. Our theory provides finite-sample lower bounds on the coverage probabilities of the confidence intervals under three sets of assumptions of increasing strength. With the moderate sample sizes found in most economics applications, the bounds become tighter as the assumptions strengthen. We discuss estimation of population parameters that the bounds depend on and contrast our methods with alternative methods for obtaining confidence intervals for partially identified parameters. The results of Monte Carlo experiments and empirical examples illustrate the usefulness of our method.},

This is motivated by the network homophily principle, which suggests that nodes with similar covariates tend to reside in the same community. To take advantage of the node-wise covariates, the proposed method augments the multi-layer network with an additional layer constructed from the node similarity matrix with proper scaling, and conducts a Tucker decomposition of the augmented multi-layer network, yielding the spectral embedding vector of each node for community detection. Asymptotic consistencies of the proposed method in terms of community detection are established, which are also supported by numerical experiments on various synthetic networks and two real-life multi-layer networks.},

Applying these models to high-dimensional datasets has proved to be challenging due to intensive computations and over-parameterization concerns. We develop an efficient Bayesian sparsification method for a class of models we call hybrid TVP-VARs—VARs with time-varying parameters in some equations but constant coefficients in others. Specifically, for each equation, the new method automatically decides whether the VAR coefficients and contemporaneous relations among variables are constant or time-varying. Using U.S. datasets of various dimensions, we find evidence that the parameters in some, but not all, equations are time varying. The large hybrid TVP-VAR also forecasts better than many standard benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Expectiles define the only law-invariant, coherent and elicitable risk measure apart from the expectation. The popularity of expectile-based risk measures is steadily growing and their properties have been studied for independent data, but further results are needed to establish that extreme expectiles can be applied with the kind of dependent time series models relevant to finance. In this article we provide a basis for inference on extreme expectiles and expectile-based marginal expected shortfall in a general β -mixing context that encompasses ARMA and GARCH models with heavy-tailed innovations. Our methods allow the estimation of marginal (pertaining to the stationary distribution) and dynamic (conditional on the past) extreme expectile-based risk measures. Simulations and applications to financial returns show that the new estimators and confidence intervals greatly improve on existing ones when the data are dependent.},

First, consistency and asymptotic normality of the pooled iterated principal component (IPC) estimator for random coefficient and homogeneous slope models are established. Then, we prove the asymptotic validity of the associated Wald test for slope parameter restrictions based on the panel heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (PHAC) variance matrix estimator for both random coefficient and homogeneous slope models, which does not require the Newey-West type time-series parameter truncation. These results asymptotically justify the use of the same pooled IPC estimator and the PHAC standard error for both homogeneous-slope and heterogeneous-slope models. This robust approach can significantly reduce the model selection uncertainty for applied researchers. In addition, we propose a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test for correlated random coefficients with covariates. This test has nontrivial power against correlated random coefficients, but not for random coefficients and homogeneous slopes. The LM test is important because the IPC estimator becomes inconsistent with correlated random coefficients. The finite sample evidence and an empirical application support the reliability and the usefulness of our robust approach.},

  abstract     = {This article studies multiple structural breaks in large contemporaneous covariance matrices of high-dimensional time series satisfying an approximate factor model. The breaks in the second-order moment structure of the common components are due to sudden changes in either factor loadings or covariance of latent factors, requiring appropriate transformation of the factor models to facilitate estimation of the (transformed) common factors and factor loadings via the classical principal component analysis. With the estimated factors and idiosyncratic errors, an easy-to-implement CUSUM-based detection technique is introduced to consistently estimate the location and number of breaks and correctly identify whether they originate in the common or idiosyncratic error components. The algorithms of Wild Binary Segmentation for Covariance (WBS-Cov) and Wild Sparsified Binary Segmentation for Covariance (WSBS-Cov) are used to estimate breaks in the common and idiosyncratic error components, respectively. Under some technical conditions, the asymptotic properties of the proposed methodology are derived with near-optimal rates (up to a logarithmic factor) achieved for the estimated breaks. Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of the developed method and its comparison with other existing approaches. We finally apply our method to study the contemporaneous covariance structure of daily returns of S&amp;P 500 constituents and identify a few breaks including those occurring during the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. An R package “ BSCOV ” is provided to implement the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Realized covariance matrices are often constructed under the assumption that richness of intra-day return data is greater than the portfolio size, resulting in nonsingular matrix measures. However, when for example the portfolio size is large, assets suffer from illiquidity issues, or market microstructure noise deters sampling on very high frequencies, this relation is not guaranteed. Under these common conditions, realized covariance matrices may obtain as singular by construction. Motivated by this situation, we introduce the Singular Conditional Autoregressive Wishart (SCAW) model to capture the temporal dynamics of time series of singular realized covariance matrices, extending the rich literature on econometric Wishart time series models to the singular case. This model is furthermore developed by covariance targeting adapted to matrices and a sector wise BEKK-specification, allowing excellent scalability to large and extremely large portfolio sizes. Finally, the model is estimated to a 20-year long time series containing 50 stocks and to a 10-year long time series containing 300 stocks, and evaluated using out-of-sample forecast accuracy. It outperforms the benchmark models with high statistical significance and the parsimonious specifications perform better than the baseline SCAW model, while using considerably less parameters.},

We describe sufficient conditions for global and local parameter identification that rely on simple rank assumptions on the linear dynamics and on finite order serial and component independence conditions for the non-Gaussian structural innovations. We generalize previous univariate analysis to develop asymptotically normal and efficient estimates exploiting second and higher order cumulant dynamics given a particular structural shocks ordering without assumptions on causality or invertibility.

For convenience, we refer to it as a network gradient descent (NGD) method. In the NGD method, only statistics (e.g., parameter estimates) need to be communicated, minimizing the risk of privacy. Meanwhile, different clients communicate with each other directly according to a carefully designed network structure without a central master. This greatly enhances the reliability of the entire algorithm. Those nice properties inspire us to carefully study the NGD method both theoretically and numerically. Theoretically, we start with a classical linear regression model. We find that both the learning rate and the network structure play significant roles in determining the NGD estimator’s statistical efficiency. The resulting NGD estimator can be statistically as efficient as the global estimator, if the learning rate is sufficiently small and the network structure is weakly balanced, even if the data are distributed heterogeneously. Those interesting findings are then extended to general models and loss functions. Extensive numerical studies are presented to corroborate our theoretical findings. Classical deep learning models are also presented for illustration purpose.},

This article investigates the empirical likelihood estimation of these moment-defined models in high-dimensional settings. We propose a penalized empirical likelihood (PEL) estimation and establish its oracle property with consistent detection of invalid moments. The PEL estimator is asymptotically normally distributed, and a projected PEL procedure further eliminates its asymptotic bias and provides more accurate normal approximation to the finite sample behavior.

We show that with probability approaching one the approach can correctly determine the number of breaks and the dates of these breaks, and that the estimator of the regime-specific regression coefficients is consistent and asymptotically normal.

However, when the dimensionality of the covariates is large, the minimum distance estimation using this process is computationally demanding. To overcome this problem, we propose a two-step estimation method based on the quantile regression and minimum distance methods. We then show the uniform asymptotic properties of our estimator and the validity of the nonparametric bootstrap. The Monte Carlo studies indicate that our estimator performs well in finite samples.

Existing approaches require the researcher to compute and combine many first- and second-order derivatives, which can be difficult to do and is susceptible to error. Bootstrap methods are simpler to apply, allowing the substitution of capital (CPU cycles) for labor (keeping track of derivatives). We show the consistency of the bootstrap distribution and consistency of bootstrap variance estimators, thereby justifying the use of bootstrap percentile intervals and bootstrap standard errors.},

We augment the model with information from the survey expectations by aligning the first and second moments of the predictive distribution implied by this baseline model with those extracted from the survey information at various horizons. Results indicate that survey information bears valuable information over the baseline model for nowcasting GDP. While the mean survey predictions deliver valuable information during extreme events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the variation in the survey participants’ predictions, often used as a measure of “ambiguity,” conveys crucial information beyond the mean of those predictions for capturing the tail behavior of the GDP distribution.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with structural breaks is an essential step in most empirical economic research. This is particularly true in panel data comprised of many cross-sectional units, which are all affected by major events. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected most sectors of the global economy; however, its impact on stock markets is still unclear. Most markets seem to have recovered while the pandemic is ongoing, suggesting that the relationship between stock returns and COVID-19 has been subject to structural break. It is therefore important to know if a structural break has occurred and, if it has, to infer the date of the break. Motivated by this last observation, the present article develops a new break detection toolbox that is applicable to different sized panels, easy to implement and robust to general forms of unobserved heterogeneity. The toolbox, which is the first of its kind, includes a structural change test, a break date estimator, and a break date confidence interval. Application to a panel covering 61 countries from January 3 to September 25, 2020, leads to the detection of a structural break that is dated to the first week of April. The effect of COVID-19 is negative before the break and zero thereafter, implying that while markets did react, the reaction was short-lived. A possible explanation is the quantitative easing programs announced by central banks all over the world in the second half of March.},

In this corrigendum, we review the CR2 variance estimator, describe the assertion of the theorem as originally stated, and demonstrate the error with a counter-example.

While iterative PCA requires iteration and is hence time-consuming, CCA can only deal with two groups of data. Herein, we develop two new methods to address these problems. We first extract the factors within groups and then project the estimated group factors into the space spanned by them in a circular manner. We propose two projection processes to estimate the common factors and determine the number of them. The new methods do not require iteration and are thus computationally efficient. They can estimate the common factors for multiple groups of data in a uniform way, regardless of whether the number of groups is large or small. They not only overcome the drawbacks of CCA but also nest the CCA method as a special case. Finally, we theoretically and numerically study the consistency properties of these new methods and apply them to studying international business cycles and the comovements of retail prices.},

In such a nonlinear model, the presence of a lagged latent variable results in an intractable likelihood containing high-dimensional integrals. To tackle this problem, we use composite likelihoods that involve a much lower order of integration. However, parameter identification might potentially become problematic since the information employed in lower dimensional distributions may not be rich enough for identification. Therefore, we characterize types of composite likelihoods that are valid for this model and study conditions under which the parameters can be identified. Moreover, we provide consistency and asymptotic normality results for two different composite likelihood estimators and conduct Monte Carlo studies to assess their finite-sample performances.

We observe that the standardized ordinary least-square estimates of α ’s across the funds possess strong dependence and nonnormality structures, indicating that the conventional multiple testing methods are inadequate for selecting the skilled funds. We start from a decision theoretical perspective, and propose an optimal multiple testing procedure to minimize a combination of false discovery rate and false nondiscovery rate. Our proposed testing procedure is constructed based on the probability of each fund not being skilled conditional on the information across all of the funds in our study. To model the distribution of the information used for the testing procedure, we consider a mixture model under dependence and propose a new method called “approximate empirical Bayes” to fit the parameters. Empirical studies show that our selected skilled funds have superior long-term and short-term performance, for example, our selection strongly outperforms the S&amp;P 500 index during the same period.},

In this paper, we extend these methods to provide reconciled historical true GDP estimates at a monthly frequency. We do this using a Bayesian mixed frequency vector autoregression (MF-VAR) involving GDP E , GDP I , unobserved true GDP, and monthly indicators of short-term economic activity. Our MF-VAR imposes restrictions that reflect a measurement-error perspective (i.e., the two GDP proxies are assumed to equal true GDP plus measurement error). Without further restrictions, our model is unidentified. We consider a range of restrictions that allow for point and set identification of true GDP and show that they lead to informative monthly GDP estimates. We illustrate how these new monthly data contribute to our historical understanding of business cycles and we provide a real-time application nowcasting monthly GDP over the pandemic recession.},

Our simulation study indicates that the subsampling method is more robust than the plug-in method based on the asymptotic expression for the variance. We use our subsampling method to study the dynamics of financial betas of six stocks on the NYSE. We document significant variation in betas, and find that tick data captures more variation in betas than the data sampled at moderate frequencies such as every 5 or 20 min. To capture this variation we estimate a simple dynamic model for betas. The variance estimation is also important for the correction of the errors-in-variables bias in such models. We find that the bias corrections are substantial, and that betas are more persistent than the naive estimators would lead one to believe.},

Our combination method extends earlier approaches that have been applied to oil price forecasting, by allowing for sequentially updating of time-varying combination weights, estimation of time-varying forecast biases and facets of miscalibration of individual forecast densities and time-varying inter-dependencies among models. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, we present an extensive set of empirical results about time-varying forecast uncertainty and risk for the real price of oil over the period 1974–2018. We show that the combination approach systematically outperforms commonly used benchmark models and combination approaches, both in terms of point and density forecasts. The dynamic patterns of the estimated individual model weights are highly time-varying, reflecting a large time variation in the relative performance of the various individual models. The combination approach has built-in diagnostic information measures about forecast inaccuracy and/or model set incompleteness, which provide clear signals of model incompleteness during three crisis periods. To highlight that our approach also can be useful for policy analysis, we present a basic analysis of profit-loss and hedging against price risk.},

To allow for heterogeneity in the long-run relationships, we consider a panel ECM with latent group structures so that all the stocks within a group share the same long-run relationship and do not otherwise. We extend the Classifier-Lasso method to the ECM to simultaneously identify the individual’s group membership and estimate the group-specific long-run relationship. We establish the uniform classification consistency and good asymptotic properties of the post-Lasso estimators under some regularity conditions. Empirically, we find that more than 30\% of the Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) 1500 stocks have estimated efficient prices significantly deviating from the midpoint—a conventional measure of efficient price. Such deviations explored from our data-driven method can provide dynamic information on the extent and direction of informed trading activities.},

The nonparametric part is modeled as a product of a deterministic time trend component and of further components that depend on stochastic regressors. We propose a two-step procedure to estimate the model. To estimate the nonparametric components, we transform the model and apply a backfitting procedure. The GARCH parameters are estimated in a second step via quasi maximum likelihood. We show consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimators. Our results are obtained using mixing properties and local stationarity. We illustrate our method using financial data. Finally, a small simulation study illustrates a substantial bias in the GARCH parameter estimates when omitting the stochastic regressors.},

It generalizes the proposed score and defines a weighted version, which emphasizes regions of interest, such as the tails or the center of a variable’s range. The (weighted) ACPS extends the symmetric (weighted) CRPS by allowing for asymmetries in the preferences underlying the scoring rule. A test is used to statistically compare the predictive ability of different forecasts. The ACPS is of general use in any situation where the decision-maker has asymmetric preferences in the evaluation of the forecasts. In an artificial experiment, the implications of varying the level of asymmetry in the ACPS are illustrated. Then, the proposed score and test are applied to assess and compare density forecasts of macroeconomic relevant datasets (U.S. employment growth) and of commodity prices (oil and electricity prices) with particular focus on the recent COVID-19 crisis period.},

The GMVP weights are the population coefficients of a linear regression of a benchmark return on a vector of return differences. This representation enables us to derive a consistent loss function from which we can infer the GMVP weights without imposing any distributional assumptions on the returns. In order to capture time variation in the returns’ conditional covariance structure, we model the portfolio weights through a recursive least squares (RLS) scheme as well as by generalized autoregressive score (GAS) type dynamics. Sparse parameterizations and targeting toward the weights of the equally weighted portfolio ensure scalability with respect to the number of assets. We apply these models to daily stock returns, and find that they perform well compared to existing static and dynamic approaches in terms of both the expected loss and unconditional portfolio variance.},

The proposed model is able to capture complex volatility effects, for example, nonlinearity and long-memory auto-dependence, overlooked by the conventional SV models, is statistically interpretable and has an impressive out-of-sample forecast performance. These properties are carefully discussed and illustrated through extensive simulation studies and applications to five international stock index datasets: the German stock index DAX30, the Hong Kong stock index HSI50, the France market index CAC40, the U.S. stock market index SP500 and the Canada market index TSX250.

The resulting estimators of θ are asymptotically normal. The proposed procedure can substantially overcome convergence problems encountered in generalized linear models with discrete response variables when sparseness occurs and misspecification.

We introduce the concept of exact robustness to measurement error for loss functions and fully characterize this class of loss functions as the Bregman class. Hence, only conditional mean forecasts can be evaluated exactly robustly. For such exactly robust loss functions, forecast loss differences are on average unaffected by the use of proxy variables and, thus, inference on conditional predictive ability can be carried out as usual. Moreover, we show that more precise proxies give predictive ability tests higher power in discriminating between competing forecasts. Simulations illustrate the different behavior of exactly robust and nonrobust loss functions. An empirical application to U.S. GDP growth rates demonstrates the nonrobustness of quantile forecasts. It also shows that it is easier to discriminate between mean forecasts issued at different horizons if a better proxy for GDP growth is used.},

Due to the short T, traditional methods have difficulty in disentangling the heterogeneous parameters from the shocks, which contaminates the estimates of the heterogeneous parameters. To tackle this problem, I assume that there is an underlying distribution of heterogeneous parameters, model this distribution nonparametrically allowing for correlation between heterogeneous parameters and initial conditions as well as individual-specific regressors, and then estimate this distribution by combining information from the whole panel. Theoretically, I prove that in cross-sectional homoscedastic cases, both the estimated common parameters and the estimated distribution of the heterogeneous parameters achieve posterior consistency, and that the density forecasts asymptotically converge to the oracle forecast. Methodologically, I develop a simulation-based posterior sampling algorithm specifically addressing the nonparametric density estimation of unobserved heterogeneous parameters. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to young firm dynamics demonstrate improvements in density forecasts relative to alternative approaches.},

The conditions underlying the asymptotic validity of our (pseudo-)simulators in conjunction with appropriate bootstraps are characterized beyond the strict and exact calibration of the parameters of the simulator. Our procedure is illustrated through impulse-response (IR) matching in a simulation study of a stylized dynamic stochastic equilibrium model, and two empirical applications on the New Keynesian Phillips curve and on the Industrial Production index. In addition to usual Wald-type statistics that combine structural or reduced form IRs, we analyze local projections IRs through a factor-analytic measure of distance which eschews the need to define a weighting matrix.},

  abstract     = {Single-index quantile regression (QR) models can avoid the curse of dimensionality in nonparametric problems by assuming that the response is only related to a single linear combination of the covariates. Like the standard parametric or nonparametric QR whose estimated curves may cross, the single-index QR can also suffer quantile crossing, leading to an invalid distribution for the response. This issue has attracted considerable attention in the literature in the recent year. In this article, we consider single-index models, develop methods for QR that guarantee noncrossing quantile curves, and extend the methods and results to composite quantile regression. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived and their advantages over existing methods are explained. Simulation studies and a real data application are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {A model for dynamic independent component analysis is introduced where the dynamics are driven by the score of the pseudo likelihood with respect to the rotation angle of model innovations. While conditional second moments are invariant with respect to rotations, higher conditional moments are not, which may have important implications for applications. The pseudo maximum likelihood estimator of the model is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. A simulation study reports good finite sample properties of the estimator, including the case of a misspecification of the innovation density. In an application to a bivariate exchange rate series of the Euro and the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar, it is shown that the model-implied conditional portfolio kurtosis largely aligns with narratives on financial stress as a result of the global financial crisis in 2008, the European sovereign debt crisis (2010–2013) and early rumors signalling the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (2017). These insights are consistent with a recently proposed model that associates portfolio kurtosis with a geopolitical risk factor.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional data are nowadays readily available and increasingly common in various fields of empirical economics. This article considers estimation and model selection for a high-dimensional censored linear regression model. We combine l 1 l 1 l1 -penalization method with the ideas of pairwise difference and propose an l 1 l 1 l1 -penalized pairwise difference least absolute deviations (LAD) estimator. Estimation consistency and model selection consistency of the estimator are established under regularity conditions. We also propose a post-penalized estimator that applies unpenalized pairwise difference LAD estimation to the model selected by the l 1 -penalized estimator, and find that the post-penalized estimator generally can perform better than the l 1 -penalized estimator in terms of the rate of convergence. Novel fast algorithms for computing the proposed estimators are provided based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. A simulation study is conducted to show the great improvements of our algorithms in terms of computation time and to illustrate the satisfactory statistical performance of our estimators.},
