  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence systems cannot yet match human abilities to apply knowledge to situations that vary from what they have been programmed for, or trained for. In visual object recognition, methods of inference exploiting top-down information (from a model) have been shown to be effective for recognising entities in difficult conditions. Here a component of this type of inference, called ‘projection’, is shown to be a key mechanism to solve the problem of applying knowledge to varied or challenging situations, across a range of AI domains, such as vision, robotics, or language. Finally, the relevance of projection to tackling the commonsense knowledge problem is discussed.},

  abstract     = {The video summarisation is an advanced mechanism for enabling users to handle and browse large videos in an effective manner. Various video summarisation methods are developed in recent days, in which handling of synchronisation and timing issues remain as the important challenge. The proposed video summarisation technique produces a short summary from the huge video stream. Initially, from an input database, the cricket videos containing number of frames are fed to keyframe extraction unit. Here, the keyframe extraction is done by the Euclidean distance and discrete cosine transform, and the best keyframes are selected based on the Euclidean distance. The residual frame is obtained by passing the input frames through deep convolutional neural network. Then, the similarity is calculated by Bhattacharyya distance. For video summarisation process, the optimal frameset is evaluated by matching residual keyframe with obtained keyframes. Here, input queries consisting of face object are subjected to object matching process, which is performed using the proposed mutual probability-based k-nearest neighbour (MP-KNN) to obtain relevant frames based on texture features. The performance of the proposed MP-KNN is superior based on precision, recall, and F-measure with values 0.963, 0.960, and 0.909, respectively.},

Research on multi-agent planning area presents recovery strategies with replanning and repairing with evaluation based simply on average values. Thus, in this work, we propose a statistical method to evaluate plan recovery strategies in dynamic environments using a domain-independent approach. To validate the proposed method, we conducted simulated experiments with varying the number of agents, goals, actions, failure probability, and agents’ coupling levels. The evaluation metrics include plan length and planning time. The results highlight with at least 94% certainty that repairing planning time is lower than replanning, and replanning builds plans with fewer actions than repairing. Considering plan recovery strategies in dynamic multi-agent environments, we demonstrate that repairing presents better results as it is faster, but replanning builds better plans as the final plan length is strongly correlated to failure occurrence.},

  abstract     = {Customer segmentation is a challenging task in marketing that aims to build homogeneous segments of customers based on their similar characteristics and activities. This problem is considered multi-objective since it requires the evaluation of several variables including descriptive and predictive characteristics of customers. However, given that most exiting segmentation methods are based on the optimisation of a single-objective function, the identification of homogeneous customer segments in terms of both predictive and descriptive variables becomes a major issue. Descriptive and predictive characteristics are usually considered as two different and independent objectives, which cannot be optimised together. To deal with this problem, we propose a multi-objective segmentation approach based on three conceptual axes: descriptive, predictive, and quality-validation. In addition to the specificity of design of the multi-objective model, our proposed approach has the specificity of directly optimising the multi-objective problem using a customised genetic algorithm that directly approximates a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. We have applied and evaluated the proposed approach in an empirical study which aims to segment bank credit card customers using their descriptive characteristics and their predictive behaviour. Obtained results have shown the ability of the proposed approach to look for effective homogeneous segments and help decision-makers propose more tailored marketing strategies.},

  abstract     = {Despite the recent popularity of contextual word embeddings, static word embeddings still dominate lexical semantic tasks, making their study of continued relevance. A widely adopted family of such static word embeddings is derived by explicitly factorising the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) weighting of the co-occurrence matrix. As unobserved co-occurrences lead PMI to negative infinity, a common workaround is to clip negative PMI at 0. However, it is unclear what information is lost by collapsing negative PMI values to 0. To answer this question, we isolate and study the effects of negative (and positive) PMI on the semantics and geometry of models adopting factorisation of different PMI matrices. Word and sentence-level evaluations show that only accounting for positive PMI in the factorisation strongly captures both semantics and syntax, whereas using only negative PMI captures little of semantics but a surprising amount of syntactic information. Results also reveal that incorporating negative PMI induces stronger rank invariance of vector norms and directions, as well as improved rare word representations.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates how agents learn and perform efficient strategies by trying different actions in asymmetric confrontation setting. Firstly, we use Gomoku as an example to analyse the causes and impacts of asymmetric confrontation: the first mover gains higher power than the second mover. We find that the first mover learns how to attack quickly while it is difficult for the second mover to learn how to defend since it cannot win the first mover and always receives negative rewards. As such, the game is stuck at a deadlock in which the first mover cannot make further advances to learn how to defend, and the second mover learns nothing. Secondly, we propose an ancillary mechanism (AM) to add two principles to the agent’s actions to overcome this difficulty. AM is a guidance for the agents to reduce the learning difficulty and to improve their behavioural quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to define asymmetric confrontation in reinforcement learning and propose approaches to tackle such problems. In the numerical tests, we first conduct a simple human vs AI experiment to calibrate the learning process in asymmetric confrontation. Then, an experiment of 15*15 Gomoku game by letting two agents (with AM and without AM) compete is applied to check the potential of AM. Results show that adding AM can make both the first and the second movers become stronger in almost the same amount of calculation.},

First, EMD is used to decompose the coal and gas outbursts index features into a number of different IMFS; Second, in order to find out the relevance of IMFS with regard to the features, a wrapper algorithm Boruta with the RF classifier is employed, and the IMFS which has high relevance with the feature are selected to form a new index feature, then the new obtained features construct new influencing factors that affect coal and gas outbursts; Furtherly, in order to eliminate the redundancy between the new generated features and the uncorrelation between the index features and outbursts, the LDA is used to extract the features with class differentiation. Finally, the SVM classifiers based on the optimal parameters by Bayesian optimisation algorithm is employed to evaluate the proposed feature extraction scheme. Experimental results show that the proposed comprehensive model can achieve significant performance in terms of classification accuracy and feature size compared to existing methods for coal and gas outbursts classification.},

Sub-symbolical approaches have proven successful in fields like image recognition and natural language processing, but the combination of these techniques into a multimodal approach towards the identification of the puzzle’s answer appears to be a matter of reasoning, more suitable for the application of a symbolic technique. In this work, we employ logic programming to perform spatial reasoning on the puzzle’s diagram and integrate the deriving knowledge into the solving process. Analysing the resolution strategies required by the puzzles of an international competition for humans, we draw the design principles of a Prolog reasoning library, which interacts with image processing software to formulate the puzzle’s constraints. The library integrates the knowledge from different sources, and relies on the Prolog inference engine to provide the answer. This work can be considered as a first step towards the ambitious goal of a machine autonomously solving a problem in a generic context starting from its textual-graphical presentation.

In this paper, a newly proposed Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is used, and its performance is compared with deterministic and other Nature-Inspired Algorithms (NIAs). The results illustrate that SSA outperforms all the other meta-heuristic algorithms in route planning for multiple UAVs in a 3D environment.

CF-PPI considers the residual energy of the protein bond in the scenario to detect the interaction between proteins and resolve the protein’s length variation issue using probabilistic feature vectors. The PPI datasets which are used in this article are S. cerevisae , H. pylori , and H uman , which achieved the average accuracy of 96.25%, 97.68%, and 97.69% respectively using the CF-PPI and Random Forest as a classifier and the comparison result proved superior to other existing results. The AUC score is also evaluated, additionally, a blind test is performed using five other species’ datasets which are independent of the training set with the same proposed feature approach. The experimental results prove that the CF-PPI is very promising and beneficial for looming proteomics research.},

The first process is the pre-processing, in which RGB to grey-scale conversion, histogram equalisation, and median filtering are adopted. Further, the optimised U-Net model is used for the leaf segmentation. Once the segmentation of the leaf is done, a set of features are extracted related to shape, colour, and texture. Since the length of the feature vector seems to be high that in turn affects the network training, optimal feature selection is adopted in order to reduce data dimensionality and to build robust classification models. Here, the optimal feature selection is performed by the new hybrid algorithm, namely Crow-Electric Fish Optimization (C-EFO), which is the hybridisation of Electric Fish Optimization (EFO) and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA). Finally, the deep learning model termed as Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (E-RNN) is used for performing the classification with the improvement based on C-EFO. From the analysis, the accuracy of the proposed C-EFO+Opt-U-Net+E-RNN is 4.7% better than k-NN, 3.5% better than VGG16, 3.5% better than LSTM, and 2.75% better than RNN, respectively. Finally, the experimental results on two plant leaf databases show that the proposed method is quite effective and feasible when compared to conventional models.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript proposes the optimal allocation of hybrid power flow controller (HPFC) using hybrid technique. The proposed technique is the implementation of Integrated Slime Mould Algorithm (ISMA). The searching behaviour of Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) is enhanced by the position updating behaviour of the whale optimisation algorithm (WOA). HPFC, a hybrid topology, has VAR compensator or an impedance-type FACTS device, most probably obtainable at power system, and two voltage source converters depend on controllers share a general DC link. The novel contributions of allocating HPFC at optimal location for multi-objective fitness functions denote minimal real power loss of system as well as minimal generation cost using ISMA method. Here, ISMA method optimises maximum line of power loss as appropriate location of unified power flow controller (UPFC). The optimal location parameters and dynamic stability restrictions are restored with normal constraints, employing UPFC optimal capacity has been optimised to decreased cost with the help of ISMA technique.},

  abstract     = {A new multiobjective evolutionary optimisation algorithm (MOEA) to solve multimodal, multidimensional, nonconvex, nonlinear, dynamic multiobjective optimisation problems (MOPs) is the need of the hour. The quality of an MOEA lies in a good balance between the exploration and exploitation stages of the MOEA. Utopia constrained MOEA (U-MOEA) is proposed in this paper that improves the exploitation in the replacement step to achieve a perfect balance between exploration and exploitation. The proposed U-MOEA is tested on benchmark MOPs and a multivariable controller design problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also compared with other MOEAs such as NSGA-II and ICMDRA concerning hyper volume, nondomination count, combined Pareto set metric, and C metric . The performance metrics show better hyper volume and spread metric values for the proposed algorithm, indicating the ability in attaining trade-off region closeness along with diversified Pareto front for U-MOEA when compared to the other two algorithms. Results clearly show that the proposed U-MOEA produces good convergence, diversity characteristics with many numbers of trade-off solutions in a Pareto front.},

  abstract     = {In divergent interest tacit coordination games there is a tradeoff between selecting a solution with a high individual payoff and one which is perceptually more salient to both players, i.e., a focal point . To construct a cognitive model of decision making in such games we need to consider both the social value orientation of the players and the game features. Therefore, the goal of this study was to construct a cognitive model for predicting the probability of selecting a focal point solution in these types of games. Using bootstrap aggregated ensemble of decision trees that was trained on the “bargaining table’ game behavioural data were able to predict when players will select a focal point solution. The binary classification achieved an accuracy level of 85%. The main contribution of the current study is the ability to model players behaviour based on the interaction between different SVOs and game features. This interaction enabled us to gain different insights regarding player’s behaviour. For example, a prosocial player often showed a tendency towards focal point solutions even when their personal gains were lower than that of the co-player. Thus, SVO is not a sufficient model for explaining behaviour in different divergent interest scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Automated planning is a prominent Artificial Intelligence (AI) challenge that has been extensively studied for decades, which has led to the development of powerful domain-independent planning systems. The performance of domain-independent planning systems are strongly affected by the structure of the search space, that is dependent on the application domain and on its encoding. This paper proposes and investigates a novel way of combining machine learning and heuristic search to improve domain-independent planning. On the learning side, we use learning to predict the plan cost of a good solution for a given instance. On the planning side, we propose a bound-sensitive heuristic function that exploits such a prediction in a state-space planner. Our function combines the input prediction (derived inductively) with some pieces of information gathered during search (derived deductively). As the prediction can sometimes be grossly inaccurate, the function also provides means to recognise when the provided information is actually misguiding the search. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach in a standard heuristic best-first search schema.},

This paper presents a multi-phase clustering solution that achieves good accuracy measures even in the case of noisy and not- well-separated data (linearly not separable data). The proposed design combines a two-stage Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) clustering with K-means logic and a state-of-the-art outlier removal technique. The use of two different optimisation criteria in the two stages of PSO clustering equips the model with the ability to escape local minima traps in the process of convergence. Extensive experiments featuring a wide variety of data have been carried out and the system could achieve accuracy levels as high as 99.9% and an average of 87.4% on notwell-separated data. The model has also been proved to be robust on eight out of the ten datasets of the Fundamental Clustering Problem Suit (FCPS), a benchmark for clustering algorithms.},

Meanwhile, deep learning has been successfully implemented to classify and predict dementia disease. However, the accuracy of MRI image classification is low. This paper aims to increase the accuracy and reduce the processing time of classification through Deep Learning Architecture by using Elastic Net Regularisation in Feature Selection. The proposed system consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance the accuracy of classification and prediction by using Elastic Net Regularisation. Initially, the MRI images are fed into CNN for features extraction through convolutional layers alternate with pooling layers, and then through a fully connected layer. After that, the features extracted are subjected to Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Elastic Net Regularisation for feature selection. Finally, the selected features are used as an input to Extreme Machine Learning (EML) for the classification of MRI images. The result shows that the accuracy of the proposed solution is better than the current system. In addition to that, the proposed method has improved the classification accuracy by 5% on average and reduced the processing time by 30 ~ 40 seconds on average. The proposed system is focused on improving the accuracy and processing time of MCI converters/non-converters classification. It consists of features extraction, feature selection, and classification using CNN, FreeSurfer, PCA, Elastic Net, and Extreme Machine Learning. Finally, this study enhances the accuracy and the processing time by using Elastic Net Regularisation, which provides important selected features for classification.},

CVD is the major cause of death all over the world for the past years because an estimation of 17.5 million people died from CVD in 2012 and premature death from CVD is 37% below the age of 70. In health-care field, the data generated are large, critical, and more complex and multi-dimensional. In the current situation, the medical professionals working in the field of heart disease can predict up to 67% accuracy but the doctors need an accurate prediction of heart disease. The ultimate goal of this study is to early prediction of CVD by enhancing both predictive analysis and probabilistic classification. Deep learning techniques such as CNN and RNN emulate human cognition and learn from training examples to predict future events. As a result, the future prediction of the cardiovascular disease has been found. The prediction of CVD can be used for the prevention of COVID-19 disease using deep learning algorithm. So, this can be employed to detect the early stage of the disease. The importance of the CVD refers to the conditions like narrowed or blocked blood vessels which may lead to some other diseases like heart attack, chest pain or stroke.},

Most of the cloud challenges are NP-hard problems; therefore, many meta-heuristic techniques have been used for solving these challenges. As a famous and powerful meta-heuristic algorithm, the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) algorithm has been recently used for solving many challenges in the cloud. However, in spite of the ACO potency for solving optimisation problems, its application in solving cloud issues in the form of a review article has not been studied so far. Therefore, this paper provides a complete and detailed study of the different types of ACO algorithms for solving the important problems and issues in cloud computing. Also, the number of published papers for various publishers and different years is shown. In this paper, available challenges are classified into different groups, including scheduling, resource allocation, load balancing, consolidation, virtual machine placement, service composition, energy consumption, and replication. Then, some of the selected important techniques from each category by applying the selection process are presented. Besides, this study shows the comparison of the reviewed approaches and also it highlights their principal elements. Finally, it highlights the relevant open issues and some clues to explain the difficulties. The results revealed that there are still some challenges in the cloud environments that the ACO is not applied to solve.},

  abstract     = {Smart devices and people existing on the internet are connected to smart objects or things in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. To protect the user information, it is required to detect malicious actions in the IoT environment. Even though different threat detection methods are introduced in the IoT technology, detecting malicious activity is still a significant challenge in the communication network. Hence, in this research work, an effective Cuckoo Search Chicken Swarm (CSCS) optimisation algorithm is proposed to detect the malicious threat in the network effectively. At first, the user activity information is simulated from the IoT network and stored in the user activity log. The user activity log file is forwarded to the feature extraction module, where the features, like logon, device, file, email, and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) are extracted using the window length. For each user, the features are extracted with respect to the time stamp. Then, the dynamic feature index is constructed, and the threat detection is performed using the deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier, which is trained using the proposed CSCS algorithm. The proposed CSCS algorithm is designed by integrating the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm and the Chicken Swarm Optimisation (CSO) algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm attained better performance with respect to the metrics, like namely F1-score, precision, and recall as 0.915, 0.975, and 0.884 by varying the k-value and 0.9286, 0.9235, and 0.9337 by varying the training data using window size as 10, respectively.},

Initially, the Mongodb documented tweets are subjected to pre-processing that includes steps such as stop word removal, stemming, and blank space removal. Accordingly, from the pre-processed tweets, the keywords are extracted. Based on the extracted keywords, the prevailing semantic words are extracted after classifying the sentimental keywords. Further, the evaluation of the semantic similarity score with the keywords takes place. Also, it exploits joint holoentropy and cross holoentropy. Here, the extraction of weighted holoentropy features is the main contribution, where a weight function is multiplied by the holoentropy features. To improve the performance of classification, a constant term is used for calculating weight function. It is tuned or optimised in such a way that the accuracy of the proposed method is better. The optimisation strategy uses the hybrid model that merges Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) into Whale Optimisation Algorithm (WOA). Hence, the proposed algorithm is named as Swarm Velocity-based WOA (SV-WOA). Finally, the analysis is done to prove the efficiency of the proposed model.},

It is particularly suitable for learning and predicting sequential data. However, when dealing with long time series or complex sequences, the accuracy is relatively lower than desired. In this paper, a novel hierarchical temporal memory based on recurrent learning unit is proposed, where a feedback mechanism is involved into the model. The original cell is extended with a recurrent unit to capture long temporal dependencies of synaptic connections between neurons. The temporal pooler algorithm is then modified to adapt to the recurrent learning unit, and the supervised gradient information is combined with the Hebbian synaptogenesis learning rule in speeding up the training. The prototype of the proposed hierarchical temporal memory is implemented and extensive experiments are carried out on two public datasets under various settings. Experimental results show that the proposed model obtains an accuracy increase by up to 32% and a perplexity drop by up to 14% on sequence prediction and text generation tasks, respectively, which indicates the hierarchical temporal memory with recurrent feedback outperforms the original model on sequence learning.},

  abstract     = {Artificial General intelligence (AGI) offers enormous benefits for humanity, yet it also poses great risk. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the peer reviewed literature on the risks associated with AGI. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Sixteen articles were deemed eligible for inclusion. Article types included in the review were classified as philosophical discussions, applications of modelling techniques, and assessment of current frameworks and processes in relation to AGI. The review identified a range of risks associated with AGI, including AGI removing itself from the control of human owners/managers, being given or developing unsafe goals, development of unsafe AGI, AGIs with poor ethics, morals and values; inadequate management of AGI, and existential risks. Several limitations of the AGI literature base were also identified, including a limited number of peer reviewed articles and modelling techniques focused on AGI risk, a lack of specific risk research in which domains that AGI may be implemented, a lack of specific definitions of the AGI functionality, and a lack of standardised AGI terminology. Recommendations to address the identified issues with AGI risk research are required to guide AGI design, implementation, and management.},

  abstract     = {The new emerging blockchain (BC) technology integrated with the IoT ecosystem revolutionised the IoT world. Classic BC with bitcoin method was realised as very expensive operations difficult to adopt for smart IoT applications; therefore, we integrated IoT network with overlay BC with distributed ledger capability to provide a secure trust management system, which can address access control issues of devices on resources. Further, the R-LEACH protocol followed by the same group urges additional cluster head requirement to establish trust between nodes is not considered in our proposed approach. The main advantage of this method is utilising ledgers for holding the trust and IoT information ensuring tamper-proof data. The miners of blockchain layer perform the trust value calculations based on trust evidence and achieved fast trust convergence, accuracy, and resilience against adversary attacks. Our proposed approach enhances privacy, reliability, availability, and more importantly, sharing and storage of trust information and also followed the consensus mechanism Proof-of-Authority (PoA) to approve the synthesis trust value of related transactions by the pre-authenticated miners/validators, from which we can take more accurate trust-based decisions. Performance results of our blockchain-based trust management approach outperformed literature review trust mechanisms for protecting trust data manipulation against the malicious nodes.},

An enhanced version of the DDPG is also presented to handle multiple robot arms simultaneously. The trained agents are successfully tested in the Unity Machine Learning Agents environment for controlling both a single robot arm as well as multiple simultaneous robot arms.

  abstract     = {This work introduces a novel privacy preservation scheme. In large databases, the data sanitisation process preserves the stored sensitive data safely from unauthorised access and users by hiding it. Moreover, the statistical features are extracted. Further, the normalised data and features are processed under the data sanitisation process. For the sanitisation process, the optimal key is produced by utilising the Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Chaotic Map-adopted Poor and Rich Optimisation (CMPRO) model. It is the modified version of the classical PRO algorithm. As a novelty, chaotic map and cycle crossover operation is included in the CMPRO algorithm. Privacy, modification degree, data preservation ratio, and hiding failure are considered as the objectives for the key generation process. Then, the data restoration process restores or recovers the sanitised data, and it is the reverse process. Then, the outcomes of the adopted scheme are analysed over the traditional systems based on certain measures.

The misinformation spread during COVID-19 pandemic increased many folds. Understanding the reasons and intent of the misinformation during COVID-19 is a crucial task. Existing approaches have not focused on understanding the intent behind sharing misinformation in the first place. To understand the intent, we introduce a new dataset MisMemoir that apart from annotating misinformation, also collects the social context and site history of the user sharing misinformation. Utilising the established benefits of game theory in social media behaviour analysis, we deploy two-person cooperative games to understand how prominent positive feedback cues like likes and retweets are in motivating an individual to share misinformation on the platform Twitter. Experimental results demonstrate that the spread of misinformation’s primary intent is the intentional/unintentional manoeuvre to increased reach and possibly a false sense of accomplishment. Empirically, we show that in a competitive environment like social media, feedback cues like retweets and comments assume the role of ‘attention’ payoff that significantly affects the strategy of a user on Twitter to share misinformation intentionally.},

  abstract     = {The proportion of COVID-19 patients is significantly expanding around the world. Treatment with serious consideration has become a significant problem. Identifying clinical indicators of succession towards severe conditions is desperately required to empower hazard stratification and optimise resource allocation in the pandemic of COVID-19. Consequently, the classification of severity level is significant for the patient’s triaging. It is required to categorise the severity level as mild, moderate, severe, and critical based on the patients’ symptoms. Various symptomatic parameters may encourage the evaluation of infection seriousness. Likewise, with the rapid spread and transmissibility of COVID-19 patients, it is crucial to utilise telemonitoring schemes for COVID-19 patients. Telemonitoring mediation encourages remote data and information exchange among medicinal services, suppliers, and patients, furthermore, risk mitigation and provision of appropriate medical facilities. This paper provides explorative data analysis of symptoms, comorbidities, and other parameters, comparing different machine learning algorithms for case severity detection. This paper also provides a system (based on the degree of truthfulness) for case severity detection that might be utilised to stratify risk levels for anticipated moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. Finally, we provide a telemonitoring model of COVID-19 patients to ensure the remote and continuous monitoring of case severity progression and appropriate risk mitigation strategies.},

Scientists utilised different approaches for the detection and characterisation of CoVs using samples such as serum, throat swabs, nose swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages. The two common approaches include antigen-based approach and molecular diagnostic approach, which are hindered by limitations such as low sensitivity and requirement for high level of biosafety during isolation of the virus from cell culture. Thus, there is a need for developing a more rapid, sensitive, simple and cheap diagnostic kit for diagnosis of different strains of coronavirus.

Recognition of COVID-19 is a challenging task. The most commonly used methods are X-ray and CT scans images to inspect COVID-19 patients. It requires specialised medical professionals to report each patient’s health manually. It is found that COVID-19 shows considerable similarity to pneumonia lung disease. Thus, knowledge learned from a model to diagnose pneumonia can be translated to identify COVID-19. Transfer learning method offers a drastic performance when compared with results from conventional classification. In this study, Image pre-processing is done to alleviate intensity variations between medical images. These processed images undergo a feature extraction which is accomplished using Q-deformed entropy and deep learning extraction. The feature extraction techniques are employed to remove abnormal markers from images, noise impedance from tissues and lesions. The traits acquired are integrated to differentiate between COVID-19, pneumonia and healthy cases. The primary aim of this model is to produce an image processing tool for medical professionals. The model results to inspect how a healthy or COVID-19 individual outperforms conventional models. The maximum accuracy of the collected data set is 99.68%.},

The goal of this research work is to define a new family of LPF AOs through the use of Dombi operations and Heronian mean (HM) operator. In addition to fusing individual attribute values, the evolved operators are good ability to handle the common association between the attributes, making them more appropriate to effectively solve difficult multi-attribute DM (MADM) problems. Therefore, we developed an approach for MADM problem based on LPF Dombi HM operators and solved an emergency programme selection problem.

Virtual screening is currently the most significant component for identifying drug-like molecules from large datasets for drug design and development. However, there are no effective easily available and user-friendly applications for virtual screening of drug leads against SARS-COV-2. Therefore, we have developed a user-friendly web-app named ‘AIDrugApp’ for the virtual screening of inhibitor molecules against SARS-CoV-2. AIDrugApp is a novel open-access, deep learning AI-based inhibitory activity prediction and data statistics visualisation platform. Users can predict the inhibitory activities (Active/Inactive) and pIC-50 values of new compounds against SARS-CoV-2 replicase polyprotein, 3CLpro and human angiotensin-converting enzymes. It is also useful for virtual screening of chemical features of molecules towards SARS-COVID-19 clinical trial bioactivities. This paper presents the development and architecture of AIDrugApp. We also present two case studies where large sets of molecules were screened using the ‘Bioactivity Prediction’ module of our app. Screened molecules were analysed further for validation by molecular docking and ADME analysis to identify the potential drug candidates.},

All nations around the world are making enormous effort to tackle the outbreak towards this deadly virus through various aspects such as technology, economy, relevant data, protective gear, lives-risk medications and all other instruments. The artificial intelligence-based researchers apply knowledge, experience and skill set on national level data to create computational and statistical models for investigating such a pandemic condition. In order to make a contribution to this worldwide human community, this paper recommends using machine-learning and deep-learning models to understand its daily accelerating actions together with predicting the future reachability of COVID-19 across nations by using the real-time information from the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In this work, a novel Exponential Smoothing Long-Short-Term Memory Networks Model (ESLSTM) learning model is proposed to predict the virus spread in the near future. The results are evaluated using RMSE and R-Squared values.},

It is found that the low sensitivity of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examinations during the early stage of COVID-19 disease. Thus, efficient models are desirable for early-stage testing of COVID-19 infected patients. Chest X-ray (CXR) images of COVID-19 infected patients have shown some bilateral changes. In this paper, deep transfer learning and a deep forest-based model are proposed to diagnose COVID-19 infection from CXR images. Initially, features of X-ray images are extracted using the well-known deep transfer learning model (i.e., ResNet101), which does not require tuning many parameters compared to the deep convolutional neural network (CNN). After that, the deep forest model is utilised to predict COVID-19 infected patients. The deep forest is based upon ensemble learning and requires a small number of hyper-parameters. Additionally, the proposed model is trained on a multi-class dataset that contains four different classes as COVID-19 (+), pneumonia, tuberculosis, and healthy patients. The comparisons are drawn among the proposed deep transfer learning and deep forest-based models, the competitive models. The obtained results show that the proposed model effectively diagnoses COVID-19 infection with an accuracy of 99.4%.},

The risk of removal of lockdowns is the emergence of new waves of a pandemic causing a surge in new cases. These facts necessitate the containment of the virus when the lockdowns end. Wearing masks in crowded places can help restrict the spread of the virus through minuscule droplets in the air. Through the automatic detection, enumeration, and localisation of masks from closed-circuit television footage, it is possible to keep violations of post-COVID regulations in check. In this paper, we leverage the Single-Shot Detection (SSD) framework through different base convolutional neural networks (CNNs) namely VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and Xception to compare performance metrics attained by the different variations of the SSD and determine the efficacies for the best base network model for automatic mask detection in a post COVID world. We find that Xception performs best among all the other models in terms of mean average precision.},

For the RBF-NN training phase, a whale optimisation algorithm (WOA) developed with a fuzzy system has been used (which is called FWOA). The reason for using the fuzzy system is the lack of correct identification of the boundary between the two stages of exploration and exploitation. Thus, the tuning of the effective parameters of the WOA is left to the fuzzy system of the Mamdani type. RBF-NN was trained by chimp optimisation algorithm (ChOA), genetic algorithm (GA), Evolution Strategy (ES), league championship algorithm (LCA), grey wolf algorithms (GWO), gravitational search algorithm (GSA), and WOA to compare the proposed algorithm. The measured criteria are convergence speed, ability to avoid local optimisation, and classification rate. The simulation results showed that FWOA with 97.49% classification accuracy rate in sonar data performed better than the other seven benchmark algorithms.},

This investigation is essentially valuable as well as challenging since everybody consistently need to know the views of existing clients about an item or service. In this article, the most prominent microblogging platform ‘Twitter’ is selected for the investigation of sentiment classification and mining opinions. This is helpful for shoppers who need to enquire about items before purchase, or organisations that need to screen the open assumption of their brands. A unique approach is presented for classifying the feeling of Political Twitter messages into Happy, Extremely Happy, Sad, Extremely Sad or else Neutral. There are numerous devices that give computerised opinion investigation. The dataset used here is the Twitter corpus Dataset named 2016 Political Election day tweets gathered using the Twitty and Simulation apparatus utilised in this examination is PYTHON. Utilising the corpus, sentiment classifier named Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) optimised by Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) determines the class of political tweets as Happy, Extremely Happy, Sad, Extremely Sad and Neutral Sentiments. This work mainly focus on English tweets. The proposed KELM classifier performance is compared with existing classifier approaches and noted with highest accuracy which defines the effective nature of the classifier. Moreover, test evaluation demonstrate that the proposed procedure is effective and performs superior to recently proposed works.},

In the proposed model, called an HLA, the action switching phase of a fixed structure learning automaton is fused with a variable structure learning automaton. Several computer simulations are conducted to study the performance of the proposed model with respect to the total number of rewards and action switching in addition to the convergence rate. The proposed model is compared to both variable structure and fixed structure learning automata, and in most cases, the numerical results demonstrate its superiority. In order to show the applicability of the HLA, a novel adaptive dropout mechanism in deep neural networks was suggested. The results of the simulations show that the proposed mechanism performs better than the simple dropout mechanism with respect to network accuracy.},

In other words, we use the divide-and-conquer rule to overcome the nonlinearity of relations between features. Moreover, to have a more accurate classification in the test or real data, we impose the fuzzy membership of each data to a cluster along with other features as the set of input into the classification method. Another advantage of our research study is to use both clinical and image features and to extract new features using principal component analysis (PCA) for the classification phase. Whereas a patient might belong to more than one cluster, the results of all corresponding classification methods for the respective patient are appropriately combined to end up with the stage of the cancerous patient. Ultimately, to investigate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid approach, we use seven real data sets with both clinical and image data.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is an optimisation problem that reduces the dimension of the dataset and increases the performance of the machine learning algorithms and classification through the selection of the optimal subset features and elimination of the redundant features. However, the huge search space is an important challenge in the FS problem. Due to their satisfactory capabilities to handle high-dimension search spaces, meta-heuristic search algorithms have recently gained much attention and become popular in the FS problem. For these algorithms, choosing a proper fitness function plays an important role. The fitness function orients the searching strategy of the algorithms to obtain best solutions. Appropriate fitness functions will help the algorithms with exploring the search space more effectively and efficiently. In this work, firstly the efficiency of two of the most outstanding and successful heuristic algorithms in the FS domain, namely genetic algorithm (GA) and grey wolf optimiser (GWO), are investigated and analysed with a single-objective fitness function. Secondly, two recent feature selection techniques based on GA and GWO, namely feature selection, weight, and parameter optimisation (FWP) and binary GWO (BGWO) with their fitness function are investigated and analysed. Thirdly, in order to remove the detected drawbacks and weaknesses of the FS algorithms and to enhance their efficiency, a new multi-objective weighted fitness function based on multiple predominant criteria has been presented. The effectiveness of the proposed fitness function on the FS algorithms is evaluated by using SVM and associative classification on 11 different large and small datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of proposed fitness function (where features were reduced and the classification performance has been improved) over single-objective fitness function and other existing fitness functions. Furthermore, another key aim of this study is to present a comprehensive study about the strengths and weaknesses of the FS algorithms which can be used as guidelines for future possible works to more improve the developments of these algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Attribute selection has been proved to be an effective trick to strengthen the classification capability of Bayesian network classifiers, such as Averaged n n n -Dependence Estimators (A n DE). However, conventional mutual information-based attribute ranking considers only the correlation between the attribute and the class, regardless of the redundancies among the attributes. In this paper, we propose a new ranking approach, called Maximin Conditional Mutual Information (MMCMI), which first minimises the conditional mutual information for any unsorted attribute with regard to the sorted attribute sequence, and then maximise the minimal conditional mutual information within all unsorted attributes. When ranking the very first attribute, the mutual information with the class is maximised within all attributes. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the MMCMI ranking approach together with attribute selection framework achieves significantly superior classification performance and less classification time with respect to regular A n DE and the mutual information counterparts.},

  abstract     = {This paper applies machine learning technology to the Satir theory model and intelligently classifies the communication stances of the second layer according to the language and behaviour information of the first layer. We arranged a large number of dialogical language materials from a TV interview programme and used the ICTCLAS Chinese word segmentation system to create a ‘psychological consultation database’. We construct the word training set by part of making use of speech filtering and text word vectorisation, and construct the semantic training set by annotating the original data with the Satir model. These two sets form the Satir communication posture classification training set. Experimental results show that the success rate of classification of four inconsistent coping stances reached 70.37%, 75.92%, 83.33%, and 77.78%.},

Precisely, the framework of observer has been initiated for estimating unmeasured state and remunerate the actuator faults with nonlinearities in the controller. Precisely, quantiser is incorporated in the network can reduce the process of transmitting data. Subsequently, activation function approach bringing together with traditional indirect Lyapunov theory endows some sufficient conditions in the frame of linear matrix inequalities to assure the finite-time stabilisation criterion for the addressed neural networks under the proposed reliable sampled-data control. Explicitly, the state feedback control and observer gain matrices are attained by solving the developed linear matrix inequalities. Convincingly, two numerical simulations are explored to substantiate the excellence and potentiality of the developed control law.},

  abstract     = {Being simple and portable, the three-dimensional (3D) convolution network has achieved great success in action recognition. However, its applicability in spatiotemporal feature learning is not evident. This study aims to improve the 3D convolution model and propose a flexible and significant attention module for the extraction of spatiotemporal information. Our first contribution is a self-additive attention module and a feature-based attention module, which is a simple yet effective method for measuring the spatiotemporal importance of a video. In self-additive attention, the spatiotemporal fusion between the frames is defined intuitively, where we set equivalent weights between the video frames manually. Further, the feature-based attention that is trained adaptively by the 3D convolution process combines the spatiotemporal information from the feature map. This study also focuses on attention fusion in learning the spatiotemporal characteristics for 3D convolution. The proposed attention fusion method exhibits outstanding performance in comparison to the recently developed attention modules and the latest 3D networks when applied to the data from the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. The experiments show consistent improvements, affirming the robustness of the method in extracting spatiotemporal attention.},

  abstract     = {Association rule mining is typically used to uncover the enthralling interdependencies between the set of variables and reveals the hidden pattern within the dataset. The associations are identified based on co-occurring variables with high frequencies. These associations can be positive (A→B) or negative (A→⌐B). The number of these association rules in larger databases are considerably higher which restricted the extraction of valuable insights from the dataset. Some rule pruning strategies are used to reduce the number of rules that can sometimes miss an important, or include an unimportant rule into the final rule set because of not considering the context of the rule. Context-based positive and negative association rule mining (CBPNARM) for the first time included context variable in the algorithms of association rule mining for selection/ de-selection of such rules. In CBPNARM, the selection of context variable and its range of values are done by the user/expert of the system which demands unwanted user interaction and may add some bias to the results. This paper proposes a method to automate the selection of context variable and selection of its value range. The context variable is chosen by using the diversity index and chi-square test, and the range of values for the context variable is set by using box plot analysis. The proposed method on top of it added conditional-probability increment ratio (CPIR) for further pruning uninteresting rules. Experiments show the system can select the context variable automatically and set the right range for the selected context variable. The performance of the proposed method is compared with CBPNARM and other state of the art methods.},

  abstract     = {Artificial superintelligent (ASI) agents that will not cause harm to humans or other organisms are central to mitigating a growing contemporary global safety concern as artificial intelligent agents become more sophisticated. We argue that it is not necessary to resort to implementing an explicit theory of ethics, and that doing so may entail intractable difficulties and unacceptable risks. We attempt to provide some insight into the matter by defining a minimal set of boundary conditions potentially capable of decreasing the probability of conflict with synthetic intellects intended to prevent aggression towards organisms. Our argument departs from causal entropic forces as good general predictors of future action in ASI agents. We reason that maximising future freedom of action implies reducing the amount of repeated computation needed to find good solutions to a large number of problems, for which living systems are good exemplars: a safe ASI should find living organisms intrinsically valuable. We describe empirically-bounded ASI agents whose actions are constrained by the character of physical laws and their own evolutionary history as emerging from H. sapiens , conceptually and memetically, if not genetically. Plausible consequences and practical concerns for experimentation are characterised, and implications for life in the universe are discussed.},
