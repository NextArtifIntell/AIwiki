The proposed Hilfer fractional system&#39;s solvability in Hilbert space is acquired by employing fractional calculus, stochastic analysis, semigroup theory, and Krasnoselskii&#39;s fixed point theorem. Furthermore, under some suitable assumptions, the considered system&#39;s trajectory controllability is established using generalized Gronwall&#39;s inequality. Finally, an example is delivered to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.},

A novel meta-heuristic approach is developed to design a discrete control model which determines each player&#39;s course of action by means of a finite set. Capturing scenarios of the pursuer are provided by designing his finite sets according to the given target range. Numerical experiments are performed in the simple case where the proposed model is compared with grey wolf optimizer through numerical simulations. Here, it is seen that the new model is more effective and accurate which requires less computation and fewer iterations to construct near-optimal solutions. Moreover, the proposed method becomes more powerful for converging to the optimal cost of the problem when the optimal solution is finite.},

  abstract     = {As we all know, the filled function method as an effective algorithm to solve global optimization problems can overcome the defect that the non-linear algorithm is trapped in the local minimizer and cannot jump to attach the global minimizer, which has attracted the attention of researchers. However, when solving multi-dimensional global optimization problems, the filled function often lacks good properties such as mandatory, convexity and continuity, which makes the conventional filled function algorithm to always encounter the difficulty that its convergence cannot be guaranteed. In view of this, a novel convergent filled function algorithm for multi-dimensional global optimization is proposed. In this algorithm, by the way of the coordinates rotate, the multi-dimensional global optimization problem is transformed into several one-dimensional sub-problems, and then the new filled function with good properties is constructed to solve the one-dimensional sub-problem, which leads to attachment of the convergence in algorithm. Finally, compared with the existing algorithms on test optimization problems in NETLIB library, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by numerical experiments.},

Firstly, two alternated inertial methods are presented. Secondly, a multi-step inertial method is proposed to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Thirdly, an alternated multi-step inertial method is further introduced. In addition, we also consider that the inertial parameters can be chosen as positive or negative parameters, and we get better results. Our numerical results illustrate the performances of our algorithms and present some comparisons with related algorithms.

Then, we obtain a family of equivalent surrogates for the group zero-norm regularized problem from a class of global exact penalties of its MPEC reformulation, established under the calmness of a partial perturbation to the composite group zero-norm constraint system. For the stationary points of these surrogates, we study their local optimality to the surrogates themselves and the group zero-norm regularized problem. The local optimality conditions obtained in this work not only recover the existing ones for zero-norm regularized problems, but also provide new criteria to judge the local optimality of a stationary point yielded by an algorithm for solving the corresponding surrogate problems.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is to look into the optimization of the first mixed boundary value problems for partial differential inclusions of the parabolic type. More specifically, we discuss a constructive approach to the study and solution of optimization problems for partial differential inclusions based on the discrete-approximate method. We formulate necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality by reducing the original first mixed boundary value problems to finite-dimensional problems in mathematical programming. All of our conditions are presented through the notion of Euler-Lagrange inclusions and transversality conditions. The effectiveness of our approach and its superiority over well-known methods are demonstrated by the example of the linear optimal control problem. Then, by passing formally to the limit as the discrete steps approach zero, we derive sufficient conditions of optimality for parabolic differential inclusions in the discrete-approximate problem.},

The programming problem under consideration has mixed constraints, that is, it involves both inequality and equality constraints. All these notions are in terms of upper semi-regular convexificators of inequality constraints and pseudo-differentials of equality constraints. Based on a sufficient condition for error bound property, the implication relation between quasinormality and error bound property in terms of convexificators is investigated in this paper. Three conditions are introduced, namely constant positive linear dependence condition (CPLD), constant rank constraint qualification (CRCQ) and Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ) in terms of convexificators. These conditions are in fact shown to be constraint qualifications as Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions hold when CPLD holds and both MFCQ and CRCQ imply CPLD. Further, it is observed that CPLD and quasinormality conditions are independent for nonsmooth problems in terms of convexificators.},

In this paper, we consider biobjective optimization problems on matroids where one of the objective functions is restricted to binary cost coefficients. We show that in this case the problem has a connected efficient set with respect to a natural definition of a neighbourhood structure and hence can be solved efficiently using a neighbourhood search approach. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-trivial problem on matroids where connectedness of the efficient set can be established. The theoretical results are validated by numerical experiments with biobjective minimum spanning tree problems (graphic matroids) and with biobjective knapsack problems with a cardinality constraint (uniform matroids). In the context of the minimum spanning tree problem, colouring all edges with cost 0 green and all edges with cost 1 red leads to an equivalent problem where we want to simultaneously minimize one general objective and the number of red edges (which defines the second objective) in a Pareto sense.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the stochastic optimization problem with multivariate second-order stochastic dominance (MSSD) constraints where the distribution of uncertain parameters is unknown. Instead, only some historical data are available. Using the Wasserstein metric, we construct an ambiguity set and develop a data-driven distributionally robust optimization model with multivariate second-order stochastic dominance constraints (DROMSSD). By utilizing the linear scalarization function, we transform MSSD constraints into univariate constraints. We present a stability analysis focusing on the impact of the variation of the ambiguity set on the optimal value and optimal solutions. Moreover, we carry out quantitative stability analysis for the DROMSSD problems as the sample size increases. Specially, in the context of the portfolio, we propose a convex lower reformulation of the corresponding DROMSSD models under some mild conditions. Finally, some preliminary numerical test results are reported. We compare the DROMSSD model with the sample average approximation model through out-of-sample performance, certificate and reliability. We also use real stock data to verify the effectiveness of the DROSSM model.},

  abstract     = {The mathematical program with switching constraints (MPSC), which has been introduced recently, is a difficult class of optimization problems since standard constraint qualifications are very likely to fail at local minimizers. Due to the failure of standard constraint qualifications, it is reasonable to propose some constraint qualifications for local minimizers to satisfy some stationarity conditions that are generally weaker than Karush-Kuhn-Tucker stationarity such as Mordukhovich (M-) stationarity. First, we propose the weakest constraint qualification for M-stationarity of MPSC to hold at local minimizers. Then we extend some weak verifiable constraint qualifications for nonlinear programming to allow the existence of switching constraints, which are all strictly weaker than MPSC linear independence constraint qualification and/or MPSC Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification used in the literature. We show that most of the newly introduced constraint qualifications are sufficient for local minimizers to be M-stationary. Finally, the relations among MPSC tailored constraint qualifications are discussed.},

Players have been provided with costly two-component strategies. Population densities are described by two coupled nonlinear stochastic second-order parabolic equations. We have added stochastic terms to the deterministic model to consider random perturbations. First, we have considered the stochastic payoff functions and proved the game has a unique stochastic Nash equilibrium. Then, we have shown the stochastic Nash equilibrium is also a Nash equilibrium for the game with deterministic payoff functions defined by expectation. Cooperative game is also studied and stochastic Pareto efficient strategies are obtained. Then, the existence and uniqueness analyses of the deterministic Nash equilibrium and deterministic Pareto efficient strategies for the game with deterministic payoff functions are provided. The explicit forms of Nash equilibriums and Pareto efficient strategies are presented. Results about the losses the players experience when they don&#39;t cooperate are given. Finally, some numerical experiments are included to illustrate what we have claimed in the statements of theorems and show the effects of the Nash equilibrium and Pareto efficient strategy on the payoffs of the players.},

While the energy minimization functional is convex due to the viscous approximation, the associated Euler–Lagrange equations are of quasilinear type, making the control problem nonconvex.

Moreover, the gap between the objective function and its affine relaxation function is derived for the first time, and when the partition interval tends to be infinitesimal, the gap is infinitely close to zero.

Several new presentations of epigraphs of composite conjugate mappings associated to (VP) are established under variant qualifying conditions. The significance of these representations is twofold: Firstly, they play a key role in establishing new kinds of vector Farkas lemmas which serve as tools in the study of vector optimization problems; secondly, they pay the way to define Lagrange and two new kinds of Fenchel–Lagrange dual problems for (VP). Strong and stable strong duality results corresponding to these mentioned dual problems of (VP) are established using the new Farkas-type results just obtained. It is shown that in the special case where Y = R , the Lagrange and Fenchel–Lagrange dual problems for (VP), go back to Lagrange, and Fenchel–Lagrange dual problems for scalar problems, and the resulting duality results cover, and in some cases, extend the corresponding ones for scalar problems in the literature.},

Applying the method of dynamic programming, the principle of optimality is presented and then the equation of optimality is provided to solve the proposed problem.

They can be interpreted as discrete temporal versions of an inertial dynamic involving both viscous damping and Hessian-driven damping. The asymptotically vanishing viscous damping is linked to the accelerated gradient method of Nesterov while the Hessian driven damping makes it possible to significantly attenuate the oscillations. By treating the Hessian-driven damping as the time derivative of the gradient term, this gives, in discretized form, first-order algorithms. These results complement the previous work of the authors where it was shown the fast convergence of the values, and the fast convergence towards zero of the gradients.},

We establish quantitative error estimates for the regularization error in terms of the Hausdorff distance of the efficient set of the original problem to the regularized efficient set. We apply these results to state-constrained multiobjective optimal control problems. In particular, we consider two different situations: distributed and finite-dimensional controls, and for each one, we define two different halfspace regularization schemes given in terms of a family of triangulations of the domain. This leads to two regularized problems corresponding to finitely many pointwise and integral constraints. By applying the abstract results, we get regularization error estimates for the four control problems under general conditions.},

By virtue of the separation theorem for convex sets, we obtain the scalarizaiton results for the sets of E -optimal points, weak E -optimal points, E -Benson proper optimal points, E -super optimal points and E -strictly optimal points. Then we make a new attempt to establish some density theorems for the sets of these optimal points. Finally, we investigate connectedness and arcwise connectedness of the sets of various notions of E -optimality by using the scalarization method and the density theorems.},

This paper considers the reverse 1-centre problem on general tree networks with weights associated to vertices under a convex piecewise-linear cost function. It is shown that the problem can be transformed into a parametric minimum cost flow problem. A polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) is first developed using the bisection method.

In this paper, we study set-valued optimization problems and develop a multiobjective optimization problem that is strongly related to it. We prove that the set of weakly minimal solutions of this subproblem is closely related to the set of weakly minimal elements of the set-valued optimization problem and that these sets can get arbitrarily close in a certain sense. Subsequently, we introduce a concept of approximations of the solution set of the set-valued optimization problem. We define a quality measure in the image space that can be used to compare finite approximations of this kind and outline a procedure to enhance a given approximation.

  abstract     = {The problem of generalizing the compound option pricing model to incorporate more empirical features becomes an urgent and necessary event. In this study, a new N -fold compound option pricing method is designed for the economic uncertainty and technical uncertainty. The economic uncertainty is modelled by a fractional jump-diffusion model, which incorporates the long-term dependence of financial markets, the kurtosis of returns and the unpredictable shocks of real world. The technical uncertainty is modelled as a simplified version Poisson-type jump process, which describes the catastrophic impact of the technical risk in multi-stage projects. The main contribution of this paper is that we firstly develop the N -fold compound option pricing model with the fractional Brownian motion and the technical risk variable. Further, the analytic solutions of pricing compound options are achieved and verified by the recursive formula of option price. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical results of this model. Moreover, from the sensitivity analysis, some results are presented to illustrate that the N -fold compound option price without considering the phase-specific characteristics of technical risk is improperly estimated. Thereby, it is essential for investors to take into account the technical risk when making decisions.},

The central idea of this approach is the construction of a continuously described inner parallel set for which any rounding of any of its elements is feasible in the original mixed-integer problem. It is known that this approach is promising for problems in which no equality constraints on integer variables appear. Yet, so far the potential of incorporating equality constraints with integer variables into this approach remained unclear. In this article, we close this gap by developing a reduction scheme that enables the application of feasible rounding approaches to problems in which such equality constraints occur. Our computational study on a large test bed of MIPLIB instances shows that this reduction is applicable to a relevant share of practical problems. Moreover, our results illustrate that a non-empty inner parallel set is possible, but less likely to occur for practical problems with equality constraints on integer variables. Finally, our results indicate that the application of a feasible rounding approach can be beneficial for the computation of good feasible points even under the occurrence of equality constraints on integer variables.},

By using eigenvalue estimates and the perturbation theory of linear systems, we show that for a fixed barrier parameter, the sequence of primal iterates is bounded away from zero. The results are established under some weak assumptions, which are implied by, for example, a second-order sufficient condition. Moreover, our analysis are independent of the choices of merit functions and penalty factors. Preliminary numerical experiments on some degenerate problems conform the results of this paper.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of sparse recovery in the context of compressed sensing. This is to minimize the sensing error of linear measurements by sparse vectors with at most s non-zero entries. We develop the so-called critical point theory for sparse recovery. This is done by introducing nondegenerate M-stationary points which adequately describe the global structure of this non-convex optimization problem. We show that all M-stationary points are generically nondegenerate. In particular, the sparsity constraint is active at all local minimizers of a generic sparse recovery problem. Additionally, the equivalence of strong stability and nondegeneracy for M-stationary points is shown. We claim that the appearance of saddle points – these are M-stationary points with exactly s −1 non-zero entries – cannot be neglected. For this purpose, we derive a so-called Morse relation, which gives a lower bound on the number of saddle points in terms of the number of local minimizers. The relatively involved structure of saddle points can be seen as a source of well-known difficulty by solving the problem of sparse recovery to global optimality.},

The problem of risk evaluation of multivariate risk sources has been studied, and a multivariate risk measure, so-called multivariate average-value-at-risk, m A V a R α , is proposed to quantify the total risk. It is shown that the proposed operator satisfies the four axioms of a coherent risk measure while reducing to one variable average-value-at-risk, A V a R α , in case N = 1. In that respect, it is shown that m A V a R α is the natural extension of A V a R α to N -dimensional case maintaining its axiomatic properties. We further show m A V a R α is flexible by giving the investor the option to choose the risk level α i of each random loss i differently. This flexibility is novel and can not be achieved applying univariate A V a R α with corresponding risk level α to the sum of the risk marginals. The framework is applicable for Gaussian mixture models with dependent risk factors that are naturally used in financial and actuarial modelling. A multivariate tail variance and its connection with m A V a R α is also presented via Chebyshev inequality for tail events. Examples with numerical simulations are also illustrated throughout.},

Ambiguity-averse members worry about model misspecification and aim to find a robust optimal strategy. In most of DC pension plans, the return of premiums clauses is been often set to protect the rights of plan members. A portion of premiums is usually refunded to members who died during the accumulation phase, while the difference between the sizes of the accumulated fund and the returned premiums is evenly divided among the surviving members. Assume that the financial market contains a risk-free asset and a risky asset, and the price process of risky asset is driven by a jump-diffusion model. We establish a mean-variance model with ambiguity aversion. By using the extended Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation, the robust time-consistent equilibrium strategy and the corresponding equilibrium value function are derived. In addition, some special cases are provided in detail. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the impact of model parameters on the robust equilibrium strategy and utility losses.},

MLFGs are known to be complex problems, but they also provide perfect models to describe hierarchical interactions among various actors of real-life problems. In this work, we focus on a class of MLFGs modelling the implementation of demand-side management in an electricity market through price incentives, leading to the so-called Bilevel Demand-Side Management problem (BDSM) .

Particularly, we compare the associated novel asymptotic constraint qualifications with already existing ones. The second part of the paper presents two applications of the obtained theory. On the one hand, we specify our findings for complementarity constrained optimization problems and recover recent results from the literature which demonstrates the power of the approach. Furthermore, we hint at potential extensions to or- and vanishing constrained optimization. On the other hand, we demonstrate the usefulness of asymptotic regularity in the context of bilevel optimization. More precisely, we justify a well-known stationarity system for affinely constrained bilevel optimization problems in a novel way. Afterwards, we suggest a solution algorithm for this class of bilevel optimization problems which combines a penalty method with ideas from DC-programming.

  abstract     = {Given a set H of functions defined on a set X , á function f : X ↦ R ¯ is called abstract H -convex if it is the upper envelope of its H -minorants, i.e. such its minorants which belong to the set H ; and f is called regularly abstract H -convex if it is the upper envelope of its maximal (with respect to the pointwise ordering) H -minorants. In the paper we first present the basic notions of (regular) H -convexity for the case when H is an abstract set of functions. For this abstract case a general sufficient condition based on Zorn&#39;s lemma for a H -convex function to be regularly H -convex is formulated. The goal of the paper is to study the particular class of regularly H -convex functions, when H is the set L C ˆ ( X , R ) of real-valued Lipschitz continuous classically concave functions defined on a real normed space X . For an extended-real-valued function f : X ↦ R ¯ to be L C ˆ -convex it is necessary and sufficient that f be lower semicontinuous and bounded from below by a Lipschitz continuous function; moreover, each L C ˆ -convex function is regularly L C ˆ -convex as well. We focus on L C ˆ -subdifferentiability of functions at a given point. We prove that the set of points at which an L C ˆ -convex function is L C ˆ -subdifferentiable is dense in its effective domain. This result extends the well-known classical Brøndsted-Rockafellar theorem on the existence of the subdifferential for convex lower semicontinuous functions to the more wide class of lower semicontinuous functions. Using the subset L C ˆ θ of the set L C ˆ consisting of such Lipschitz continuous concave functions that vanish at the origin we introduce the notions of L C ˆ θ -subgradient and L C ˆ θ -subdifferential of a function at a point which generalize the corresponding notions of the classical convex analysis. Some properties and simple calculus rules for L C ˆ θ -subdifferentials as well as L C ˆ θ -subdifferential conditions for global extremum points are established. Symmetric notions of abstract L C ˇ -concavity and L C ˇ -superdifferentiability of functions where L C ˇ := L C ˇ ( X , R ) is the set of Lipschitz continuous convex functions are also considered.},

  abstract     = {A set-valued optimization problem with variable preferences is considered. Relations between local and global solutions, optimality conditions, and Wolfe and Mond-Weir duality properties are studied. Both minimal and nondominated solutions are discussed with general variable preferences. The results are proved for three main types of solutions in vector optimization: weak, Pareto, and strong solutions. New variants of generalized derivatives and convexity are proposed and used in all the results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we examine a zero-duality gap with polynomial multipliers between a non-convex polynomial program and its associated generalized Lagrangian dual problem. To this end, we introduce a sum of squares certificate of non-negativity, abbreviated as (SC), that allows us to verify the non-negativity of a polynomial over a feasible set of a system of given polynomials. With the help of (SC), we show that the zero-duality gap with polynomial multipliers coincides with the convergent Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations. This zero-duality gap with polynomial multipliers reduces to the classical zero-duality gap with constant multipliers when considering it in the setting of SOS-convex polynomial programs or quadratic programs with the hidden convexity. We also show that, in the framework of truncated polynomial systems, the zero-duality gap with polynomial multipliers can be checked via the classical Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition under an additional convexity condition.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we deal with vector optimization problems where the images of the objective maps are given in linear spaces not endowed with any topological structure. Firstly, we propose new concepts of semicontinuity of vector-valued maps acting from metric spaces into linear ones and discuss their properties and characterizations. Next, using Zorn&#39;s Lemma and these properties, we formulate existence conditions for such problems. Then, we introduce two notions of Levitin-Polyak well-posedness for the reference problems, and study sufficient conditions for their fulfillment, as well as relationships of these notions. Finally, using the Kuratowski measure of noncompactness, several metric characterizations of such well-posedness properties for vector optimization problems are investigated. Many examples are given to analyze our results.},
