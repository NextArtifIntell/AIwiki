  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a dynamic object elimination algorithm that combines semantic and geometric constraints to address the problem of visual SLAM being easily affected by dynamic feature points in dynamic environments. This issue leads to the degradation of localisation accuracy and robustness. Firstly, we employ a lightweight YOLO-Tiny network to enhance both detection accuracy and system speed. Secondly, we integrate the YOLO-Tiny network into the ORB-SLAM3 system to extract semantic information from the images and initiate the elimination of dynamic feature points. Subsequently, we augment this approach by incorporating geometric constraints between neighbouring frames to further eliminate dynamic feature points. Then, the former is supplemented by combining the geometric constraints between neighbouring frames to further eliminate dynamic feature points. Experiments on the TUM dataset demonstrate that the algorithm in this paper can improve the Relative Pose Error (RPE) by up to 95.12% and the Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 99.01% in high dynamic sequences compared to ORB-SLAM3. The effectiveness of dynamic feature point elimination is evident, leading to significantly improved localisation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {We have witnessed substantial growth in super-resolution research within the computer vision community. Unlike previous works that mainly focus on the super-resolution synthesis of images, videos, or single volumes, our research is dedicated to the super-resolution synthesis of time-varying volumetric data, which are generated from scientific simulations and are crucial for domain scientists to understand and analyse complex scientific phenomena. Compared to previous works, our research presents a greater challenge: the time-varying volumetric data have higher dimensions, making it more difficult to synthesise super-resolution that maintains good spatio-temporal consistency while achieving high visual quality. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new GAN-based network called SSR-DoubleUNetGAN, which includes novel network architecture and loss functions, allowing for accurate synthesis of spatial super-resolution for time-varying volumetric data with relatively fast training time. Our method can be applied in the context of in-situ visualisation to aid domain scientists in analysing more time-varying volumetric data more efficiently. In addition, it can be used in the compression-decompression pipeline to recover the super-resolution time-varying volumetric data from their low-resolution counterpart. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied various time-varying volumetric datasets from different scientific simulations to it. To demonstrate its advantages, we compared it qualitatively and quantitatively with five state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques, namely SSR-TVD, Tricubic, SRResNet, Cubic, and Linear. Furthermore, we conducted an ablation study to validate its important modules. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the compared state-of-the-art techniques.},

However, using different EEG features and complementarity to discriminate other emotions is still challenging. Most existing models extract a single temporal feature from the EEG signal while ignoring the crucial temporal dynamic information, which, to a certain extent, constrains the classification capability of the model. To address this issue, we propose an Attention-Based Depthwise Parameterized Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (AB-DPCGRU) model and validate it with the mixed experiment on the SEED and SEED-IV datasets. The experimental outcomes revealed that the accuracy of the model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, which confirmed the superiority of our approach over currently popular emotion recognition models.},

  abstract     = {Since 2005, the deep learning community has had access to input graphs to their models. So, the natural language processing (NLP) community started using this technique to process text. However, a challenge that the graph neural networks (GNN) may encounter is the sensibility to representation format. Since different graphs can represent the same text, the model’s performance may change depending on the representation used. Even though many practitioners have this intuition, only some works touch on this aspect of GNN. Therefore, we explore twelve different text representation strategies that build graphs from text and apply them to the same GNN to investigate how different graphs may affect the results. We divide these strategies into four groups: reading order, dependency-based, binary tree, and graph of words. From these groups, we created the binary tree group for this paper. Nevertheless, in our tests, we observed that the dependency-based representations tend to achieve better performance: The dependency-based methods allow us to stay competitive in five relevant datasets and beat the state-of-the-art in another dataset. These results suggest that performing representation tuning can be a valuable technique to improve a deep learning model.},

Second, we constructed the NFT creator graph (NCG) and NFT holder graph (THG) to delve into the characteristics of the NFT market. Further, we analyse the market preferences and trends using statistical methods to reveal the development trends of the NFT market. Finally, we focus on predicting the transaction volume of the NFT market and analyse the influence factors.

In particular, it is a study to solve the health care problem of students exposed to violence. Among the problematic behaviours, students exposed to violence, especially, have many problems with healthcare. A projective test using pictures can elicit information from adolescents through direct experiences represented by pictures to which the subject unconsciously reacts. Few methods analyse images drawn by adolescents as image data. This study analyses data from 134 violent students who received fifth-degree punishment for violent behaviour and 134 nonviolent students. We use the convolutional neural network (CNN)(softmax), CNN (support vector machine (SVM)), with the style transfer generative adversarial network, and ensemble techniques to analyse drawn images using WZT and predict violence through deep learning. We predict violence from pictures with an accuracy of 93%–98%. This study is the first to automatically analyze and predict violence with a deep learning model in images drawn by adolescents on WZT. It also features WZT to proactively conduct violence investigations to improve health care for students. Advances in deep learning for image feature extraction are expected to provide more research opportunities.},

In this study, we present an innovative automated methodology tailored to assist business process experts in identifying security threats and conducting risk assessments, particularly in the context of e-Government processes. Our approach streamlines the process, requiring only a business specialist to annotate BPMN entities with high-level, non-security-related information. Based on these annotations, potential threats to the system can be automatically identified. To develop our methodology, we leverage the standard BPMN annotation mechanism. From the annotated BPMN, the methodology utilises the ENISA Threat Landscape knowledge base for threat identification and employs the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology for risk assessment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we applied it to a straightforward case study within the e-Government domain. Through this example, we illustrate how our methodology can be employed to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation and meet the mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessment requirements.},

  abstract     = {Term polarity co-extraction is an aspect-based sentiment analysis task, which has been widely used in the fields of user opinions extraction. It consists of two subtasks: aspect term extraction and aspect sentiment classification. Most existing studies solve aforesaid subtasks as independent tasks or simply unify the two subtasks without making full use of the relationship between tasks to mine the interaction of text information, which leads to low performance for practical applications. Meanwhile, the learning framework for these studies has a label drift phenomenon (LDP) in the process of predictive learning, increasing the learning error rate. To address the above problems, this study unifies subtasks and proposes a Unified framework based on the information interaction mechanism framework, called IIM. Specifically, we design an Information Interaction Channel (IIC) to construct closer semantic features to extract preliminary term-polarity unified labels from the perspective of basic semantics. For label inconsistency between aspect terms, a Position-aware Module (SAM) is proposed to alleviate the Label Drift Phenomenon (LDP). Moreover, we introduce a syntax-attention graph neural network (Syn-AttGCN) to model the syntactic structure of text and strengthen the emotional connection between aspect terms. The experimental results show that IIM outperforms most baselines. Meanwhile, the SAM module has a certain slowing effect on LDP.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in various military and civilian applications. UAV mission scheduling is a key issue in UAV applications and a central topic in UAV research. UAV task scheduling should include several constraints into consideration, such as completion time constraint, flight distance constraint, and resource consumption constraint. Furthermore, UAV task scheduling should be studied within the traditional framework of combinatorial optimisation. In this paper, we consider optimal mission scheduling for heterogeneous UAVs with completion time, flight distance, and resource consumption constraints. The contributions of the paper are summarised as follows. We define two combinatorial optimisation problems, namely, the NFTM (number of finished tasks maximisation) problem and the RFTM (reward of finished tasks maximisation) problem. We construct an algorithmic framework for both NFTM and RFTM problems, so that our heuristic algorithms (four for NFTM and two for RFTM) can be presented in a unified way. We derive upper bounds for optimal solutions, so that our heuristic solutions can be compared with optimal solutions. We experimentally evaluate the performance of our heuristic algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper studying UAV mission scheduling with time, distance, and resource constraints as combinatorial optimisation problems.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic measurement via deep learning can be applied in many industrial fields significantly (e.g. electrical power load and fault diagnosis acquisition). Nowadays, accurate and continuous loading measurement is essential in coal mine production. The existing methods are weak in loading measurement because they ignore the symbol characteristics of loading and adjusting features. To address the problem, we propose a hybrid learning method (called ScTCN-LightGBM) to realize the loading measurement of industrial material effectively. First, we provide an abnormal data processing method to guarantee raw data accuracy. Second, we design a sided-composited temporal convolutional network that combines a novel transposed dimensionality-reduction convolution residual block with the conventional residual block. This module can extract symbol characteristics and values of loading and adjusting features well. Finally, we utilize the light-gradient boosting machine to measure loading capacity. Experimental results show that the ScTCN-LightGBM outperforms existing measurement models with high metrics, especially the stability coefficient R 2 is 0.923. Compared to the conventional loading measurement method, the measurement performance via ScTCN-LigthGBM improves by 40.2% and the continuous measurement time is 11.28s. This study indicates that the proposed model can achieve the loading measurement of industrial material effectively.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, one of the prominent research areas in the complex network field has been the Influence Maximization Problem. This problem focuses on selecting seed sets to achieve optimal information propagation across networks. Practical networks often encounter challenges like node or link failures due to internal issues or external disturbances. Addressing this, researchers emphasize seed robustness against potential interferences, framing it as the robust influence maximisation problem. However, current approaches to this problem are incomplete, leaving several challenges unaddressed. On one hand, existing methods primarily handle seed selection under isolated disruptions, neglecting the simultaneous threats posed by both node-based and link-based attacks. On the other hand, prevailing algorithms fail to capture information synergy from multiple scenarios during the solution process. To bridge these gaps, this study integrates the multi-tasking optimisation theory into robust influence maximisation, introducing an evolutionary algorithm called DMFEA. DMFEA concurrently addresses multiple optimization scenarios, leveraging synergy between tasks while emphasizing information diversity. Experimental results demonstrate DMFEA&#39;s competitive edge over existing methods. This research significantly advances collaborative optimization for robust influence maximisation under multi-scenario disruptions, offering a reliable solution for robust information diffusion in complex environments.},

  abstract     = {Compiler optimization presents a formidable challenge, seeking to enhance code quality through various techniques. One significant obstacle is the phase-ordering problem, where the sequence of optimization algorithms can impact code quality and potentially lead to performance deterioration. While machine learning has shown promise in addressing this issue, it still encounters limitations in certain scenarios. Instruction Sink is a machine-independent optimization that segregates instructions like modulo and division into separate basic blocks. This separation prevents the application of the machine-dependent optimization called Division-Modulo Combine at the backend, which could otherwise lead to a decline in program performance. However, reordering these optimizations to avoid conflicts can prove to be challenging. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to enhance Instruction Sink, resolving the blocking problem, and implements it within the LLVM optimizer. Leveraging the modularity of LLVM enables us to tackle all affected back-end issues simultaneously. To assess the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation focusing on feasibility, compatibility, and targeted improvements. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the blocking problem without conflicting with other optimization algorithms, solely impacting problematic instructions while leaving normal ones unaffected.},

Two widely adopted strategies for accelerating computational performance are quantisation and the utilisation of AI hardware accelerators. Each type of accelerator or inference engine offers distinct advantages, with accelerators primarily designed to optimise neural network operations. In this paper, we present an innovative method for integrating TVM&#39;s quantisation flow with the MediaTek Neuropilot AI accelerator. We outline the process of converting the TVM relay intermediate-representation quantised neural network dialect model to a tensor-oriented quantisation format, with the aim of harnessing the full potential of both TVM and MediaTek NeuroPilot. This integration enables more efficient neural network inference while preserving the accuracy of the results. We assessed the effectiveness of our proposed integration by conducting a series of experiments and comparing the performance of our approach with that of TVM equipped with an autotuning mechanism. The findings indicate that our approach substantially outperforms TVM in both floating-point model inference and quantised model inference, with inference speedups of up to 11× and up to 70×, respectively. These results underscore the potential of our approach in accelerating AI performance across a diverse range of applications and edge devices. Moreover, a key contribution of our work is providing a valuable practical method for other hardware companies interested in integrating TVM with their own accelerators to achieve performance gains.},

Generally, it connects the different items, Vehicles, and Environments, which transfers data between the network. The various challenges associated with IoV are routing security and data transmission. It is a different form of the traditional intelligent transportation system, and thus, many researchers have studied routing protocols and their simulation tools. Finding all Such methodologies and their development are unavailable at a single source. Focusing on this objective, our research explores routing protocols within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) context. Our study comprehensively reviews diverse routing algorithms and their associated assessment methodologies. To systematically categorise these protocols, we employ a multi-tiered taxonomy. Firstly, we classify them into three main groups based on their transmission strategies: unicast, geo-cast, and broadcast. Secondly, we categorise them into four classes: topology-based, position-based, map-based, and path-based. Thirdly, we organise them according to their dimensions, differentiating between 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D approaches. Finally, we classify these protocols based on their applicability to homogeneous or heterogeneous network environments. The combination of classical routing protocols with the emerging heterogeneous network paradigm is of particular interest in our research, representing a compelling area for future exploration. By presenting this extensive framework, we aim to inspire researchers in the IoV field to develop innovative and efficient routing protocols and technologies.},

  abstract     = {The penaeid shrimp farming industry is experiencing rapid growth. To reduce costs and labour, automation techniques such as counting and size estimation are increasingly being adopted. Feeding based on the degree of stomach fullness can significantly reduce food waste and water contamination. Therefore, we propose an intelligent shrimp farming system that includes shrimp detection, measurement of approximated shrimp length, shrimp quantity, and two methods for determining the degree of digestive tract fullness. We introduce AR-YOLOv5 (Angular Rotation YOLOv5) in the system to enhance both shrimp growth and the environmental sustainability of shrimp farming. Our experiments were conducted in a real shrimp farming environment. The length and quantity are estimated based on the bounding box, and the level of stomach fullness is approximated using the ratio of the shrimp´s digestive tract to its body size. In terms of detection performance, our proposed method achieves a precision rate of 97.70%, a recall rate of 91.42%, a mean average precision of 94.46%, and an F1-score of 95.42% using AR-YOLOv5. Furthermore, our stomach fullness determined method achieves an accuracy of 88.8%, a precision rate of 91.7%, a recall rate of 90.9%, and an F1-score of 91.3% in real shrimp farming environments.},

However, its computational requirements rise with the growth of distributed generations in the interconnected power system. As CA is a complex and computationally intensive problem, it requires a fast and accurate calculation to ensure the secure operation. Therefore, efficient mathematical modelling and parallel programming are key to efficient static security analysis. This paper proposes a parallel algorithm for static CA that uses both central processing units (CPUs) and graphical processing units (GPUs). To enhance the accuracy, AC load flow is used, and parallel computation of load flow is done simultaneously, with efficient screening and ranking of the critical contingencies. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. As a result, we establish that the proposed parallel algorithm with high-performance computing (HPC) computing is much faster than the traditional algorithms. Furthermore, the HPC experiments were conducted using the national supercomputing facility, which demonstrates the proposed algorithm in the context of N −1 and N −2 static CA with immense power systems, such as the Indian northern regional power grid (NRPG) 246-bus and the polish 2383-bus networks.},

To this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Neighbor Interaction-based Personalized Transfer for Cross-Domain Recommendation (NIPT-CDR). This proposed method mainly contains two modules: (i) an intra-domain item supplementing module and (ii) a personalised feature transfer module. The first module introduces neighbour interactions to supplement the potential missing preferences for each source domain user, particularly for those with limited observed interactions. This approach comprehensively captures the preferences of all users. The second module develops an attention mechanism to guide the knowledge transfer process selectively. Moreover, a meta-network based on users&#39; transferable features is trained to construct personalised mapping functions for each user. The experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed NIPT-CDR method achieves significant performance improvements compared to seven baseline models.

Another reason is that a single constraint cannot effectively control the position relationship between objects in the generated image. To address the above problems, we propose a dual-conditional GAN with based on an external attention for semantic image synthesis (DCSIS). In DCSIS, the adaptive normalization method uses the one-hot encoded semantic layout to generate the first latent space and the external attention uses the RGB encoded semantic layout to generate the second latent space. Two latent spaces control the shape of objects and the positional relationship between objects in the generated image. The graph attention (GAT) is added to the generator to strengthen the relationship between different categories in the generated image. A graph convolutional segmentation network (GSeg) is designed to learn information for each category. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing approaches, regarding both visual quality and the representative evaluating criteria.},

During the assessment, precise damage segmentation plays a crucial role. Dent is a type of damage that can commonly occur in vehicles. It is difficult to pinpoint and tends to blend in with the background. This paper proposes a novel loss function to improve dent segmentation accuracy in vehicle insurance claims. Centre and Pixel-based Weighted DICE (CPW-DICE) is a loss function that performs pixel-based weighting. The CPW-DICE aims to concentrate on the centre of the dent damage to lessen faulty segmentations. CPW-DICE generates a weight mask during training by employing ground truth (GT) and prediction masks. Simultaneously, the weight mask is incorporated into DICE loss. Experiments conducted on our comprehensive internal dataset show a 3% improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) score for three state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches compared to DICE loss. Finally, CPW-DICE is evaluated in similar tasks to demonstrate its benefits beyond car damage segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Online reviews contain comparative opinions that reveal the competitive relationships of related products, help identify the competitiveness of products in the marketplace, and influence consumers’ purchasing choices. The Class Sequence Rule (CSR) method, which is previously commonly used to identify the comparative relations of reviews, suffers from low recognition efficiency and inaccurate generation of rules. In this paper, we improve on the CSR method by proposing a hybrid CSR method, which utilises dependency relations and the part-of-speech to identify frequent sequence patterns in customer reviews, which can reduce manual intervention and reinforce sequence rules in the relation mining process. Such a method outperforms CSR and other CSR-based models with an F-value of 84.67%. In different experiments, we find that the method is characterised by less time-consuming and efficient in generating sequence patterns, as the dependency direction helps to reduce the sequence length. In addition, this method also performs well in implicit relation mining for extracting comparative information that lacks obvious rules. In this study, the optimal CSR method is applied to automatically capture the deeper features of comparative relations, thus improving the process of recognising explicit and implicit comparative relations.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an emerging military and civilian technology that uses sensors. Sensor networks are hierarchical and chaotic in remote, unmonitored sites. Wireless sensor networks pose unique security threats due to their public location and wireless transmission. WSNs are vulnerable to various routing attacks, including Black holes, Sybil, sinkholes and wormholes. In this paper, we proposed advanced intrusion detection systems based on hybrid machine learning (AIDS-HML) in wireless sensor networks to identify and classify attacks. Hybrid machine learning classifiers identify wireless sensor network dangers.  Benchmark datasets are used to compare the proposed model to baseline models in terms of precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy. The scheme is trained and evaluates prediction models. This confirms that the detection accuracy achieved 99.80% using the NSL-KDD benchmark dataset based on hybrid random forest and extreme gradient boost (RF-XGB). The hybrid cluster labelling K-Means (CLK-M) s achieved better classification accuracy of 100% using UNSW_NB15, and CICIDS2017 benchmark datasets for binary classification of label attacks. Different attack detection metrics were compared against various benchmark datasets to evaluate the quality of this work. The proposed system is efficient in simulations for feature extraction and route discovery and detection attacks achieving an accuracy of 99.46%.},

  abstract     = {Despite the extensive deployment of digital instruments in modern times, their stability is challenging to maintain in adverse environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures, pressure, or powerful electromagnetic radiation. Analog meters, owing to their mechanical resilience and electromagnetic impedance, persistently find usage across nuclear power plants, petroleum, and chemical industries. However, under these harsh conditions, manual reading of the instruments may prove to be difficult and dangerous while failing to meet the requirements of real-time monitoring. In recent years, several machine vision-based meter reading systems have been proposed, however, achieving high accuracy through camera-based methods under varying angles and lighting conditions poses significant challenges. Cloud deployment may compromise plant privacy, while edge computing faces limitations in real-time meter reading due to limited computing power. To address these issues, we propose a real-time reading system based on the YolactEdge instance segmentation framework for single-point analog meters. Our system is more accurate than previous studies and is implemented and deployed on the Jetson Xavier NX edge computing device. Our performance evaluation shows that our model outperforms other baselines, with low reference values and relative errors of 0.0237% and 0.0300%, respectively, and an average inference speed of 10.26 FPS with INIT 8 linear acceleration on Nvidia Jetson NX.},

The goal of our work is to identify susceptible communities with patients and healthcare workers, and analyse the independent contact networks of various roles to determine the high-influence nodes within the hospital contact network. If these high-influence nodes are part of the susceptible community, they should be the focus of observation to prevent the spread of the virus.

Particle-based techniques are used to model and simulate nonlinear elastic objects, such as the skin and internal organs. This enables the simulation to consider various factors, such as location, direction, and depth, when making incisions in the organs. However, the issue with this method is that it can only simulate precisely cut tissue during incision. Objects with elasticity, such as tissue, require the generation of complex debris during incision. This paper proposes a particle-based elastic object simulation technique to model the debris from torn tissue when making an incision in the organs. It can predict where the tissue will tear based on the maximum shear stress (MSS) theory and Tresca’s yield criterion when the force applied to the tissue exceeds the maximum stress. Newly generated particles at the predicted location are remeshed with nearby particles. We verified the superiority of our proposed method over traditional particle-based methods by accurately representing more complex debris and comparing the results of incisions in the same area of the body. This allows various incision types, such as stab wounds and lacerations, to be simulated.},

Consequently, ransomware attacks to encrypt healthcare systems or leak such data have increased recently. Many studies are aiming to predict ransomware behaviours early to protect the healthcare IoT environment from such attacks. However, previous studies analysed ransomware behaviours for long periods of time, and systems would already get infected and encrypted meanwhile. To avoid this problem, this study proposes an early prediction scheme of ransomware behaviour (EPS-Ran) to reduce the likelihood of systems being infected during behavioural analysis. EPS-Ran analyses behaviours for 30 s to extract the opcode and API calls sequence. The extracted behaviour features are entered into a hybrid deep learning model that combines the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) model and the temporal convolutional network (TCN) model to predict a future 90 s API calls sequence. The MAE, MSE, and RMSE of the prediction performance of EPS-Ran were measured to be 0.3438, 0.5648, and 0.6342, respectively. EPS-Ran predicted ransomware behaviours early with a low error rate even when the analysis time was reduced from 120 s to 30 s.},

  abstract     = {Food-oriented cross-modal retrieval aims to retrieve relevant recipes given food images or vice versa. The modality semantic gap between recipes and food images (text and image modalities) is the main challenge. Though several studies are introduced to bridge this gap, they still suffer from two major limitations: 1) The simple embedding concatenation only can capture the simple interactions rather than complex interactions between different recipe components. 2) The image feature extraction based on convolutional neural networks only considers the local features and ignores the global features of an image, as well as the interactions between different extracted features. This paper proposes a novel method based on Latent Component Weight Factors and Global Information (LCWF-GI) to learn the robust recipe and image representations for food-oriented cross-modal retrieval. This proposed method integrates the textual embeddings of different recipe components into a compact embedding to represent the recipes with the latent component-specific weight factors. A transformer encoder is utilised to capture the intra-modality interactions and the importance of different extracted image features for enhanced image representations. Finally, the bi-directional triplet loss is further used to perform retrieval learning. Experimental results on the Recipe 1M dataset show that our LCWF-GI method achieves competent improvements.},

  abstract     = {Although machine learning classifiers have been successfully used in the medical and engineering fields, there is still room for improving the predictive accuracy of model classification. The higher the accuracy of the classifier, the better suggestions can be provided for the decision makers. Therefore, in this study, we propose an ensemble machine learning approach, called Feature generation-based Ensemble Support Vector Machine (FESVM), for classification tasks. We first apply the feature selection technique to select the most related features. Next, we introduce an ensemble strategy to aggregate multiple base estimators for the final prediction using the meta-classifier SVM. During this stage, we use the classification probabilities obtained from the base classifier to generate new features. After that, the generated features are added to the original data set to form a new data set. Finally, this new data set is utilised to train the meta-classifier SVM to obtain the final classification results. For example, for a binary classification task, each base classifier has two probabilities ( p for one class and 1− p for the other class). In this case, two new features are generated from the combination of probabilities based on these base classifiers. One is the sum of p as new feature 1, and the other is the sum of 1− p as new feature 2. These two new features are then added to the original data set to form the new data set. In the same way, our feature generation method can be easily extended for a multi-class task for generating new features, where the number of features depends on the number of classes. Those generated features from the base estimators (first layer) are added to the original data set to form a new data set. This new data set is used as the input to the second layer (meta-classifier) to obtain the final model. Experiments based on the 20 data sets show that our proposed model FESVM has the best performance compared to the other machine learning classifiers under comparison. In addition, our FESVM has better performance than the original stacking method in the multi-class classification tasks. Statistical results based on the Wilcoxon–Holm method also confirms that our FESVM can significantly outperform the other models. These indicate that our FESVM can be a useful tool for classification tasks, especially multi-classification tasks.},

Metrics of critical node evaluation are constructed by combining the node embedding vectors and local structural features to evaluate the node&#39;s importance. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better evaluation accuracy than the K-Shell algorithm (K-Shell), K-shell-based gravity model ranking algorithm (KSDG), the Page Rank algorithm in MLN (PR), influence maximization based on network embedding (IMNE) and the node ranking algorithm based on information entropy (ERM).},

As the number of third-party APIs grows, it becomes increasingly challenging to quickly find suitable APIs that meet users’ requirements. Inspired by recommender systems, API recommendation methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, previous API recommendation methods are insufficient in utilising the high-order interactions between users and APIs, and thus have limited performance. Based on the model of lightweight graph convolutional neural network, this paper proposes an effective API recommendation method by exploiting both low-order and high-order interactions between users and APIs. It first learns the embedding of users and APIs from the user-API interaction graph, and then adopts a weighted summation operator to aggregate the embeddings learned from different propagation layers for API recommendation. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real dataset with 160,309 API users and 21,031 Web APIs, and the results show that our method has significantly better precision and recall than other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of Internet data traffic, the means of malicious attack become more diversified. The single modal intrusion detection model cannot fully exploit the rich feature information in the massive network traffic data, resulting in unsatisfactory detection results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal hybrid parallel network intrusion detection model (MHPN). The proposed model extracts network traffic features from two modalities: the statistical information of network traffic and the original load of traffic, and constructs appropriate neural network models for each modal information. Firstly, a two-branch convolutional neural network is combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract the spatio-temporal feature information of network traffic from the original load mode of traffic, and a convolutional neural network is used to extract the feature information of traffic statistics. Then, the feature information extracted from the two modalities is fused and fed to the CosMargin classifier for network traffic classification. The experimental results on the ISCX-IDS 2012 and CIC-IDS-2017 datasets show that the MHPN model outperforms the single-modal models and achieves an average accuracy of 99.98 % . The model also demonstrates strong robustness and a positive sample recognition rate.},

Secondly, MoCoUTRL uses a dynamic dictionary to act as the approximately ground-truth representation for each token, providing the pseudo labels for token-level contrastive learning. The MoCoUTRL can extend the use of pre-trained language models (PLM) and even large-scale language models (LLM) into a plug-and-play semantic feature extractor that can fuel multiple downstream tasks. Experimental results on several publicly available datasets and further theoretical analysis validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed method in this paper.},

Since most real-world data is automatically correlated, autoregressive models are available. Comparisons were made between the ARLs obtained using the explicit formula and the numerical integral equation (NIE) approach. The results showed that the explicit formula&#39;s use of the ARL outperformed the NIE approach in terms of computation time. After that, the efficacy of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and double EWMA charts is then compared using the suggested explicit ARL formula. The ARL of the double EWMA chart was found to perform better than the ARL of the EWMA chart in all situations. It also uses natural gas and diesel prices on stock exchanges around the world as cases studies. The results show that the double EWMA chart has better detection sensitivity than the EWMA chart, and the results are consistent with the experimental results. As a result, the sensitivity of the double EWMA chart in detecting changes makes it a good alternative for monitoring processes with real-world data.},

  abstract     = {Traffic matrices (TMs) are essential for managing networks. Getting the whole TMs is difficult because of the high measurement cost. Several recent studies propose sparse measurement schemes to reduce the cost, which involve taking measurements on only a subset of origin and destination pairs (OD pairs) and inferring data for unmeasured OD pairs through matrix completion. However, existing sparse network measurement schemes suffer from the problems of high computation costs and low recovery quality. This paper investigates the coherence feature of real traffic flow data traces (Abilene and GÈANT). Both data sets are high coherence, with column coherence greater than row coherence. According to the coherence feature of both data sets, we propose our Redundant Row Subspace-based Matrix Completion (RRS-MC). RRS-MC involves several techniques. Firstly, we design an algorithm to identify subspace rows (OD pairs) from historical data. Secondly, based on the identified subspace rows, we design our sampling scheduling algorithm, which takes full measurement samples in subspace rows while taking partial measurement samples in the remaining rows. Moreover, we propose a redundant sampling rule prevent the recovery accuracy decrease caused by the subspace rows varying. Finally, we design a completion algorithm to recover the partially measured rows. We conduct extensive experiments. Results indicate that the proposed scheme is superior to the state-of-the-art sampling and completion scheme in computation costs and recovery accuracy.},

The main idea of cloud auditing is to entrust the audit task to a third-party auditor (TPA) with powerful computing ability. However, TPA may lead to data leakage and become the single point of failure. Recently, blockchain has been introduced to solve these problems by TPA. However, the dynamic storage structure developed by traditional cloud storage does not apply to the blockchain. This paper proposes a blockchain-based collaborative public auditing scheme for dynamic data. We design the cloud service provider(CSP) to generate a challenge set using the latest block hash. It does not need to interact with the blockchain in the challenge phase, dramatically reducing communication overhead. In addition, considering economic factors, we allow users to seek partners to reduce audit costs. The EigenTrust model evaluates the reputation of each user&#39;s audit behaviour, effectively avoiding the probability of malicious users participating. For data update, we introduce the Pseudo Index Linked List(PIL) index management structure, which reduces the size of the index management structure to adapt to the blockchain&#39;s characteristics and makes the update operation have a constant time complexity. Through a complete security analysis and performance evaluation, we proved the security and effectiveness of the scheme.},

Therefore, the traditional recommendation method cannot meet people&#39;s requirements. In this paper, we propose the Collaborative Knowledge Propagation Graph Attention Network for Recipes Recommendation (CGRS). This method designs collaborative information propagation to make full use of user interaction and recipe attribute information to meet the needs of multiple influencing factors. Use the graph attention feature learning network to obtain the high-order feature information of the entity to meet the demand for fine-grained representation. Specifically, the method first obtains the multi-hop triplet sets of users and recipes through a collaborative message propagation strategy. Then utilises a graph attention feature learning layer to learn the topological proximity structure features of the triplet sets. Obtain high-level semantic information of entities by superimposing network layers. Design an attention aggregator at the prediction layer to refine the embedding representation of entities. Finally predict the user-recipe interaction probability. Experimental results prove the advancement and effectiveness of CGRS.},

Therefore, this paper presents a trajectory privacy data publishing scheme, denoted as LORDP, which is based on local optimisation and R-tree. The proposed scheme aims to handle sensitive data while improves trajectory protection effectiveness. Firstly, the scheme combines the LKC-privacy model requirement to filter out the minimum violating sequences set, to reduce data sensitivity and the amount of injected noise. Secondly, R-tree is constructed based on trajectory similarity. Finally, Laplacian noise is added to the R-tree’s leaf nodes constrained by differential privacy. The experiments show that the proposed LORDP algorithm significantly enhances the utility of data compared to other algorithms, and reduces the loss rate of about approximately 2% for per trajectory data, which shows that the present algorithm is extremely effective.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing takes advantage of human intelligence to solve complex problems that computers cannot handle. People actively participate in computational tasks for rewards, especially those that are relatively simple for humans but challenging for computers. However, most traditional crowdsourcing systems must rely on a central organisation to handle the work associated with crowdsourcing. This may lead to privacy and security issues such as information leakage, single point of attack and unfair judgement. Meanwhile, the high service fees of existing central crowdsourcing platforms will reduce people&#39;s motivation to participate in crowdsourcing tasks. Consequently, PrivBCS is proposed in this paper, a blockchain-based decentralised crowdsourcing system that does not rely on third-party agencies and requires only low transaction fees. In this paper, PrivBCS protects the confidentiality of crowdsourcing data and the identity privacy of participants by cryptographic means, such as Paillier, El-Gamal and CPABE. It selects the most suitable worker to perform tasks by setting access control policies on task data and matching workers&#39; attributes while ensuring the anonymity of workers&#39; identity. Considering that the data volume of crowdsourcing tasks may be large and there is a certain upper limit to the block capacity of the blockchain, an on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage scheme is proposed, which can increase the throughput of the blockchain system and improve its scalability to a certain extent. In PrivBCS, we implement the transaction process of crowdsourcing tasks through smart contracts. The experimental results and security analysis in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and feasibility of PrivBCS.},

  abstract     = {The deep integration of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Artificial intelligence makes the further development of intelligent medical services possible, but privacy leakage and data security problems hinder its wide application. Although the combination of IoMT and federated learning (FL) can achieve no direct access to the original data of participants, FL still can&#39;t resist inference attacks against model parameters and the single point of failure of the central server. In addition, malicious clients can disguise as benign participants to launch poisoning attacks, which seriously compromises the accuracy of the global model. In this paper, we design a new privacy protection framework (BFG) for decentralized FL using blockchain, differential privacy and Generative Adversarial Network. The framework can effectively avoid a single point of failure and resist inference attacks. In particular, it can limit the success rate of poisoning attacks to less than 26%. Moreover, the framework alleviates the storage pressure of the blockchain, achieves a balance between privacy budget and global model accuracy, and can effectively resist the negative impact of node withdrawal. Simulation experiments on image datasets show that the BFG framework has a better combined performance in terms of accuracy, robustness and privacy preservation.},

However, the centralised FL is vulnerable to a single-point failure. While decentralised and tamper-proof blockchains can cope with the above issues, it is difficult to find a benign benchmark gradient and eliminate the poisoning attack in the later stage of global model aggregation. To address the above problems, we present a global to local based privacy-preserving federated consensus scheme against poisoning attacks (FedG2L). This scheme can effectively reduce the influence of poisoning attacks on model accuracy. In the global aggregation stage, a gradient-similarity-based secure consensus algorithm ( Sec PBFT) is designed to eliminate malicious gradients. During this procedure, the gradient of the data owner will not be leaked. Then, we propose an improved ACGAN algorithm to generate local data to further update the model without poisoning attacks. Finally, we theoretically prove the security and correctness of our scheme. Experimental results demonstrated that the model accuracy is improved by at least 55% than no defense scheme, and the attack success rate is reduced by more than 60%.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of traffic classification is to allocate bandwidth to different types of data on a network. Application-level traffic classification is important for identifying the applications that are in high demand on the network. Due to the increasing complexity and volume of internet traffic, machine learning and deep learning methods are being used more frequently in traffic classification. The focus of this research is to evaluate the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in classifying network packets by application type, as well as classifying the type of data communicated within an application. The research considers encrypted network packets, including those from Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and the WhatsApp mobile application. Previous research has shown that deep learning methods are effective in the feature learning process, so this study uses a simple feed-forward Deep Neural Network (DNN) to improve the performance of the SVM algorithm. Additionally, various feature learning frameworks based on deep learning, such as DNN, Autoencoder and PCA, are compared. The study concludes that the DNN is able to improve the F1 score of the SVM classifier from 0.78 to 0.90. Furthermore, the study shows that using a hybrid framework of DNN with SVM can address the class imbalance problem often present in machine learning.},

However, labeling huge amounts of data is expensive, making it difficult to train a good detector with limited labeled data. Existing approaches mitigate this issue via active learning or semi-supervised learning, but there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method for deep object detection that fully exploits unlabeled data by combining the benefits of active learning and semi-supervised learning. Our method first trains an initial model using limited labeled data, then uses self-training and data augmentation strategies to train a semi-supervised model using labeled and unlabeled data. We then select query samples based on informativeness and representativeness from the unlabeled data to further improve the model through semi-supervised training. Experimental results on commonly used object detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problem of low detection accuracy of network traffic data types by traditional intrusion detection methods, we propose an improved Harris Hawk hybrid intrusion detection method to enhance the detection capability. The improved Harris Hawk optimization algorithm is used as a feature selection scheme to reduce the impact of redundant and noisy features on the performance of the classification model. The algorithm introduces the singer map to initialise the population, uses multi-information fusion to obtain the best prey position, and applies the sine function-based escape energy to execute a prey search strategy to obtain the optimal subset of features. In addition, the original data is preprocessed by the k-nearest neighbour and deep denoising autoencoder (KNN-DDAE) to relieve the imbalance problem of the network traffic data. Finally, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to complete the classification. Simulation experiments are conducted on the dataset NSL-KDD, KDD CUP99, and UNSW-NB15. The results show that our feature selection and data balancing scheme greatly improves the detection accuracy. In addition, the detection performance of this method is better than the current popular intrusion detection schemes.},

  abstract     = {Safety-critical systems play a significant role in industrial domains, and their complexity is increasing with advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). To provide efficient services, safety-critical systems that integrate AI applications are always built based on Linux, where Linux offers massive amounts of features and an incredibly perfect software ecosystem for AI applications. Since Linux is a pre-existing complex software system, different research programmes aim to pave the way for developing Linux-based safety-critical systems. Still, only some focus on the system calls for file operations. However, the execution path of a system call is effectively non-deterministic in Linux kernel space, which challenges the test coverage-based verification recommended by the functional safety standards. This research analyzes the influence of system state on Linux kernel path variability from two perspectives: file system type and system load. Therefore, an online data collection system for system call execution paths was constructed based on Ftrace, network file system (NFS), and MD5 hash function, uniquely identifying the system call execution path. The collected data were processed and analysed in this study. Evaluations show that the number of function execution paths of the system calls relevant to file systems increased with the increase in system load but would eventually be stable. Additionally, the function execution paths of the system call varied in different file systems. Based on the evaluations, the results of this work can provide advice for analyzing Linux-based safety-critical systems. In addition, the method introduced in this research can also provide support for the verification of Linux-based safety-critical systems.},

  abstract     = {Online transaction fraud has become increasingly rampant due to the convenience of mobile payment. Fraud detection is critical to ensure the security of online transactions. With the development of graph neural network, researchers have applied it to the field of fraud detection. The existing fraud detection methods will solve the class imbalance by sampling, but they do not fully consider the various imbalances in the heterogeneous graph, and the data imbalance will directly affect the performance of the model. This work proposes a hybrid graph neural network model for online fraud detection to address this issue. The three types of imbalance in online transactions are feature imbalance, category imbalance, and relation imbalance, and they are all addressed in the proposed model. The entities with the feature most closely related to the fraudsters will be determined for the feature imbalance, and samples will be taken for further identification in the subsequent training phase. The hybrid model then uses under-sampling in combination with the long-distance sampling to find nodes with high similarity of features for the category imbalance. Finally, we propose a reward/punishment mechanism based on reinforcement learning for relation imbalance, which uses the threshold created by training as the sampling weight between relations. This paper conducts experiments on the public datasets Amazon and Yelp. The experimental results show that the model proposed is 5.61% higher than the best model in the comparison model on Amazon dataset, and 1.58% higher on Yelp dataset.},

The research proposes a framework for extracting semantically rich facts from data by incorporating domain knowledge into the data mining process through the use of ontologies. An improved Apriori algorithm is employed for mining semantic association rules, while the interestingness of the rules is evaluated using BERT models for semantic richness.

Understanding differences among process variants helps analysts and managers to make informed decisions as to how to standardise or otherwise improve a business process. Existing process variant mining approaches typically fall short in full supporting semantic process variability mining, especially rarely taking activity behaviour relationships and trace context semantic into consideration. Here, we propose a semantic process variant discovery method, aimed at solving the difficulty of distinguishing similar-but-different behaviours directly from event logs. More specifically, we adapt concepts of benchmark logs and trace context tree to formalise context semantic of event log, to classify benchmark logs into several parts, thereby the clustered trace cohorts are mapped to discover the configurable process variants. In the experimental part, some performance metrics of the proposed method are evaluated and calculated by real-world event logs, supporting the usefulness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to distinguish similar-but-different behaviours and is superior to the characteristic trace clustering method using conventional neural networks.},

Existing studies have recognised the value of interactive learning in ABSA and have developed various methods to precisely model aspect words and their contexts through interactive learning. However, these methods mostly take a shallow interactive way to model aspect words and their contexts, which may lead to the lack of complex sentiment information. To solve this issue, we propose a Lightweight Multilayer Interactive Attention Network (LMIAN) for ABSA. Specifically, we first employ a pre-trained language model to initialise word embedding vectors. Second, an interactive computational layer is designed to build correlations between aspect words and their contexts. Such correlation degree is calculated by multiple computational layers with neural attention models. Third, we use a parameter-sharing strategy among the computational layers. This allows the model to learn complex sentiment features with lower memory costs. Finally, LMIAN conducts instance validation on six publicly available sentiment analysis datasets. Extensive experiments show that LMIAN performs better than other advanced methods with relatively low memory consumption.},

The MERD approach incorporates intelligent computing principles from computer science into the resource scheduling of the construction process, modelling the installation scheduling problem into a combinatorial optimisation problem. Designing the probability method based on Bayes theorem, the MERD approach carries out an installation provisioning mechanism to optimise personnel and device allocation in the selected area. As a result, the MERD approach minimises construction hours and reduces labour costs in the construction process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the MERD approach in reducing work time and cost in engineering projects.},

  abstract     = {The mobile healthcare (mHealth) is a promising and fascinating paradigm, which can dramatically improve the quality of healthcare delivery by providing remote diagnosis and medical record sharing. Now, the mHealth faces serious challenges such as data leakage and unauthorised access currently. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) which has been employed for mHealth is an excellent cryptographic primitive of securing data sharing. However, there are still some security and efficiency issues in the ABE-based data sharing scheme for mHealth. Firstly, the explicit storage of access policy may expose the privacy of users. Secondly, the computation cost is high, especially in the mHealth with IoT devices. Thirdly, the authentication of access rights to shared data is usually performed by the centralised third parties or IoT devices with limited resources. To handle the above issues, this paper presents a privacy-preserving and efficient data sharing scheme. The scheme partially hides access policy to protect user&#39;s privacy, and introduces an offline mechanism in key generation and encryption phase to improve efficiency of mHealth. Furthermore, it also provides decentralised and trusted authentication of data access right based on blockchain. The security proofs and the experiment results demonstrate that the presented scheme has better security and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) technology and the global COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals gain access to patients’ health data from remote wearable medical equipment. Federated learning (FL) addresses the difficulty of sharing data in remote medical systems. However, some key issues and challenges persist, such as heterogeneous health data stored in hospitals, which leads to high communication cost and low model accuracy. There are many approaches of federated distillation (FD) methods used to solve these problems, but FD is very vulnerable to poisoning attacks and requires a centralised server for aggregation, which is prone to single-node failure. To tackle this issue, we combine FD and blockchain to solve data sharing in remote medical system called FedRMD. FedRMD use reputation incentive to defend against poisoning attacks and store reputation values and soft labels of FD in Hyperledger Fabric. Experimenting on COVID-19 radiography and COVID-Chestxray datasets shows our method can reduce communication cost, and the performance is higher than FedAvg, FedDF, and FedGen. In addition, the reputation incentive can reduce the impact of poisoning attacks.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of machine learning in the field of classification, the classification fairness has become the research emphasis second to prediction accuracy. However, the data bias and algorithmic discrimination that affect the fair classification of models have not been well resolved, which may damage or benefit the specific groups related to the sensitive attributes (e.g. age, race, and gender). To alleviate the unfairness of the classification model, this study proposes a novel bias-alleviated hybrid ensemble model (BAHEM) based on over-sampling and post-processing. First, a new clustering-based over-sampling method is proposed to reduce the data bias caused by the imbalance in label and sensitive attribute. Then, a stacking-based ensemble learning method is employed to obtain the higher performance and robustness of the BAHEM. Finally, a new classification with alternating normalisation (CAN)-based post-processing method is proposed to further improve the fairness and maintain the accuracy of the BAHEM. Three datasets with different sensitive attributes and four evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy and fairness of the BAHEM. The experimental results verify the superior fairness of the BAHEM with little accuracy reduction.},

However, DRL is not good at training deep networks in an end-to-end manner due to data inefficiency and lack of direct supervision signals. This paper provides a visual information dimension reduction scheme with representation learning as the visual perception module, which reduces the dimensions of high-dimensional visual information and retains its features related to UAV navigation. Combining such state representation learning with the DRL model can effectively reduce the complexity of the neural network required by DRL. Based on this scheme, we design three motion control models with a monocular camera as the main sensor and train them to control UAVs for obstacle avoidance tasks in a simulated environment. Experiments show that all these models achieve high obstacle avoidance ability after a certain period of training. In addition, one of them also enables the monocular vision guidance system to avoid obstacles in the blind spot of side vision.},

However, the existing super-resolution models have some problems, such as missing details, distorted natural texture, blurred details and too smooth after image reconstruction. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a Multi-scale Dual-Attention based Residual Dense Generative Adversarial Network (MARDGAN), which uses multi-branch paths to extract image features and obtain multi-scale feature information. This paper also designs the channel and spatial attention block (CSAB), which is combined with the enhanced residual dense block (ERDB) to extract multi-level depth feature information and enhance feature reuse. In addition, the multi-scale feature information extracted under the three-branch path is fused with global features, and sub-pixel convolution is used to restore the high-resolution image. The experimental results show that the objective evaluation index of MARDGAN on multiple benchmark datasets is higher than other methods, and the subjective visual effect is better. This model can effectively use the original image information to restore the super-resolution image with clearer details and stronger authenticity.},

  abstract     = {Span classification is a popular method for nested named entity recognition. To recognise full-span named entities, span-based models should enumerate and verify all possible entity spans in a sentence, which leads to serious problems regarding computational complexity and data imbalance. In this study, we propose a boundary regression model to support full-span named entity recognition, where a regression operation is adopted to refine spatial locations of entity spans in a sentence. Therefore, instead of exhaustively enumerating all possible spans, we need only verify a small number of them. Span boundaries are regressed to find all possible named entities in a sentence. Furthermore, for a better representation of long-named entities, a multi-granule sentence representation is adopted to encode semantic features with different semantic granularities. In our experiments, even enumerating a small number of entity spans, our model still has competitive performance, achieving 87.35% and 80.85% F1 scores on the ACE2005 and GENIA datasets. Analytical experiments show that our model is able to find all named entities in a sentence without exhaustively verifying all possible entity spans. It is effective in mitigating the computational complexity and data imbalance problems in full-span named entity recognition.},

However, with the rapid development of vehicle networks, it will be invaded by various security problems, such as privacy disclosure, session key security, forward security, etc. To eliminate the security threats faced by the vehicle network and ensure privacy and secure communication between vehicles and roadside units(RSU), it is necessary to introduce a secure, reliable, and efficient authentication key agreement scheme. Therefore, based on the principle of challenge authentication handshake protocol, we propose a novel security authentication and key agreement scheme for the vehicle networks. The scheme meets mutual authentication, and is the session key of communication protocol between vehicle and roadside unit to resist common attacks. In addition, compared with other schemes, our scheme has the advantage that we can flexibly set time keys to constrain vehicle behaviour and achieve dynamic vehicle management. We also give a formal security proof of the scheme under the random oracle model (ROM). Finally, the efficiency of the protocol is evaluated, and the computing and communication overhead of our scheme is about 35% lower than that of the existing scheme. So, our scheme is more practical.},

  abstract     = {The work presented here is a high dimensional color image encryption architecture (HDIEA) founded on the Lorenz-Gauss-Logistic (LGL) encryption algorithm. The primary objective is to demonstrate that both the proposed novel five-dimensional (5D) Gauss-Logistic and four-dimensional (4D) Lorenz system are operating in a hyper-chaotic condition. The visual study of their most important characteristics, such as the sensitivity of the starting value of both maps and the Lyapunov exponent of the 5D Gauss Logistic map, is carried out. The Runge–Kutta technique is used to discretise the Lorenz system in order to construct a pseudo-random sequence generation for the control parameter that has a greater degree of randomness. The 5D Gauss-Logistic system is then selected to serve as the principal hyper-chaotic mapping scheme. The simulation results demonstrate that the suggested image encryption method is successful according to the NIST test and has powerful anti-attack, a larger key space as large as 2 847 , which is prone to multiple attacks, and key sensitivity capabilities. Also, the pixel correlation reached −0.0019, −0.0016, and −0.0069, while the information entropy was at 7.9996. This demonstrates the excellent scrambling effect of the proposed approach, which is capable of greatly improving the color image security performance.},

Due to its importance, the impartiality is forced to be realised even by increasing the corresponding cost in terms of the strength of weights. For the first approximation, three types of impartial competition can be developed: componential, computational, and collective competition. In the componential competition, every weight should have an equal chance on average to win the competition. In the computational competition, all computational procedures should have an equal chance to be applied sequentially in learning. In collective computing for interpretation, all network configurations, obtained by learning, have an equal chance to participate in a process of interpretation, representing one of the most idealised forms of impartiality. The method was applied to a well-known second-language-learning data set. The intuitive conclusion, stressed in the specific science, could not be extracted by the conventional natural language processing methods, because they can deal only with word frequency. The present method tried to extract a main feature beyond the word frequency by competing connection weights and computational procedures impartially, followed by collective and impartial competition for interpretation.},

However, typical RL-based methods normally suffer from challenges such as sparse and delayed reward problems. Besides, with user goal unavailable in real scenarios, the reward estimator is unable to generate reward reflecting action validity and task completion. Those issues may slow down and degrade the policy learning significantly. In this paper, we present a novel scheduled knowledge distillation framework for dialogue policy learning, which trains a compact student reward estimator by distilling the prior knowledge of user goals from a large teacher model. To further improve the stability of dialogue policy learning, we propose to leverage self-paced learning to arrange meaningful training order for the student reward estimator. Comprehensive experiments on Microsoft Dialogue Challenge and MultiWOZ datasets indicate that our approach significantly accelerates the learning speed, and the task-completion success rate can be improved from 0.47%∼9.01% compared with several strong baselines.},

  abstract     = {The orthogonal projection method has made significant progress in text classification, especially in generating discriminative features. This method obtains more pure and suitable for classification features by projecting text features onto the orthogonal direction of common features (which are not helpful for classification and actually confuse performance). However, this approach requires an additional branch network to generate these common features, which reduces the flexibility of this method compared to representation optimisation methods such as self-attention mechanisms, as it requires significant modification of the base network structure to use. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Inversed Attention Orthogonal Projection Module (IAOPM). IAOPM uses inversed attention (IA) to iteratively reverse the attention map on text features, encouraging the network to remove discriminating features from the text features and obtain potential common features. Unlike the original orthogonal projection method, IAOPM can extract common features within a single network without any branch networks, increasing the flexibility of the orthogonal projection method. We also use an orthogonal loss to ensure the quality of the common features during training, so IAOPM also has better purity performance than the original method. Experiments show that text classification models based on IAOPM outperform the baseline models, self-attention mechanisms, and the original orthogonal projection method on multiple text classification datasets with an average accuracy increase of 1.02%, 0.44%, and 0.52%, respectively.},

However, real-time small-scale pedestrian detection in intelligent vehicle environment perception systems is still needs to be improved. This paper proposes an intelligent vehicle-pedestrian detection method based on YOLOv5s, named IVP-YOLOv5, to use in vehicle environment perception systems. Based on the network structure of YOLOv5s, we replaced BottleNeck CSP with Ghost-Bottleneck to reduce the complexity of processing feature maps while maintaining good detection performance. To reduce the error between the ground truth box and the predicted box, we apply Alpha-IoU as the bounding box loss function, improving pedestrian detection accuracy and robustness. We introduce the slicing-aided hyper inference (SAHI) strategy, which enables the lightweight backbone network to capture more detailed features of pedestrians by enlarging image pixels. Experiments on the BDD100 K dataset show that the proposed IVP-YOLOv5 achieves 67.1% AP and 18.5% APs of pedestrian detection, and the GFLOPs and the number of parameters are only 10.5 and 4.9M.},

The collaborative pursuit-evasion mission is divided into two stages: the encirclement stage and pursuit-evasion stage. When pursuers fly to the mission area from a distance, the formation and obstacle avoidance method based on leader-follower mode is designed for the encirclement process. In the pursuit-evasion stage, considering obstacle avoidance and manoeuver constraint, a collaborative strategy combining Apollonius circle algorithm and geometric algorithm is proposed, and the condition for the successful capture of a single superior evader is analysed. In the simulation, the influence of obstacle size and manoeuver constraint is compared and analysed in detail, which indicates that they will increase the capture time even changes the result of the game in the limited map. In addition, the complexity of the algorithm is M times higher than that of the obstacle-free case ( M is the number of obstacles in the map).},

The positioning accuracy of the conventional radio frequency positioning approach is severely impacted. The latest panoramic vision positioning technology relies on binocular cameras. And that cannot be used for monocular cameras in industrial scenarios. This paper proposes a monocular vision positioning method based on YOLOv7 and coordinate transformation to solve the problem of positioning accuracy in the digital workshop. Positioning beacons are placed on the top of the moving vehicle with a uniform height. The coordinate position of the beacon on the image is obtained through the YOLOv7 model based on transfer learning. Then, coordinate transformation is applied to obtain the real space coordinates of the vehicle. Experimental results show that the proposed single-eye vision system can improve the positioning accuracy of the digital workshop.

This study proposes a cue prompt adapting (CPA) model for relation extraction (RE) that encodes contextual features and semantic dependencies by implanting task-relevant cues in a sentence. Additionally, a new transformer architecture is proposed to adapt pre-trained language models (PLMs) to perceive named entities in a relation instance. Finally, in the decoding process, a goal-oriented prompt template is designed to take advantage of the potential semantic features of a PLM. The proposed model is evaluated using three public corpora: ACE, ReTACRED, and Semeval. The performance achieves an impressive improvement, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.

  abstract     = {For autonomous vehicles, free-space detection is an essential part of visual perception. With the development of multi-modal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in recent years, the performance of driving scene semantic segmentation algorithms has been dramatically improved. Therefore most free-space detection algorithms are developed based on multiple sensors. However, multi-modal CNNs have high data throughput and contain a large number of computationally intensive convolution calculations, limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide a unique combination of flexibility, performance, and low power for these problems to accommodate multi-modal data and the computational acceleration of different compression algorithms. Network lightweight methods offer great assurance for facilitating the deployment of CNNs on such resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a network lightweight method for a multi-modal free-space detection algorithm. We first propose an FPGA-friendly multi-modal free-space detection lightweight network. It comprises operators that FPGA prefers and achieves a 95.54 % MaxF score on the test set of KITTI-Road free-space detection tasks and 81 ms runtime when running on 700 W GPU devices. Then we present a pruning approach for this network to reduce the number of parameters in case the complete model exceeds the FPGA chip memory. The pruning is in two parts. For the feature extractors, we propose a data-dependent filter pruner according to the principle that the low-rank feature map contains less information. To not compromise the integrity of the multi-modal information, the pruner is independent for each modality. For the segmentation decoder, we apply a channel pruning approach to remove redundant parameters. Finally, we implement our designs on an FPGA board using 8-bit quantisation, and the accelerator achieves outstanding performance. A real-time application of scene segmentation on KITTI-Road is used to evaluate our algorithm, and the model achieves a 94.39 % MaxF score and minimum 14 ms runtime on 20W FPGA devices.},

In this paper, we present a system for building a Malay NER dataset (MS-NER) of 20,146 sentences through labelled datasets of homologous languages and iterative optimisation. Additionally, we propose a M ulti- T ask framework, namely MTBR, to integrate boundary information more effectively for NER. Specifically, boundary detection is treated as an auxiliary task and an enhanced Bidirectional Revision module with a gated ignoring mechanism is proposed to undertake conditional label transfer. This can reduce error propagation by the auxiliary task. We conduct extensive experiments on Malay, Indonesian, and English. Experimental results show that MTBR could achieve competitive performance and tends to outperform multiple baselines. The constructed dataset and model would be made available to the public as a new, reliable benchmark for Malay NER.},

This paper proposes a lightweight and efficient object detection model based on YOLOv4, first using the lightweight network GhostNet to extract image features and reduce the number of parameters and computation of the backbone structure; then combining AFmodule and Meta-ACON activation function to enhance the feature extraction capability of the backbone network, which strengthen the mode’s ability to capture image spatial feature information; this paper also designs the RL-PAFPN feature fusion structure is with the Reslayer module to further improve the model’s ability to extract and fuse image features. By comparing other mainstream object detection models, the YOLOv4-Ghost-AMR network in this paper has less computation and fewer parameters, and the accuracy of the model reaches 86.83%, which is suitable for deployment in mobile devices with limited storage. The model proposed in this paper can be applied to medical, traffic and fault detection fields, which changes the traditional manual detection method and saves manpower and time costs, achieving high precision real-time object detection.},

  abstract     = {The autonomous driving algorithm studied in this paper makes a ground vehicle capable of sensing its environment via visual images and moving safely with little or no human input. Due to the limitation of the computing power of end side devices, the autonomous driving algorithm should adopt a lightweight model and have high performance. Conditional imitation learning has been proved an efficient and promising policy for autonomous driving and other applications on end side devices due to its high performance and offline characteristics. In driving scenarios, the images captured in different weathers have different styles, which are influenced by various interference factors, such as illumination, raindrops, etc. These interference factors bring challenges to the perception ability of deep models, thus affecting the decision-making process in autonomous driving. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate the performance gap of driving models under different weather conditions. Following the investigation, we utilise StarGAN-V2 to translate images from source domains into the target clear sunset domain. Based on the images translated by StarGAN-V2, we propose Conditional Imitation Learning with ResNet backbone named Star-CILRS. The proposed method is able to convert an image to multiple styles using only one single model, making our method easier to deploy on end side devices. Visualization results show that Star-CILRS can eliminate some environmental interference factors. Our method outperforms other methods and the success rate values in different tasks are 98%, 74%, and 22%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Porcelain insulators play an important role in power transmission lines. It is of great significance to improve the accuracy of diagnosis of porcelain insulators’ discharge state and ensure the reliability of power supply. Therefore, this paper presents a diagnosis method of polluted discharge state of porcelain insulator based on GA-optimised CNN network structure. Firstly, the artificial pollution discharge test of porcelain insulator is carried out. According to the characteristics of leakage current, the discharge development process is divided into five stages: normal state, initial discharge, through discharge, flashover and flashover completion. GA algorithm is used to optimise the parameters of CNN model, and several single models are established simultaneously to compare the progress with the proposed model. The results show that GA has the advantages of global optimisation, less adjustment parameters, etc. It can automatically select the best structure of CNN network, avoid the problem of poor performance of artificial selection of CNN network structure, reduce the time required for parameter selection, and improve the accuracy of diagnosis of polluted discharge state of porcelain insulators, with the diagnosis accuracy as high as 99.2%. The results show that the discharge state of porcelain insulator surface can be judged by leakage current.},

  abstract     = {To prevent products with missing character information from reaching the market, manufacturers need an automatic character recognition method. One of the key problems of this recognition method is to recognise text under complex package patterns. In addition, some products use dot matrix characters to reduce printing costs, which makes text extraction more difficult. We propose a character detection algorithm using DBNet as the base network, combined with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to improve its feature extraction of characters in complex contexts. After the character area has been located by the detection algorithm, it is intercepted and fed into a fully convolutional character recognition network to achieve print character recognition. We use ResNet as the backbone network and CTC loss for training. In addition, the CBAM module was added to the backbone network to enhance its recognition of dot matrix characters. The algorithm was finally deployed on the jetson nano. The experimental results show that the character detection accuracy reaches 97.9%, an improvement of 1.9% compared to the original network. As for the character recognition algorithm, the inference speed is doubled when deployed to the nano platform compared to the CRNN network, with an accuracy of 97.8%.},

  abstract     = {Due to the advantages of all-weather capability and high resolution, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image ship detection has been widely applied in the military, civilian, and other domains. However, SAR-based ship detection suffers from limitations such as strong scattering of targets, multiple scales, and background interference, leading to low detection accuracy. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel SAR ship detection method, NAS-YOLOX, which leverages the efficient feature fusion of the neural architecture search feature pyramid network (NAS-FPN) and the effective feature extraction of the multi-scale attention mechanism. Specifically, NAS-FPN replaces the PAFPN in the baseline YOLOX, greatly enhances the fusion performance of the model’s multi-scale feature information, and a dilated convolution feature enhancement module (DFEM) is designed and integrated into the backbone network to improve the network’s receptive field and target information extraction capabilities. Furthermore, a multi-scale channel-spatial attention (MCSA) mechanism is conceptualised to enhance focus on target regions, improve small-scale target detection, and adapt to multi-scale targets. Additionally, extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, HRSID and SSDD, demonstrate that NAS-YOLOX achieves comparable or superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art ship detection models and reaches best accuracies of 91.1% and 97.2% on AP 0.5 , respectively.},
