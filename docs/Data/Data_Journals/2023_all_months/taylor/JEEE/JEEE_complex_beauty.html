  abstract     = {Investment in social interaction and affiliative behaviour is often related to variation in sex-specific dispersal patterns among species but can also vary within species in response to local environmental conditions and feeding competition. Chimpanzee () association patterns have been studied primarily in low and mid-elevation tropical forests. This study adds to our understanding of association patterns in chimpanzees by presenting the first data on association patterns in a high-elevation population at Nyungwe in equatorial Rwanda. Using data on co-occurrence in social parties (party association) and calculating gregariousness indices, we quantified levels of associations among age-sex classes relative to food (fruit) distribution and the presence of oestrous females. Overall, adult females in Nyungwe are less gregarious than males. Female but not male gregariousness increased when feeding on clumped foods, indicating that resource characteristics impact female association tendencies more intensely than males. Despite high elevation forests representing a habitat with relatively fewer fruit resources for chimpanzees, at an edge of range location, we found that gregariousness patterns were driven by similar factors as those in mid and low elevation chimpanzee populations.},

  abstract     = {There are several factors, such as genetic drift, gene flow and migration that affect the population genetic structure and phylogeographic distribution of genetic lineages within single species. Previous studies of the bladder grasshoppers, of South Africa, showed divergence in mitochondrial CO1 (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1) haplotype diversity and significant genetic structure. In this study, we revisit these findings adding more samples from different locations and using mitochondrial CO1 and Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequences. We tested the hypothesis that the western, northern and eastern distribution ranges of show different population genetic patterns, corresponding with isolation-by-distance. Mitochondrial CO1 and ITS data were collected for 99 individuals from 12 localities across the Western, Northern and Eastern sides of South Africa. Overall, significant variation in genetic structure was found across the localities as indicated by analyses. Haplotype and phylogeographical analyses suggested that restricted gene flow played a role in shaping current genetic patterns, although isolation-by-distance was not supported, as confirmed by Mantel tests. Phylogenetic trees of both genetic sequences revealed two major clades, with western and northern sides. Also, the major clades exhibit a few sub-clades within the localities, showing other factors shaping the genetic structure of include the geographical barriers, and most likely due to changes in habitat specificity and habitat fragmentation. Taken together, this study aims to contribute information on the population structure and genetic diversity of populations across South Africa.},

In the current study, we employed GPS-tracking technology and unilateral HF lesions to further explore what if any aspects of a pigeon’s homing flight might be under dominant control by either the left or right HF. Pigeons were released from three locations prior to any experimental manipulation and released repeatedly from the same three sites as sham-lesioned control, right HF-lesioned and left HF-lesioned treatment groups. Analyses of homing performance and virtual vanishing bearings revealed no effect of either lesion treatment. A more in-depth analysis of path efficiency during the initial decision-making, en route and near home phases of a homing flight also revealed no effect of either lesion treatment. A last analysis on the learning and memory for positions along a previously flown route, a proxy for investigating the development of route fidelity, also revealed no effect of either unilateral lesion. However, independent of treatment group, some statistically significant effects were observed with respect to changes in performance across training and the different release sites. The current study revealed no detectable difference between the left and right HF-lesioned pigeons with respect to several navigational parameters of a homing flight. Although in need of supporting experimentation, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that both the left and right HF are similarly able to support several aspects of homing pigeon navigation.},

  abstract     = {Animal species living in highly seasonal environments developed different strategies to cope with the periodical drastic change of environmental conditions. Hibernating mammals survive the winter season by reducing their activity and metabolism, and by centring their activities during the favourable season. Thus, the demography of these species depends upon both hibernating and active periods. In this study, we explored the apparent survival of Alpine marmots monitored between 2007 and 2018 in the North-Western Italian Alps. We fit Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models to quantify changes in the apparent survival and capture probability of marmots, after the hibernation phase and at the end of the summer. Apparent survival after winter almost reached 100\% and it was higher than post-summer survival. Moreover, while post-summer apparent survival remained almost stable over lifetime, with a slight increase with age, characterised however by wide confidence intervals, overwinter survival decreased with age, especially after 6 years of age. No temporal trends, nor changes between areas at different elevations, were found. We suggest that these results arise from a combination of climatic conditions, predation pressure and social dynamics, which is a pivotal feature of this species and cannot be ignored when considering population dynamics of Alpine marmots.},

The male rubbed and tapped on the female’s antennae with sexually dimorphic segments of his antennae, and on her elytra with brushes of setae on his hind tarsi. He forcefully grasped the female’s prothorax and at least occasionally perforated the female’s prothoracic membranes with his modified middle tibiae, and her relatively uniform, membranous vaginal lining with his strong aedeagal teeth. His aedeagal teeth snagged her vaginal lining, and his gonostyli usually pressed against a featureless external female intersegmental membrane. None of these male structures was used as a weapon or in threat displays. No female structure fitted tightly in a “lock-and-key” manner with any of the male structures, nor was any female structure capable of selectively impeding their use, thus ruling out some hypotheses explaining their species-specificity in males. Female resistance to males, including occasional violent “tantrum” displays, was energetic, persistent, and highly effective; the functional significance of this resistance is unclear. If females distinguish the stimuli produced by species-specific traits of male genitalia, as supposed by some hypotheses, they likely use higher-level analyses in the central nervous system rather than the locations of the particular sense organs that are stimulated.},

  abstract     = {Human-wildlife coexistence has increasingly been known for providing diverse ecological services to humans. However, the global repercussions of the Anthropocene epoch have changed the status and future of human-wildlife relationships. In this paper, we shed light on the significance of a positive attitude towards sharing space with animals in identifying and managing both conflict and ecological aspects of human-wildlife interactions in an agrarian landscape. We tried to understand how interactions between meso-carnivores like jungle cats () and humans influence their survival in dense human populations. We evaluate the abundance and habitat use by jungle cats seasonally and diet, as well as their interactions with farmers in West Bengal, India. The mean encounter rate of jungle cats was assessed and used as a proxy for their abundance. Using a combination of direct sign surveys, we found that the habitat preference and seasonal distribution of jungle cats were influenced by the change in seasons with respect to different habitats. Our results indicate that jungle cats were more associated with human settlements during the monsoon. Scat analysis revealed the dominance of rodents in the diets of jungle cats. This activity helps to control the rodent population from destroying crops. However, our interactions with farmers showed their negative attitude towards the species due to the instances of livestock (poultry birds) depredation. We suggest that, more interdisciplinary researches are required to address how affectively socioeconomic structures shape up positive human-wildlife interaction. Planning and implementation of conservation education programmes are also necessary to help people for understanding the economic and ecological benefits provided by jungle cats and other wide-ranging carnivores.},

Parents can protect their offspring against abiotic conditions that may damage their webs, or compromise their egg sacs, and against araneophagic spiders that prey on their eggs. However, the current knowledge of the parental care in the species is restricted to a population located in areas covered by plantations. This study investigates parental care efficiency in a new ecological context, a protected area of Brazilian savanna. We described the substrates in which built webs and the agents of egg mortality. We also performed a parent removal experiment to test the effect of parental care on the integrity of nursery webs, offspring survival, and the presence of egg predators. Spiders built webs at variable heights and many distinct substrates but were mainly associated with the bromeliad . We found two previously reported egg predators, and (Araneae Theridiidae), and a new one emerging from the egg sacs, the insect (Neuroptera Mantispidae). The presence of parents in the webs of prevented the webs from collapsing and effectively increased offspring survival. However, the occurrence of egg predators was not reduced by the presence of parents. Overall, parental care increased offspring survival in both populations, but variation in biotic and abiotic factors between areas influenced offspring mortality and the efficiency of parental behaviours. Our results emphasise the importance of investigating multiple populations in behavioural studies of parental care.},

The average home range was 9.47 ha (MCP 95\%) and 44.11 (Kernel 95\%) for bushmasters tracked for more than 6 months. The macrohabitats used were primarily composed of disturbed primary (partially logged) and secondary (originally cleared) forests, but also of rubber tree plantations with a dense understory vegetation. Activity centres were closer to the forest edge (~ 22 m) than the core of the small forest fragments. The snakes mainly occupied wooded microhabitats with complex vegetation structures, around 50\% under- and mid-story cover. Nocturnal ambush differed from diurnal resting microhabitats on the surface mainly by being significantly closer to mammal trails and a more open understory space. While mammal burrows and refuges under roots and rocks have been used, diurnal resting was primarily on the forest floor (75\%). Translocation from sites &gt; 20 km outside the study site has produced little evidence of negative effect, as all individuals grew impressively, continued an apparently normal life and established a home range similar to native bushmasters.},

  abstract     = {In mixed-species groups (MSGs), individuals from different species may locate and communicate about the presence of predators and prey quickly and accurately but may compete for food and favourable positions in the flock. Thus, foraging behaviour is likely to change when individuals participate in MSGs compared with single-species groups (SSGs). In a highly seasonal tropical environment, the foraging behaviour of omnivorous birds may also vary with fluctuations in food availability, weather, and breeding conditions. Here, we observed the foraging behaviour (food item consumed and foraging substrate) of an insectivorous-granivorous songbird, the Coal-crested finch (), in a savanna in central Brazil, while simultaneously sampling the grass seed production. Birds were more likely to consume grass seeds and forage on lower vertical strata (i.e., ground or herbaceous layers) in MSGs than in other social contexts (SSGs, pair or alone), suggesting they are facing interference competition from other species in MSGs or obtaining antipredator benefits in MSGs that enable them to explore preferred food resources in microhabitats more exposed to predators. As expected, Coal-crested finches were more likely to feed on grass seeds and forage on lower vertical strata when grass seed production is abundant, suggesting that they switch their diet according to the availability of their main food items: grass seeds and invertebrates. Weather and breeding seasonalities had small effects on foraging behaviour. Our results show that MSGs may have a major role in the foraging behaviour of omnivorous birds even considering the seasonal mismatching of their main food items.},

The evolutionary forces that shape the variation in the gross morphology of these gametic cells are still not completely understood. Previous studies suggest that the intra-individual variation in sperm size reduces as a result of post-copulatory sexual selection. To our knowledge, for the first time, we provide evidence here that pre-copulatory sexual selection can also play a role. By studying the Neotropical paper wasp, a monandrous species, we found reduced variation in sperm length in males bearing sexual ornamentation preferred by females. Besides, the female spermatheca contains a less variable sperm compared to that in the male seminal vesicles. Thus, the scope of selection, acting on this sperm trait, seems broader than previously acknowledged.},

The work was carried out at Quebrada de La Puerta in the province of San Juan and data recorded for the species included microhabitat use and availability according to established categories. To assess microhabitat selection, we applied a design of usage vs availability and calculated the Manly index to obtain a function of resource selection. The species utilised the rock microhabitat in greater proportion with respect to its availability, and in lesser measure utilised shrub and bare soil, whereas it rejected the use of cactus and dead leaves substrate. The Manly index showed that the selection of rock substrate was significant with respect to the other microhabitats. We conclude that this population of has clearly saxicolous habits, though it is necessary to be aware of other aspects of its natural history to truly understand how its microhabitat selection relates to feeding or reproduction in hostile environments like the Puna. In this way we contribute to the scarce existing knowledge of its biology and we provide an information basis for the creation of future priority areas for conservation and for habitat management plans in Puna environments.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, population fluctuations of microtine rodents have frequently faded out in parts of northern Europe, possibly because of climate change. Weather events may affect the rodents directly, but also indirectly, by acting on factors that generate population fluctuations. However, few studies have addressed the latter aspect. A species well suited for such a study is the bank vole (), which usually increases in number after a year with high seed production of bilberry (). We analysed two snap-trapping time series of bank vole from Central Norway. When controlling for the impact of seed production of bilberry and Norway spruce (), the number of bank voles trapped in the low-altitude area was negatively related to a summer temperature index of the two previous years, possibly because of the impact of temperature on the nutritional status of food plants. In the area situated at the highest altitude, there was a negative relationship with the winter NAO-index and a positive relationship with a snow depth index. Wet and mild winters are assumed to give unfavourable snow conditions, with alternating thawing and freezing, sometimes also creating an ice-layer at ground level, whereas a sufficient thick snow cover protects the rodents in periods with critical low temperatures. We conclude that an understanding of the ultimate cause of population fluctuations is needed to reveal the disturbing effects of weather events or other factors.},

  abstract     = {Compared to other primate taxa, hand preference in strepsirrhines has been poorly investigated and the available studies have often produced conflicting results. Thanks to their remarkable plasticity in foraging and postural habits, ring-tailed lemurs ( represent a key model species to examine manual lateralisation. We video-recorded 23 individuals hosted at four Italian zoological gardens during three food-related trials requiring different kinds of manual actions. We found a remarkable hand preference at individual level for grasping static food presented in a bowl, both when only one kind of food was offered (“food limited-choice” task) and when a mix of less and more palatable food items were available (“food large-choice” task). Conversely, most individuals did not show any hand preference for catching highly palatable food in motion (“catching” task). Moreover, the subjects not showing any hand preference engaged more frequently in bimanual actions (concurrent and symmetric use of both hands in catching food) than the subjects displaying a manual asymmetry. No detrimental effect on the task performance was recorded, indicating a high level of hand selection plasticity in . In conclusion, our findings show that ring-tailed lemurs can take advantage from a flexible manual strategy and highlight how ecological factors must be carefully evaluated when assessing hand preference in extant strepsirrhines.},

  abstract     = {Wintering site selection is a major decision in a bird’s annual life cycle since conditions experienced by individuals within a wintering site can influence individual fitness and ultimately population dynamics. If individuals show strong fidelity to specific sites, annual environmental effects can be reinforced. In this study we analyse winter resightings of ringed Dalmatian pelicans, collected during a 35-year-long ringing survey, to identify winter movement patterns of Dalmatian pelicans, assess the level of site fidelity both within and among consecutive wintering events and examine environmental factors that may contribute to an individual’s decision to move towards a specific site during the winter period. Our results showed that the decision of Dalmatian pelicans to move towards a specific site was mainly driven by the site’s size and temperature conditions. Larger wetlands can provide birds with higher resource abundance and offer more opportunities to exploit optimal roosting and feeding habitats, whereas wetlands that do not freeze during the winter are a definite requirement. Wintering movements were more likely to occur at short distances from a bird’s natal colony, whereas it was uncommon for birds born in wetlands located in the Adriatic and Ionian coast to move eastwards during the winter, suggesting a level of spatial substructure. Furthermore, we showed that the species exhibits very strong within-year and among-year wintering site fidelity, with birds moving less during the winter, whereas juvenile birds travel greater distances than the rest of the age classes examined. Our conclusions could guide an effective approach to site-based conservation management at key wintering sites.},

Therefore, terrestrial salamanders regulate their surface activity, including foraging, to minimize evaporative water loss. The influence of local micro-climatic factors on the foraging success of European forest dwelling salamanders has rarely been analysed in detail. We examined the role of local climatic conditions on the foraging success, measured by the total number of prey items, of two syntopic forest-dwelling salamanders: Strinati’s cave salamander, (family Plethodontidae), and Northern spectacled salamander, (family Salamandridae). We evaluated the effects of rainfall, temperature and body size on the foraging success of these two species, in eight sampling sites in the Northern Apennines of Italy, for a total of 11 salamander populations. Our findings show that different climatic variables affected the two species differently. foraged more intensively during periods of prolonged rainfall with higher temperatures. On the contrary, foraging success was negatively influenced by rising temperature, while rainfall seemed to have no significant effect. Interestingly, body size increased success in but not in . Overall, our findings show that, when foraging in the same environment, these two species are conditioned by different climatic factors possibly due to their differences in overall body size and their ability to resist dehydration.},

  abstract     = {In many species, dispersal from the natal group is crucial for reproduction. However, venturing into a new territory and integrating into a novel social environment is associated with risks and costs. In cooperatively breeding species, moreover, an individual’s prospects of future reproduction upon dispersal or upon remaining in the natal group might crucially depend on other group members’ concurrent decisions to disperse or to stay. We developed a methodology for evaluating how the actual decision of a potential disperser to join or not to join a dispersing individual or coalition affects its fitness in comparison with the fitness consequences it would have had if it had taken the reverse decision – to disperse instead of staying, or to stay instead of dispersing. We then examined 64 dispersal events by unisex coalitions of Arabian babblers who could not breed in their group of origin, and aimed to acquire breeding opportunities by joining another group. For each such dispersal event, we compared the fitness consequences for the members of the dispersing coalition as well as for their same-sex siblings who stayed, to the counterfactual consequences of taking the reverse decision for each of them in turn. Fitness consequences were assessed based on breeding success in the ensuing year as the leading criterion, and on social rank as a secondary criterion. We found that 69\% of the dispersers and 38\% of the individuals who stayed made fitness-enhancing decisions relative to the alternative they faced, and for an additional 10\% of dispersers and 21\% of those who stayed, their choice yielded fitness consequences on par with those of the alternative choice. These findings suggest that despite the risky and uncertain circumstances in which dispersal decisions are taken, most individuals make informed, fitness-enhancing dispersal choices, taking into account the concurrent choices of their groupmates.},

  abstract     = {Lizards are commonly preyed by a great variety of predators, including vertebrates and invertebrates. Therefore, it is expected that lizards have developed a wide range of antipredator traits, increasing their chances of successful survival during agonistic events. Defence against predation involves two levels of behavioural strategies, commonly named primary and secondary defence traits. Primary defences relate to predator detection or interest and include as responses immobility, mimicry, aposematism, and cryptic colouration. Secondary defences occur after predator detection and attack, including traits that aim to prevent or interrupt predators. These defences encompass traits such as frightening (e.g., scratching or biting the predator), tail lashing, flouncing vigorously the body, cloacal discharge, agony vocalisations, and tail autotomy. In this review, we gathered information from 206 scientific publications, including peer-reviewed journals, short communications, scientific notes, and books. This compilation resulted in 22 defence traits, 23\% passive and 77\% active defences. Lizard species deal with a wide diversity of predators, but the number of field records, experiments, and antipredator studies remain scarce. We reviewed the defence traits presented by Neotropical lizards, using a phylogenetic approach in order to track evolutionary process behind these traits. Thanatosis, crypsis, and tail autotomy are symplesiomorphic for lizards, whereas venom and emetic substances are autapomorphic, and aposematism seems to be rare. We also present a novel case of defence trait where the dark colour helps lizards to be camouflaged in the burned vegetation. Our character mapping provides valuable information about the evolution of defensive traits in Neotropical lizards, combining natural history and phylogenetics. Trivial observations about any animal behaviour, including those provided by social networks and citizen science pages, might be important, and we strongly recommend that ethological observations describe the event in all possible details.},

  abstract     = {Early detection of predators is fundamental for the survival of the prey. Predator detection can occur by perception of the chemical substances released by predators or injured conspecifics, granting prey the opportunity to avoid the attack. However, overreacting to cues can generate false alarm reactions that result in fruitless energetic costs. Given that chemical cues in natural habitats rarely occur singly, individuals can benefit from obtaining information from multiple sources, such as the combined chemical cues from predators and conspecifics. We experimentally tested the movement reaction of cane toad () tadpoles when in contact with isolated chemical cues from a conspecific, a predator (dragonfly larvae), and the combination of these two substances. We quantified duration of swimming activity before and after the exposure to the chemical cues and compared it to a control group. A significant reduction in swimming activity was only observed when the tadpoles were exposed to the combination of both cue types. Our results suggest that the tadpoles can recognise the chemical cues from conspecifics and predators, but a behavioural response is only elicited when both stimuli are detected simultaneously. We suggest that behavioural change in response to predation threat in is a compromise between early detection of predators and avoidance of unnecessary energetic expenditures.},

  abstract     = {The encounter with relatives at the time of mating can be reduced if one or both sexes breed away from the natal site, and it is often assumed that this occurs to a lesser extent on islands where only short dispersal is possible. However, endemic insular populations may have evolved fine-tuned dispersal patterns enabling effective avoidance of inbreeding even in a small habitat, and the influence of spatial constraint should be more apparent for non-endemic than endemic populations. Recently established island populations of originally migratory birds can provide insights into the direct effect of habitat area on inbreeding risk. We studied spatial distribution of kin and inbreeding in a population of the bull-headed shrike, that became established on small oceanic islands separated from the mainland by &gt; 360 km, Minami-daito and Kita-daito Islands, early in the 1970s. Sex-specific spatial genetic structure that could reduce inbreeding risk was absent within the focal Minami-daito Island. This result remained unchanged after the neighbouring Kita-daito Island was incorporated into the analysis. Average relatedness of breeding pairs was not different from that expected under random mating, and F was no greater than zero. The estimates of extra-pair paternity frequency were not high (4.5–16\% of offspring, depending on the estimation method) compared to the mainland. Inbreeding coefficient of offspring was variable among nests, indicating some occurrence of inbreeding. We found no clear evidence of recent population bottleneck, suggesting that the purging of deleterious recessive alleles did not occur upon colonisation. These results suggest the absence of obvious inbreeding avoidance despite the potentially negative effects of inbreeding. Future studies should quantify inbreeding depression and also formally rule out the possibility that inbreeding is not avoided as an adaptive strategy as has been suggested for endemic island species.• Inbreeding risk is assumed to be high in small isolated habitats due to limited dispersal distance.• We studied spatial kin clustering and inbreeding in a non-endemic island bird population.• Evidence suggests that inbreeding is not avoided via differential dispersal distance between sexes.},

Black vultures (), because of their less developed olfactory apparatus, have been compared with the turkey vulture as a phylogenetically related species lacking the sense of smell. However, little evidence from behavioural studies supports the lack of olfaction of black vultures. We conducted a field experiment where we presented urban black vultures a binary choice of decaying fish and sand (serving as control) inside plastic bags. Birds chose the fish bait in 81\% of the times they approached the plastic bags. The probability of reaction decreased significantly with the distance between the birds and the fish bait, being virtually null at 40–50 m away. Furthermore, birds clearly reacted more when the fish presented higher decaying time (7 compared to 2 days). These results show that olfaction is not only used by black vultures but is probably the most relevant sense when they search for food hidden in plastic bags and in piles of unsorted waste, which is the most common foraging environment for this species in urban areas where they are very abundant.},

The epigynum of (Walckenaer 1841) is unusual in having a prominent ventral process covered on its anterior side and around its base with long, thick setae.

Females lacking setae produced mating plugs immediately after copulation less often than unmanipulated females. However, 24 hr later the mating plugs had disappeared in many females of the treatment group. Setae removal did not affect the amount of sperm stored in the female spermatheca, or the frequency of female attacks. The rate of male genital inflations correlated positively, but mating duration was negatively correlated with sperm stored in female’s spermathecae. Females attempted to attack small males more often than large males.

Particularly, the intensity model that considers a real male confrontation has not been experimentally tested in laboratory rats. Furthermore, no study has explored the active role of the female (that occurs in natural conditions) in regulating the timing of copulation on the effects of competition on sexual behaviour and seminal parameters. Thus, the goal of this study was to analyse the copulatory behaviour and seminal parameters under male–male competition and female pacing. In order to control for possible variations due to the sexual behaviour phenotype, all experiments were done in male rats with short ejaculation latencies (rapid ejaculators). The results show that competition decreased by half the ejaculation latency and increased sperm quantity, but substantially decreased sperm motility. On the contrary, when competition is tested under conditions where the female regulates the timing of copulation (paced mating), the ejaculation latency increased to double, the sperm count did not change, and the sperm motility significantly decreased. The variations in the parameters of the ejaculate depend on the context, i.e., the confrontation with a competitor, and the active participation of the female during copulation. Probably, when there is more than one male during mating, the female – through cryptic choice – promotes mechanisms that interfere temporally with sperm motility.},

The defensive displays of 30 males to different stimuli simulating a predator were analysed. We observed five types of strategies which were used by these animals separately or concomitantly: puffing up the body (100\%), push movement (83.3\%), distress call (33.3\%), hiding (23.3\%), cloacal discharge (16.6\%) and spine aggression (6.6\%). The analysis of intra and interindividual coefficient of variation showed that there was no acoustic variation in the distress call of this species. Understanding the defensive mechanisms of a species is important to identify the antipredatory strategies used by animals, especially in face of emerging threats, and to help to produce proposals for the conservation of neotropical species.Studies on the defensive behaviour of anurans have been presented information that can help in the construction of the natural history of the species in this group. The results show that males of exhibited five types of defensive behaviours, of which 4 were of visual origin: puffing up the body, push, hiding, cloacal discharge, and spinal aggression; and one type of acoustic behaviour: distress call. The behaviours were observed through three types of external stimuli, in which during the data analysis it was evident that there is no male preference for a specific type of stimulus. Through the interindividual and interindividual coefficient of variation that there are no significant variations in the distress call, being an unprecedented result for works that involve the distress call.},

  abstract     = {The concept of mating systems refers to all the strategies through which animals interact in the context of breeding. Animal social interactions, and consequently their mating strategies, are strongly influenced by landscape configuration, including anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. Despite this holding the potential to impact both genetic viability and animal behaviour, an updated and comprehensive review on its effects on mating systems is lacking, as an exhaustive understanding of the underlying processes. Thus, we reviewed the literature concerning the influence of habitat fragmentation on mating systems of tetrapods and on processes associated with breeding. We underlined the unfortunate biases present in literature (e.g., most studies on birds and mammals, none on amphibians) and showed the changes possibly led by living in discontinuous habitats for each class of terrestrial vertebrates (i.e., mammals, birds, and reptiles). In fragmented patches of habitats, resource distribution gets altered; consequently, space occupancy may change and affect how animals interact, leading to variable potential for monogamous/polygamous mating systems compared to continuous populations. We discussed how dispersal and indirectly the population sex ratio can be altered in such populations, and further considered changes in social behaviour, specifically in interactions between kin individuals with increasing relatedness in smaller and isolated patches. More typical of bird populations are changes in mating-related phenomena such as pairing success, extra-pair paternity (EPP) rate, and nest parasitism, together with shifts from mating strategies (e.g., lekking behaviour). Although no univocal response to habitat parcelling was found, several complex and population-specific trends emerge in the literature. We suggest a multidisciplinary approach to implement research in this direction, especially to evaluate the adaptive nature of such responses. Ultimately, we underline the urgent need of taking into consideration behavioural responses in wildlife management interventions, particularly when dealing with species that may lack plasticity to adapt to landscape degradation.},

This study sought to evaluate such effects on juvenile , exposed to two organophosphate (OP) pesticides under laboratory conditions. Treatments involved a control, solvent control (xylene), malathion and diazinon commercial insecticides, with the OPs administered in three logarithmically increasing concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 µg/L. A pre-established ethogram was used to document behavioural acts for treatments; foraging, eating, grooming, locomotion, quiescence (inactive), prolonged agonism, non-agonistic contact and moulting. Each treatment cohort was continuously recorded over a 72 hr period. The time durations for each act were determined from the video footage (n = 2,304 hr) and used to determine time spent on each behavioural act, over a 24 hr time period. Time spent by OP-exposed crabs on each act differed significantly from those of the controls. Diazinon-exposed crabs spent most of their daily time in heightened agonistic behaviour (43.4–71.6\%). Malathion-exposed crabs spent the majority of their time being inactive (46.7–79.0\%) and xylene-exposed crabs exhibited similar behavioural alterations of heightened aggression (53.6\%) and inactivity (39.3\%). OP-induced changes in essential behaviours of juvenile can increase vulnerability, hamper survival and increase risk to predators via impaired locomotion, induced inactivity and limited energy availability, through reduced food intake. These findings provide a better understanding of OP-induced behavioural alterations in juvenile and the long-term consequences for essential processes like growth, reproduction and survival.},

We also studied whether the foraging behavior of Cock-tailed tyrant is influenced by the sex and age of the individual. Our results indicated the birds change their behavior between the dry and wet seasons. Aerial hawking was predominantly used by Cock-tailed tyrant and Streamer-tailed tyrant during both seasons, but by White-rumped monjita only during the wet season. Perch-to-ground was the predominant hunting strategy for Gray monjita during both seasons and for White-rumped monjita during the dry season.

  abstract     = {Parental care increases offspring survival, but may be costly for parents, reducing future survival and reproduction. Offspring attendance may increase predation risk, or reduce food intake, mating opportunities, and reproductive rate of parents. Anurans exhibit a great diversity of parental care behaviours and offer an opportunity to investigate the costs and benefits of parenting. Here, we measured the body condition of females of the Neotropical frog during tadpole attendance. By comparing attending and non-attending females, we tested the hypothesis that females providing care will have reduced body condition and food ingestion. Although fat body mass did not differ, attending females had significantly lower body mass, ovary mass, and stomach volume after 6 days of care. Overall, attending females may lose up to 40\% of body mass due to parental care, while non-attending females gain mass. Although 27\% of attending females had empty stomachs, prey diversity was higher. Additionally, the higher proportion of aquatic hemipterans and spiders preyed on by attending females may be explained by different microhabitat use and active protection of offspring. Our results indicate that parental care has the potential to affect future reproduction of females via reduction in body condition and food intake. Studies have shown the benefits related to offspring survival in anurans, but few addressed the costs to parents. By evaluating the potential costs of parenting in a frog species with aquatic tadpoles for the first time, our study contributes to fill this gap. Studies investigating the costs and benefits of parental care in different lineages of frogs will improve our knowledge on the evolution of parenting in this highly diverse group.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary significance of color expression in animals is often framed within either an interspecific (e.g., antipredator display) or intraspecific (e.g., mate choice) context. In part, this dichotomy stems from assumptions that the expression of conspicuous sexually selected traits likely hinders survival in the wild. Here we address the potential for natural and sexual selection to reinforce expression of a conspicuous tail bar pattern in zebra-tailed lizards (). In , display of this tail bar pattern has historically been considered an interspecific signal to deter predator pursuit. However, a putative honest link between the tail bar pattern and escape likelihood (e.g., sprint speed) is unknown. Further, studies on related taxa also support the potential for this trait to be informative as a signal of individual quality during mating interactions as well. We assessed variation in the morphology of male and female , and then evaluated how variation in morphology (emphasizing the tail bar pattern) contributed to variation in performance (sprint capacity) and, for males, variation in female preference. Males were larger than females, but size was unrelated to variation in tail bar number. Males sprinted faster than females overall, but tail bar number only mattered for males: specifically, males with more tail bars sprinted faster. Females also preferred males with more tail bars. Overall, our findings suggest that natural (mediated via an honest link between bar number and sprint speed) and sexual (mediated via a preference for males with more tail bars) selection may mutually reinforce expression of a color signal. Thus, the potential adaptive benefits of a color signal may span intra- and interspecific contexts. For males at least, the tail bar pattern is useful for both deterring the pursuit of predators as well as attracting the attention of potential mates.},

  abstract     = {Reproductive castes are a defining characteristic of eusocial insects. The developmental timing of reproductive caste differentiation is important to shaping individual opportunities for reproductive flexibility. Because hard-part body size (e.g., wing length) is fixed for insects upon adult emergence, morphology can be used to assess pre-adult effects on caste status. Differences in body size amongst adult colony mates may affect social competition for resources and reproductive status in caste-monomorphic species. Our goal was to use body size correlations with female behavior and physiology to test among three hypotheses for pre-emergent effects on female caste within colonies of paper wasps: (1) no size overlap between females with developed and undeveloped ovaries would indicate caste is likely determined during larval development; (2) size bias for reproductives with exceptions: caste could be biased during development, but post-emergence factors may play a role; (3) no size patterns: no morphological evidence for pre-adult caste biases. Within colonies, we found a significant difference in body size (wing length) between females with developed vs undeveloped ovaries: larger females were more likely to have developed ovaries. Additionally, larger females were more aggressive towards nestmates. However, there was considerable variation in body size effects on both ovary development and behavioral dominance: even some of the smallest-bodied females had developed ovaries and were socially aggressive. These data suggest factors during pre-adult development lead to morphological (size) differences, and that body size affects the outcome of adult interactions with implications for reproductive caste.},

In dispersed habitat, the density of seed bugs is always low ( 67\%). In both habitats, mating males are in better condition (= mass – mass expected from length) than non-mating males. In clustered habitats, aggression between males occurs frequently and determines residency in areas of high ragwort abundance to which females are especially attracted for mating and oviposition. A mark-recapture study revealed that males move about more in dispersed than clustered habitats, possibly searching for mates. Variance in male mating efficiency (copulations/sightings) matches random expectations in dispersed habitats but is significantly higher than that in clustered habitats, suggesting greater opportunity for sexual selection. A multivariate analysis of selection intensity using mark-recapture data revealed that longer wings and shorter bodies are favored in dispersed habitat, suggesting selection on ability to search for mates. In clustered habitat, selection favors a longer body, antennae, and legs. This finding suggests selection favoring dominance in aggressive interactions, as legs and antennae are used to grapple with opponents and to seize females during aggressive courtship.},

A person approached juncos simultaneously playing the sounds of object types that normally move at different relative velocities: faster (bicycles), intermediate (skateboards and scooters), or slower (people walking). Juncos responded at significantly greater distances and moved further in relation to what sound cues would normally imply about the velocity of approach. Absolute stimulus volume was not a significant predictor of response across object type. The responses occurred without the presence of visual cues, suggesting that an auditory cue alone and without visual confirmation can produce an appropriate response. Overall, this shows that this population of urban juncos has the ability to respond appropriately to novel anthropogenic sound cues. The question remains as to how universal such abilities are across species, different urban situations, and in natural habitats.},

  abstract     = {The wild boar population has increased rapidly during the last 2 decades in Southern and Central Sweden. This rise in population size has caused severe damages to agricultural fields through their foraging behavior. Given the hierarchical nature of habitat and resource selection, wildlife management needs to understand the selection on both levels to better understand the ecology of nuisance species and mitigate the damages they infer. Thus, there is an urgent need for more knowledge on the factors that influence habitat selection as a tool in the evidence-based management of wild boar to reduce the losses they cause in the agricultural sector. This study aims to evaluate a common management action (feeding stations) influencing wild boar selection of (1) habitats and (2) resources i.e., crop types, in South-Central Sweden during summer. Eleven wild boars were fitted with GPS/GSM-collars to record movement among different habitats and crops. Wild boar shows a high preference for clear-cuts, agricultural fields, and deciduous forests. The animals showed a high preference for crop fields with oat, spring wheat, and mixed crops. A binary logistic model revealed both a positive and negative significant influence of distance to feeding stations on the selection of different habitats and crop fields. In general, feeding stations influenced the selection of different habitats and crops negatively i.e., the closer a habitat or crop field is to a feeding station, the higher the likelihood of its selection. The study recommends adjustments to wild boar management and cropping systems to reduce damages on highly selected crop fields.},

  abstract     = {Behavior is often phylogenetically informative and detailed descriptions of behavior have been used to support taxonomic relationships in several groups, such as birds, lizards, and arthropods. Web building behavior has provided informative traits to several spider families, but observations are lacking for other families, such as wall spiders Oecobiidae. Recent phylogenetic hypotheses based on molecular traits placed oecobiids either close to cribellate orb weavers (Uloboridae) or to long-spinneret spiders (Hersiliidae). Here, we describe for first time the web construction behavior and details of the web design in the oecobiid Simon 1893 (Oecobiidae). We compare them with uloborid and araneoid orb weavers. If Oecobiidae and Uloboridae are closely related, we expect that share some web construction behaviors with these orb weavers. Video recordings and analyses of web structures suggest the sequence of web construction (radii, then sticky spiral construction) and the arrangement of cribellate threads are possible homologies between Oecobiidae and orb weavers, supporting a close relationship of Oecobiidae with Uloboridae.},

  abstract     = {Self-grooming is the most commonly observed behavior and serves numerous functions, with the removal of ectoparasites likely the most important. According to a predominant conception, grooming is regulated by two mechanisms: a programmed-grooming model and a stimulus-driven model. The programmed-grooming model predicts, first, that smaller body-size females must groom more frequently compared to larger males (body-size principle); second, the smaller young groom significantly more often than adults (developmental grooming); and third, rutting males, busy with social vigilance, groom significantly less often than females (vigilance principle). The impact of molting was also tested on the grooming rate as an additional hypothesis that is not a part of the programmed-grooming model. According to investigations of a wide variety of ungulates in captive and natural conditions, the predictions of the programmed-grooming mechanism were found to be accurate for most sexually dimorphic ungulates. Here, I tested the principles of the programmed-grooming model in free living, wild goitered gazelles (), which are parasitized by both keds and ticks. My study found the following: (a) the body-size principle was not supported by my data, especially during the gazelles’ molting and rutting periods; (b) the developmental grooming model did not relate to the grooming behavior of goitered gazelle fawns; (c) the vigilance principle was not applicable to male goitered gazelles; and (d) spring molting increased the grooming rate drastically for both males and females and likely had the greatest effect over any other factor, even though keds also contributed to the grooming rate at this time. Though previous studies of tick parasitism on many ungulate species demonstrated that oral grooming was more consistent with programmed-grooming than the stimulus-driven grooming model, my study of ked parasitism of goitered gazelles showed the opposite, suggesting that grooming driven mechanisms were parasite-host dependent. However, grooming behavior is likely a multifaceted phenomenon depending not only on body size, vigilance rate or even from ectoparasite burden, but also on numerous other factors.},

  abstract     = {Some porcellanid crabs (Decapoda Anomura) are known to escape predator crabs through a hair-trigger autotomy response when they are held by the cheliped only. The porcellanid crab autotomizes chelipeds, and the post-autotomy cheliped movement functions like a lizard tail, which may increase predator distraction time, affording the prey more time to escape. However, the predatory encounters between prey and the relevant predators have not been observed to understand the benefits of autotomy in . The present study conducted 140 predation trials to evaluate the effectiveness of cheliped autotomy by in avoiding predation from its potential predator crab that commonly co-occurs with under cobble and boulders in intertidal zones. The predator attacked the prey in many trials (84\%) and successfully grasped the prey in most attack cases (94\%). The prey held by the body was able to escape the predator in a few cases (7\%). When the prey was held by the cheliped only, the prey autotomized the cheliped and was able to escape the predator in many cases (75 and 83\%, respectively), while the predator was eating the autotomized cheliped. The predator appeared to take a long time to handle the autotomized cheliped with its claws. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated that exhibited high incidences of cheliped autotomy when it was held by the cheliped only, enabling it to escape the predator crab at high probabilities. Furthermore, post-autotomy movements may improve the efficacy of the antipredator defence mechanism of autotomized chelipeds in .},

  abstract     = {We studied the hermit crab–shell interaction network of rocky shores in South Brazil using both community and populational (demographic groups) approaches which evaluated both inter and intraspecific perspectives. The community was composed of six hermit crab species and 33 gastropod shell species. We found a recurrent pattern in which the network structure was characterized by a modular and specialized pattern. The specialization at the species level varies in the community species and for ontogenetic groups. The configuration of the modules changed when switching from community to populational approaches, consisting of three and four modules, respectively. Resource partitioning must be a very important feature in these systems due to both the specific and demographic needs of each group. Our results reveal a pattern in which these types of interactions are modular and specialized, with those patterns being uncommon for non-mutualistic interactions in hermit crab-gastropod networks. The analyses showed difference in the network metrics when considering intra and interspecific perspectives. The mandatory nature of these interactions and the resource dynamics of the gastropod shells when occupied by hermit crabs may partially explain the patterns found for these unique interactions.},

  abstract     = {The operational sex ratio (OSR), the ratio of sexually active males to sexually receptive females, is one of the main measures used to predict the intensity and direction of mating competition, influencing the opportunity for sexual selection. Here, we conducted the first experimental study to investigate how OSR and male age impacts the intensity of mating competition in reindeer (), under semi-natural conditions during the rut. We manipulated OSR on two levels in two enclosures, a female biased treatment (3♂:6♀ = OSR 0.5) and a sex balanced treatment (3♂:3♀ = OSR 1), over 2 years with males from two age groups, and with females of various ages. We found some support for prevailing OSR theory, notably with female intrasexual competition occurring at lower frequencies in OSR 1 than OSR 0.5, and male intrasexual competition occurring at higher frequencies in the older male age group. Courtship behaviour was found to occur at higher frequencies in OSR 1 than OSR 0.5; however, there was no effect of male age. To successfully pass on genes to the next generation, one needs access to mates and winning a competitive bout is not always indicative of successfully accomplishing gene flow. Studies on OSR have the potential to help us understand the drivers behind sexual competition and how best to predict breeding outcomes during a rut.},

  abstract     = {In animal mating systems, individuals obtain fitness benefits by selecting a mate that increases their chance of reproductive success. Among amphibians, it is generally considered that females select males, primarily based on advertisement calls that signal their size, quality or compatibility. Yet, it is becoming increasingly apparent that amphibians exhibit a wide range of mating systems, including those where assortative mating can occur. Herein, we investigated mate selection in the sandpaper frog, ; an Australian anuran that breeds explosively during discrete periods of rainfall over an extended breeding period. We compared the size and condition of amplecting pairs relative to other potential suitors within the available population of reproductively active adults over 3 consecutive breeding years. We found no relationship between the SVL of amplecting pairs and no effect of SVL on amplecting status of males within pools. Instead, the condition of amplecting pairs was positively correlated, leading to positive assortative mating. While there was a general decline in condition of adult males and females across each season, changes in the temporal availability of better conditioned mates does not account for the assortative mating were found. Males found in amplexus were also generally of poorer condition, which may occur as individuals investing more heavily into higher-signalling effort are more successful in finding a mate but at the expense of maintaining current condition. We propose that both findings could be evidence of active mate choice in an explosive breeding species. Our findings highlight the need to consider mate condition alongside size to detect the presence of assortative mating or non-random mating among explosive breeding amphibians.},
