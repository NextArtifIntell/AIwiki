  abstract     = {Parametric system identification, which is the process of uncovering the inherent dynamics of a system based on the model built with the observed inputs and outputs data, has been intensively studied in the past few decades. Recent years have seen a surge in the use of neural networks (NNs) in system identification, owing to their high approximation capability, less reliance on prior knowledge, and the growth of computational power. However, there is a lack of review on neural network modelling in the paradigm of parametric system identification, particularly in the time domain. This article discussed the connection in principle between conventional parametric models and three types of NNs including Feedforward Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Encoder-Decoder. Then it reviewed the advantages and limitations of related research in addressing two major challenges of parametric system identification, including the model interpretability and modelling with nonstationary realisations. Finally, new challenges and future trends in neural network-based parametric system identification are presented in this article.},

  abstract     = {With the generalisation of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), picture fuzzy sets (PFSs) have been developed based on membership, neutral membership, and non-membership degrees. Compared with IFSs, PFSs can more accurately represent uncertainty in real-world decision-making problems. Recently, the research on decision-making theories and methods under picture fuzzy environments has been rapidly developing. Therefore, this manuscript presents a systematic review of picture fuzzy decision-making theories and methods, including the context in which this field was developed, the current status and advancements of this field, and the main research results obtained with the picture fuzzy information. First, this review introduces the development process of PFSs and the current status of corresponding theories. Next, the basic theories based on PFSs, including operations rules, measures, and aggregation operators are introduced. Afterward, this review summarises the current research on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), and large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) methods with picture fuzzy information. Finally, future research directions of picture fuzzy decision-making theories and methodologies are discussed.},

  abstract     = {While applying control signals to every node is typically considered in multiagent networks to mitigate the adverse effects of misbehaving nodes, this control strategy may not always be possible due to physical constraints and/or economical limitations. Motivated by this standpoint, we have recently focused on how to control misbehaving multiagent networks through sending control signals to a subset of nodes (i.e. driver nodes) for suppressing the adverse effects of misbehaving nodes in the overall multiagent network, where the driver nodes only use their own state information to generate their control signals. To address the open problem where the driver nodes cannot obtain their own state information, the main contribution of this paper is that we now take into account that these nodes need to generate their control signals using the state information received from other subset of nodes (i.e. observer nodes). We characterise which nodes in the network behave as desired based on the selection of driver nodes and observer nodes in control of misbehaving multiagent networks. In addition, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as the importance of the selection of driver and observer nodes for maximising the number of nodes that exhibit the desired responses.},

First, a novel functional observer including parameters and parameter rates is proposed, and the observer gains can be directly designed. Different from the previous studies, a memory ISMC scheme with a time-varying delay through the functional observer is used for the first time in LPV systems to improve the performance. Moreover, to fully adopt the model characteristics of LPV systems and the functional observer, an integral PD surface function that contains PD input matrices and a memory parameter is established simultaneously. And then, an adaptive compensator is deduced for eliminating the influence of unknown nonlinear functions, so that the designed memory ISMC can make closed-loop LPV systems stable within a preset finite time. Furthermore, stability criteria with less conservatism for the LPV systems are proposed by memory Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional with measurable parameters. These criteria can guarantee LPV systems are finite-time boundedness with H ∞ performance (FTB- H ∞ ) on the sliding stage, arriving stage and entire finite-time region. Finally, a riderless bicycle is given to display the validity and superiority of the developed approach.},

For the multi-channel systems under the energy constraint, the attack policy is designed to determine the optimal attack locations to degrade the estimation performance of the system to the most extent. Then, it is proved that achieving the optimal attack policy is equivalent to solving a limited optimisation problem and a 0–1 programming problem, respectively.

Regarding the decoupling, an input/output (I/O) coupling matrix function is proposed to derive two decouplers (U-decoupler/functional inversion and D-decoupler/static matrix inversion). A general existing theorem is proved for model-free sliding mode control (MFSMC) to lay the foundation for the NDCI, which takes the Lyapunov differential inequality for its derivative rather than the semi-define Lyapunov derivative. Accordingly, a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) model-free decoupling U-control (MFDUC) platform is established to integrate the functionalities into a double closed-loop system framework. To validate the functionalities and configurations, this study presents transparent and comparative simulated bench tests, which also could be treated as user guidance for further study and ad hoc applications.},

The key feature of the multiplex networks is that it allows leader agent(s) to spatially alter the size and orientation of the resulting formation without requiring global information exchange ability. In addition, the key feature of the finite-time approach is to ensure that the overall multiagent system establishes a particular formation determined by the leader agent(s) at user-defined times. System-theoretical analysis of the proposed architecture is given using the time transformation approach along with Lyapunov stability theory, and an illustrative numerical example is also included to demonstrate the ability of the proposed architecture in addressing the sequential formation control problem.},

Based on a novel dynamic sampling rule, a sampling-point-based partition-dependent discontinuous Lyapunov functions control approach are developed to make the considered closed-loop switched systems be globally asymptotically stable. Compared with the existing results, the proposed control method permits frequent switching in a sampling interval for subsystems. But the frequent information transmission to the matched controllers and the negative effect of long asynchronous running on system performance can be nicely handled in this paper. Moreover, the partitioned Lyapunov functions are allowed to increase in some segments of the synchronous operating intervals. Tighter synchronous duration and switching number which are determined by more than affine functions make the switching signal more flexible. Finally, simulation analyses of two examples show the advantages of the developed control strategy.},

The main goals of paper are to drive the considered output profile to the desired reference with the avoidance of possible process faults, delays and uncertainties. First, the nonlinear estimation problem is simplified to the linear one by introducing an appropriate system reparametrisation to deal with the problem of the simultaneous estimation of state and process fault. Second, to solve the problem of time-varying delays and uncertainties, this paper makes use of the two-dimensional (2-D) and repetitive characteristics of batch processes and introduces the state error, tracking error and estimation error to establish the dynamics model of FTILC that is eventually converted into a linear repetitive process model. Then, sufficient conditions based on the Lyapunov–Krasovskii theory and H ∞ methodology are established to ensure the robust stability along the trial in according with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for all uncertainties. Finally, this paper manifests the effectiveness of the proposed sufficient conditions by a simulation of injection moulding process.},

The technique is a pseudospectral collocation approach based on the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto points. Firstly the domain of interest is divided into several adaptive subintervals, and then the traditional pseudospectral approach is used for each segment. This approach discretizes the optimal control problem with a scale delay function and transforms it into a nonlinear programming problem whose solution can be achieved via the existing solvers. The main advantages of this method are the simplicity of the structure and the ease of its implementation and execution. Moreover, the necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality associated with the scale-delayed control problems are obtained. To do this, a new transformation technique is proposed which transforms the scale delayed control problem into a constant delayed one. These conditions can be used to measure the accuracy of the approximate findings obtained by applying the suggested method. The effectiveness and usefulness of the discretization procedure are demonstrated by the implementation of the proposed method in some experimental examples.},

A novel bounded admissible edge-dependent average dwell time (BAED-ADT) switching signal is designed. Based on this division rule of switching subsystems, we adopt the slow switching method for the stable subsystems and the fast switching method for the unstable subsystems, so that stable subsystems can compensate unstable subsystems. Combined with admissible edge-dependent average impulsive interval (AED-AII) impulsive signal, a new unified ISS stability result is established, which could be applied to impulsive switched systems with an arbitrary combination of unstable and stable subsystems. Without solving the linear matrix inequality, it is allowed to readjust the AED-ADT boundary of the newly proposed stability condition according to the actual impulsive and switching signal. Further, compared with the existing fruits, the new stability condition is an extension and improvement of the previous one, which is less conservative. Several numerical examples are provided to show the validity of the conditions and the advantages of the theoretic results.},

  abstract     = {The complex v-plane is an emerging design domain for fractional order control system design. Recently, several works demonstrated the advantages of tuning FOPID controllers in v-plane. These approaches essentially perform the minimum angle pole placement to a target angle within the stability region of the v-plane and facilitate fractional order control system design tasks because of inherently guaranteed stabilisation of fractional order transfer functions. Accordingly, the optimal FOPID controller tuning problem can be simplified to placement of minimum angle system pole to a target point within the stability region of the v-plane. After reviewing previous v-domain design works, authors investigate prominent target points that can result in improved FOPID control performance for the v-domain design task. The consideration of target points in polar coordinates can provide two design parameters (angle and magnitude), which can convey essential system knowledge associated with the stability and control performance of FOPID control systems. In this perspective, effects of minimum angle pole positions on control performance indices are investigated in detail, and some prominent target points to manage FOPID design in v-domain have been reported. The v-domain design examples are illustrated to reveal the effects of the sampled pole positions on the robust control performance.},

The above stability is achieved through dynamic event-triggered mechanism and static event-triggered mechanism. To avert Zeno behaviour in each sample path, our event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs) force a pause time after each successful execution, which will lead to intermittent detection of system status, thus greatly saving communication resources. One utilises the Hanalay-type inequality to obtain the less conservative stability criterion. In addition, a collaborative design method of ETM and linear controller is proposed. Ultimately, an paraphrastic example is shown to indicate the availability of the mentioned collaborative design process.},

In the controller design procedure, the neural network state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable state variables. Dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is applied to avoid the repeated differentiation for the virtual control signals. The dynamic surface compensation signals can realise the practical fixed-time bounded. Utilising the classified discussion method, the difficulty of controller design caused by the existence of observer error term is addressed. The technique of transformation of the index set is employed to cope with the related variables of the neighbour states, which simplifies the controller design. Under the presented control mechanism, all closed-loop signals remain bound for a fixed period of time, the formation control performance target between all followers and leader can be achieved. And the formation errors and state observers errors are both bounded such that can converge to a little domain around zero. Simulation results are provided to test the availability of the presented strategy.},

The proposed algorithm divides the iterative process into a rapidly decreasing error phase and an error convergence phase, and uses different control algorithms in different phases, thus combining different advantages of the original algorithms. In addition to this, this work proves the convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm and summarises the design idea of this controller. Finally, the convergence performance of the algorithm in noisy environments and in variable reference trajectory environment is simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this work.},

Here, the delayed Bode&#39;s ideal transfer function is employed in the reference model. Moreover, the stability region of the reference model is given via a theorem. In simulation studies, the proposed methodology is compared with other two different methods using the same frequency domain specifications. It is observed that the proposed optimal fractional-order PID controllers outperform according to the mentioned performance indices, and they also possess considerably acceptable performance in terms of other time domain specifications such as overshoot, settling time, etc.},

Also, it is introduced in the design and analysis like some integrable auxiliary signals and a novel contradiction argument. Moreover, hysteresis nonlinearity is counteracted by constructing its approximated inverse compensator. With these efforts, stability analysis ensures that all the closed-loop system signals are uniformly bounded, and it is successfully achieved the asymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero, circumventing the obstacle caused by the unknown control directions.

The specialty lies in that the terminal penalty is a quadratic term over the conditional expectations of the terminal state. The essential difficulty lies in an additional measurability constraint on the input induced by the conditional expectation term, which is shared by the control problems for the stochastic system with delays, rational expectations problems, control problems involving conditional expectation terms, asymmetric information control and so on. A new idea, dynamic programming combined with orthogonal decomposition, is proposed to deal with this problem. The orthogonal decomposition eliminates the additional measurability constraint on the input. The solvability condition and the optimal controller are obtained by developing generalised Riccati equations. Numerical experiment is provided to support the achieved results.},

The major challenge in the LQT problem is the boundedness issue of the cost function in an infinite time framework. In many studies, a discount factor is utilised to overcome the challenge. However, it can affect the stability of the closed-loop system and the steady-state error. This paper proposes an optimal control structure that guarantees zero steady-state error with bounded cost function without utilising the discount factor. The optimal gains of the proposed control structure are computed via model-based and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. As a novelty in model-based RL algorithms, a model predictive RL algorithm is proposed to reduce the number of iterations in the learning phase. A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm is utilised to obtain optimal control for tracking the reference online and without any knowledge of system dynamics. Finally, the simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed optimal control structure.},

First, we analyse the well-posedness of solutions. Then sufficient conditions for extinction and permanence of prey and predator populations are derived. Moreover, we present the existence and uniqueness of stationary distribution of this system. Finally, based on numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, it is revealed that (i) high-intensity white noise can lead to the extinction of predator populations; (ii) low-intensity white noise may prolong the period of periodic solutions.

Then, the error system is divided into two second-order subsystems, and a distributed controller comprised of two parts is delivered. The stability analysis of the whole system is given by the employing cascaded control theory. One key merit of the proposed controller is that the prescribed formation is an extensive case and unlimited, including different tracking radii and angular spacing. Another merit is that the communication topology among agents only needs to have a directed spanning tree. Furthermore, the controller can be implemented by each agent in its local frame so that only local information is utilised without knowing global information.

Then we adopt the static benchmark to analyse the optimisation performance and establish the sub-linear expected static regret and sub-linear expected constraint violations of the proposed algorithm in the two-point bandit feedback setup. Moreover, the expected static regret and constraint violations are further improved to O ( ln ⁡ T ) when loss functions satisfy the condition of strong convexity.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an adaptive finite-time impedance control strategy based on optimised backstepping (OB) technique is proposed for robotic manipulators subject to state constraints. The existing OB methods approximately solve the intractable Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation by reinforcement learning (RL) with Bellman residual error, which has intricate actor-critic updating laws and persistence excitation requirement. To overcome this drawback, we construct the simplified RL updating laws by converting the problem to the solution of a positive-definite function, which is composed of actor-critic network weights. Then, the simplified RL updating laws can significantly reduce the controller complexity and relax the persistence excitation. Based on the barrier Lyapunov function, a barrier-type performance index function is constructed for the optimised controller under state constraints. The finite-time stability theory can guarantee the finite-time convergence property of the closed loop system without violating the prescribed constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the simulation example with environment-robot interaction.},

For alleviating the burden of communication bandwidth, a novel event-triggered scheme of data transmission is designed in the sensor-to-controller (S-C) channel. To deal with the unknown parameters and disturbances of master–slave MNNs, the adaptive controller is designed with the system states of triggering instants. Different from existing results about event-triggered adaptive control (ETAC) for MNNs, in which the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is installed in the controller-to-actuator (C-A) channel, the event-triggered scheme in this paper is designed between the sensor and the controller, so the information flow of S-C channel is discontinuous. The adaptive laws can only use discrete-time system states transmitted at triggering instants to update control gains in this paper. By means of the Lyapunov methods, adaptive control theories and event-triggered techniques, sufficient conditions for synchronisation and quasi-synchronisation are obtained. At the same time, the designed ETM can avoid Zeno behaviour theoretically. Finally, the validity of the obtained results is shown by two simulation examples.},

The remote estimator does not have the knowledge of the measurement in the case of collision and the origin of the data packet in the case of successful transmission, resulting in the non-Gaussianity of the estimation process in the two cases. By using a commonly used Gaussian approximation method, the posterior distribution of the system state is proved to be a mixture of two Gaussians and a mixture of three Gaussians in the cases of collision and successful transmission, respectively. Then an approximate minimum mean squared error estimator with adaptive weights is proposed, and the weights convexly combine the estimates for the possible transmission situations. Moreover, the proposed estimator is also shown to be conventional forms under three extreme situations. Finally, numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator based on the incomplete information.},

The performances of these processes can be improved by modifying SP. The present work deals with the control of dead-time by integrating the first-order-plus-dead-time (IFOPDT) or first-order-plus-dead-time process (FOPDT), and a modified sliding-mode-controller (SMC) in the proposed modified-Smith-predictor (MSP) structure. Here, a modified novel SMC discontinuous tuning-parameter is derived analytically to satisfy performance criteria such as speed adjustment, reducing overshoot and chattering effects. Furthermore, the MSP-SMC structure is implemented in six different processes. This is done to counteract time-delay and constant load-disturbance for integrating processes and a nonlinear system separately. Also, the proposed work is implemented in the real-time lab setup of a neutralisation process. Furthermore, the robustness and invariance properties of the SMC have been analysed against parametric uncertainty. The optimality of the proposed controller parameters is tested by giving uncertainty in the dead time of the process parameters. The proposed design is also implemented in the non-linear and Multi-Input-Multi-Output processes. The performance metrics, IAEs, of 6 case studies have been obtained using MATLAB and the peak overshoots are compared with similar kinds of works.},

Initially, a transformation function is introduced into the control design, which allows the tracking error of the controlled systems to a specified accuracy within a preassigned settling time. Unlike the existing prescribed time control scheme that only uses transformation function technique in the first step of the backstepping design, the transformation function is introduced to each step of the controlled systems, which makes only one adaptive parameter that needs to be updated online. Then, to synthesise a low-cost control scheme, a first-order sliding mode differentiator and a single-parameter estimation method are implemented based on the newly constructed coordinate transformations. Meanwhile, the Nussbaum technique successfully solves the effects caused by the unknown control direction, unknown backlash-like hysteresis and quantised input. All signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded under the proposed control scheme with arbitrary switching signal.

The inherent ‘explosion of complexity’ problem is eliminated by adopting command filter technology and the corresponding error compensation mechanism is exploited to alleviate the influence of the errors generated by command filters. It is further proved that all the signals can be fast finite-time bounded in the closed-loop systems based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Besides, the observer and tracking errors can reach a small region around the origin in fast finite time.

Using fuzzy logic systems, the unknown functions of systems are then roughly estimated.

First, a fractional-order congestion model with fractional-order PID controller is constructed. Then the onset of the tipping induced by Hopf bifurcation of the uncontrolled model is studied. By contrast, the tipping point can be delayed under the controller for the controlled model. Some conditions under which Hopf bifurcation occurs are given. The stable and unstable ranges of control parameters for the controlled model are also deduced.

Our advanced approach builds upon the foundation of conventional Decentralised Fully Probabilistic Design (DFPD) by refining the Riccati equation to accommodate multiple noise sources effectively. By embracing the inherent stochastic nature of complex systems, our methodology fully characterises their dynamic behaviours using probabilistic state–space models, delivering a comprehensive representation of subsystem components. Importantly, the DFPD approach also incorporates system and input constraints by characterising their corresponding ideal distributions, ensuring optimal functionality and performance while adhering to permissible boundaries. To further enhance system performance, we introduce a probabilistic message passing architecture that enables seamless communication between neighbouring subsystems and promotes harmonised decision-making among local nodes. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, we employ a three-inverted pendulum system as a numerical example and compare its performance to that of the conventional DFPD. Through this comparison, we showcase the advantages of our novel decentralised control approach in handling complex systems with multiple noise factors.},

To tackle the problem, this paper proposes an encryption method, which does not need to compromise accuracy to privacy, nor does it need to encrypt and decrypt state information every time. Meanwhile, the method in this paper not only keeps the initial state secret, but also considers the real-time state privacy. Then, we further elaborate two aspects of the proposed method by simple proofs. Finally, simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

The parameters for dead-zone characteristics are assumed to be unknown, and an adaptive dead-zone inverse method is applied so as to reduce the effect for dead-zone non-linearities. Moreover, for the purpose of reducing the effects of matched and mismatched uncertainties, compensation inputs are introduced. The proposed adaptive gain robust model-following/tracking controller can achieve that the tracking error asymptotically converges to zero. In this paper, by using piecewise Lyapunov functions, we show sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed adaptive gain robust model-following/tracking controller.

Firstly, a new synchronisation error model with uncertain of internal coupling weights between nodes and stochastic network attacks on actuator is modelled. Secondly, the Bernoulli stochastic distribution process is used to describe the probability of stochastic attacks, and the actuator failure model is adopted to depict actuator failure. By establishing an appropriate Lyapunov function, some sufficient conditions to ensure the asymptotic stability of the synchronisation error system is derived, which reduces conservatism.

The multi-rate system is transformed into a single-rate system by using a virtual measurement method. At each sensor node, the estimates received from neighbour nodes are fused by matrix or scalar weighting according to their different estimation accuracy. A distributed recursive filter with the Kalman consensus filter structure is devised based on the fused estimate, where the filtering gain and consensus gain are solved by locally minimising an upper bound of the filtering error covariance. The obtained gains and the upper bound of the covariance depend on a group of free positive scalar parameters. The scalar parameters are optimised by minimising the upper bound of the covariance. It is proved that the upper bound of the covariance of the filter with optimal gains and parameters is smaller than the covariance of the local filter based on sensor measurements. It avoids calculating cross-covariance matrices between nodes and has small computational burden. The exponential boundedness in the mean square of the filtering error is analysed.

To accurately identify the fraction model is however challenging, and this paper presents a regularised fast recursive algorithm (RFRA) to identify both the true fraction model structure and the associated unknown model parameters. This is achieved first by transforming the fraction form to a linear combination of nonlinear model terms. Then the terms in the denominator are used to form a regularisation term in the cost function to offset the bias induced by the linear transformation. According to the structural risk minimisation principle based on the new cost function, the model terms are selected based on their contributions to the cost function and the coefficients are then identified recursively without explicitly solving the inverse matrix. The proposed method is proved to have low computational complexity. Simulation results confirm the efficacy of the method in fast identification of the true fraction models for the targeted nonlinear systems.},

In this paper, a novel window-type detector (WTD) is designed for stealthy false data injection (FDI) attack targeted at CPSs. In the absence of attack, the evaluation value of a WTD is χ 2 χ 2 χ2 distributed because of the existence of Gaussian noise. In the presence of attack, the evaluation value of the WTD is the result of accumulating the residual data caused by attack signals, which is similar to the mechanism of a summation (SUM) detector. It is proved that when the duration of system operation is much larger than the attack duration squared, evaluation value of an SUM detector is χ 2 distributed due to the huge number of tolerable historical data. And the structure of finite window size prevents the WTD from failure in such a situation, which equips it with better performance in the detection of attacks with medium duration. Furthermore, it is proved that the closer the window size is to the attack duration, the larger the evaluation value is, which means that the better detection performance could be achieved. Finally, numerical examples are given to verify the characteristics of the WTD.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the bipartite output containment control problem by utilising distributed control protocols for heterogeneous multi-agent systems over directed signed graphs. A fully distributed dynamic compensator is proposed to estimate the convex hull and symmetric convex hull spanned by states of leaders. Then, a distributed observer based on neighbour information is presented for estimating the state of each follower. An output feedback control protocol is further given based on the fully distributed dynamic compensator and neighbour-based observer to cope with the bipartite containment control problem of the linear heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Different from the related works, a neighbour-based observer is presented for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, in which the analysis method used in the Luenburger observer cannot be applied directly, because of the heterogeneity. Besides, the dynamics of the agents are allowed to not only have nonidentical coefficient matrices but also have different dimensions. A simulation example is shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

By developing a dual-domination gain method, a distributed compensator is proposed for each follower by utilising the output information of the follower and its neighbour agents. Based on the compensator, an output feedback control law is designed to achieve consensus. These two gains are used to deal with the unknown measurement noises and nonlinear terms, respectively. Then the consensus problem is transformed into a stability problem by introducing an appropriate state transformation. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the states of the leader and followers can achieve consensus asymptotically.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel state-dependent switching controller with delayed positive partial state feedback is proposed to stabilise a controlled system with insufficient state information. At first, the controlled system is converted to a single-degree-of-freedom vibrational system by using an invertible transform and a second-order Taylor approximation for the time delay term. Then, appropriate control gain parameters and a state-dependent switching rule are designed via the physical meaning of the resulting vibrational system. By combining the advantages of delayed positive position feedback with the state-dependent switching mechanism, we find that the time delay can considerably improve the asymptotic stability of the controlled system. Finally, three numerical examples show that the proposed controller is effective and that time delay indeed plays a prominent positive role in switched control systems.},

Hence, an attempt has been made in this work to modify the RIMC (as a bi-loop RIMC proportional-derivative (RIMC-PD)) strategy to make it applicable to a class of unstable and integrating systems involving dead time. The secondary-loop stabilisation is achieved with a PD controller constructed by Routh stability constraints. The primary loop contains a RIMC controller for reference following. Both primary, as well as secondary-loop controller parameters, are optimally tuned in the search space using the equilibrium optimiser subjected to minimal integral square error. The RIMC-PD control strategy delivers reasonable enhancement in performance measures when compared with some of the recently reported strategies. A robust stability investigation is also carried out. Finally, experimental verification of the RIMC-PD strategy is carried out using a magnetic levitation laboratory setup.},

Moreover, fault estimator is designed in line with periodic piecewise observer systems to estimate the immeasurable states of the PPTVSs and the fault signal, simultaneously. Subsequently, in accordance with the estimated values of the fault signal and state dynamics, a fault-tolerant controller is devised. Moreover, by utilising Lyapunov stability theory and matrix polynomial lemma, sufficient criteria are procured in context of linear matrix inequalities to affirm the uniform boundedness of the undertaken system and error system. Further, relying on the acquired constraints, the precise configuration of the fault-tolerant control and observer gain matrices are proffered.

Since coloured noises will reduce the estimation accuracy, the model transformation technique is employed to whiten the original system without changing the input-output relationship. In order to alleviate the heavy computational burden caused by high-dimensional variables and different types of parameters, the transformed model is divided into several sub-models according to the numbers of outputs. However, after the decomposition, all the sub-models contain a same parameter vector, resulting in many redundant estimates. A model transformation based distributed stochastic gradient (MT-DSG) algorithm is derived to cut down the redundant estimates and exchange the information among the sub-models. Compared with the centralised multivariate generalised stochastic gradient algorithm, the MT-DSG algorithm has more accurate estimates and less computational complexity.

The main feature of this paper is that the observer&#39;s state converges to the actual state within the desired convergence time, where the convergence time is invariant with respect to the initial errors of the system. Moreover, the convergence time can be chosen at the will of the designer. The proposed method&#39;s results involve the high-gain principle and recent advancements in fixed-time observers.

Firstly, a new criterion is provided to analyse the admissibility of SFOSs, which does not need to divide the fractional order interval ( 0 , 2 ) ( 0 , 2 ) (0, 2) into interval ( 0 , 1 ) ( 0 , 1 ) (0, 1) and interval [ 1 , 2 ) to study them separately. Then, by expanding the dimension of the SFOS, the non-fragile SMO and the sliding surface are constructed and the accurate estimations of faults and the SFOS state simultaneously are achieved. A new reaching law is designed, which can divide the process of the system moving to the sliding surface into three stages. Further the control law is constructed to guarantee the observation error reaches the sliding surface in finite time. Finally, three examples show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The asynchronous situation between the original MJSs and the controller/filter is modelled by the hidden Markov model (HMM). This work gives a survey on the recent development of the HMM-based asynchronous controller and filter design for different MJSs, covering linear MJSs, fuzzy MJSs, semi-MJSs and 2D MJSs. Finally, a conclusion is drawn and the potential future research directions of MJSs are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion processes, as fundamental mechanisms for particle movement in systems with different concentrations, are used to describe many real-world physical, chemical, biological, engineering, economic and social phenomena. A diffusion process can be modelled via a fractional-order transfer function with time-delay, where its parameters may be affected by circumstance. Hereupon, this study proposes a pioneer robustness indicator to achieve the phase margin invariance regardless of concurrent uncertainty on different parameters of a diffusion process. Afterwards, an analytical procedure is suggested to tune a Fractional-Order Proportional-Integral-Derivative (FO-PID) controller for a diffusion process, to favourably regulate the values of gain crossover frequency and phase margin, such that the proposed robustness criterion is met. Moreover, the solvability of the problem is analytically investigated. Finally, a numerical simulation on robust temperature control during magnetic local hyperthermia, i.e. a common method to treat cancerous tumours, is presented to validate the efficiency of the paper achievements.},

To solve this phenomenon, the Weighted Try-Once-Discard (WTOD) protocol is proposed on the sensor-to-controller (S/C) channels to regulate which one sensor node is permitted to send data via the communication network at each instant. A key issue of this work is how to integrate the WTOD protocol into the design of observer and the sliding mode controller for the switched systems. To this end, a token-dependent observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasured states, and then an observer-based SMC law is properly designed. Moreover, by constructing a Lur&#39;e-type Lyapunov function interconnected with a cone-bounded nonlinearity, some sufficient conditions are established such that the reachability with a sliding domain around the specified sliding surface is achieved, meanwhile, the exponential stability of the resultant closed-loop switched systems is guaranteed.

Then, different from the conventional ones for canonical integral cascade model, a novel prescribed-time extended state observer (PTESO) is designed for WMR such that the unknown skidding and slipping can be observed and compensated. By developing the active disturbance rejection control technique, the zero-error control is achieved for WMR in prescribed time instead of ultimately uniform boundedness.

Two kinds of sampling techniques, namely, aperiodic sampling and dynamic event-triggered sampling, are utilised. Moreover, the proportional integral (PI) strategy is utilised in the proposed algorithms. Compared with the existing distributed optimisation algorithm based on periodic sampling, the proposed algorithm dependent on aperiodic sampling is more general. Compared with the existing steady event-triggered algorithm, the distributed optimisation algorithm based on dynamic event-triggered sampling has the merit of lower energy consumption. Under the assumption that the global cost function is strongly convex about global minimum point, it is proved that the proposed algorithms solve the optimisation problem. Lyapunov stability theory is applied to give sufficient criteria guaranteeing convergence to optimal point.

To reduce some unnecessary data transmissions, a novel dynamic threshold adjustable event-triggering mechanism is proposed. In contrast with the traditional static threshold event-triggering mechanism, communication efficiency is greatly enhanced. Then, a neural networks-based observer is constructed to address the problem of unmeasured states, and the dynamic surface control method is used to address the ‘explosion of complexity’ that comes up when traditional backstepping design processes are used. Meanwhile, the Nussbaum function is introduced to eliminate the effect of unknown hysteresis. By resorting to the Lyapunov stability theory, it can be verified that all signals in the close-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded.

This study theoretically and experimentally validates that the temperature parameter of the softmax function significantly impacts the classification accuracy and the proposed loss function is effective in improving the performance in the presence of noise.

According to the empirical Bayesian approach, we design the third-order stable kernel structure used for embedding prior knowledge and derive the estimation of hyperparameters. The hyperparameters included in local weighting functions and kernel functions are determined by the maximum likelihood method.

On this basis, a backstepping controller is designed. Considering the unknown time-varying delays, the control effect of the neural network controller based on the backstepping method is not optimal. To deal with the problem, a double-layer adaptive compensator for the neural network is proposed.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the decentralised tracking control (DTC) problem is investigated for a class of continuous-time large-scale systems with external disturbance by utilising adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Firstly, the DTC problem is solved by designing corresponding optimal controllers of the isolated subsystems, which are formulated with N augmented subsystems consisting of the tracking error and the reference trajectory. Then, considering the external disturbance, we can effectively construct the DTC scheme by means of adding suitable feedback gains to the optimal control strategies associated with each augmented tracking isolated subsystems (ATISs). Due to the approximate nature, a series of critic neural networks are constructed to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation, so as to derive the estimation of the Nash equilibrium solution containing the optimal control strategy and the worst disturbance law. Herein, a modified weight updating criterion is developed by employing a stabilising term. Consequently, we remove the requirement of initial admissible control in the proposed algorithm. After that, stability analysis of the ATIS is performed through the Lyapunov theory, in the sense that tracking states and weight approximation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, an experimental simulation is demonstrated to ensure the validity of the proposed DTC scheme.},

With a practical vision of real-world problems, constraints on the control signal and system states are involved in the proposed algorithm. The main goal is to design a sub-optimal controller by simultaneously obtaining the control policy and the model parameters. To this end, the conventional problem of solving the Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is transformed into a nonlinear non-convex optimisation problem. Then, by reformulating the constraints of the optimisation problem, it is relaxed into a convex Semi-Definite Programming (SDP). By presenting an iterative method, the control cost, the performance, and the number of iterations are improved compared to conventional methods, and a closer result to the optimal solution is obtained. The performance and efficacy of the proposed algorithm are investigated through a case study on the physical load positioning system.},

  abstract     = {Liquid crystal elastomer-based actuators (LCEAs) exhibit large, reversible deformation, which demonstrates superior advantages in developing remote controlled, light-weighted soft robots. However, deformation of LCEAs undergoes complicated physical dynamics and exhibits highly nonlinear hysteretic characteristics, posing challenges in the realization of related applications. It is necessary to develop a dynamic model that captures the characteristics of LCEAs. With this purpose, this paper proposes a dynamic modelling approach for LCEAs to provide a hybrid model for LCEAs with reduced computational complexity and high precision. In the research, a modelling scheme based on a physics-phenomenon-combined approach for LCEAs is proposed, which considers the elastic free energy, the nematic free energy and dissipation of the LCEA. Physics-based models are then developed to describe these energies. Meanwhile, a phenomenon-based model is proposed to characterise the hysteresis as a component of the nematic free energy. The above models are combined together to provide the final hybrid model for the LCEA. To verify the proposed model, a photo-responsive LCEA experimental platform is established and experiments are conducted. Model parameters are identified based on the nonlinear least-squares method. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed model as an excellent representative to characterise LCEAs&#39; dynamic behaviours.},

In light of the active disturbance rejection control technique, a distributed containment control scheme is put forward, which effectively deals with the problems of unknown nonlinearities and uncertain dynamics.

  abstract     = {A generalised proportional-derivative type scheme for the finite-time and exponential tracking continuous control of Euler–Lagrange systems with input constraints is developed. Its generalised design permits the choice among multiple saturating structures. Suitable functions are involved for the appropriate shaping of every error correction term, and complementarily of their addition, to achieve the concerned type of convergence (in addition to the input saturation avoidance). Such a shaping is carried out through control parameters that act as exponential weights on the gained configuration and generalised velocity errors and on their joint action. Compared to previous finite-time approaches, such exponential weights are required to satisfy generalised comparative conditions, avoiding a fixed equivalence relation among any of them. This permits to give rise to a wider spectrum of finite-time convergent closed-loop trajectories and gives an optional type of (unconventional) exponential convergence (in addition to the conventional one). The resulting extended conditions on the exponential weights and the generalised saturating structure enlarge the controller potential for performance improvement or adjustment. The generalised design is supported through a more general analysis based on more general strict Lyapunov functions, stating more solid analytical bases for possible design extensions on the accomplishment of other control objectives. The study is further supported through experimental tests on a 3-degree-of-freedom robot manipulator.},

  abstract     = {Event-triggered fault diagnosis has attracted tremendous research attention in the last decade due to its superiority in improving the utilisation efficiency of communication resources. Different from traditional works of time-driven, event-triggered schemes are used to determine whether the current measurement output should be released to the fault detection filter, while the sensor data not satisfying a predefined triggering condition will be discarded directly. As such, research on event-triggered fault diagnosis has been a challenging issue and many outstanding results have been reported. This paper presents a survey of model-based event-triggered fault detection (FD) and fault estimation (FE) methods mainly based on the techniques of residual generation. First, an overview of recent advances in state estimation-based methods of event-triggered FD is provided, which include the event-triggered FD for dynamic systems subject to Gaussian noises, the H ∞ filtering formulation of event-triggered FD, and the event-triggered H i / H ∞ optimisation-based FD. Second, the representative results of parity space-based event-triggered FD are reviewed. Third, recent results on event-triggered FE are also reviewed. Finally, several challenging issues on event-triggered fault diagnosis are provided for future research.},

Then, we compare the differences between some features, which include users&#39; transaction volume, speculators&#39; transaction volume and expected token returns, on the green platform (ESG score greater than 0) and the same features on the brown one (ESG score less than 0). We also analyse the impact of speculators&#39; ESG preferences on the expected token returns, users&#39; and speculators&#39; transaction volume.

Due to the fact that vectors have more flexible mathematical properties than matrices, this paper proposes the more convenient mathematic method to investigate the double tracking control problem of NS and OLS. Under the condition that the states of NS are available and the states of OLS are unavailable, the asymptotical state observer of OLS is designed, by which the tracking controllers of NS and OLS are synthesised to ensure achieving the double tracking goals.

Then, two event-triggered mechanisms are constructed, and a positive L 1 function introduced therein is greatly useful for scheduling the information transmission as well as excluding the Zeno behavior. Under the proposed protocol, the consensus errors are proved to converge to zero asymptotically in a scalable and fully distributed way. Furthermore, the results obtained in the leaderless network are extended to the leader-following case. Finally, simulation examples are conducted to confirm the validity of the presented results.},

The results presented in this paper remove the common assumption that the system&#39;s mode and controller&#39;s mode have to be synchronised and that the triggering condition has to be monitored continuously.

  abstract     = {We propose a new distributed adaptive control architecture for finite-time control of uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems. The proposed architecture employs three key components for each agent; a nonlinear reference model, a weight update rule, and an adaptive control signal. Predicated on agent-wise reference model state exchange, an ideal finite-time behaviour of overall multiagent system is captured by nonlinear reference models. The weight update rule of each agent, which is driven by a local error signal between the actual uncertain state of an agent and its reference model state, then adjusts agent-wise controller parameters in real-time to drive the local error signals of each agent to zero in finite-time. That is, not only the states of agents converge to their nonlinear reference model states in finite-time, but also the latter states converge to the given ideal behaviour in finite-time. Considering safety, the distinct feature of our architecture is that it does not rely on agent-wise actual state exchange between agents, which involves the effect of system uncertainties. This implies that when a subset of agents exhibits, for example, Byzantine behaviour, then their behaviour do not affect the rest of multiagent system from functioning.},

Specifically, our contribution is a norm-free and adaptive event-triggering rule for each agent, where it is decentralised and predicated on the solution-predictor curve method. The decentralised feature means that the proposed event-triggering rule depends on the own error signals of an agent without requiring any neighbouring or global information. The norm-free feature means that the left-hand side of the proposed event-triggering rule inequality does not depend on distances such as absolute values of error signals to allow for better agent-to-agent information exchange reduction. To achieve both decentralised and norm-free features together, an adaptive term is utilised in the event-triggering rule for each agent to estimate unknown variable unavailable to an agent. Here, the presented system-theoretical analysis of the proposed event-triggering rule holds for both the sampled data exchange case and the data exchange case predicated on the solution-predictor curve method. In contrast to standard sampled data exchange, the solution-predictor curve method has the ability to further reduce agent-to-agent information exchange, where each agent stores this curve and exchanges its parameters when an event occurs in a distributed manner for approximating the solution trajectory of each agent.},

Previous works have mainly considered noise-corrupted communication by ignoring intrinsic dynamics of nodes. This work provides a systematic study of complex networks by taking into account both additive noise and nonlinear dynamics of nodes, examining their stochastic synchronisation problems. We model the deterministic diffusive coupling and noisy additive coupling with the time-invariant strength and the time-varying strength, respectively. Using the stochastic Lyapunov technique, this framework enables an analytical treatment of the problem, ultimately leading to sufficient conditions for the onset of synchronisation. For symmetrical/asymmetrical connections, the synchronisation condition for the time-invariant coupling strength can be stated elegantly in terms of node dynamics and network topology, whereas that for the time-varying coupling strength is described as a robust condition. Finally, two simulation examples are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Communication network could suffer uncertainties originating from link faults and network attacks. This situation, in multi-agent systems, can be featured by unknown weights of network topology. To impair the influence of the uncertain topology, typical compensation should be taken into account in distributed protocols to the workability of multi-agent systems. This paper, in the context of uncertain topology, addresses finite-time leader-following consensus for second-order uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems. In addition to uncertainties in topology, the systems also allow unknown control coefficients, which together with the unknown weights renders the realisation of finite-time leader-following consensus nontrivial. Specifically, a fully distributed protocol based on distributed finite-time observer is designed via integrating the adaptive compensation scheme. Notably, in the designed protocol, dynamic high gains are introduced for the compensations of the network uncertainties and agents uncertainties. It turns out that the designed fully distributed protocol guarantees the global finite-time leader-following consensus. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.},

Also, the partial IMC (PIMC) concept is utilised, wherein we write the plant as the summation of stable and unstable parts and consider only the stable part as the internal model. The combined approach is thereby referred to as modified partial IMC (m-PIMC). This paper presents a graphical method to obtain controller parameters for the proposed m-PIMC to satisfy the given gain margin ( A m ) and phase margin ( ϕ m ) specifications. Further, stability boundary and robust boundary for the controller parameters are obtained which respectively give a set of all controller parameters stabilising the close loop and a set of all controller parameters ensuring robust stability. Seven different well-known standard stable, unstable and integrating process models are considered for the proposed m-PIMC design, and simulation examples are given for four selected plant models.},

For the linear subsystem, in order to obtain unbiased estimates of model parameters, a bias compensation method is introduced. Then, the bias-compensated least squares (BLS) algorithm is proposed. For the nonlinear subsystem, on the basis of particle swarm optimisation (PSO), the fuzzy control technology is added to improve the ability of jumping out of the local optimum. Thus, a bias-compensated least squares and fuzzy PSO based hierarchical (BLS-FPSO-H) method is derived at last.

Since the T–S fuzzy system is characterised by its membership function, less conservative stabilisation conditions can be derived from membership function-dependent Lyapunov function which contributes to the improvement of disturbance rejection performance. Specifically, we utilise a configuration composed of a membership function-dependent state observer for the state estimation, a membership function-dependent equivalent-input-disturbance estimator for the estimation and compensation of disturbance and an internal model for the reference tracking. It is revealed that this membership function-dependent Lyapunov function naturally leads to control gains switching in accordance with the derivative signs of the normalised premise variables. The switching rules and the design conditions for all control gains are obtained explicitly. In particular, the free-weighting-matrix approach is used to lessen the conservatism in the stability condition. Moreover, a concrete procedure for the controller design including the switching rule is given. Finally, the developed method is tested via simulations. The advantage of the membership function-dependent equivalent-input-disturbance method is validated by comparing with conventional methods.},

The proposed method is suitable for parametric systems with non-affine parametric dependence. With Taylor expansion, the expansion coefficients of the state variable are first obtained. Then, we show that the subspace spanned by the expansion coefficients belongs to a Krylov subspace. To speed up the PMOR process, a parallel strategy based on the block DFT and the structured matrices is proposed to compute the matrices involved in the Krylov subspace. This can avoid directly computing the inverse of the large-scale matrix. After that, the reduced parametric systems are constructed with the projection matrix obtained by the Arnoldi algorithm and orthonormalisation. Furthermore, we analyse the invertibility and the error estimations to guarantee the feasibility of the proposed PMOR method.

First, aiming at system stability, the feasible domain of decision is given for stable and unstable MJLSs with initial MTPM. Second, a generalised performance index is put forward which contains both state cost and decision cost, and we obtain the quantitative relationship between the index and decision via stochastic dynamic programming.

To relax this assumption, this paper shows that the dynamical model of isolated systems can be extracted from measured data of interconnected systems under some weak restrictions on network structures. We also modify the identification algorithm to obtain real-time identification results with fewer calculation resources and analyse the convergence of the proposed methods. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method can identify network structures in real-time and detect changes in networks correctly.},

Firstly, based on communication topology, the distributed optimisation problem with two clusters is considered and a kind of distributed control protocol is proposed. By using the fixed-time stability theory and the convexity of function, it is proved that the MASs can not only achieve cluster consensus in a fixed-time interval, but also solve the optimisation problem asymptotically. Secondly, the MASs with multiple clusters are further considered. We extend the proposed protocol to a more general case and also prove that MASs can achieve cluster consensus in fixed-time and asymptotically reach the optimal solution of the optimisation objective.

  abstract     = {Event-triggered control, as networked systems are popular, is increasingly appreciated. Such control could arouse essential saving of communication/computation and would lay the groundwork for networked (control) systems. However, due to the discontinuity and hybrid nature of event-triggered control, the exclusion of Zeno phenomenon is the premise of its workability. Aiming to circumvent the Zeno behaviour more explicitly, we attach a dynamic dwell time to triggering mechanism and propose a new adaptive event-triggered control scheme for uncertain nonlinear systems. Specifically, a set of dynamic gains are first introduced to compensate for large uncertainties and nonlinearities, and the indispensability of a set of gains rather than a gain is elaborated on. Then, from a dynamic-gain-dependent monitoring rule, the positive dwell time is generated so that the Zeno phenomenon can be excluded automatically. In particular, the rule enables system behaviour to be always monitored by evaluating the sampling errors of gains. Based on this, we construct an adaptive controller with linear structure, which allows the execution error can be estimated explicitly, and in turn suppressed by the gains. It is shown that, with the proposed event-triggered control, all the closed-loop system signals are bounded and the system state ultimately converges to zero. Notably, the designed triggering mechanism could save more resources in theory since the event detection and gains monitoring are performed alternately. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme is illustrated by two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional models are challenging to deals with because of their complex structure. Two-dimensional models can be separated into two sub-models only if they are represented in separable-denominator form. However, the separable-denominator form must satisfy the minimal rank-decomposition criteria to decompose the two-dimensional model into two sub-models. This research proposes a transformation that transforms the original two-dimensional general model into a two-dimensional decoupled model form without involving separable-denominator form and minimal rank-decomposition criteria and then decomposes into two one-dimensional sub-models (i.e. two cascaded one-dimensional models). Furthermore, the suggested transformation preserves the symmetry of the decomposed one-dimensional sub-models. These sub-models are used for ease in the design, analysis, control, and model reduction. Numerical outcomes show that the suggested transformation efficiently transforms the original two-dimensional model into decoupled model form, demonstrating the proposed transformation&#39;s effectiveness.},

Furthermore, the singularity at the zero characteristic root is scrutinised, leading to what we call the stationary root boundary (SRB) in the domain of the delays. With these, we resort to the Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots (CTCR) paradigm to determine the complete stability map of the system with the complete knowledge of the KOH and SRB.

  abstract     = {The explicit model predictive control (EMPC) generates the rules of control defined for a set of polyhedral regions. Online EMPC calculations consist of searching a look-up table to find the appropriate control law according to a particular state. This paper discusses the complexity of online computation and the memory required to store data in an EMPC implementation. Therefore, a new reshaping method is applied to the active regions so that the definition of the polyhedron has regular boundaries. This approach has made some improvements. First, the usable memory will be a lot less for the actual implementation compared to the traditional EMPC approach. Second, the small number of new clusters reduces search time in explicit lookup tables and speeds up overall implementation. To this end, fuzzy clustering is used to introduce a novel method of transforming polyhedrons in the context of fuzzy explicit model predictive (FEMPC) control, followed by a new fuzzy-based piece-wise affine (PWA) explicit formulation for control law calculations. The stability of the proposed method is investigated using the Lyapunov stability criteria. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) benchmark system and simulation tests show that the proposed approach involves a compromise between storage space requirements and online efficiency.},

The proposed method is evaluated in terms of induced ℒ 2 L 2 L2 -gain (or so-called ℋ ∞ H ∞ H∞ norm) to be robust to disturbances, sensor noises and uncertainties on the premise variables. Unlike the common approaches reported in the literature that consider exact premise variables, this work deals with the problem of unmeasured premises. The main results of this paper illustrate that stability and performance conditions can be evaluated by examining the feasibility of parametrised sets of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The proof of stability is based on the non-linear sector approach of the closed loop under Lyapunov conditions, L 2 norm and system transformations. The result is a control structure with only one parameter tuned via simple conditions. The performance and applicability of the proposed approach are illustrated through numerical simulations of an academic example.},

Afterwards, the initial heuristic iterative method is further improved by piecewise Lyapunov-like functions, arriving at a refined heuristic iterative method.

The state dynamics of the system are not always directly measurable, so that a system states are reconstructed by constructing a periodic piecewise observer system to get the required result. Subsequently, the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional by the decomposition of periodic positive-definite matrices is built and in conjunction with convex optimisation technique and extended Wirtinger&#39;s integral inequality, the sufficient conditions are derived to assure the finite-time boundedness of the closed-loop system. In particular, the corresponding periodic piecewise time-varying controller and observer gain matrices can be obtained as solutions to a set of derived sufficient linear matrix inequality-based conditions.

When a fault occurs, it needs to be located quickly and accurately to avoid more significant losses. Due to the wide application of distributed generation in the distribution network, many traditional methods are no longer applicable. Thus, a fast and high fault tolerance method is urgently needed to solve the complex fault location problem of the distribution network. According to the logical and algebraic relationship of fault location, a linear integer programming model for fault section location of the distribution network is established. This paper adopts a new method for solving integer programming, called the fixed-point iterative method. This method has unique advantages in dealing with such large-scale problems and is easily realised through distributed computing, thereby saving time. Finally, through MATLAB experimental simulation, results show that the integer programming method can quickly locate the fault and has high fault tolerance.},

  abstract     = {The design of recursive estimation algorithms in networked systems is an important research challenge from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The growing number of application fields are demanding the development of new mathematical models and algorithms that accommodate the effect of the unavoidable network-induced uncertainties. Special relevance have transmission delays and packet dropouts, which may yield a significant degradation in the performance of conventional estimators. This paper discusses the distributed fusion estimation problem in a class of linear stochastic uncertain systems whose measurement noises are cross-correlated and coupled with the process noise. The uncertainty of the system is not only described by additive noises, but also by multiplicative noise in the state equation and random parameter matrices in the measurement model. Both one-step delays and packet dropouts can randomly occur during the transmission of the sensor measurements to the local processors and a compensation strategy based on measurement prediction is used. Under the least-squares criterion and using an innovation approach, a recursive algorithm for the local filtering estimators is designed. These local estimators are then fused at a processing centre, where the distributed fusion filter is generated as the least-squares matrix-weighted linear combination of the local ones.},

Such a fractional term plays an important role in achieving prescribed-time stabilisation. Next, the analysis of the prescribed-time stabilisation with state constraints is presented.

Simple and analytical adjusting rules are followed to determine the parameters of the I-PD controller and the lead/lag filter according to desired robustness specified by maximum sensitivity (Ms).

The desired reference signals are allowed to be time-varying. Using appropriate transformations, the considered system is transformed into a new interconnected system with an appropriate structure to facilitate the sliding surface design and the decentralised control design. A set of conditions is proposed to guarantee that the designed controller drives the tracking errors onto the sliding surface. The sliding motion exhibited by the error dynamics is uniformly ultimately bounded. The developed results are applied to a river quality control problem. Simulation results show that the proposed decentralised control strategy is effective and feasible.},

The nonlinear terms have incremental rates which include nonlinear functions of output and polynomials of output multiplying unknown constants. By introducing an observer, and two classes of particular dual adaptive high-gains and a class of exclusive constant high-gains, an output feedback controller is developed to stabilise the MIMO nonlinear system. The designed controller is able to tolerate uncertain measurement errors with a relatively wide range. Finally, some simulations are provided to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

First, in order to ensure the saturation independence of two controllers in the nonzero-sum game problem, we adopt two different boundaries to constrain them respectively. Then, a novel triggering condition is designed to reduce the update times of the controllers, which achieves the purpose of less calculation. It is emphasised that the triggering condition is established based on the iteration of the time-triggered mechanism. Meanwhile, we prove that the real cost function possesses a predetermined upper bound, which realises the cost guarantee of the controlled system. In addition, we prove that the closed-loop system using the developed algorithm is asymptotically stable and that the system state and the sampling state are uniformly ultimately bounded during the process of training neural networks.

Based on this, 98 SMA-related studies in the Web of Science were retrieved, selected, and identified. The two main review vectors were advanced versions of SMAs and application domains. First, we counted and analysed various advanced versions of SMAs, summarised, classified, and discussed their improvement methods and directions. Secondly, we sort out the application domains of SMA and analyse the role, development status, and shortcomings of SMA in each domain. A survey based on the existing literature shows that SMAs clearly outperform some established metaheuristics in terms of speed and accuracy in handling various benchmark problems and solving multiple realistic optimization problems. This review not only suggests possible future directions in the field but, due to the inclusion of graphical and tabular comparisons of various properties, also provides future researchers with a comprehensive source of information about SMA and advanced versions of SAMs and the scope of adaptation for multiple application domains.},

According to the linear transformation, the problem of H ∞ H ∞ H∞ consensus is converted into a set of H ∞ H ∞ H∞ stability problems. Through the Lyapunov theory, combined with the time-delay interval decomposition method, a less conservative controller design method for the state feedback controller is presented. And the obtained controller can ensure closed-loop multi-agent systems to fulfil the consensus. Utilizing the generalised Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (GKYP) lemma, the sufficient condition is derived for multi-agent systems achieving the H ∞ performance in the finite frequency domain (FFD). Then, via the orthogonal spatial information of the input matrix, the conservativeness of obtained design approach is further declined. Moreover, the design method with less conservativeness is proposed for the dynamic output feedback controller.

  abstract     = {This work discusses the H ∞ state-feedback control issue for a class of state saturated two-dimensional (2-D) Roesser systems under the event-triggered mechanism. Here, the state saturation is considered to cater the practical situation. First, an event-triggered strategy is exploited to make use of resources rationally in the communication network with finite capacity. Based on the Lyapunov method, the sufficient criterion is presented to achieve the desired H ∞ performance of the corresponding closed-loop saturated 2-D system and the existence of event-triggered state-feedback (ET-SF) controller is ensured. Particularly, a positive scalar is introduced to cope with the state saturation term. With the aid of sufficient criterion and cone complementary linearisation (CCL) algorithm, the design problem of ET-SF controller can further be transformed into seeking the feasible solution to linear matrix inequalities. Eventually, a simulation example is implemented to reveal the usefulness of the presented control scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop the moment and almost-sure stability with a general decay rate for stochastic functional differential equations with semi-Markovian switching signal (SFDESMS). We first present a new equivalent concept of moment stability with general decay rate and its implication to almost-sure stability with general decay rate. Subsequently, using the present equivalent concept and implication relationship, we formulate some explicit sufficient criteria of the moment and almost sure stability with general decay rate for SFDESMS. In addition, we consider the application of our results to two special classes of SFDESMS and obtain the moment and almost-sure stability with general decay rate for two special classes of SFDESMS. At last, we illustrate the obtained theoretical results by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of trajectory tracking for a quadcopter subject to parametric uncertainties and disturbances. Using the backstepping technique and ignoring parametric uncertainties and disturbances, a nominal controller is proposed for the quadcopter. In order to ensure that the controller is adaptive to parametric uncertainties (i.e. unknown but constant mass and tensor of inertia) and external disturbances, an exponentially stable estimator is designed based on the Kalman–Bucy filter. The closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of the plant, the controller, and the estimator is such that the backstepping error is uniformly ultimately bounded. Furthermore, simulation and experimental results are presented, validating the stability and robustness properties of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the input-to-state stability (ISS) and the finite-time input-to-state stability issues for the discrete-time stochastic switched nonlinear systems with time-varying delay. Based on the improved vector-version comparison principle and by employing the stochastic analysis method, sufficient conditions are first derived to guarantee the discrete-time stochastic switched system to be finite-time input-to-state stable in mean and finite-time stochastic input-to-state stable. Then, the comparison principle is further utilised to establish the p -th moment ISS result. As an application, the mean-square ISS is analysed for the linear discrete-time stochastic switched system. At the end of the paper, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the feasibility/effectiveness of the obtained results.},
