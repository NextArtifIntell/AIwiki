  abstract     = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is becoming a promising platform, in which Sensor Nodes (SNs) can sense and monitor the physical or environmental conditions and send the data to the Base Station (BS) through multi-hop routing. Here, opting for the right Cluster Head Selection (CHS) is the key to enhancing the clustering routing protocol performance. Here, a new optimization model to prolong the lifetime of the network and progress the energy efficiency in the routing process is anticipated. The Serial Exponential Newton Meta heuristic algorithm (SExpNMA) is developed for CHS and routing. The parameters like energy, Link Lifetime (LLT), and delay, are considered as the fitness function of the proposed SExpNMA to select the optimal solution. Ultimately, the performance analysis clearly reveals that the SExpNMA technique attains the maximum residual energy of 0.515 J, LLT of 0.346, the throughput of 0.617, and minimum delay of 0.236 s, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Workload balancing in cloud computing continues to be a significant topic, notably within the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) paradigm. Site or web service being overcrowded or underloaded impairs the waiting times or culminates in a system malfunction, and it is indeed an issue that need not happen with cloud storage. To overcome such issues, a suitable access schedule should be devised, allowing the organization to spread work and overall resources available, a process known as load balancing. As a response, a unique multi-objective load balancing framework is presented in this research for optimum load balancing in the cloud. The suggested multi-objective load balancing paradigm considers power usage, bandwidth consumption, migration costs, memory usage, and load balancing parameters (Response time, Turnaround time, Server load). A novel hybrid optimization technique-Mouse Customized Golden Eagle Optimization (MCGEO) model is developed for optimal load balancing, which is conceptual combination of traditional Golden Eagle Optimizer (GEO) and Cat and Mouse-Based Optimizer (CMBO). Therefore, the newly developed hybrid optimization model improves convergence and addresses the optimization problems in load balancing. The proposed MCGEO achieved a throughput value of ∼281.6255, at 150 tasks for the cloud environment-2 this proves the superiority of the proposed approach.},

On the other hand, the analysis of VH meets a lot of complexities when it comes to investigation, including network modeling that was very complex owing to the diversity in topology. This article aims to present a VH method by means of graph theory. At first, the improved k-partite graph is exploited to model the VH issues in HetNets. Second, improved Dijkstra’s algorithm (DA) is deployed for choosing the best path. Further, the analytic hierarchy process is used for estimating the adaptive weights among nodes. Accordingly, optimal selection of weights in DA is performed depending on a hybridized model named as grey wolf upgraded CSO. Ultimately, several metrics such as throughput, packet jitter, and delay and packet losses indicate that the created strategy is efficient.},

Furthermore, employing data acquisition and supervisory control to predict wind turbine power may not result in the best governing approach, as non-calibrated data may be generated due to sensor degradation. Hence, to solve the adverse impact, it’s planned to incorporate the wind turbine Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data into the improved optimization based NN, resulting in the development of a highly accurate prediction model. Thus, SCADA data of the wind turbine such as active power, bearing shaft, gear box shearing, gear box oil temperature, generator rpm, generator windings 1 and 2, hub temperature, reactive power, rotor rpm and wind speed are fed as input features to the predictive model. In order to achieve better prediction, the NN will be trained by using a new Coefficient Factor Updated Coyote Optimization Algorithm (CFU-COA), which is the conceptual advancement of traditional Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA). Finally, the supremacy of the presented approach is proved with respect to varied error measures.},

Regenerative braking is an important method for extending the battery durability of EVs by lowering idle charge time. In regenerative braking, the kinetic energy created during braking is converted into electrical energy and returned to the storage device as charging power. This study offers a method for calculating regenerative braking force (RBF) using a special optimized artificial neural network (ANN) model RBF. The vehicle controller is then optimized via the Improved Wild Horse Optimization Algorithm (IWHO), allowing for maximum energy collection in Electric automobiles without requiring any architectural changes. MATLAB is used to validate the suggested method for the predefined driving schedule Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). The performance of the ANN is evaluated using the error functions mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The suggested methodology’s simulation results are compared to the ANN with traditional algorithms such as Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm (GWO), Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), FireFly Optimization Algorithm (FF), and Wild Horse Optimization Algorithm (WHO).},

  abstract     = {Routing is the key issue for Vehicular Networks since each node in the network has mobility. The dynamic nature of vehicular networks increases with mobility and the consequence is reflected in controlling traffic overhead. As a result, the routing technique and the type of node mobility information are completely dependent on building dependable end-to-end communication links. To address these challenges, a Reliable Cluster-based Multi-Hop Cooperative Routing (RCCR) strategy was proposed by using velocity, distance, and link quality parameters. This algorithm obtains the tradeoff between Quality of Service (QoS) and mobility constraints over link parameters. It improves routing scalability by electing cluster heads and selecting Multi-Point Relays (MPRs) while considering mobility constraints and QoS needs. The proposed technique determines the link quality for every pair of nodes based on values of signal strength and distance parameters. The relay vehicles are chosen based on the highest possible QoS value, which is calculated to assure route stability, reliability, and durability. The heuristic limitations of the multi-point relay selection strategy are handled by considering the link quality, distance from the source vehicle, and cluster-head coverage area to enhance the performance of the multi-hop network with tolerable End-to-End transmission delay. Further, we obtained an optimal number of cooperative vehicles in every hop. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to other state of art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Adopting learning management systems to support teaching has become the norm in education field. Therefore, huge amount of data about the learning history of students has been accumulated. Educators, therefore, can use data mining techniques to evaluate students’ learning performance. Fuzzy association rule mining is one of the techniques used to investigate the correlation between teaching means or students’ characteristics and their performance. For instance, the rule Gender = Male∧Attendance = Low∧Final Report = Middle→Semester = Middle states that a student’s semester grade is in Middle if his gender is male, attendance rate is Low, and final report score is Middle, where Middle and Low are predetermined linguistic terms given by educators. The information shown in this example reveals general and concise knowledge for educators, allowing them to adjust their teaching strategies and pedagogies. However, no studies, to our knowledge, have yet to assess changes by applying this type of rule in the education field. For example, say that the above rule became available in the last semester; however, is not a trend this semester, and has been substituted by “Gender = Female∧Attendance = High∧Final Report = Middle→Semester = Middle”. Without updates in knowledge and belief, educators might adopt inappropriate teaching strategies and pedagogies for students who are learning in different time-periods. To deal with this problem, this study proposes a change mining model to detect changes in students’ learning performance. We also carry out experiments to evaluate the proposed model. We empirically demonstrate how the model helps educators to understand the changing characteristics of students and to improve their teaching practice.},

This study aims to increase the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing the disease and to reveal the patterns that enable early diagnosis of the disease by focusing on the pre-processing stages. The proposed hybrid model includes &quot;filling in missing values ​​with KNN&quot;, &quot;examining six different normalization methods for normalization&quot; and &quot;removing outliers with K-means&quot; in the pre-processing stage. In the data classification stage, four algorithms C4.5, SVM, Naïve Bayes and KNN were examined and the best hybrid model was found. The performance evaluation of these models is based on accuracy. The results were compared with previous studies and had higher accuracy of 98.3% and 99.1% for (KNN + n5 + K-means + SVM) and (KNN + n4/n3 + K-means + KNN), respectively.

  abstract     = {Delay tolerant network is a boon in emergency fields like flood and war zones. The data gathered by the sensor nodes is transmitted whenever any aggregator node comes in contact with those stationary sensor nodes. However, few nodes can behave differently and don&#39;t transmit the information. These nodes which don&#39;t take part in communication to preserve it&#39;s battery or are compromised are selfish nodes and have to be identified to avoid communication disruption. This article discusses the selfish node&#39;s detection schemes and proposes a novel hybrid scheme. Most of the recent schemes work with on node&#39;s reputation or incentives if it takes part in communication. This paper has proposed an incentivized reputation scheme that first clusters the nodes using their social features, calculates the weighted social tie as their social connection strength and updates the weighted social tie by applying reward or penalty. The incentive is offered if residual energy and packet delay has a tradeoff or are penalized. A new modularized deep nonnegative matrix deep autoencoder is developed to calculate the reputation of nodes using social features and named IRU-mDANMF (incentivized reputation update by modularized DANMF). The scheme has been experimented with in several scenarios and is performing significantly better than state-of-the-art schemes.},

Twitter being an open application programming interface is vulnerable to attacks from fake accounts. Fake accounts are primarily used for advertising and marketing, defamation of an individual, consumer data acquisition, increasing fake blog or website traffic, sharing wrong information, online fraud, and control. Fake accounts are disruptive to both users and service providers, thus it&#39;s critical to recognize and filter out such information on social media. This paper presents a technique for detecting fake Twitter accounts using the feature set mapped to Twitter’s rules and policies to flag suspicious accounts. To choose the apt subset of features from the original feature space, feature selection techniques such as information gain and correlation were used. Users have been classified using a Logistic Regression classifier with the detection accuracy of 93.5 percent after being trained on the data of about 1,00,000 Twitter users. Furthermore, an algorithm for classifying suspicious users as Fake profiles has been presented. The results of the experiments show that the suggested model outperforms competitive state-of-the-art research in the majority of circumstances.},

  abstract     = {The use of Brushless-DC (BLDC) motor drives in many industrial settings has grown in recent years. In an ideal situation, the torque generated via BLDC motors with a trapezoidal back electromotive force (BEMF) remains unchanged. But, in actuality, the generated torque is distorted by torque ripples (TRs). These TRs make it essential that variable-speed drives operate smoothly. Power electronic switches are used by BLDC motors during commutation, which causes harmonics within the armature current. Sliding-mode control (SMC) is parameter-resistant and dynamic. SMC design involves reaching and sliding. SMC flaws include chattering. A reduced discontinuous gain control policy may strengthen this problem. The controller’s dynamic responsiveness will degrade. The standard SMC strategy’s indefinite converging rate for error to zero lowers dynamic reaction time. For the SMC to converge indefinitely, an adaptive strategy in fuzzy-based SMC (hybrid control technique) is developed to control the TRs in BLDC motor drives. In a BLDC motor, the recommended controller is used to regulate the harmonics as well as the speed. Based on modeling with MATLAB and observations on an operational 3 kW BLDC motor, the suggested approach is beneficial in the lowering of torque waves and current harmonics. The findings reported here support the efficiency of the suggested approach.},

This agent is first set up to keep track of the resource load resulting from the request that has been assigned a job. Cloud watch also keeps an eye on energy levels to determine the typical payload size of resource execution. The TLB establishes new instance state to assign the resource based on the payload weight. To shorten the execution time, the dynamic hyper switching model develops a balancing mechanism. The suggested system achieves high performance in resource management by creating load balancer that is efficiently targeted to cut down on computation time and cost depending on energy levels. In comparison to existing techniques, the suggested parallelized homogeneous job in the cloud environment produces greater performance up to 95.5% while maintaining the time execution utilizing switching state of execution. This maintains the reduced CPU consumption, which dependent on the lowering of temporal complexity.},

  abstract     = {The hybrid solar/wind power systems are the best renewable energy sources because of their complementary nature. The generation of electricity from wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is greatly reliant on the weather. Their intermittent nature causes output fluctuations. As a result, the need for rapid compensation for energy transmission and distribution systems is becoming increasingly critical. In this article, an optimal parameterized Fractional Order Proportional Integral Derivative (FOPID) controller for a hybrid renewable energy system integrated with a single-phase grid. An amalgamation of solar PV and wind is presented as a way to provide continuous power from alternate sources. Furthermore, it is planned to design a robust output voltage management system that utilizes a FOPID controller for the output voltage regulation of the hybrid system integrated with the grid. A novel Randomly Updated Path Finder Algorithm (RU-PF) is proposed to optimize the FOPID gains. Hence, the proposed FOPID-based control for the single-phase grid connected to PV and wind system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, and their performance is examined. In particular, the fitness of the proposed RU-PF algorithm is 5.06%, 1.32%, 7.41%, and 0.88% superior to the extant PSO, FF, WOA, and PFA algorithms at the 25th iteration.},

An optimal Direct Current (DC)-DC Bi-directional Buck-Boost Converter (BBBC) with a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is used for the optimal flow of power from the energy source to the drive during EV acceleration. The regenerative braking energy is allowed to return through the same bidirectional converter and retained in the Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) during the deceleration mode. A novel optimization is attained in the converter controller circuit using a Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) and Adaptive Aquila Optimization Algorithm (AAqOA). The proposed strategy is validated using the results compared to conventional algorithms. In particular, the settling time of the suggested AAqOA model is 55.44%, 96.94%, 97.03%, and 91.87% better than the extant PI, DA, SSA, and AOA methods, respectively.},

For this optimal selection, the adopted model named as Grey Wolf Insisted Inertia-based Path finder Algorithm is used. To determine the best location of the UPQC device, the suggested model focuses on the cost of UPQC, power losses, and voltage stability index. Further, the presented concept was implemented using IEEE 69 and IEEE 33 bus networks and the proposed model’s performance was compared to that of other traditional approaches with respect to minimum fitness value. Accordingly, for a 50% loading scenario, the proposed model is 0.30%, 0.20%, 0.348%, 0.277%, and 0.105% better than PF, GWO, GM-DA, DA, and GA schemes. Likewise, in convergence analysis for 100th iteration, the suggested approach reaches the least value of 536.80. Therefore, it is evident that the proposed PF-GWO algorithm is more efficient than existing models with lower convergence rates.

Multi- objectives are achieved by optimizing the location as well as size of Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices in the test bus system.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an ANN-based framework for forecasting the daily solar irradiance with the meteorological data collected over 10 years for Hisar city, located in Haryana. Meteorological information like temperature, relative humidity, and average wind speed is used as input variables for estimating sun irradiation in order to obtain high accuracy under various weather situations. Meteorological information is used as input variables for estimating the solar irradiation in order to obtain acceptable accuracy in a variety of weather circumstances. In addition, it was suggested in this paper that the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model be trained using the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) Algorithm. The following task is to choose the best solar panel (SP) out of the thousands that are currently on the market. Due to a crucial component like weather, choosing the finest SP is important. Hence, this paper introduces a score-based model for selecting the best panel by considering the different criteria of the eleven SPs that are used as test panels. The annual power produced by panel P11 is 79.67% better than panel P1. Finally, based on the average power generated, the proposed panel P11 is regarded as the best panel when compared to other panels.},

  abstract     = {Numerous factors are causing wireless networks to carry an increasing volume of traffic, which is developing quickly. The 5 G mobile networks target a variety of new used cases that consist of more heterogeneous devices linked with similar frameworks. Moreover, the most frequent and fastest-growing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, targets the developing computational network infrastructures worldwide. This makes the development of an effective and early detection for massive, complex DDoS attacks necessary. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present a unique DDoS attack detection model for 5 G networks that consists of two phases: feature extraction and attack detection. Here, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) &amp; Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classifiers are combined to perform the detection. The Opposition Learning-based Seagull Optimization Algorithm (OLSOA) model optimizes the weight of the RNN for better accurate detection. A correctly trained hybrid model produces a detected output that is more accurate. Finally, the outcomes of the adopted strategy are calculated about various metrics using conventional approaches. Particularly, the adopted work’s accuracy at node = 10000 outperforms the existing DCNN, RNN, LSTM, Hybrid classifier + WOA, Hybrid classifier + MFO, and Hybrid classifier + SOA methods by 10.8%, 8.33%, 16%, 27.08%, 17.02%, and 5.01%.},

This study offers Ensemble methods for Cloud-based Network Intrusion Detection and Classification. The main means through which Ensemble Learning enhances each Machine Learning result Using algorithms and a strong classifier. In starting, the redundant data is removed from the collected raw data and the data cleaning is performed as the pre-processing phase. From these pre-processed data, modified holoentropy, correntropy, information gain, and statistical features are extracted. An ensemble technique that uses models like the neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and optimized deep belief network (DBN) performs the final detection of the presence or absence of attacks. The process of fine-tuning is supervised, and in order to increase the training’s accuracy, the weights received from the RBM pre-training are modified. A new hybrid model called Moth Logarithmic Assisted Deer Hunting Optimization performs this fine-tuning (MLADHO). The conceptual fusion of the traditional Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) and the Deer Hunting Optimization Algorithm (DHO) yields the suggested algorithm. Finally, both the algorithmic and classifier evaluation is performed by comparing the suggested over conventional methods.},

Furthermore, to offer trustworthy routing, the trust score is calculated using a variety of trust variables, including direct and indirect trust. A novel hybrid optimization model—Beet swarm Induced Tunicate swarm Algorithm (BITA), which is a conceptual hybridization of Beetle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (BSO) and Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), is used to achieve this optimal selection of Cluster Head (CH) based on multi-objective. In addition, the multi-hop communication between the CHs is chosen from among the available options based on the shortest distance.

Thus, the optimal centroids are further processed for k-means clustering, and the optimal clustered data is attained.

  abstract     = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has made widespread testing a need for controlling the disease. Numerous recent investigations have shown that many people with COVID-19 show no outward signs of illness. As a result, these patients are more likely to unwittingly spread the virus because they will not take a COVID-19 test. In order to get tested, patients will need to travel to a lab, putting others at risk of exposure. Recent studies have shown that people with COVID-19 who are asymptomatic have distinctive coughs and breathing patterns compared to the general population. This prompted the study of cough and breath sounds in COVID-19 patients as a means of differentiating them from those of non-COVID lung infection patients and the general population. In this article, we present a robust, efficient, and extensible method for identifying symptomatic patterns in biological audio signals. Cough digitized audio files are subjected to spectral analysis via a stationary wavelet transform (SWT). The proposed model employs ADASYN technique to handle the class imbalance problem. Also, features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), log frame energies, zero crossing rate (ZCR), and kurtosis are extracted. For classification process, deep belief network (DBN) model is utilized. Finally, mayfly optimization (MFO) algorithm is exploited for optimal hyper-parameter tuning of the DBN model. The experimental validation of the proposed model takes place using open access dataset. Proposed method is compared with other methods in terms accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-Score, precision and recall. The experimental outcomes demonstrated the betterment of the proposed model over other recent state of art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble clustering combines the results of multiple individual clustering methods for better results. Basically, all available clustering methods can be combined to produce final clusters. However, selecting a subset of optimal methods can reduce the complexity and increase the efficiency of ensemble clustering methods. This article examines the problem of selecting individual clustering methods to produce an ensemble hierarchical clustering method. Hierarchical clustering is a technique for grouping data at different scales by creating dendrograms. The aim is to select a subset of individual hierarchical clustering methods considering diversity and quality that can create an ensemble clustering method with minimal complexity. The proposed method consists of three main phases. The selection of a subset of individual hierarchical clustering methods is done in the first phase. In the second phase, the results of the selected clusters are re-clustered to create super-clusters. Super-clusters can combine clustering knowledge of different methods into one clustering form. Finally, the final clusters are formed by assigning each sample to a super-cluster with the shortest distance in the third phase. Experimental results on several datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Therefore, in the present work, an electrical analogous model of the practical environment is simulated for investigation by considering several effects, namely imperfect insulation, density, viscosity, and compressibility. Further, to check the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the controller performance using the EMFO algorithm is compared with the performance using the original MFO algorithm. The validation results show a substantial improvement in the case of EMFO-based controller with an online tuning method in comparison to MFO-based controller. EMFO algorithm exhibits superior performance as it combines the benefits of three modifications (change the spiral path, opposition learning-based initialization, and change in flames selection) in the original MFO algorithm. Furthermore, the system is also investigated for the effect of system dynamics and process disturbance. It is concluded that the developed EMFO algorithm gives superior performance in a simulated real environment paving the way for possible implementation in practical situations.},

In this context, modern autonomous systems are capable to semantically recognize and separate entities from camera measurements, while effectively interprete and interact with their environment in a higher level. Extending this notion, the semantic representation of the surroundings, based on satellite and ground-level data, is considered a fundamental property for self-localization, especially in the absence of any georeferencing signal. Keeping that in mind, in this article, we present a robust algorithm to locate the position of an autonomous vehicle within a georeferenced map using graph-based descriptors with semantic and metric information from both its memory and query measurements. In particular, an enhanced prerecorded satellite map is processed to compute semantic memories, whilst ground-level query views are used as a means to identify similarities and extrapolate the location of a moving vehicle. The above components are evaluated under an extensive set of experiments, revealing the robustness and accuracy of our final robot localization system.},

Here, a new converted decision matrix has been introduced which overcomes some delusions of the proposed method by Kumar and Chen. Then the probability density functions have been defined based on the converted decision matrix. From this probability density functions the mean value and the standard deviation for each alternative has been derived. Using these mean and standard deviation the z-score decision matrix has been derived. The transform weight for each alternative has been derived from the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy weight vales. Finally, the ranking order has been derived from the transformed weight and z-score decision matrix. Some examples also have been considered to compare the proposed method with other existing methods. The proposed method has been applied to a selection of house among some houses with different criteria.

Malware detection systems are facing new challenges due to the volume, velocity, and complexity of malware. The current malware detection system relies on a time-consuming, resource-intensive, and knowledge-intensive classification approach. Most of the existing malware detection system is ineffective in detecting novel malware attacks. A deep learning approach can be used to build a malware detection system that can effectively detect novel malware attacks without much human intervention. The current circumstance necessitates not just a malware system with excellent accuracy, but also one that can serve a large volume of demand in near real-time. A scalable malware detection system capable of detecting complex attacks is the need of time. This article discusses a scalable and distributed deep learning approach for malware detection using convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM). The deep learning approach has been used to make the system learn and make predictive decisions without human intervention. The performance of the deep learning approach depends on various parameters and training data sets. Hence, different combinations of deep learning algorithms have been used to design and test the models to achieve the desired result. The experimental results show that the double layer of CNN and BiLSTM has better performance than single-layer CNN.},

  abstract     = {Gesture classification is one of the most emerging domains of today’s era. Among the major applications of gesture classification, sign gesture recognition is considered the core class of this domain. Keeping in mind the specifications of the region and language-based variations, the development of a standard sign gesture classifier is the main objective of today’s research. So far many language translators have been utilized to capture this communication deficiency. Software simulations and hardware prototype-based different models have been implemented using vision-based, sensor-based, and hybrid classifiers. This article focuses on the flex, accelerometer, and gyroscope sensors-based smart prototype which is designed to capture sign gestures. These sensors are placed on a glove to capture and compile digits i.e. 0 to 10, alphabets i.e. A–Z, and alphanumeric i.e. 0–10, A–Z datasets. The main objective of the proposed model is to classify sign gestures, made by deaf–mute individuals and recognize the actual meaning of performed gestures. K-nearest neighbor, discriminant analysis, and support vector machine-based machine learning algorithms are trained on our manually compiled datasets that are succeeded in achieving an average accuracy of 99.18%, 99.03%, and 99.82%, respectively.},

The issue of supplier selection and evaluation in accordance with green and resilient principles has received little attention in the electronic industry. So, the present study aims to consider both criteria of resilience and greenness in a new supplier selection model. This study presents an integrated decision-making method based on the fuzzy set theory and data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach for supplier selection in a supply chain network in an electronic manufacturing company. The fuzzy set theory was used for analyzing suppliers&#39; indicator weights, the suppliers&#39; performance, and rating them with respect to subcriteria. Then, the obtained data were aggregated to classify and prepare them for use in a version assurance region of the DEA method with one dummy input and three output variables to rank the suppliers. The performance of the proposed DEA-based model has been verified through the sensitivity analysis and it has been validated by the existing FIS-based model in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed DEA-based model can be designed with any number of suppliers and criteria and subcriteria.},

  abstract     = {Cybercrime is an online crime committing fraud, stealing identities, violating privacy or hacking the personal information. A high level of information security in banking can be attained through striving to achieve an integrity, confidentiality, availability, assurance, and accountability. This Pandemic situation (COVID-19) paved the way for the customers to avoid traditional ways of banking and adapt to digital transactions. This banking digitalization increases in the utilization of cashless transactions like digital money (Cryptocurrency). Cyber security is imperative to preserve sensitive information, therefore, Blockchain technology has been adapted to provide security. Transactions done via Blockchain are tested through every block, which makes transactions secure and helps the banking system to work faster. The proposed algorithm WFB is used to estimate the average queue rate and avoid unwanted block generation. Then the trapezoidal fuzzy technique optimizes the allocation of blocks. An objective of this investigation is to enhance the security in banking systems from Cybercrimes by verifying Rain Drop Service (RDS) and Fingerprint Biometric without the need of any central authority. Once the service is completed, the service is a dropout and the following new service will be provided (Hence the name RDS). For the strong authentication scheme to fight against bank fraud, RSA encryption technique has been implemented successfully. Therefore, Blockchain technology increases the need for cyber security as a part of design architecture which intends to detect the stemming attacks in real time instead of repairing the damage.},

  abstract     = {Social networks and media have gradually grabbed significant time from people’s lives to share and communicate information. Moreover, these social platforms also act as an emotional catalyst for expressing their feeling and views on different products, movies, and even national policies. Thus, it helps to understand people’s opinions and predict their behaviors in social networks, where it helps the entrepreneur improve their products or services. It is considered the most efficient method to understand the customer’s view on their product better. Since entrepreneurs are increasing exponentially, an intelligent system is required to understand people’s views on their products. Also, people use informal language to express their sentiments; it has become a daunting task to extract the sentiments that reflect the people’s attitude and feedback about the product. Therefore, this article suggests a novel hybrid deep learning system, consisting of bi-convolutional networks (B-CNN) and spotted hyena optimized long short term memory (SHOLSTM), for improved understanding of people’s feelings and the construction of intelligent recommendation systems for entrepreneurs. Many experiments have been conducted utilizing various datasets compared to other current hybrid deep learning methods, including long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), BIGRU, and attention classifiers. Accuracy is achieved as 99.4%, 99% precision, 99.2% recall, 99.2% F1-score is achieved, which suits these algorithms best for implementing the intelligent recommendation systems based on the different ensembled sentiments.},

  abstract     = {Among common tasks in natural language processing (NLP) domain, text classification is considered as an important primitive task which is widely applied in multiple disciplines. Recent advanced deep learning-based architectures such as sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) with attention mechanism have demonstrated remarkable improvements in multiple NLP’s tasks, including classification. However, recent seq2seq-based models still encounter challenges related to the limitation in effectively capturing long-range dependent relationships between words in a text corpus. Recent integrated graph neural network and textual graph transformer (TGT)-based models have demonstrated significant improvements in preserving the structural n-hop co-occurring relationships between words in a given text corpus. However, these models still suffer problems related to the thorough considerations on the sequential and contextual relations of words within a single document’s graph. To meet these challenges, in this article we proposed a novel semantic-enhanced graph transformer-based textual representation learning approach, called as: SemTGT. Our proposed SemTGT can support to effectively learn both local rich-contextual and global long-range structural latent representations of texts for leveraging the performance of classification task. Extensive experiments in standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SemTGT model in comparing with recent seq2seq-based and textual graph embedding-based baselines.},

The system recommends useful and satisfactory products (items) such as books, music, jokes, and movies for targeting users based on their interest. The content-based filtering as well as collaborative are different systems used often while designing the RS that predicts the recommended item(s) based upon the user preferences. However, the collaborative filtering algorithm provides poor performance for data sparsity, and it is complex for tracking the change of user interest. Moreover, the hybrid system has combined both the techniques in multiple ways to overcome the shortcomings and optimize the outcomes. Thereby, this article plans to develop a new hybrid recommender system assisting with the optimization concept for optimal recommendation list based on user preference or interest. At first, the feature extraction process takes place, in which the content features and the collaborative features are extracted based on (a) profile construction, (b) content similarity index, (c) Neighbor finder, (d) Items generator, and (e) Items weight generator and variance generator. Consequently, the optimal recommendation is carried out on the basis of features extracted. Further, the developed work plans to carry out the optimal rating of recommendation using a FireFly with Weighted Crow Search Algorithm (FF-WCSA). At last, the outcomes of the developed model is computed to extant approaches in terms of various metrics like accuracy, FDR, MAE, MARE, MSE, MSRE, RMSE, and RMSRE, respectively.},

This does protect our right to freedom of speech, however the enormous reach of social media makes it a potential tool for widespread radicalization among the youth, irrespective of the geographical and demographical boundaries. This necessitates the need to effectively identify the content which is a source of mass online radicalization. In order to curb the propagation, security agencies need an automatic radicalization detection mechanism for mining the huge volumes of social media content. In this article, we propose an approach for detecting online radicalized accounts and quantifying the degree to which these user accounts are propagating radical content. We propose to use three novel features, i.e., Similarity to domain, presence of radical content and sentiment to calculate the radicalness score for each online user. Our algorithm uses a CNN-LSTM-based technique to effectively differentiate between radical/non-radical content with an accuracy of 93%. Our empirical results show that radicalness scores for known radicalized websites are higher as compared to the non-radical users. We believe this is a first ever attempt at quantifying the level of radicalization of users using scientific methods which can be very helpful to national security agencies in tracking suspicious online users and stop the spread of anti-national content on social media.},

Several factors may result in the high number of accidents among which we can state the driving behavior. This paper focused on the study of drivers’ behavior and aimed to help reduce the number of accidents and consequently improve road safety. To this end, the driving behavior was classified into three categories (normal, drowsy and aggressive) based on smartphone sensors data. A new stacked Long Short-Term Memory (stacked LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks architecture was proposed for the driving behaviors classification. The accuracy of the obtained drivers’ states results was improved with the use of the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory of belief functions that overcame the uncertainty of data. The obtained results are clearly better than those existing in other driving behavior classification studies since the obtained F1-measure score achieves 97%.},

Among these surfaces, the wing is the main contributor to the force which lifts the aircraft enabling the flight. However, the application of this force out of the center of gravity generates a moment that must be balanced through a force applied in the Horizontal-Tail-Plane (HTP) reaching the longitudinal trim of the aircraft. Traditionally, the design of the wing and HTP have been performed iteratively attaining suboptimal or time ineffective results. In this paper, we solve this problem through the application of a Genetic Algorithm for the combined optimization of the wing and the HTP by adjusting the aspect ratio, the taper ratio, the twist angle and the incidence angle of both surfaces to produce the optimal balance of lift adjusting its distribution to an elliptical configuration and enabling the longitudinal trim. Results show the automatic adjustment of the parameters of the aerodynamic surfaces thus fulfilling the objectives of this paper.},

  abstract     = {In this research, a coevolutionary collision free multi-robot path planning that makes use of A* is proposed. To find collision-free paths for all robots, we generate a route for each of robot using A* path finding but introducing restrictions for each collision found. Afterward, a co-evolutionary optimization process is implemented for introducing changes in the initial paths to find a combination of routes that is collision-free. The approach has been tested in mazes with increasing the number of robots, showing a robust performance although at high time expenses. Nevertheless, several enhancements are proposed to tackle this issue.},

  abstract     = {As governments access capital, technology, and managerial expertise from private investors, there is an increasing trend of privatizations in infrastructure projects worldwide. Given the large size of these investments, notably in the sector of telecommunications, investors typically create a consortium with other interested firms, an investment vehicle known as private participation project (PPP). Given the critical repercussions on the rest of the economy, and its large financial losses in case of failure, the prediction of the success of PPPs in telecommunications is of utmost importance. The success of PPPs can be predicted by Machine Learning and it is probed in this article. Hence, widely acknowledged classifiers ( k- nearest neighbors [k-NNs], support vector machines [SVMs], and random forest [RF]) are applied to PPPs publicly available data from the World Bank. The results on this highly imbalanced dataset are greatly improved by the application of data balancing techniques. It includes some standard ones (random oversampling, random undersampling, and synthetic minority oversampling technique [SMOTE]), together with some other advanced ones (density-based SMOTE and borderline SMOTE). The satisfactory results validate the proposed application of classifiers on the dataset improved by data-balancing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep learning models proliferate in the prediction of power demand for efficient planning of power consumption. However, the “ black-box ” characteristics of deep learning hinders from establishing a specific plan because it cannot explain the cause of the prediction. Recently, there are several attempts to explain the result of deep learning through the analysis of the input attributes that influence the prediction, but they lack of appropriate explanation because of ignoring the time-series property of the input data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to explain the impact of the input attributes on the prediction by taking account of the long-term and short-term properties of the time-series forecasting. The model consists of (i) two encoders to represent the power information for prediction and explanation, (ii) a decoder to predict the power demand from the concatenated outputs of encoders, and (iii) an explainer to identify the most significant attributes for predicting the energy consumption. Kullback–Leibler divergence in the loss function induces the long-term and short-term dependencies in latent space constructed by the second encoder. Several experiments on the benchmark dataset of household electric energy demand show that the proposed method explains the prediction appropriately with the most influential input attributes in the long-term and short-term dependencies. We can trade off the gain of the time-series explanation of the result against a slight degradation of the prediction performance.},

Therefore, the decision-maker seeks to reduce risks and meet these challenges. The manuscript aims to identify cause-effect relationships between variables affecting countries and changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and propose an algorithm to facilitate decision-making by identifying forgotten effects. The authors use thematic analysis to synthesize the semi-systematic literature review findings. The applied research uses a quantitative approach through modeling and simulation. The results highlight that the pandemic effects are associated with causes such as health care, political and economic stability, social justice, and the level of corruption. Decision-makers must prioritize the management of these variables guided by science. The main contribution is to show an algorithm that identifies forgotten effects in pandemics&#39; socio-economic and health management, preventing future crises. In addition, the study advances the frontier of knowledge by addressing identified gaps and contributes to academia and policy makers. The most critical limitation is the number of variables included in this research. Future investigations could include analyses on the impact of climate change and sustainable development of nations and country-specific studies on the forgotten effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

The results show that there was a positive linear relation between the introduced variables. In this scenario, crime did not affect tourist activity, but tourist activity incited crime.

The proposed PFS-based forecasting method uses Gaussian probability distribution function to assign probabilities to membership grades. Proposed FTS forecasting method uses high-order weighted fuzzy logical relation in which each fuzzy logical relation uses the weight in ascending order. Superiority of proposed method is shown by implementing it on SBI share price at BSE, India and University of Alabama enrollments. Error measures and statistical parameters, for example, coefficient of correlation, coefficient of determination, performance parameter, evaluation parameter and tracking signal are also used to confirm the outperformance and validity of the proposed PFS-based forecasting method.},

On the basis of GM(1,1) model, a new model is established by adding exponential time delay term. The model is discretized by integral, the least square estimation of the linear parameters and the approximate time response equation are obtained. Finally, PSO is used to search the optimal parameters of the model and the experimental results are verified by Wilcoxon rank sum test. In order to test the good adaptability and strong prediction ability of the new model, two groups of data are verified for the production and consumption of oil and electricity in China. The results show that the new model has better prediction accuracy and adaptability than the other existing six grey models.},

Among all types of data, the textual documents are an incredible source of knowledge. In order not to lose track of this rapid development of information diversity, it is necessary to provide schemes that make it possible to filter out and present specific information from this huge amount of textual data. Since then, key-phrase extraction methods have started to gain importance. A key-phrase extraction system provides a selection of relevant data in textual documents based on languages and corresponding extraction rules. To extract the important concepts from the documents, the system should be able to use special features and self-identify properties of the words in the texts and properties of the documents. In this article, we developed and discussed different sets of features which are unrestricted to form, size and organization of the documents, i.e. a novel set of regular, advanced and external knowledge-based features are proposed. To selectively combine the best features from all three sets of features here we deploy the two different automatic feature selection techniques. Four different datasets are used here to evaluate the performance of the individual, combined and best selected features. The dynamic programming-based feature selection approaches significantly improves the performance in contrast to the different feature sets (individual and combined both) and state-of-the-art.},

We propose a single-period newsvendor model with one manufacturer and one retailer in the supply chains. The proposed model considers two variables, including order quantity and investment in corporate social responsibility, where the demand is stochastic and follows a normal standard distribution. The model considers quantity flexibility, advanced purchasing discounts (APDs), and buyback contracts under cooperative conditions. Numerical examples are used to exhibit the applicability of the model under various conditions, including the two-demand distribution and three coordination contracts. We demonstrate an ideal scenario where the APD contracting results in the most overall supply chain profit and increases for each supply chain partner.},

  abstract     = {Nonferrous metals are the basic materials for national economic development. Accurate and robust price forecasting can effectively reduce investment costs and bring greater economic benefits to enterprises. But the violent fluctuation of nonferrous metal prices and the evolution of irregular cycles make metal price prediction difficult. A nonferrous metal price prediction model based on improved complementary ensemble empirical mode (ICEEMDAN) decomposition, a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization gated recurrent neural network (GRU) and an integrated autoregressive moving average model (ARIMA) is proposed. First, ICEEMDAN is used to decompose the original metal price series, and then fuzzy entropy is applied to judge the complexity of confusion of the decomposed subsequence. An ARIMA model is used to predict the sequence with the minimum fuzzy entropy, and the other subsequences are predicted by the Bayesian hyperparametric optimization GRU in this article. Finally, the prediction results are integrated to obtain the final prediction results of the original price series. To verify the reliability and practicability of the model in this article, different lengths of daily futures price series of zinc, aluminum, copper and gold prices on the London Metal Exchange and the Investing are used as the research data, three experiments utilizing 5 groups of metal price data and 10 comparison models are designed to verify the superiority of the proposed model. The results show that: (i) Bayesian hyperparameter optimization can improve the prediction performance of a single model effectively. The hybrid method with fuzzy entropy can effectively improve the prediction accuracy. (ii) The proposed model outperforms the compared state-of-the art models in three-step metal prices forecasting.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a three-staged approach to data envelopment analysis (DEA) modeling for hospital efficiency. The approach aims to overcome the constraint on the number of inputs/outputs relative to the number of DMUs. Initially, the principal components of all inputs and outputs are determined using principal component analysis (PCA). Next, these principal components enter a factor analysis (FA) process to construct a two-level hierarchy of inputs/outputs and to establish a weighting scheme based on explained variances of components. Finally, a two-level DEA (TLDEA) method is applied to the resultant framework to determine the relative efficiency of hospitals using data from the healthcare context of Iran as an emerging economy. The outcomes of applying the proposed PCA-FA-TLDEA approach are argued to offer a substantial increase in the discriminatory power of classical DEA methods and could incorporate a relatively large set of inputs/outputs already existing in the hospital efficiency literature. As demonstrated in the evaluated hospitals, the PCA-FA-TLDEA methodology improved the discrimination from 0% in the original DEA to 45%. The paper proposes a novel three-stage DEA model by using PCA to extract the principal components from the inputs and outputs; therefore, reducing the number of inputs and outputs and their inter-correlations. Secondly, a hierarchy of inputs and outputs by applying FA to the principal components is constructed. Finally, the TLDEA method to the hierarchy of inputs and outputs is applied to evaluate the performance of public hospitals.},
