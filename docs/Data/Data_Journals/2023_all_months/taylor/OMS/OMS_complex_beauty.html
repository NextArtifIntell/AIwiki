  abstract     = {Nowadays, the issue of traffic flow assignment has become an interdisciplinary topic that concerns multiple research areas and branches of science. This work is focussed on the mathematical and computational aspects of the equilibrium traffic assignment problem in the case when route flows are considered to be decision variables. Firstly, we obtain a fixed-point mapping with the explicit contraction operator, which is proven to equilibrate the journey times on feasible routes between a single origin-destination pair of nodes with the quadratic rate. Remarkable that from mathematical perspectives, the developed operator generalizes most path-equilibration operators already exploited by researchers. Secondly, we use the obtained fixed-point procedure to run the sequential path-equilibration algorithm for traffic flow assignment on well-known test urban road networks with arc-additive travel time functions. Our computational results appear to demonstrate higher accuracy of user-equilibrium traffic assignment solutions than the best ones known to us. In other words, developed within this paper sequential path-equilibration algorithm leads to solutions with less goal function values compared to the best solutions for today, according to our knowledge.},

Instead of maximizing the sum of all distances between all classes, we will define an objective function that will maximize the minimum separation among all distances between all classes.

This problem can benefit transportation, telecommunication or delivery systems, in which hub nodes are responsible for receiving, collecting and delivering commodities. This paper discusses the multiple allocation hub maximal covering problem (MAHMCP). In this problem, the flow of an origin–destination pair is transferred via multiple hubs such that the total flow covered by located hubs is maximized. We present a new model for the MAHMCP, which has a significantly smaller number of binary variables compared to previous models. The proposed model is theoretically stronger than past models, and an empirical study using the Australia Post (AP) dataset demonstrates its effectiveness. Our experiments show that the new formulation provides high-quality solutions and fast run times for instances up to 100 nodes.},

More precisely, we show that under the convexity of the lower-level problem and either the boundedness of the feasible set or the coercivity of the objective function, the global optimal values of SOS relaxation problems are lower bounds of the global optimal value of the robust bilevel polynomial problem and they converge to this global optimal value when the degrees of SOS polynomials in the relaxation problems tend to infinity. Moreover, an application to an electric vehicle charging scheduling problem with renewable energy sources demonstrates that using the proposed SOS relaxation schemes, we obtain more stable optimal values than applying a direct solution approach as the SOS relaxations are capable of solving these models involving data uncertainties in dynamic charging price and weather conditions.},

Under some suitable conditions, the subsequential convergence of the proposed algorithm is established. And under expectation conditions with the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property, we also prove that the proposed method converges globally.

We analyze an analogous semi-conjugate gradient (SCG) method, a special case of the existing semi-conjugate direction (SCD) methods, for unsymmetric positive definite linear systems. Unlike CG, SCG requires the solution of a lower triangular linear system to produce each semi-conjugate direction. We prove that SCG is theoretically equivalent to the full orthogonalization method (FOM), which is based on the Arnoldi process and converges in a finite number of steps. Because SCG&#39;s triangular system increases in size each iteration, Dai and Yuan [ Study on semi-conjugate direction methods for non-symmetric systems , Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 60(8) (2004), pp. 1383–1399] proposed a sliding window implementation (SWI) to improve efficiency. We show that the directions produced are still locally semi-conjugate. A counter-example illustrates that SWI is different from the direct incomplete orthogonalization method (DIOM), which is FOM with a sliding window. Numerical experiments from the convection-diffusion equation and other applications show that SCG is robust and that the sliding window implementation SWI allows SCG to solve large systems efficiently.},

Different from convex optimization problems on single functions, gradient descent on multiple objectives may not converge to stable fixed points (SFPs). In order to improve learning dynamics in such games, many recently proposed methods utilize the second-order information of the game, such as the Hessian matrix. Unfortunately, these methods often suffer from the enormous computational cost of Hessian, which hinders their further applications. In this paper, we present efficient second-order optimization (ESO), in which only a part of Hessian is updated in each iteration, and the algorithm is derived. Furthermore, we give the local convergence of the method under reasonable assumptions. In order to further speed up the training process of GANs, we propose efficient second-order optimization with predictions (ESOP) using a novel accelerator. Basic experiments show that the proposed learning methods are faster than some state-of-art methods in GANs, while applicable to many other n-player differential games with local convergence guarantee.},

  abstract     = {Nonnegative matrix factorization is the following problem: given a nonnegative input matrix V and a factorization rank K , compute two nonnegative matrices, W with K columns and H with K rows, such that WH approximates V as well as possible. In this paper, we propose two new approaches for computing high-quality NMF solutions using conic optimization. These approaches rely on the same two steps. First, we reformulate NMF as minimizing a concave function over a product of convex cones – one approach is based on the exponential cone and the other on the second-order cone. Then, we solve these reformulations iteratively: at each step, we minimize exactly, over the feasible set, a majorization of the objective functions obtained via linearization at the current iterate. Hence these subproblems are convex conic programs and can be solved efficiently using dedicated algorithms. We prove that our approaches reach a stationary point with an accuracy decreasing as O ( 1 i ) , where i denotes the iteration number. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to provide a convergence rate to stationary points for NMF. Furthermore, in the particular cases of rank-1 factorizations (i.e. K = 1), we show that one of our formulations can be expressed as a convex optimization problem, implying that optimal rank-1 approximations can be computed efficiently. Finally, we show on several numerical examples that our approaches are able to frequently compute exact NMFs (i.e. with V = WH ) and compete favourably with the state of the art.},

Specifically, under a standard network connectivity condition, we show that RFDGM is guaranteed to reach ϵ -accuracy in both optimality and feasibility within O ( 1 ϵ 2 ln ⁡ 1 ϵ ) iterations. Such iteration complexity can be improved to O ( 1 ϵ ln ⁡ 1 ϵ ) if the local objective functions are strongly convex but not necessarily differentiable.

The method analysed allows inexact solution of the subproblems and do not require prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constants related with the problem. When an approximate feasible point is used as starting point, it is shown that the referred method takes at most 𝒪 ( log ( σ − 1 0 ϵ − 2 ) ) O ( log ⁡ ( σ 0 − 1 ϵ − 2 ) ) O(log⁡(σ0−1ϵ−2)) outer iterations to generate an ϵ -approximate KKT point, where σ 0 is the first penalty parameter. For equality constrained problems, this bound yields to an evaluation complexity bound of O ( ϵ − 4 ) , when σ 0 = ϵ − 2 and suitable first-order methods are used as inner solvers. For problems having only linear equality constraints, an evaluation complexity bound of O ( ϵ − ( p + 1 ) / p ) is established when appropriate p -order methods ( p ≥ 2 ) are used as inner solvers.

Expected residual minimization (ERM) is an established model for obtaining a reasonable solution for the SVIP, and its objective function is an expected value of a suitable merit function for the SVIP. However, the ERM is restricted to the case where the distribution is known in advance. We extend the ERM to ensure the attainment of robust solutions for the SVIP under the uncertainty distribution (the extended ERM is referred to as distributionally robust expected residual minimization (DRERM), where the worst-case distribution is derived from the set of probability measures in which the expected value and variance take the same sample mean and variance, respectively).

  abstract     = {In this study, we present a general framework of outer approximation algorithms to solve convex vector optimization problems, in which the Pascoletti-Serafini (PS) scalarization is solved iteratively. This scalarization finds the minimum ‘distance’ from a reference point, which is usually taken as a vertex of the current outer approximation, to the upper image through a given direction. We propose efficient methods to select the parameters (the reference point and direction vector) of the PS scalarization and analyse the effects of these on the overall performance of the algorithm. Different from the existing vertex selection rules from the literature, the proposed methods do not require solving additional single-objective optimization problems. Using some test problems, we conduct an extensive computational study where three different measures are set as the stopping criteria: the approximation error, the runtime, and the cardinality of the solution set. We observe that the proposed variants have satisfactory results, especially in terms of runtime compared to the existing variants from the literature.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale optimization, when either forming or storing Hessian matrices are prohibitively expensive, quasi-Newton methods are often used in lieu of Newton&#39;s method because they only require first-order information to approximate the true Hessian. Multipoint symmetric secant (MSS) methods can be thought of as generalizations of quasi-Newton methods in that they attempt to impose additional requirements on their approximation of the Hessian. Given an initial Hessian approximation, MSS methods generate a sequence of possibly-indefinite matrices using rank-2 updates to solve nonconvex unconstrained optimization problems. For practical reasons, up to now, the initialization has been a constant multiple of the identity matrix. In this paper, we propose a new limited-memory MSS method for large-scale nonconvex optimization that allows for dense initializations. Numerical results on the CUTEst test problems suggest that the MSS method using a dense initialization outperforms the standard initialization. Numerical results also suggest that this approach is competitive with both a basic L-SR1 trust-region method and an L-PSB method.},

  abstract     = {In this work we focus on the convex feasibility problem (CFP) in Hilbert space. A specific method in this area that has gained a lot of interest in recent years is the Douglas-Rachford (DR) algorithm. This algorithm was originally introduced in 1956 for solving stationary and non-stationary heat equations. Then in 1979, Lions and Mercier adjusted and extended the algorithm with the aim of solving CFPs and even more general problems, such as finding zeros of the sum of two maximally monotone operators. Many developments which implement various concepts concerning this algorithm have occurred during the last decade. We introduce an unrestricted DR algorithm, which provides a general framework for such concepts. Using unrestricted products of a finite number of strongly nonexpansive operators, we apply this framework to provide new iterative methods, where, inter alia , such operators may be interlaced between the operators used in the scheme of our unrestricted DR algorithm.},

We further show how to compute a convex relaxation ( P ∗ ) whose optimal value reaches the value of ( SDP ). In order to handle these inequalities in the solution of ( SDP ), we solve it by a heuristic that also serves as a separation algorithm.

Each method can generate a sequence of feasible points such that the sequence of function evaluations is decreasing. These methods can be regarded as extensions of the descent methods for unconstrained optimization problems. We pay particular attention to the Newton method. We show that under appropriate conditions, the Newton method is globally and quadratically convergent. Moreover, after finitely many iterations, the unit steplength will always be accepted. We also propose a nonlinear equations-based Newton method and establish its global and quadratic convergence. In the end, we do several numerical experiments to test the proposed Newton methods.

To compute the spectral parameter, in the account of worthy properties of quasi-Newton methods, we minimize the distance between the search direction matrix of the spectral conjugate gradient method and the BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) update. To achieve sufficient descent property, the search direction is projected in the orthogonal subspace to the gradient of the objective function. The convergence analysis of the proposed method is carried out under standard assumptions for general functions. Finally, the practical merits of the suggested method are investigated by numerical experiments on a set of CUTEr test functions using the Dolan–Moré performance profile.

Our model can strictly limit the number of misclassified samples, expressing the soft-margin constraint as a sparse constraint.

In this paper, we customize the non-convex piecewise quadratic approximation (PQA) function considering the background of portfolio management and present the PQA regularized mean–variance model (PMV). By exposing the feature of PMV, we prove that a KKT point of PMV is a local minimizer if the regularization parameter satisfies a mild condition. Besides, the theoretical sparsity of PMV is analysed, which is associated with the regularization parameter and the weight parameter. To solve this model, we introduce the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm, whose improved linear convergence rate compared with proximal gradient (PG) algorithm is developed. Moreover, the optimal accelerated parameter of APG algorithm for PMV is attained. These theoretical results are further illustrated with numerical experiments. Finally, empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed model has a better out-of-sample performance and a lower turnover than many other existing models on the tested datasets.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a class of constrained optimization problems whose constraints involve a cardinality or rank constraint. The penalty formulation based on a partial regularization has recently been promoted in the literature to approximate these problems, which usually outperforms the penalty formulation based on a full regularization in terms of solution quality. Nevertheless, the relation between the penalty formulation with a partial regularizer and the original problem was not much studied yet. Under some suitable assumptions, we show that the penalty formulation based on a partial regularization is an exact reformulation of the original problem in the sense that they both share the same global minimizers. We also show that a local minimizer of the original problem is that of the penalty reformulation. These results provide some theoretical justification for the often-observed superior performance of the penalty model based on a partial regularizer over a corresponding full regularizer.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new class of rigorous methods for derivative-free optimization with the aim of delivering efficient and robust numerical performance for functions of all types, from smooth to non-smooth, and under different noise regimes. To this end, we have developed a class of methods, called Full-Low Evaluation methods, organized around two main types of iterations. The first iteration type (called Full-Eval ) is expensive in function evaluations, but exhibits good performance in the smooth and non-noisy cases. For the theory, we consider a line search based on an approximate gradient, backtracking until a sufficient decrease condition is satisfied. In practice, the gradient was approximated via finite differences, and the direction was calculated by a quasi-Newton step (BFGS). The second iteration type (called Low-Eval ) is cheap in function evaluations, yet more robust in the presence of noise or non-smoothness. For the theory, we consider direct search, and in practice we use probabilistic direct search with one random direction and its negative. A switch condition from Full-Eval to Low-Eval iterations was developed based on the values of the line-search and direct-search stepsizes. If enough Full-Eval steps are taken, we derive a complexity result of gradient-descent type. Under failure of Full-Eval , the Low-Eval iterations become the drivers of convergence yielding non-smooth convergence. Full-Low Evaluation methods are shown to be efficient and robust in practice across problems with different levels of smoothness and noise.},

The system can react to failures and its behaviour is described by general mixed integer nonlinear programs, which allows for applications to many (technical) systems. This then leads to a three-level optimization problem. The upper level designs the system minimizing a cost function, the middle level represents worst-case failures of components, i.e. interdicts the system, and the lowest level operates the remaining system. We describe new inequalities that characterize the set of resilient solutions and allow to reformulate the problem. The reformulation can then be solved using a nested branch-and-cut approach. We discuss several improvements, for instance, by taking symmetry into account and strengthening cuts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our implementation on the optimal design of water networks, robust trusses, and gas networks, in comparison to an approach in which the failure scenarios are directly included into the model.},

  abstract     = {We propose a solution strategy for the large indefinite linear systems arising in interior methods for nonlinear optimization. The method is suitable for implementation on hardware accelerators such as graphical processing units (GPUs). The current gold standard for sparse indefinite systems is the LBLT factorization where L L L is a lower triangular matrix and B B B is 1 × 1 1 × 1 1×1 or 2 × 2 2 × 2 2×2 block diagonal. However, this requires pivoting, which substantially increases communication cost and degrades performance on GPUs. Our approach solves a large indefinite system by solving multiple smaller positive definite systems, using an iterative solver on the Schur complement and an inner direct solve (via Cholesky factorization) within each iteration. Cholesky is stable without pivoting, thereby reducing communication and allowing reuse of the symbolic factorization. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach on large optimal power flow problems and show that it can efficiently utilize GPUs and outperform LBL T factorization of the full system.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this paper is to investigate an approach for derivative-free optimization that has not received sufficient attention in the literature and is yet one of the simplest to implement and parallelize. In its simplest form, it consists of employing derivative-based methods for unconstrained or constrained optimization and replacing the gradient of the objective (and constraints) by finite-difference approximations. This approach is applicable to problems with or without noise in the functions. The differencing interval is determined by a bound on the second (or third) derivative and by the noise level, which is assumed to be known or to be accessible through difference tables or sampling. The use of finite-difference gradient approximations has been largely dismissed in the derivative-free optimization literature as too expensive in terms of function evaluations or as impractical in the presence of noise. However, the test results presented in this paper suggest that it has much to be recommended. The experiments compare newuoa, dfo-ls and cobyla against finite-difference versions of l-bfgs, lmder and knitro on three classes of problems: general unconstrained problems, nonlinear least squares problems and nonlinear programs with inequality constraints.},

  abstract     = {We know that compressive sensing can establish stable sparse recovery results from highly undersampled data under a restricted isometry property condition. In reality, however, numerous problems are coherent, and vast majority conventional methods might work not so well. Recently, it was shown that using the difference between ℓ 1 ℓ 1 ℓ1 - and ℓ 2 ℓ 2 ℓ2 -norm as a regularization always has superior performance. In this paper, we consider an adaptive ℓ p ℓ p ℓp - ℓ 1 − 2 ℓ 1 − 2 ℓ1−2 model where the ℓ p ℓ p ℓp -norm with p ≥ 1 p ≥ 1 p≥1 measures the data fidelity and the ℓ 1 − 2 -term measures the sparsity. This proposed model has the ability to deal with different types of noises and extract the sparse property even under high coherent condition. We use a proximal majorization-minimization technique to handle the non-convex regularization term and then employ a semismooth Newton method to solve the corresponding convex relaxation subproblem. We prove that the sequence generated by the semismooth Newton method admits fast local convergence rate to the subproblem under some technical assumptions. Finally, we do some numerical experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model and the progressiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

We propose an algorithm that determines if an equilibrium of such an MEP exists and that computes an equilibrium in case of existence. Three key prerequisites have to be met. First, appropriate bounds on market prices have to be derived from necessary optimality conditions of some players. Second, a technical assumption is required for those prices that are not uniquely determined by the derived bounds. Third, nonconvex optimization problems have to be solved to global optimality. We test the algorithm on well-known instances from the power and gas literature that meet these three prerequisites. There, nonconvexities arise from considering the transmission system operator as an additional player besides producers and consumers who, e.g. switches lines or faces nonlinear physical laws. Our numerical results indicate that equilibria often exist, especially for the case of continuous nonconvexities in the context of gas market problems.},

  abstract     = {We consider distributed optimization over several devices, each sending incremental model updates to a central server. This setting is considered, for instance, in federated learning. Various schemes have been designed to compress the model updates in order to reduce the overall communication cost. However, existing methods suffer from a significant slowdown due to additional variance ω &gt; 0 ω &gt; 0 ω&amp;gt;0 coming from the compression operator and as a result, only converge sublinearly. What is needed is a variance reduction technique for taming the variance introduced by compression. We propose the first methods that achieve linear convergence for arbitrary compression operators. For strongly convex functions with condition number κ , distributed among n machines with a finite-sum structure, each worker having less than m components, we also (i) give analysis for the weakly convex and the non-convex cases and (ii) verify in experiments that our novel variance reduced schemes are more efficient than the baselines. Moreover, we show theoretically that as the number of devices increases, higher compression levels are possible without this affecting the overall number of communications in comparison with methods that do not perform any compression. This leads to a significant reduction in communication cost. Our general analysis allows to pick the most suitable compression for each problem, finding the right balance between additional variance and communication savings. Finally, we also (iii) give analysis for arbitrary quantized updates.},

  abstract     = {We present a quasi-Newton interior-point method appropriate for optimization problems with pointwise inequality constraints in Hilbert function spaces. Among others, our methodology applies to optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) that are posed in a reduced-space formulation and have bounds or inequality constraints on the optimized parameter function. We first introduce the formalization of an infinite-dimensional quasi-Newton interior-point algorithm using secant BFGS updates and then proceed to derive a discretized interior-point method capable of working with a wide range of finite element discretization schemes. We also discuss and address mathematical and software interface issues that are pervasive when existing off-the-shelf PDE solvers are to be used with off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers. Finally, we elaborate on the numerical and parallel computing strengths and limitations of the proposed methodology on several classes of PDE-constrained problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a type of semidefinite programming problem (MSDP), which involves many (not necessarily finite) of semidefinite constraints. MSDP can be established in a wide range of applications, including covering ellipsoids problem and truss topology design. We propose a random method based on a stochastic approximation technique for solving MSDP, without calculating and storing the multiplier. Under mild conditions, we establish the almost sure convergence and expected convergence rates of the proposed method. A variety of simulation experiments are carried out to support our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {We consider minimizing a class of nonconvex composite stochastic optimization problems, and deterministic optimization problems whose objective function consists of an expectation function (or an average of finitely many smooth functions) and a weakly convex but potentially nonsmooth function. And in this paper, we focus on the theoretical properties of two types of stochastic splitting methods for solving these nonconvex optimization problems: stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers and stochastic proximal gradient descent. In particular, several inexact versions of these two types of splitting methods are studied. At each iteration, the proposed schemes inexactly solve their subproblems by using relative error criteria instead of exogenous and diminishing error rules, which allows our approaches to handle some complex regularized problems in statistics and machine learning. Under mild conditions, we obtain the convergence of the schemes and their computational complexity related to the evaluations on the component gradient of the smooth function, and find that some conclusions of their exact counterparts can be recovered.},
