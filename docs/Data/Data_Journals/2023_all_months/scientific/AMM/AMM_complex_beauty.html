  abstract     = {This paper examines and analyzes the domestic and foreign regulatory framework, guidelines and technical documents, information brochures, manuals, handbooks, test reports and other literary sources as well as information on the Internet. In the countries of the European space, fire safety requirements have been established for roofs and roofing materials, both for roofing materials and for roofs as part of structures, which helps to limit the spread of fire in buildings and structures during a fire. It has been proven that there is a need to create equipment for testing resistance to external fire exposure in accordance with DSTU CEN/TS 1187:2016 (method 2) of coverings of buildings (roofs) and establishing fire classification according to DSTU EN 13501-5:2016. A registration certificate, a technical description, an operating manual, and a program and methodology of the test bench verification have been developed. The initial verification of the test bench was carried out and it was put into operation. Approbation of the test method was carried out on the created test bench through experimental studies of five types of roofing materials being widely used on construction works in Ukraine using two bases (substrates) of combustible and non-combustible materials at air flow speeds of 2 m/s and 4 m/s above the specimen surface. According to the results of this work, it was established that the maximum relative deviation of the result of measuring the length of the damaged (charred) part of the specimens was in the range of 1.2 % to 23.3 % for the roof and 0.7 % to 27.5 % for the base.},

  abstract     = {This article analyzes the current state of explosion protection in the world. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the main modern method of explosion protection is the use of easy-dropped construction (hereinafter - EDC). There are various methods for calculating the required area of the EDC, but to confirm the reliability of the calculations, the selection of the material that performs the function of the EDC, geometrical parameters and excess pressure of operation, it is necessary to conduct experimental research. The existing experimental devices for testing EDC for excess explosion pressure are given. The designs and drawbacks of these devices are considered. The design features of the constructed unit for checking the functionality of elements of easy-dropped construction (hereinafter referred to as the unit) and the main advantages compared to other experimental units are described. A scheme of the device and its structure is given. The required amount of propane-butane was calculated to obtain an excess explosion pressure of 5 kPa. Based on the results of the tests, a graph of the change in the excess pressure of the explosion over time is plotted and the value of the excess pressure of the explosion in a closed volume depending on the concentration of the gas mixture of propane-butane with air, which is formed in the closed volume, and the change in the excess pressure of the explosion after the activation of the EDC were investigated. A graph of the influence of the concentration of the gas-air mixture on the excess pressure acting on the EDC is plotted. The design parameters of the device and its location, the limit values of the excess pressure of the explosion, the minimum amount of gas to create the required excess pressure of the explosion are substantiated. The considered device provides an experimental determination of the values of the overpressure of the operation of EDC of typical sizes and allows conducting experimental research of the operation of the EDC under the influence of various values of the overpressure of the explosion with the required accuracy.},

For supplying components of gel-forming compositions Na2O·2,7SiO2 + NH4H2PO4 sprayers of the &quot;segener wheel&quot; type were used. This made it possible to create a finely dispersed fog of gel-forming compounds under the subway car, ensuring uniform and stable adhesion of the gel layers to all surfaces under the car. When conducting experimental studies on the extinguishing of model fires, which are close in their configuration to a sub-weighted space, the effective parameters of the dispersion of drops of gel-forming compositions in 1,6 mm were determined. Uniformly stable adhesion of gel-forming compositions when finely dispersed allowed to reduce the consumption of fire extinguishing agent by at least 25% compared to previously used technical solutions.},

  abstract     = {The prototype of the compressed air foam system was improved based on the evaluation of the numerical parameters obtained with the help of the developed mathematical model of the foam generation process and the pneumatic-hydraulic scheme. The prototype provides the possibility of foam generation both in autonomous mode, due to the installation of cylinders with compressed gas, and in stationary mode, due to the supply of compressed air from an external source. This allows the use of an improved model of the compressed air foam system both in stationary mode (dry pipes, gas stations, etc.) and for use on heavy and light fire trucks, which is important for large cities. Testing of the improved prototype of the system for extinguishing model fires was carried out. The system provides extinguishing of model fires of class 183 B and 144 B when using both a general-purpose foaming agent and a special film-forming foaming agent. When using a film-forming foaming agent, the extinguishing time was reduced by 1.75 times, the consumption of fire extinguishing solution by 1.47 times. But at the same time, it should be taken into account that the cost of the film-forming foaming agent Sofir (sofirafff 6 %) is more than 3.2 times the cost of the general-purpose foaming agent Sofir. The effectiveness of the improved model in extinguishing class A fires was also confirmed. The autonomous compressed air foam system ensures extinguishing of a class 4 A model fire in 90 seconds. Dry foam with a factor of 14 is noted to be more effective in extinguishing solid combustible substances.},

  abstract     = {3D printing is an emerging technology that creates parts straight from CAD models. Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is a 3D printing method that is becoming increasingly popular in the aerospace, medical, and orthopedics sectors. These are usually focused on precise, long-lasting, and lightweight parts. DMLS is an Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique that employs a laser to sinter a selected area of a metallic powder layer by layer to produce the required metal components. The heating power of the laser was discovered to have a strong effect on phase formation. The major issue with this process is that high residual and large deformations are introduced to the components during manufacturing. This causes a change in the fatigue strength of a part and can even lead to cracks. The quality of the DMLS parts is affected by various process parameters. In this study, the design of experiments is used to investigate the consequences of process parameters used in the DMLS process to make metal parts. Process parameters such as laser power and scanning speed must be identified because they have the largest influence on the part&#39;s characteristics. (Build time, part accuracy). The change in the controlling parameters, or process parameters, in the DMLS method, has been found to affect material properties, according to a literature review. Thus, in the proposed work, three process parameters laser speed, scanning speed, and hatching distance are taken into account at two distinct levels. L4 orthogonal arrays are used in the studies. Experimental research is done on the manufacturing process, build time and component accuracy. Finally, the impact of each parameter on the quality aspects is discussed based on the experimental findings.},

Robotic surveillance system can be used to replace human guards in dangerous surveillance conditions. Several robots have been developed to assist in these operations. But the full scale employment of robots in crucial fields such as surveillance, security in defence industries and military bases is very limited. The system&#39;s overall structure is described, along with descriptions of each component. The robotic system consists of robot eyes, which are capable of sensing an object through IR sensor capability. This robotic system helps in the identification of human presence and alerting respective owners. These operations, performed by the robotic system are achieved using sensors, several number of servo motors, Arduino microcontroller. These components are placed in their respective locations, within a body which is fabricated using the 3D printing technology. The sensors in the robotic system capture the movements of objects. The robotic eyes are fitted with cameras which capture the movements. The robotic system is programmed in such a way that the robotic eyes, move in the direction of object which has been sensed by the sensors and focus on it. If there are multiple moving objects, then one robotic eye focuses on one object, while the other robotic eye focuses on another object.

  abstract     = {Photocatalyst activity relates to the active surface area between pollutants and catalyst compounds. The insertion of Al atoms as a substantial defect in ZnO structures can reduce the particle size thus the active surface area increases. Another way to raise the photocatalytic activity of ZnO is by combination with other oxide materials such as TiO2 (Titanium dioxide). In this study, the ZnO-Al:TiO2 powder was successfully prepared via the sol-gel method using zinc acetate dihydrate as a precursor, 0.5wt% of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate as a dopant precursor, and TiO2 anatase. In order to understand the role of the combination of these two metal oxides, the concentration ratio of ZnO-Al and TiO2 was varied by 1:1 (ZAT) and 4:1 (ZA4T) under low (150°C) and high (450°C) temperature calcination. Photocatalytic testing was carried out using a 3.2 ppm methylene blue (MB) solution under UV-A lamp irradiation for 120 minutes. The high calcination temperature facilitates the growth of ZnO-Al. Besides that, the different ratio concentrations and calcination temperatures produce different defect states in each sample. The most optimum results in the photocatalytic activity performed by ZnO-Al:TiO2 150°C (ZAT 15) with degradation rate constant (k) of 0.033/min and efficiency of 97% for MB removal. The unexpected zinc vacancies defect is estimated produce at the samples in high-temperature calcination. This defect type can accelerate electron-hole pair recombination. In Addition, samples with high-temperature calcination were considered to have lower hydroxyl/oxygen bonds on the surface thus affecting the photocatalytic performance.},

The fermentation of food waste should improve its quality and ensure that food waste is safe to use as feed material. As a result of various tests of Proximate, FTIR, SEM, and Physical Quality test it has been shown that the fermentation process can significantly improve the nutritional quality of food waste without changing the functional groups and the reduction of the particle size after the fermentation process is also capable to improve the physical quality of feed.

The study investigates the potential of these natural fibres and powders as a replacement for traditional synthetic fibres in the development of lightweight and environmentally friendly composite materials. The composites will be prepared by blending the natural fibres with a thermosetting resin matrix. Four samples are fabricated by using hand lay-up technique. The composition of the composites will be optimized by varying the fibre volume fraction and the ratio of the different types of fibres, and the mechanical properties of these materials will be evaluated using standard ASTM testing procedures. The results of the study will be used to analyze the effects of fibre content, and the inclusion of groundnut husk powder on the mechanical properties of the composites, such as tensile test, flexural test, compression test and hardness test. The findings of this research could contribute to the development of new and improved composite materials that are sustainable, cost-effective, and have desirable mechanical properties for various applications, such as construction, automotive, and packaging industries.},

In this study, potato starch with a composition of 5%, 10%, and 15% acted as a pore-former in the local filter. The local filter burned to a temperature of about 1200°C to obtain the mullite phase. Local filter characterization used SEM, XRD, XRF, and DTA. Several tests were carried out in this study, including Permanent Linear Change (PLC) test, thermal expansion test, flexural strength test, and porosity test. The results obtained in this study show that pores on the local filter are not open, have a prolate shape, and have an average pore size of 10 to 55 m. Burning kaolin up to 1200°C proved successful in obtaining the mullite phase. Another result of this study, the more starch content added to the material, the greater the shrinkage and expansion of the material; the highest shrinkage value on the material is 0.17%, and the highest expansion value of the material is 0,29%, the 15% values owned by potato starch.

The analysis model could estimate the effective tensile coefficient within a 5% error compared to the hydraulic tightening experimental results. The simulated results of the analysis model showed that the effective tensile coefficient changed largely depending on the thickness and the surface pressure of the flange, and that the coefficient hardly changed by the height of the nut and the friction coefficient at the bearing surface.},

Due to the detrimental impact of aerodynamic heating on the vehicle structure, it is imperative to develop a robust thermal protection system that can protect the vehicle from high temperatures. However, the development of sophisticated TPS for slender components is impractical and, therefore, requires a hot structure system that can operate at substantial aerothermal loads. The aim of this study is to predict the impact of aero-heating on a UHTCC-based hot structure system of a hypersonic cruise vehicle through uncoupled thermo-structural analysis of the control surface.

Board bending angles and timing were analyzed with a Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model to identify the most important teeterboard variables associated to jump height. The BRT model showed that both the board recoil effect and the landing of the opposite acrobat influenced 46% and 37% of the jump height, respectively. The recoil timing was found to be synchronized with the last contact at take-off.

PDMS must be stable both chemically and physically during the storage process according to WHO standards. This is necessary to maintain security and regulate the drug supply. Our research shows that low-and medium-viscosity PDMS produced from low-grade octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) monomer have good stability and storage for 15 months. The optimal time for stability and storage of this PDMS is 5 months. Changes in viscosity values occur due to a very slow chain growth from 5 until 15 months. However, a longer assessment time and other tests are needed to complete the material stability information.},

This study aims to determine the tissue equivalence of this material by looking at aspects of the effective atomic number and radiation mass attenuation coefficient. To determine the effective atomic number, we used the EDX results from the SEM machine and input the concentration data of each element from alginate gel with 20% water content into the Autozeff software. The radiation mass attenuation coefficient is simulated by calculations involving each element’s concentration, then confirmed by CT-Number obtained from CT-Scan images. We obtained an effective atomic number and mass attenuation coefficient from the calculation results, which are described as a function of photon energy. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the bolus made from alginate impression material is equivalent to soft tissue and breast tissue.},

This paper first introduces the problem of stress concentration in aerospace, demonstrates the necessity and importance of studying this problem, at the same time, puts forward a stress concentration solution based on finite element method, which simplifies the geometric model by using symmetrical characte-ristics, so as to reduce the batch data of analysis. Compared with the conventional analysis using Patran and NASTRAN, its geometric model has a higher degree of discretization, The superiority and reliability of this method are verified by two examples. The results show that this finite element method is more accurate and effective in dealing with stress concentration problems, especially complex geometric models, and has high value for engineering practice.},

Some of the salt produced has not been able to meet the standard requirement especially for industrial uses and make Indonesia still importing salt. This study aims to develop a precipitation model of various salt components during seasalt production from seawater by varying the brine input and output concentration on the crystallization table using the concept of solubility. The evaporation and precipitation processes during the salt production were modeled using a series of separator and filter units and carried out by making use of the electrolyte wizard in Aspen Plus®. In this simulation, 9 variation were carried out by varying the brine input at concentration 20 ºBe, 23 ºBe, and 25 ºBe and output at concentration 29 ºBe, 30 ºBe, and 31 ºBe on the crystallization table. It is shown that the purity of NaCl salt is significantly influenced by the the brine input concentration to and the brine output concentration from the crystallization table. The percentage of calcium impurity increases when the brine input concentration to the crystallization table is lower while the percentage of magnesium impurity increases when the brine output concentration from the crystallization table is higher. The percentage of sulfate impurity increases when both the brine input concentration to and the brine output concentration from the crystallization table is lower. In practice, it is advisable that the crystallization in the salt table is carried out from 25 to 29 ºBe to limit the amount of magnesium impurity that can cause salt to taste bitter. Conducting the crystallization in this concentration range would give the purity of NaCl salt of 94.049%, which is in accordance with SNI standard for consumption salt, and the yield of NaCl salt of 78.83%. Further study needs to be done to provide a workable solution on how to make the purity of NaCl salt higher such as by using suitable precipitating agents in the salt production to help the precipitation process of various salt impurities.},

The brick powder can partially replace cement for construction production, which can solve the problem of cement energy consumption. This paper studies the influence of brick powder on the performance of cement-based materials. The research shows that the water absorption effect of brick powder and the friction force are the two main factors affecting concrete. Energy dispersive spectrometer, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and compressive strength tests show that the addition of brick powder leads to the increase of silicon/calcium. inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry shows that although brick powder dissolves in the early stage, the volcanic ash effect is weak. The results of mercury intrusion porosimetry and ultrasonic pulse velocity are consistent with the compressive strength. When 5 % is added, it shows excellent durability. In addition, with the increase of age, the durability will not decrease significantly. Since the brick powder only needs to be ground to avoid the related process of cement, good economic and environmental benefits can be obtained with the increase of substitution rate.},

C5 or pentose can be hydrolyzed into furfural through the hydrolysis process and then dehydration reaction using the acid catalyst in various kinds of solvent. At this moment, the highest yield of furfural in the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of xylose in water resulted in only about 50.0w-%. Other methods such as salt addition or the use of various organic solvents lead to new challenges both in purification and environmental issues. Therefore in this study, 70.0w-% ethanol in water was utilized as the solvent in a range of temperatures (140-170°C) and concentration of sulfuric acid (0.1-0.5M) up to 120 minutes reaction time. As the outcomes, the shorter time was needed to achieve maximum furfural yield with the increase of temperature and acid concentration with the water and the ethanol as the solvent. Improvement was shown in the highest furfural yield achieved up to 70.0-72.0mol-% (after 15 min at 170°C, 0.2-0.5 M concentration of H2SO4). The results showed the potential use of ethanol as a green solvent to produce furfural from xylose.},

Furthermore, the experimental data is used to verify the accuracy of the numerical data. This unique CFD simulation research included a 3D system, Reynolds-Average, Navier-Stokes equations (RANS), k-turbulence model, and total interphase forces. Bulk flow patterns were revealed through CFD analysis. Total contact force, both constant and non-steady, is also analyzed for its impact.

In addition, bubbles without enough velocity to leave the bed circulate towards the wall with liquid and follow a similar pattern. The results show that the phenomenon of the central peak can only be captured by using a single bubble and no drag forces. The correlation between simulation and experimental findings is excellent. Within the higher, middle, and nearby gas distributor height ranges, the outcome agrees extremely well with the experiment. In addition, the results of the experiments show that the level of turbulence has played a crucial role in dynamic behavior. The CFD model described qualitative and quantitative flow performance, producing excellent results. The results also gave a framework for comparing and evaluating future designs and gave insights into the fluid dynamics of the bubble column reactor. Efforts were made to compare and contrast the main operating modes of different reactor designs. Keywords: Two phase, Ansys, Bubble column, CFD, Drag force, Flow Pattern.},

  abstract     = {Meeting stringent emission regulations, the demand for environmentally friendly fuels is increasing by the day. Alternative fuel must be burned alongside conventional fuel to increase the availability of such clean energy sources. The current experimental study investigates the characteristics of the premixed LPG flames with CO2 dilution in tube swirling and non-swirling burners. The study including testing the effects of equivalence ratios, $\varphi$, (0.8, 1, 1.2, &amp;amp; 1.4), CO2 dilution ratios (0%, 5%, 7.5%, &amp;amp; 10%), and aspect ratio of the non-swirling burner (2, 4, 6, 8, &amp;amp; 10). Two swirling burners with swirl number was tested, namely 0.78 &amp;amp; 0.48. The dilution of CO2 has been observed lengthens the flame, particularly at higher equivalence ratios and/or flow rates since there is more than one influence, they all agree on a similar influence on flame height. The flame shortens clearly when using a swirling burner. Besides, when increasing the swirl number, the flame height increases slightly. Also, the swirling burner divided the flame&#39;s inner core into segments equal to the number of swirl vanes, and a flower-shaped flame was generated at low flow rates. The burner’s aspect ratio affects flame height insignificantly. Flame stability limits increase for a higher equivalence ratio and it enhances due to CO2 addition. The LPG-CO2/air mixture has an improved reply to beat flame flashback. The addition of CO2 expands the flow rate of stable flame by about 40% and 25% for $\varphi$ = 1 and 1.2 respectively. Utilizing a swirling burner improves flame stability greatly. The limit between flashback and blowout increased by about three times as a result of using a swirling burner.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a non-evaporative cooling system is used with an assisted thermoelectric cooler (TEC) devices module. The system was proposed as an alternative cooling system in the high temperature climate to overcome the high energy consumption of traditional air-conditioning compression cycle. The open source Open FOAM V.9 was used to solve the transient effect of 3D model of indirect non-evaporative cooling system. The primary air temperature was set to 319 . While, the air flow was tested under four different air inlet velocities: 0.75 m/s, 1 m/s, 1.25 m/s, and 1.5 m/s. the validation shows good and acceptable agreement in COP values of the system with both experimental and theoretical works from literature within an error between (12.9 % and 9.5 %). Results show that the temperate difference value on a slice through the length of the air channel starts to decrease as velocity increasing. For example, at the last timesteps of each velocity, the temperature difference reaches about (~10 oK) when velocity is (0.75 m/s) starting from the first quarter of the channel, while the same difference in temperature not reached until the half way of the channel from the channel inlet when velocity is (1.5 m/s). Revealing that even though the percentage increase in the velocity is about 50%, the change in the temperature difference value between the inlet and outlet of the channel is about 1.2%. The local Nusselt number shows that steady state heat transfer reached very quickly as the velocity increased (i.e., at 0.75 m/s at 12s while for 1.5 m/s at 4s). Notwithstanding, as the time processed the ( increases for all cases but becomes lower as the velocity increased. .},

Then we made a circle of ROI with a diameter of 0.2 cm2 on the Bone, Soft-tissue and Air sections in that four tube current-time variations, each of which has 7 ROI points tocalculate the SNR and the radiation dose is seen from the image. There is a difference in SNR on tube current-time changes and affects the image quality with an Adjusted R square value of 0.003 and 0.865. It shows that there is a change in tube current that affects the Signal to Noise Ratio between organs.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical tool that is used to form images of organs, soft tissues, bones and almost all internal body structures. The MRI image acquisition process takes a long time. One of the efforts to shorten the examination acquisition time is using the parallel imaging technique, namely SENSE. However, SENSE has a weakness, namely reducing the Signal Noise to Ratio (SNR). One of the denoising methods that can increase SNR is the Nonlocal mean filter (NLM). Post-image acquisition denoising becomes a cheaper and more effective alternative to use. The aim of this research is to measure the increase of SNR value in MRI SENSE images between before the denoising technique and after the denoising technique. This research is expected to produce a faster scanning time and maintain the quality of the MRI image. This experimental research was carried out by applying the SENSE parallel imaging technique to R-factors 2 and 4. The sequence used is T2WI TSE on axial slice phantom. The T2WI TSE SENSE phantom MRI image was corrected with the NLM denoising technique to produce a better quality image. Each variation is measured image information before and after the denoising technique. Image information is assessed quantitatively by measuring SNR. The results of the parametric test showed that there was an increase in the SNR value after the application of the denoising technique on the Phantom T2WI TSE SENSE MRI image at r-factor 2 and r-factor 4. The different test on the SNR assessment resulted in a p value &amp;lt; 0.001.},

The application of BLADE and STIR sequences based on artificial intelligence technology has described in reference that it is able to suppress moving signals from the vascular and signals from fat tissue. However, the long consumption of scanning time is one of the drawbacks that arise, and subsequently affect the presence of noise in the image.

Methods: The search was conducted using google scholar, WILEY, IEE Explore, SPRINGER, Scopus and PERPUSNAS in English with the article period 2004-2020 using the keywords MRI artifacts, reducing artifacts and the Kalman filter algorithm. Result: The results of a review of 4 articles of kalman filter intervention on MRI Brain, MRI Abdomen and MR Cardiac showed that kalman filter was good enough in reducing artifacts and increasing anatomical information. Conclusion: Kalman filter has the potential to reduce artifacts, improve image quality and clarify anatomical images on MRI examinations.},

  abstract     = {In its use, reefer containers require a lot of energy to operate to cool the cargo inside. Because the cooling system in the reefer container must operate continuously to maintain the temperature in the container. To reduce the operation of the cooling system, reefer containers are equipped with PCM (phase change material) as thermal energy storage which can store heat energy longer to create a lag time for the operation of the cooling system. In previous research, the use of PCM in cold storage can save the cost of using cold storage. From this research, the use of PCM in reefer containers was developed. The eutectic mixture used as PCM is NaCl-H2O with additional ingredients is propylene glycol. Before being applied to the reefer container, the mixture was tested using the cooling chamber methods to determine its thermophysics. The presence of additives in the PCM eutectic mixture is expected to reduce the supercooling phenomenon, reduce corrosive properties and increase the use of PCM based on NaCl-H2O.},

Decreased performance of closed cooling water system can cause the gas turbine protection system to be active and cause the gas turbine trip. The study began with data collection, both design data for the heat exchanger cooler fan and operating data from the closed cooling water system on the gas turbine. An experiment was carried out by varying the blade pitch angle cooler fan to measure the work parameters in the field and analyzing the results of these measurements against the performance of the heat exchanger cooler fan. Variations of blade pitch angle cooler fan were done by limiting the working parameters of the cooling fan motor. The result of this study was an increase in the blade pitch angle cooler fan results in an increase in the flow rate of the cooler fan, this also affected the heat transfer rate of the heat exchanger cooler fan which grew when the blade pitch angle cooler fan was raised. The increase of blade pitch angle cooler fan also resulted in a decrease in the temperature of closed cooling water on the heat exchanger cooler fan outlet.},

An absorber plate is the main part of the SWHS that functions to absorb solar energy. Porous materials are efficient in increasing heat transfer, energy efficiency, energy storage, and reducing reflectance losses. Efforts have been made to add aluminium foam as a porous material on the lower and upper surfaces of the absorber plate. Porous materials function absorb heat and store radiant heat energy before being transferred to the fluid. Experimental tests were carried out by testing three models of absorber plates on a solar thermal energy unit with similar conditions. The first model is a standard flat plate (SFP) without aluminium foam. The second model combines standard flat plate and aluminium foam (SFP-TAF), placed on top of the SFP. The third model combines standard flat plate and aluminium foam (SFP-BAF), placed under the SFP. The results showed that the SFP-BAF model has a higher thermal efficiency than the other models. The SFP-BAF model has an efficiency increase of 2.71 % at a flow rate of 10 L/h and 5.39 % flow rate of 12 L/h compared with the standard model (SFP). The position of the aluminium foam at the bottom surface is substantial enough to help absorb and store radiant heat for transfer to circulating water.},

The dominant frequency obtained using the tensile test was approximately 103 kHz, and those in the acetic-acid solution without stress were approximately 32 and 101 kHz. The dominant frequencies of the crack specimens in which cracks propagated were approximately 30–40 (F1), 60–85 (F2), and 100–110 (F3) kHz.

In this context, series of tests were carried out using untreated short fibers in lightweight concrete. The evaluation of the mechanical and physical behavior of the material was obtained by determining the compressive strength, bending strength and thermal conductivity. The results obtained showed the influence of the fibers volume fraction. For mechanical behavior, the optimum of fibers volume fraction was estimated at 1% for lightweight concrete with date palm and sisal fibers. The thermal conductivity is inversely proportional to the fibers volume fraction, which justifies the use of this composite as a filling and insulation material.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, a smart structure is being investigated, where a functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) plate is equipped with piezoelectric actuators to provide vibration control. Due to their high mechanical properties coupled with lightweight, FG-CNTRCs are mainly used in the aerospace industry and in advanced engineering applications. The CNTs have a linear and non-linear distribution along the thickness of the plate and are distributed according to five configurations, namely: UD, FG-X, FG-O, FG-A and FG-V. The first order shear deformation (FOSD) theory is considered in the formulation of a 9-node quadratic finite element with 5 degrees-of-freedom per node, and an additional degree of freedom is provided for the piezoelectric layer. The model developed in this study assesses the free vibration behavior and controls the nanocomposite plate deflection through the electromechanical coupling factor piezoelectric. In addition, it investigates: (i) the effect of the plate configuration, (ii) the CNT volume fraction, (iii) the CNT destruction patterns, (iv) the linear and nonlinear distribution of CNTs, (v) the number of CNTRC ply, (vi) the boundary conditions and (vii) the dimensions with different locations of actuators. The results obtained show the first natural frequencies for all configurations, which are considered to be in good agreement with those available in the literature and illustrate that the effective stiffness of the nanocomposite plates can be improved further when the reinforcement is dispersed according to the FG-X pattern. In addition, for the case of the deflection control analysis, results indicate that the distributed piezoelectric layers (actuators) attenuate the deflection of the CNTRC to the desired tolerance. It is noted that patches with partial coverage compared to the case of total coverage of piezoelectric layers require more electrical power to reach the same level of attenuation. The developed numerical model is intended to be used in a variety of potential advanced engineering applications.},

The fibre reinforced composites being light in weight, and high strength are replacing metals in many applications. Nowadays, more focus is paid in developing sustainable and environment friendly materials without compromise in the quality. This reason led to the development of Natural Fibre Reinforced Composite (NFRC) materials, which is gaining more attention towards them. Though many NFRCs were developed, machining is a very big challenge. Compared to the traditional machining processes, the non-traditional machining process is proved to be recommendable for machining NFRC materials. In this article, the numerous research endeavors carried out in machining of NFRCs using Abrasive Water Jet Machining (AWJM) process is reviewed. This article describes the different parameters considered in AWJM process and their influence over the machining characteristics of NFRCs. Based on the different research carried out, the use of nanofillers in the right composition is expected to increase the performance of the AWJM process over NFRCs.},

The vibration response type covers galloping and vortex-induced vibration regimes. The mini harvester energy induced by the harmonic oscillation of prismatic structure was implemented based on the magnetostrictive principle to gain electricity using a galfenol alloy (Fe-Ga). The power generation variations are influenced by the amplitude, frequency, structure displacement, span length, and shape of the bluff body. The optimum power generation is 2.87 mW, and the maximum power generation is 10.63 mW at the resonance velocity Vr of 6.45. Reducing the frequency characteristics of circular cylinders by applying a cap end tip affect power generation characteristics and galloping behaviour for the prism with a span length of 200 mm but not for other span lengths. The effect of span length variation on free vibration and power generation performance for all prism models is similar in that both features are decreased by increasing span length. However, it enhances onset valued power generation. Power generation is considered for the independent electricity supply for specific sensor or wireless devices of an IoT system.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a very promising device to monitor environmental events, which are used in many application areas such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, air-water pollution, greenhouse, health monitoring, structural monitoring etc. Also, WSN needs effective and efficient way of collecting data from the area over which it is deployed, since the network consists of battery-operated nodes with limited energy. Improving the lifetime of WSN for continuous monitoring applications are very essential because of simple deployment, low installation cost, lack of cabling, and high mobility. The better energy conservation and reliable data transmission would be achieved in WSN by adopting efficient routing protocols for better and reliable communication. Also, security in data transmission in WSN is still a challenging task. Hence, a better way of encryption has to be computed to promote a reliable transmission between the nodes. In this paper discusses about different routing protocols which support energy efficiency and security techniques in WSN.},

  abstract     = {The trawler winch is a main winching tool in the fishing operation of trawler. The disturbing influence of various factors such as sea wind and waves, change in the size of the catch and the turning of the fishing vessel during the operation of the trawler will cause unbalanced force on the wire rope of the two winches, which will easily cause the deformation and damage of the fishing net facilities and directly affect the improvement of the fishing yield and increase the harvest. In order to compensate for the change of the tension of the winch tractor during the operation of the trawler, the change of the load tension caused by the wave, or the rotation direction of the fishing vessel, and to ensure the good shape of the net opening, an electro-hydraulic control technology was used to design an automatic trawler tension controller. The tension control method of the trawler is investigated. The tension sensor is used as the input information of the electrical signal of the trawler&#39;s left and right trawler, which is measured indirectly and transmitted to the controller for logical operation, and the output torque of the hydraulic motor is changed by controlling the pilot overflow, which drives the trawler winch to adjust the tension of the left and right trawler to achieve the dynamic balance of the control system. In order to solve the problem of the tension of the trawl and the influence of the length change on the trawl, we designed an intelligent control system combining PLC control system and hydraulic system and used AMEsim hydraulic simulation software system to model and simulate it, the results show that without PLC control the torque of hydraulic motor 1 is 2387.7NM, the torque of hydraulic motor 9 is 2148.64NM the difference is 239.06 NM uneven force on both sides of the trailing platform, after adding PLC adjustment torque is obviously controlled torque to maintain about 2300NM, within a certain range to play a reliable adjustment effect.},

The method calculates the aerodynamic heat based on Eckert reference enthalpy method, and calculates the temperature field by finite element method. The temperature field is taken as the volume load while calculating the thermal stress gradient and time history. Considering the influence of thermal stress, the natural vibration characteristics such as the mode and vibration frequency with time are obtained. The numerical computation results show that the aerodynamic heat is distributed unevenly across the rudder, such as stagnation point, laminar flow, transition and turbulence. The solid blocks of rudder shaft, longitudinal and transverse wall plates cause local low temperature, and large temperature gradient leads to higher thermal stress. Due to the change of material properties and thermal stress, the natural vibration frequency of the rudder has a significant decrease at sometime. The software of ANSYS was used to calculate and output cloud diagrams. The software of Microsoft Office was used to make curve graphics. The developed APDL command flow is very efficient and portable, which is convenient for complex structural model, and can provide technical support for supersonic missile rudder.},

Graphical user interfaces are also developed to take necessary user inputs required at different stages for crack identification, predicting weld bead dimension, and weld path generation. Based on the identified crack geometry and predicted weld bead feature, linear and curved weld path planning methodology is proposed. The proposed modules are validated for a case study by successfully generating the desired weld paths.

To show what happens within the hot flue gas supply duct and mould drying chamber, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Ansys software was used. The business benefits by eliminating the usage of wood as a fuel and making the process more cost-effective and environmentally friendly by capturing hot flue gas from the top section of the furnace or chimney and supplying it through duct to the drying chamber to dry the mold.

The two methods used to reduce CO and HC exhaust emissions are as follows: the first method is by mixing fossil fuels with ethanol. The fuel used is a mixture of gasoline + ethanol with variations of gasoline, E10, and E20. The second method is to provide a CO and HC reformer catalyst made of modified copper with the addition of SiO2 and MZM5 as much as 10% and 20%, respectively. The test uses a four-stroke two-wheel motor in a neutral gear position. Exhaust emission data retrieval is at 1500, 3000, 5000, 7000, 9000 rpm. With gasoline fuel mixed with ethanol with E 10 and E 20. There is a decrease in CO at each engine speed in each fuel variation, because the more ethanol content, the greater the supply of O2 in combustion because ethanol has oxygen bonds that can increase combustion. The emission of CO and HC gas on gasoline-fueled motors are greater than those of E 10 and E 20 motors. The use of a copper converter catalyst SiO2-C-ZSM5 is very significant and can reduce CO levels for gasoline fuel from the highest value of 4,7% to 2.82%, gasohol fuel E 10 with the highest value of CO 3.02% decreased to 1.2% and gasohol fuel E 20 the highest value of CO 2.78% decreased to 0.17%. Changes were seen visually on the surface of the copper used for the CO and HC reduction test, the surface copper became darker in color, especially when testing using gasoline.

  abstract     = {The Smart Foundry concept promises benefits of improved foundry supply chain quality, more sustainable metal processing, and improved customer support. A significant need includes automated data gathering and visualization of the data. In metal foundries regardless of manufacturing small parts in mass production or big parts in small production, metal castings are difficult to trace individually. Furthermore, to identify causes of defects through statistical correlation of recorded process inputs to inspected part defects becomes challenging. In this paper we present a sand-casting Smart Foundry operation including automated scan-based tracking of cast parts through the foundry and supply chain. This allowed process data collected to be automatically associated with the part being processed. This study proved that additively manufactured tags can be utilized in foundry serial production operations for direct-part-marking of castings and both digital tracking and process data collection of individual cast parts. Further we made use of the captured part-by-part data to develop a root cause analysis for quality defect causal correlation. The results indicated that the casting feature dimensional quality was highly correlated with variations in sand bending strength, tin content in aluminum, and pouring time, among others. Such insights are available when tracking process and part data as part of a Smart Foundry.},

  abstract     = {Currently, FBG sensor has been developed in many applications due to its wavelength is sensitive to pressure change. This study aims to analyze the FBG wavelength shifting due to an applied load. In this research, the FBG was placed transversely right in the middle of the specimen that was made by using silicon rubber with thicknesses of 7 mm and 14 mm. The FBG wavelength in the two specimens was investigated by an interrogator when the load is put on to the specimens in three variations: without load, 5 kg, and 10 kg. The result show that the shift of FBG wavelength in specimen with the same thickness is proportional to load increasing. Furthermore, the test specimen with a thickness of 7 mm is more sensitive than 14 mm. Accordingly, the specimen with a thickness of 7 mm is a good option to be used as a weight measurement system.},

  abstract     = {Masonry is used as a construction material since old age. It is a cheaper construction material compared to R.C.C. and also requires comparatively less construction skills. During an earthquake, the masonry wall constructed following the codal provisions shows preliminary behaviour in the in-plane direction of wall and it has lesser deformation in the out-of-plane direction of the wall. Although, the strength and stiffness of the Un-Reinforced Masonry (URM) walls were reduce due to sizes and positions of openings, the relationship between the seismic capacity of the walls and the position and size of opening in walls are not clear. Researchers in the past mostly explored the in-plane behaviour of solid masonry wall without opening. Considering the openings in these walls can significantly affect the strength of the masonry wall. Hence, in the present study, an attempt is made to understand the effect of varying opening sizes (4 different combinations of door and/or window openings) in unreinforced masonry wall using finite element software CATIA. From this software, URM walls were modeled and load based quasi-static analysis were done in in-plane direction. The collapse mechanisms of the masonry walls and crack patterns are studied from the analysis and a key output from this work is the characterization of the relationships between the sizes and positions of openings and the in-plane performance of masonry walls.},

  abstract     = {Aircraft components have different functions and characteristics, for example, the bolt and nut pressure switch of Cessna Grand Caravan 208B, which functions to determine the pressure of oil and fuel flowing. At the end of the bolt and nut, there is a small hole to press the sensor in the component, then the result of the pressure will be converted to the system and sent to the indicator located in the cockpit, so the pilot sees the actual in the cockpit. The purpose in this research was to determine the characteristics of the bolt and nut pressure switch. This study used chemical composition, Vickers hardness, and metallographic testing methods. The test results of the chemical composition of bolt and nut on the pressure switch of Cessna Grand Caravan 208B, show that the elements, iron (Fe) = 67.58% and chromium (Cr) = 17.04%, are the dominant elements, therefore it is included as an alloying element of Fe-Cr. The test an average hardness value of 254.64 VHN. These values were obtained from the total percentage of iron 67.58% and chromium 17.04%. Chromium (Cr) is an element that can increase the hardness of carbon steel and increase corrosion resistance. Therefore, the hardness of the bolt and nut pressure switch of Cessna Grand Caravan 208B is high due to the addition of Cr which help the main element, Fe, properties. The novelty of this study is the dominant presence of chromium, so the properties of this material are hard, heat resistant, and corrosion resistant},

  abstract     = {Alternative synthesis methods are need of the hour to provide easy protocol for synthesizing biologically active heterocyclic compounds. In this connection, this paper describes the development of a concise, convergent protocol for diversely substituted Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of heteroaryl bromides and boronic acids under microwave irradiation using Sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) as a solid support as well as base. According to my knowledge, this is the first report of the strategy that involves the use of zinc as a catalyst on fused tricyclic di-halo quinolones in a solvent-free condition using simple microwave irradiation. Earlier research from the same laboratory established a solid support assisted Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction for forming C–C bonds under the influence of microwave irradiation. Therefore, sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) was attempted as a base and solid support instead of traditional mineral bases. Moreover, zinc was used as a catalyst replacing palladium. The new method is unique and effective due to its energy economy, procedural simplicity, and general applicability. Moreover, the use of Sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) is expected to extend this green-protocol and atom-friendly chemistry for the synthesis of varied heterocyclic compounds of interest.},
