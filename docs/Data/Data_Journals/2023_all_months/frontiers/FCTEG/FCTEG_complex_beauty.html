Examples range from animal group behaviors observed in nature to strategies used in team sports. This mini review goes over literature in multiagent systems that study group control in adversarial scenarios. We identify different ways of formulating adversaries and discuss various types of teaming behavior that arise. Specifically from the perspective of multiagent task assignment, the types of tasks and the nature of assignments brought by the adversary are categorized. The frontiers of the current literature and the direction for future research are discussed at the end.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a stochastic model predictive control approach combined with a time-series forecasting technique to tackle the problem of microgrid energy management in the face of uncertainty. The data-driven non-parametric chance constraint method is used to formulate chance constraints for stochastic model predictive control, while removing the dependency on probability density assumptions of uncertain variables and retaining the linear structure of the resulting optimization problem. The proposed approach is suitable for implementation on systems with limited computational power or limited memory storage, thanks to its simple linear structure and its ability to provide accurate results within pre-defined confidence levels, even when using small data batches. The proposed forecasting and stochastic model predictive control approaches are applied on a numerical example featuring a small grid-connected microgrid with PV generation, a battery storage system, and a non-controllable load, showing the ability to reduce costs by reducing the confidence level, and to satisfy pre-defined confidence levels.},

However, thermal processes in coal-fired power plants are usually difficult to model accurately, which limits the application of MPC to thermal power plants.Methods: To solve the problem, this paper proposes a process-model-free method for MPC via a reference model (RM)-based controller, i.e., a desired dynamic equational (DDE) proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller (DDE-PID).Results and Discussion: The DDE-PID can provide the design model and enhance the disturbance rejection ability for MPC. Simulations and results of field tests on a coal-fired unit show the superiorities of the proposed controller in reference tracking, disturbance rejection and robustness, which indicates the promising prospect of the field application of the MPC with DDE-PID, or MPC-DDE in short, to thermal power plants.},

The main components of Bi-SACOD include bi-level surrogate model construction (Bi-SMC), bi-level model management (Bi-MM), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) mixed-integer constrained evolutionary (PSO-MICE) search. Bi-SMC implements surrogate column model construction and feasible domain identification. Bi-MM combines surrogate column models with rigorous CDU simulations to perform model management, and PSO-MICE implements optimum search works. The optimization results of the CDUs indicate that Bi-SACOD outperforms the single-level surrogate column model approaches, and are more consistent with the rigorous CDU model optimization approach, whereas the evaluation numbers of the time-consuming rigorous models are significantly reduced.},

  abstract     = {Introduction: With conventional heart rate (HR) control systems, the exercising person is bound to walk or run at a pace determined by the feedback. This may be challenging for people with impairments that make it difficult for them to achieve a smooth, continuous pace. The aim of this work was to assess the technical feasibility of a novel self-paced heart rate control strategy and to compare its accuracy with conventional heart rate control.Methods: We propose a self-paced heart rate control system that embeds an automatic positioning controller within the heart rate control loop. The treadmill speed command is decoupled from the heart rate compensator, whereas speed is determined by the exerciser’s own volition: target speed is displayed visually to the person and, when they try to follow this target, the position controller sets the treadmill speed while keeping the person at a safe reference position on the track. A further novel contribution of this work is a new input-sensitivity-shaping, frequency-domain design strategy for feedback control of position.Results: Experimental evaluation with four participants showed that self-paced heart rate control is technically feasible: all participants were able to accurately follow the target running speed calculated by the HR compensator and presented to them visually; for all four participants, self-paced HR tracking accuracy was not substantially different from conventional HR control performance; on average, the self-paced heart rate controller gave slightly better performance than conventional HR control, with RMS tracking error of 2.98 beats per minute (bpm) vs 3.11 bpm and higher average control signal power.Conclusion: The proposed self-paced heart rate control strategy with embedded automatic position control is deemed feasible. This approach may be helpful for people with gait impairments or other limitations that make it difficult for them to follow an imposed treadmill speed.},

This paper proposes a trajectory-planning scheme and a trajectory-tracking control strategy for a Mecanum-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot by using artificial potential field and discrete integral terminal sliding mode, respectively. First, a discrete kinematic-and-dynamic model is established for the Mecanum-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot. Then, according to the positions of the robot, target, and obstacles, a reference an obstacle-avoidance trajectory is planned and updated iteratively by utilizing artificial potential field functions. Afterward, a discrete integral terminal sliding mode control algorithm is designed for the omnidirectional mobile robot such that the robot can track the planned trajectory accurately. Meanwhile, the stability of the control system is analyzed and guaranteed proved in the sense of Lyapunov. Last, simulations are executed in the scenarios of static obstacles and dynamic obstacles. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the presented methods.},

To solve this problem, shepherding offers a bio-inspired technique for navigating such a group of agents using external steering agents with appropriately designed movement law. Although most shepherding research is mainly based on the availability of centralized instructions, these assumptions are not realistic enough to solve some emerging application problems. Therefore, this paper presents a decentralized shepherding method where each steering agent makes movements based on its own observation without any inter-agent communication. Our numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing its high success rate and low costs in various placement patterns. These advantages particularly improve with the increase in the number of steering agents. We also confirm the robustness and resilience properties of the proposed method via numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {We consider perimeter defense problem in a planar conical environment with two cooperative heterogeneous defenders, i.e., a turret and a mobile vehicle, that seek to defend a concentric perimeter against mobile intruders. Arbitrary numbers of intruders are released at the circumference of the environment at arbitrary time instants and locations. Upon release, they move radially inwards with fixed speed towards the perimeter. The defenders are heterogeneous in terms of their motion and capture capabilities. Specifically, the turret has a finite engagement range and can only turn (clockwise or anti-clockwise) in the environment with fixed angular rate whereas, the vehicle has a finite capture radius and can move in any direction with unit speed. We present a competitive analysis approach to this perimeter defense problem by measuring the performance of multiple cooperative online algorithms for the defenders against arbitrary inputs, relative to an optimal offline algorithm that has information about the entire input sequence in advance. Specifically, we establish necessary conditions on the parameter space to guarantee finite competitiveness of any online algorithm. We then design and analyze four cooperative online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes in which they have finite competitive ratios. In particular, our first two algorithms are 1-competitive in specific parameter regimes, our third algorithm exhibits different competitive ratios in different regimes of problem parameters, and our fourth algorithm is 1.5-competitive in specific parameter regimes. Finally, we provide multiple numerical plots in the parameter space to reveal additional insights into the relative performance of our algorithms.},

The idea is to combine robust control with a high-level driving supervisor in order to successfully share control authority between the wheelchair user and the assistance system. This shared control strategy is composed of two parts, namely an operational part and a tactical part. Through the haptic joystick interface, this assistance system aims to reduce user’s effort when manipulating the joystick, guide the user to avoid any potential collisions, and maintain the active participation of the user in driving the wheelchair. In the operational part, an optimal Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control approach is proposed to deal with the time-varying user’s intention represented by his desired longitudinal and angular position errors and velocities and hand torques. The control design is formulated as an LMI optimization problem which can be easily solved with numerical solvers. Two unknown input observers for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model have been designed to estimate the user’s intention in order to generate an assistance torque via a haptic force feedback joystick. The control supervisor in the tactical part, aims to provide a decision-making signal which allows for the conflict management based on the user hand torque estimation. A specific algorithm has been developed to solve the conflict between the user’s desired actions and the suggestions from the assistance system to ensure the user remains the final decision-maker. Experimental results show the effectiveness and the validity of the proposed assistance system.},

To this end, we leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to develop an imitation learning framework that learns a mapping from defenders’ local perceptions and their communication graph to their actions. The proposed GNN-based learning network is trained by imitating a centralized expert algorithm such that the learned actions are close to that generated by the expert algorithm. We demonstrate that our proposed network performs closer to the expert algorithm and is superior to other baseline algorithms by capturing more intruders. Our GNN-based network is trained at a small scale and can be generalized to large-scale cases.

Results of the present review showed that shared control continues to be of interest to researchers of automated vehicles.

The proposed, pragmatic approach enhances the scope for controller and observer design by using local instead of global Lyapunov functions, beneficial for systems with widely spaced pole locations. Within this contribution, the proposed design approach is applied to the complex control design task of wind turbine control. As the mechanical loads that affect the wind turbine components are very sensitive to the closed-loop system dynamic, a maximum flexibility in the control design is necessary for an appropriate wind turbine controller performance. Therefore, the implication of the local Lyapunov approach for an effective control design in the Takagi-Sugeno framework is discussed based on the sensitivity of the closed-loop pole locations and resulting mechanical loads to a variation of the design parameters.},

  abstract     = {This paper reviews the recent works on multiplayer reach-avoid (M-RA) differential games between two adversarial teams in a game region which is split into a goal region and a play region. The pursuit team aims to protect the goal region from the evasion team by cooperatively capturing the evaders which start from the play region and strive to enter the goal region. We provide a selective overview of algorithms and theoretical results for multiplayer reach-avoid differential games. Specifically, we focus on point mass holonomic players that can move freely in the game region and have simple motions as Rufus Isaacs states. We describe how the challenges due to high-dimensional continuous joint action and state spaces, as well as complex cooperations and competitions among players, can be properly resolved by a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis of small-scale games and optimal task allocation. We finally point out the limitations of the current works and identify fruitful future research directions on theoretical studies of multiplayer reach-avoid differential games.},

  abstract     = {Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control is a durable control technology that has been widely applied in the process control industry. However, PID controllers cannot achieve satisfactory performance for oscillatory systems with long time delays; thus, high-order controllers like the proportional–integral–double derivative (&lt;mml:math id=&quot;m2&quot; xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msup&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;P&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;I&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;D&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;D&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt;&lt;/mml:msup&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;) can be adopted to enhance the control performance. In this paper, we propose a tuning formula for the &lt;mml:math id=&quot;m3&quot; xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msup&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;P&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;I&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;D&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;D&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt;&lt;/mml:msup&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt; controller for oscillatory systems with time delays and its practical implementation via an observer bandwidth-based state-space &lt;mml:math id=&quot;m4&quot; xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msup&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;P&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;I&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;D&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;D&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt;&lt;/mml:msup&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;. Simulation results show that the state-space &lt;mml:math id=&quot;m5&quot; xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msup&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;P&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;I&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;D&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;D&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt;&lt;/mml:msup&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt; controller tuned from the proposed formula trades-off among robustness, time domain performance, and measurement noise attenuation and can arrive at a better control effect than PID for oscillatory systems.},
