  abstract     = {The complex synthesis of emotions seen in music is meticulously composed using a wide range of aural components. Given the expanding soundscape and abundance of online music resources, creating a music recommendation system is significant. The area of music file emotion recognition is particularly fascinating. The RGRU (Enhanced Residual Gated Recurrent Unit), a complex architecture, is used in our study to look at MIDI (Musical Instrument and Digital Interface) compositions for detecting emotions. This involves extracting diverse features from the MIDI dataset, encompassing harmony, rhythm, dynamics, and statistical attributes. These extracted features subsequently serve as input to our emotion recognition model for emotion detection. We use an improved RGRU version to identify emotions and the Adaptive Red Fox Algorithm (ARFA) to optimize the RGRU hyperparameters. Our suggested model offers a sophisticated classification framework that effectively divides emotional content into four separate quadrants: positive-high, positive-low, negative-high, and negative-low. The Python programming environment is used to implement our suggested approach. We use the EMOPIA dataset to compare its performance to the traditional approach and assess its effectiveness experimentally. The trial results show better performance compared to traditional methods, with higher accuracy, recall, F-measure, and precision.},

In this article, we have proposed a consensus method that is having the potential to improve the scalability of the Private Blockchain. The system, at first, mitigates latency arising from kernel schedulers, ensuring that the application consistently has access to an available core for transaction processing. Secondly, the committee system alleviates the network&#39;s workload, preventing spurious transactions from monopolizing network resources and impeding its efficiency. Extensive experimentation is made by considering various scenarios of transaction with CPU isolation and application sticking to core 2 with varied priority. Based on the number of transactions performed per second, the proposed system is compared with different existing consensus mechanisms working in various types of Blockchains. Also, a detailed discussion is presented on the critical analysis of the adopted research mechanism. Overall, the proposed systems outperforms to other systems in various parameters of blockchain network scalability.},

  abstract     = {Fog Computing has emerged as a pivotal technology for enabling low-latency, context-aware, and efficient computing at the edge of the network. Effective task scheduling plays a vital role in optimizing the performance of fog computing systems. Traditional task scheduling algorithms, primarily designed for centralized cloud environments, often fail to cater to the dynamic, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained nature of Fog nodes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a sophisticated machine learning-driven methodology that adapts task allocation to the ever-changing Fog environment&#39;s conditions. Our approach amalgamates K-Means clustering algorithm enhanced with fuzzy logic, a robust unsupervised learning technique, to efficiently group Fog nodes based on their resource characteristics and workload patterns. The proposed method combines the clustering capabilities of K-means with the adaptability of fuzzy logic to dynamically allocate tasks to fog nodes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we demonstrate how tasks can be intelligently allocated to fog nodes, resulting in reducing execution time, response time and network usage. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed approach in dynamic fog environments. Clustering proves to be a time-effective method for identifying groups of jobs per virtual machine (VM) efficiently. To model and evaluate our proposed approach, we have utilized iFogSim. The simulation results affirm the effectiveness of our scheduling technique, showcasing significant enhancements in execution time reduction, minimized network utilization, and improved response time when compared to existing machine learning and non-machine learning based scheduling methods within the iFogSim framework.},

With the increasing interest in body-centric technologies, it is thus essential to understand how to build technologies that interface with human awareness without disrupting or requiring too many cognitive resources. In this paper, we build and evaluate a wearable system that uses different feedback types to alter human awareness (of the device). We further demonstrate how this awareness impacts cognitive load, sense of body-ownership, and sense of agency, which are often essential antecedents to successful and continued use. Moreover, we further investigate physiological signals, such as physiological synchrony, as well as qualitative reports in a multimodal analysis. Our results show that devices that provide feedback that deviate from expected behavior tend to generate higher amounts of explicit awareness, and that such increased awareness correlates with increased cognitive load, lower sense of agency and lower sense of body-ownership. Moreover, we find that interoceptive acuity correlates with diminished sense of agency. We discuss their implications for designing wearable body-centric systems that induce or disrupt different levels of awareness to deliver or diminish a sense of body-ownership and agency over the system.},

  abstract     = {In materials informatics, searching for chemical materials with desired properties is challenging due to the vastness of the chemical space. Moreover, the high cost of evaluating properties necessitates a search with a few clues. In practice, there is also a demand for proposing compositions that are easily synthesizable. In the real world, such as in the exploration of chemical materials, it is common to encounter problems targeting black-box objective functions where formalizing the objective function in explicit form is challenging, and the evaluation cost is high. In recent research, a Bayesian optimization method has been proposed to formulate the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem as a surrogate model for black-box objective functions with discrete variables. Regarding this method, studies have been conducted using the D-Wave quantum annealer to optimize the acquisition function, which is based on the surrogate model and determines the next exploration point for the black-box objective function. In this paper, we address optimizing a black-box objective function containing discrete variables in the context of actual chemical material exploration. In this optimization problem, we demonstrate results obtaining parameters of the acquisition function by sampling from a probability distribution with variance can explore the solution space more extensively than in the case of no variance. As a result, we found combinations of substituents in compositions with the desired properties, which could only be discovered when we set an appropriate variance.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are sensitive to perturbations and adversarial attacks. One hypothesized solution to adversarial robustness is to align manifolds in the embedded space of neural networks with biologically grounded manifolds. Recent state-of-the-art works that emphasize learning robust neural representations, rather than optimizing for a specific target task like classification, support the idea that researchers should investigate this hypothesis. While works have shown that fine-tuning ANNs to coincide with biological vision does increase robustness to both perturbations and adversarial attacks, these works have relied on proprietary datasets—the lack of publicly available biological benchmarks makes it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of these claims. Here, we deliver a curated dataset consisting of biological representations of images taken from two commonly used computer vision datasets, ImageNet and COCO, that can be easily integrated into model training and evaluation. Specifically, we take a large functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset (BOLD5000), preprocess it into representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), and establish an infrastructure that anyone can use to train models with biologically grounded representations. Using this infrastructure, we investigate the representations of several popular neural networks and find that as networks have been optimized for tasks, their correspondence with biological fidelity has decreased. Additionally, we use a previously unexplored graph-based technique, Fiedler partitioning, to showcase the viability of the biological data, and the potential to extend these analyses by extending RDMs into Laplacian matrices. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of utilizing our new biological benchmark to effectively enhance the robustness of models.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have ushered in a transformative era in wireless communication, reshaping the landscape of radio spectrum utilization and management. At the core of CRNs lies the pivotal capability to sense the radio frequency spectrum dynamically and adapt transmission parameters to preemptively address interference and optimize spectrum utilization. This article addresses the escalating challenges associated with Quality of Service (QoS) management in CRNs, exacerbated by their dynamic nature, especially in scenarios characterized by high mobility. Concurrently, the article underscores the critical significance of energy efficiency, given its direct implications on network operational costs and sustainability. To effectively navigate the intricate interplay between QoS and energy management in CRNs, we propose a Smart Sensing Enabled Dynamic Spectrum Management scheme (SSDSM). Within the SSDSM framework, cognitive user energy undergoes intelligent sensing, while QoS is governed through dynamic spectrum management. The proposed scheme optimizes service response time by refining fuzzy-based controllers and curtails energy consumption through periodic sensing triggered by predefined rules. Operationalizing within a centralized paradigm, the entire network is overseen by a central controlling node, tasked with formulating an optimal channel list using the SSDSM scheme and allocating it to cognitive users. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is evaluated and validated through rigorous testing using MATLAB. Results reveal tangible enhancements in system efficiency, encompassing maximized throughput, reduced handoff ratio, and minimized service response delay. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on advancing the performance metrics of cognitive radio networks in the pursuit of reliable and sustainable wireless communication services.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionWalking indoors, particularly at home, presents a distinct experience compared to the conventional pedestrian walking classically described. Our homes encompass intricate, confined, and cluttered architectural spaces that necessitate a predominantly curvilinear walking pattern. Despite the growing interest in studying our home, spurred by successive COVID-19 lockdowns, there remains a dearth of information regarding our walking behaviors inside homes, yet rich in data on the physical and sensory links between humans and their daily interior environment.MethodsThis study presents the outcomes of a controlled experiment conducted in an apartment in Montpellier, France. Participants were tasked with traversing the living room at a natural pace, encountering two natural obstacles-a large dining table and a small coffee table. They then walked back in opposite direction, circumnavigating the same two obstacles. To examine walking behavior within a pseudo-natural context, three conditions were tested: a controlled condition and two conditions that perturbed the natural curvilinear trajectory perceptually, by imposing an unpleasant sound, or physically, by suddenly displacing the coffee table between conditions. Twenty participants performed 30 trials in each condition. We approximated the position of their center of mass and computed various metrics related to their trajectories, including walking speed, obstacle clearance distance, its adaptation over time, and inter-trial trajectory variability.ResultsFindings revealed a greater visual clearance distance for the dining table compared to the coffee table, a difference reduced by the perturbation caused by displacing the coffee table. This clearing distance diminished with repetitions, showing that over time we tend to walk closer to obstacles around us. These adaptations were clearly the result of an active visuo-motor regulation, as evidenced by the reduced trajectory variability at, or just before, the location of the obstacles.DiscussionCollectively, these results demonstrate that walking at home is a flexible behavior necessitating continuous perceptual adaptations in our daily trajectories. These findings could contribute to a detailed analysis of walking indoors under natural conditions, and the investigated metrics could serve as a baseline for comparing the embodiment of physical and mental health in walking patterns, for instance during lockdowns. Furthermore, our findings have consequences for safer mediated human architecture interaction.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionHealthcare wearables allow researchers to develop various system approaches that recognize and understand the human emotional experience. Previous research has indicated that machine learning classifiers, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT), can improve the accuracy of physiological signal analysis and emotion recognition. However, various emotions can have distinct effects on physiological signal alterations. Therefore, solely relying on a single type of physiological signal analysis is insufficient for accurately recognizing and understanding human emotional experiences.MethodsResearch on multi-modal emotion recognition systems (ERS) has commonly gathered physiological signals using expensive devices, which required participants to remain in fixed positions in the lab setting. This limitation restricts the potential for generalizing the ERS technology for peripheral use in daily life. Therefore, considering the convenience of data collection from everyday devices, we propose a multi-modal physiological signals-based ERS based on peripheral signals, utilizing the DEAP database. The physiological signals selected for analysis include photoplethysmography (PPG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and skin temperature (SKT). Signal features were extracted using the “Toolbox for Emotional Feature Extraction from Physiological Signals” (TEAP) library and further analyzed with three classifiers: SVM, KNN, and DT.ResultsThe results showed improved accuracy in the proposed system compared to a single-modal ERS application, which also outperformed current DEAP multi-modal ERS applications.DiscussionThis study sheds light on the potential of combining multi-modal peripheral physiological signals in ERS for ubiquitous applications in daily life, conveniently captured using smart devices.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe days of dusty couches in therapists&#39; offices behind closed doors are long gone. Now, personalized mood tracking, therapy appointments and breathing exercises are just mere clicks (or taps) away: Technologies for self-care (SCTs) that focus on mental health are both a flourishing industry and an academic field of interest. As societal, and cultural artifacts, SCTs for mental health are imbued with values, worldviews, and assumptions about these concepts by their designers and developers. Here, current SCTs tend to lean toward a more medical(ised) approach due to being shaped by dominant views of mental health as an individualized issue. However, this approach is only one of many potential pedagogies and approaches. As an alternative, we explore what SCTs for mental health could be like, from a humanistic, person-centered standpoint: We conceptualize mental health in holistic terms, as an experiential quality of everyday life.MethodsTo this end, we report on two engagements with humanistic practitioners and the person-centered approach as a guiding principle: First, we ran a workshop informed by the Rogerian “encounter group”. This approach is focused on providing the space to meaningfully meet and relate to people. Inspired by this concept, we brought together humanistic practitioners to openly explore what technology for (self-)care means for them. Second, we build on the insights from the aforementioned study by organizing an asynchronous, online whiteboard for humanistic practitioners—counselors, students-in-training, therapists, and researchers—to explore their utopian, realistic and dystopian visions of SCTs.ResultsThrough thematic analysis and affinity-clustering these engagements, we construct an understanding that technology within a person-centered, humanistic context is a constrained, ambiguous undertaking, yet also one full of potential.DiscussionWe conclude the paper by sketching out three design opportunities for how the person-centered approach, and humanistic psychology in general could be integrated into caring technologies.},

The generated model can be used to simulate changes in the process configuration and to evaluate the expected performance of the processes before they are executed. Currently, these what-if scenarios are defined and assessed manually by the analysts. Besides the complexity of finding a suitable scenario for a desired performance, existing approaches simulate scenarios based on flow and data patterns leaving aside a resource-based analysis. Resources are critical on the process performance since they carry out costs, time, and quality.MethodsThis paper proposes a method to automate the discovery of optimal resource allocations to improve the performance of simulated what-if scenarios. We describe a model for individual resource allocation only to activities they fit. Then, we present how what-if scenarios are generated based on preference and collaboration allocation policies. The optimal resource allocations are discovered based on a user-defined multi-objective optimization function.Results and discussionThis method is integrated with a simulation environment to compare the trade-off in the performance of what-if scenarios when changing allocation policies. An experimental evaluation of multiple real-life and synthetic event logs shows that optimal resource allocations improve the simulation performance.},

  abstract     = {We are interested in benchmarking both quantum annealing and classical algorithms for minimizing quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. Such problems are NP-hard in general, implying that the exact minima of randomly generated instances are hard to find and thus typically unknown. While brute forcing smaller instances is possible, such instances are typically not interesting due to being too easy for both quantum and classical algorithms. In this contribution, we propose a novel method, called posiform planting, for generating random QUBO instances of arbitrary size with known optimal solutions, and use those instances to benchmark the sampling quality of four D-Wave quantum annealers utilizing different interconnection structures (Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr hardware graphs) and the simulated annealing algorithm. Posiform planting differs from many existing methods in two key ways. It ensures the uniqueness of the planted optimal solution, thus avoiding groundstate degeneracy, and it enables the generation of QUBOs that are tailored to a given hardware connectivity structure, provided that the connectivity is not too sparse. Posiform planted QUBOs are a type of 2-SAT boolean satisfiability combinatorial optimization problems. Our experiments demonstrate the capability of the D-Wave quantum annealers to sample the optimal planted solution of combinatorial optimization problems with up to 5, 627 qubits.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionWhen we taste, we take in a variety of sensory information that can be completely independent from the properties of the food itself: the ambient lighting and environmental sounds can all influence our taste perception and affective responses. However, current multisensory research is mixed as to whether these In Real Life (IRL) findings also apply to Extended Reality (XR) environments. A potential reason for this may be the limited realism of some XR scenarios, which this study aimed to overcome through an immersive Virtual Reality experience (VR, chosen for its greater realism relative to other XR applications) whilst also expanding the scope to flavour perception.MethodsA total of 34 participants rated food samples under neutral, red, and green ambient lighting in VR. Participants ate either lime flavoured, strawberry flavoured, or “Neutral” (no added flavour) samples.ResultsWhile participants were equally immersed in all three environments, they rated the red and green lighting environments as substantially less natural than the neutral lighting environment. Interestingly, while participants associated sweetness and sourness with red lighting and green lighting respectively, this minimally extended to their behavioural ratings, when sampling the stimuli in VR. Samples eaten under red lighting were rated as significantly sweeter than those eaten under neutral lighting. However, neither red nor green lighting affected sample sourness nor the intensity of strawberry or lime flavour.DiscussionThis study found limited evidence of multisensory integration in XR, wherein taste expectations do not extend to taste experiences. We discuss these results in light of prior works on crossmodal associations and raise a reflection on why multisensory integration of taste may not apply to XR in our study. While there is much excitement about the opportunities XR can offer, we argue that we are only at the beginning of understanding the experiences on the reality-virtuality continuum and that we need to establish a richer understanding of participants&#39; experiences, expectations, and taste/flavour perceptions between IRL and XR.},

  abstract     = {This paper begins with a description of methods for estimating probability density functions for images that reflects the observation that such data is usually constrained to lie in restricted regions of the high-dimensional image space—not every pattern of pixels is an image. It is common to say that images lie on a lower-dimensional manifold in the high-dimensional space. However, although images may lie on such lower-dimensional manifolds, it is not the case that all points on the manifold have an equal probability of being images. Images are unevenly distributed on the manifold, and our task is to devise ways to model this distribution as a probability distribution. In pursuing this goal, we consider generative models that are popular in AI and computer vision community. For our purposes, generative/probabilistic models should have the properties of (1) sample generation: it should be possible to sample from this distribution according to the modeled density function, and (2) probability computation: given a previously unseen sample from the dataset of interest, one should be able to compute the probability of the sample, at least up to a normalizing constant. To this end, we investigate the use of methods such as normalizing flow and diffusion models. We then show how semantic interpretations are used to describe points on the manifold. To achieve this, we consider an emergent language framework that makes use of variational encoders to produce a disentangled representation of points that reside on a given manifold. Trajectories between points on a manifold can then be described in terms of evolving semantic descriptions. In addition to describing the manifold in terms of density and semantic disentanglement, we also show that such probabilistic descriptions (bounded) can be used to improve semantic consistency by constructing defenses against adversarial attacks. We evaluate our methods on CelebA and point samples for likelihood estimation with improved semantic robustness and out-of-distribution detection capability, MNIST and CelebA for semantic disentanglement with explainable and editable semantic interpolation, and CelebA and Fashion-MNIST to defend against patch attacks with significantly improved classification accuracy. We also discuss the limitations of applying our likelihood estimation to 2D images in diffusion models.},

  abstract     = {Charisma is considered as one&#39;s ability to attract and potentially influence others. Clearly, there can be considerable interest from an artificial intelligence&#39;s (AI) perspective to provide it with such skill. Beyond, a plethora of use cases opens up for computational measurement of human charisma, such as for tutoring humans in the acquisition of charisma, mediating human-to-human conversation, or identifying charismatic individuals in big social data. While charisma is a subject of research in its own right, a number of models exist that base it on various “pillars,” that is, dimensions, often following the idea that charisma is given if someone could and would help others. Examples of such pillars, therefore, include influence (could help) and affability (would help) in scientific studies, or power (could help), presence, and warmth (both would help) as a popular concept. Modeling high levels in these dimensions, i. e., high influence and high affability, or high power, presence, and warmth for charismatic AI of the future, e. g., for humanoid robots or virtual agents, seems accomplishable. Beyond, also automatic measurement appears quite feasible with the recent advances in the related fields of Affective Computing and Social Signal Processing. Here, we therefore present a brick by brick blueprint for building machines that can appear charismatic, but also analyse the charisma of others. We first approach the topic very broadly and discuss how the foundation of charisma is defined from a psychological perspective. Throughout the manuscript, the building blocks (bricks) then become more specific and provide concrete groundwork for capturing charisma through artificial intelligence (AI). Following the introduction of the concept of charisma, we switch to charisma in spoken language as an exemplary modality that is essential for human-human and human-computer conversations. The computational perspective then deals with the recognition and generation of charismatic behavior by AI. This includes an overview of the state of play in the field and the aforementioned blueprint. We then list exemplary use cases of computational charismatic skills. The building blocks of application domains and ethics conclude the article.},

While this approach has shown promise as an alternative to classical sampling methods, the limitations of quantum annealing hardware, such as the number of qubits and the lack of connectivity between the qubits, still pose a barrier to wide-scale adoption. We propose the use of multiple software techniques such as dropout method, passive labeling, and parallelization techniques for addressing these hardware limitations. The study found that using these techniques along with quantum sampling showed comparable results to its classical counterparts in certain contexts, while in others the increased complexity of the sampling process hindered the performance of the trained models. This means that further research into the behavior of quantum sampling needs to be done to apply quantum annealing to training tasks of more complicated RBM models.},

  abstract     = {We investigate a framework for binary image denoising via restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) that introduces a denoising objective in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form well-suited for quantum annealing. The denoising objective is attained by balancing the distribution learned by a trained RBM with a penalty term for derivations from the noisy image. We derive the statistically optimal choice of the penalty parameter assuming the target distribution has been well-approximated, and further suggest an empirically supported modification to make the method robust to that idealistic assumption. We also show under additional assumptions that the denoised images attained by our method are, in expectation, strictly closer to the noise-free images than the noisy images are. While we frame the model as an image denoising model, it can be applied to any binary data. As the QUBO formulation is well-suited for implementation on quantum annealers, we test the model on a D-Wave Advantage machine, and also test on data too large for current quantum annealers by approximating QUBO solutions through classical heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Classification of school violence has been proven to be an effective solution for preventing violence within educational institutions. As a result, technical proposals aimed at enhancing the efficacy of violence classification are of considerable interest to researchers. This study explores the utilization of the SORT tracking method for localizing and tracking objects in videos related to school violence, coupled with the application of LSTM and GRU methods to enhance the accuracy of the violence classification model. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a padding box to localize, identify actions, and recover tracked objects lost during video playback. The integration of these techniques offers a robust and efficient system for analyzing and preventing violence in educational environments. The results demonstrate that object localization and recovery algorithms yield improved violent classification outcomes compared to both the SORT tracking and violence classification algorithms alone, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 72.13%. These experimental findings hold promise, especially in educational settings, where the assumption of camera stability is justifiable. This distinction is crucial due to the unique characteristics of violence in educational environments, setting it apart from other forms of violence.},

  abstract     = {In the ever-evolving landscape of deep learning, novel designs of neural network architectures have been thought to drive progress by enhancing embedded representations. However, recent findings reveal that the embedded representations of various state-of-the-art models are mappable to one another via a simple linear map, thus challenging the notion that architectural variations are meaningfully distinctive. While these linear maps have been established for traditional non-adversarial datasets, e.g., ImageNet, to our knowledge no work has explored the linear relation between adversarial image representations of these datasets generated by different CNNs. Accurately mapping adversarial images signals the feasibility of generalizing an adversarial defense optimized for a specific network. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of a linear mapping of adversarial inputs between different models that can be exploited to develop such model-agnostic, generalized adversarial defense. We further propose an experimental setup designed to underscore the concept of this model-agnostic defense. We train a linear classifier using both adversarial and non-adversarial embeddings within the defended space. Subsequently, we assess its performance using adversarial embeddings from other models that are mapped to this space. Our approach achieves an AUROC of up to 0.99 for both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.},

To address this gap, we conducted a usability evaluation of two websites and three browser extensions. Using a mixed methods approach, data from a heuristic evaluation and a moderated, task-based usability evaluation are analyzed in triangulation with data collected using summative evaluations. Challenges are identified to stem from users’ inability to understand results due to the presentation of information, unclear terminology, or lack of explanations. As a solution, we recommend four design principles: First is to establish credibility, second is to improve the general visual layout and design of the tools, third is to improve search capabilities, and finally, heavy importance should be given to the depth and presentation of information.},

  abstract     = {The current outsourcing of maintenance and the use of technological devices to automatically care for plants in buildings change the spatial experience between human office occupants and plants. This caretaker system distances people from plants, inclining us to regard them more as decorative objects. The relationship between humans and plants in a building is often unidirectional, with plants providing humans multiple benefits such as improved health and well-being, and increased worker productivity. In our human-plant interaction study, we developed a layer of care infrastructure within an office building that gives agency to people as a collective to interact with and take care of other non-human beings; that is, plants. In re-imagining mediated human-building interaction, we employed technology as an ambient mediator where people, plants and technology comprised the plant care system in a typical office building. A year-long design intervention was introduced within a typical office floor using artifacts (pots, shelves, and digital system) which we fabricated for the plants. From the results of an 8 week participation experiment together with data from qualitative interviews of 6 study participants, we identified five themes: Technology, Object/Thing, Infrastructuring, Commoning, and Care. Our analysis of these themes informs a care infrastructuring approach where both humans and plants become interdependent office co-inhabitants. By entangling with technology, care, and others, we present an infrastructuring layer to mediate human-building interactions with plants.},

The application of intelligent automation leveraging artificial intelligence and cloud computing to deliver continuous value from software is in its nascent stage across the industry and is evolving rapidly. The advent of agile methodologies with DevOps has increased software quality and accelerated its delivery. Numerous software organizations have adopted DevOps to develop and operate their software systems and improve efficiency. Software organizations try to implement DevOps activities by taking advantage of various expert services. The adoption of DevOps by software organizations is beset with multiple challenges. These issues can be overcome by understanding and structurally addressing the pain points. This paper presents the preliminary analysis of the interviews with the relevant stakeholders. Ground truths were established and applied to evaluate various machine learning algorithms to compare their accuracy and test our hypothesis. This study aims to help researchers and practitioners understand the adoption of DevOps and the contexts in which the DevOps practices are viable.

The website consists of 12 lessons, categorized by grade levels (1st–2nd grade, 3rd–4th grade, and 5th–6th grade), and includes an interactive question-answer section. Users can scroll down after reading the lessons and practice questions based on the visualizations. The website also has the potential to incorporate games related to data and visualization. The lessons are implemented using React.js and Java with the Spring framework, and new lessons can easily be added by storing them in a markdown folder. The website features a navigation bar with tabs for Home, Lessons, Games, About, and Contact. Additionally, a feedback form is included to gather user feedback for further improvements. The website is currently in the testing stage, and future surveys for teachers and elementary school students will be added to enhance the features provided.

  abstract     = {How cost-efficient are potential infrastructure sharing business models for the 5G era (and beyond)? This significant question needs to be addressed if we are to deliver universal affordable broadband in line with Target 9.1 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Although almost two-thirds of the global population is now connected, many users still lack access to high-speed and reliable broadband connectivity. Indeed, some of the largest connectivity issues are associated with those living in areas of low economic viability. Consequently, this assessment evaluates the cost implications of different infrastructure sharing business models using a techno-economic assessment framework. The results indicate that a rural 5G neutral host network (NHN) strategy helps to reduce total cost between 10 and 50% compared with other sharing strategies. We also find that, compared to a baseline strategy with No Sharing, the net present value of rural 5G sharing strategies can earn between 30 and 90% more profit. The network upgrades to 5G using various sharing strategies are most sensitive to changes in the average revenue per user, the adoption rate, and the amount of existing site infrastructure. For example, the results from this study show that a 20% variation in demand revenue is estimated to increase the net present value of the sharing strategies by 2–5 times compared to the No Sharing strategy. Similarly, a 10% increase in existing infrastructure lowers the net present value by 8–30%. The infrastructure sharing strategies outlined in this study have the potential to enhance network viability while bridging the digital divide in remote and rural locations.},

  abstract     = {Music educators and researchers have grown increasingly aware of the need for traditional musical practices to promote inclusive music for disabled people. Inclusive music participation has been addressed by Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs), which welcome different ways of playing and perceiving music, with considerable impact on music-making for disabled people. ADMIs offer exciting possibilities for instrument design to consider and incorporate individual constraints (e.g., missing arm, low vision, hearing loss, etc.) more than traditional acoustic instruments, whose generally fixed design allows little room for disabled musicians inclusivity. Relatively few works discuss ADMIs in the context of disability studies, and no work has investigated the impact of different disability models in the process of designing inclusive music technology. This paper proposes criteria to classify ADMIs according to the medical, social, and cultural models of disability, then applies these criteria to evaluate eleven ADMIs targeting d/Deaf people. This analysis allows us to reflect on the design of ADMIs from different perspectives of disability, giving insights for future projects and deepening our understanding of medical, social, and cultural aspects of accessible music technology.},

Hospitals are susceptible environments that require special attention since sound can aggravate patients&#39; health issues and negatively impact the performance of healthcare professionals. This paper focuses on Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) as an especially sensitive case representing a hostile acoustic environment in which healthcare professionals have little awareness of how unwanted sounds impact the perceived quality of the soundscape. We performed a semi-systematic review of scientific literature on sound assessment studies in NICU from 2001. A thematic analysis was performed to identify emerging themes that informed the analysis of 27 technological solutions for the assessment of sound quality in indoor and outdoor environments. Solutions were categorized by functions and evaluation methods and grouped according to the characteristics of the design components, i.e., acquisition, computation, and communication strategies. Results highlight a lack of solutions to assess the qualitative characteristics of indoor environments such as NICU and forecast the footprint that different sound sources have on the indoor soundscape. Such solutions are urgently needed to empower healthcare professionals, and especially nurses, to actively modify and prevent the negative impact of unwanted sounds on NICU and critical care soundscape.},

It contributes an analysis and synthesis of pedagogic research with 55 experienced accessibility educators in higher education and the workplace, in the UK and internationally, drawing on insights from expert panel methods including interviews, forums and focus groups. We find that digital accessibility is identified as a necessary core competency for an inclusive digital world. We examine the prevalent approaches that experienced workplace educators use to establish foundational awareness and understanding of accessibility to enable learners to achieve core learning objectives. We report the challenges that workplace educators face, negotiating different contexts and working practices and adapting foundational learning experiences to meet the pedagogic demands of different roles, responsibilities, and specialist advancement. In doing so, we demonstrate that establishing a common foundation of awareness and understanding is the basis for a pedagogic framework for digital accessibility education, with relevance for both workplace and academic settings.},

  abstract     = {In this article, I consider how scientific theories may explain architectural atmosphere. Architects use atmosphere to refer to a holistic, emergent property of a space that partly determines the mood of inhabitants. It is said to be a “subtle, intangible, ambient quality of a place” that also significantly shapes the way we interact with a space. It is caused by the way light, texture, materials, layout, geometry, acoustics, smell, and other perceptual properties influence affect. But it goes beyond these individually because of non-linear interactions between them. In sections one and two, I explain what an externalist account of the atmosphere would look like. This is an interpretation that objectifies the atmosphere, treating it as a complex causal property of buildings and spaces, accessible to scientific study through ethnographic research, through quantifying and minutely observing and recording humans and the buildings they are in, and then using machine learning and statistical analyses to identify correlations. The goal is to push the identification of the underlying external attributes as far as possible, ultimately to where a machine might enter a room, move around, and then label its atmosphere. In section three, I explore an internalist or subjectivist account of the atmosphere. This is the position that pushes back on machine identification of atmospheres. A subjectivist interpretation is harder to study scientifically because it involves knowing so much about the inner state and the history of a person. Culture, incoming mood, prior experience and associations, interests, tasks, social interaction, and more may all affect mood. Section four explores the frequently underestimated role—on emotion and space comprehension—played by the tasks that occupants perform while in a space, and the way their surrounding social and technological context intrudes on their encounter. I introduce and defend the view that tasks, social context, and nearby technology situate a person in a different environment than when they are inactive. This complicates the search for atmosphere. Nonetheless, I end on an optimistic note that there may yet be a place for atmosphere in the neuroscience of architecture, but it will be much different than our current thinking.},

  abstract     = {Global maritime transportation and logistics systems are essential parts of critical infrastructures in every society, and a crucial part of maritime logistics processes are seaports. In the coming years, digitalization and increased levels of autonomy in logistic transport chains are expected to take leaps forward. This development can help create safer, more efficient, more sustainable, and more reliable service chains to meet the requirements for a better quality of life and global prosperity. Port and harbor operations connect the maritime transport to other modes of transportation and enable multimodal transportation. Smart ports play a central role in future transport logistics and supply chains. Digitalization helps improve the efficiency of terminal systems in the processes of these ports. In the best cases, digitalization can also promote the reduction of emissions by optimizing port operations and enhancing cargo and people flows while improving the experience for all stakeholders. The improvement of port processes relies on the development of information and communication technology (ICT) as well as on industrial control systems (ICS) and operation technologies (OT). At the same time, the cyber security of maritime logistics also needs to be addressed. This article presents our findings related to the Sea4Value research goal on cyber security, which is a comprehensive cyber security architecture for port services at the system level. The article emphasizes the importance of a system of systems approach in terms of a comprehensive cyber security management process for port ecosystems. The description and recognition of management steps of every stakeholder are the key elements in this kind of process.},

  abstract     = {Online live-streaming has become an essential segment of the music industry in the post-COVID- era. However, methods to enhance interaction between musicians and listeners at online concerts are yet to be adequately researched. In this pilot study, we propose Heart Fire, a system to promote musician-listener interaction that visualizes the listeners&#39; mental states using a smartwatch-based architecture. Accordingly, the listeners&#39; heart rates are first measured using a Galaxy smartwatch and then processed into a real-time animation of a burning flame, whose intensity is dependent on the heart rate, using Azure Kinect and TouchDesigner. The feasibility of the proposed system was confirmed using an experiment involving ten subjects. Each subject selected two types of music-cheerful and relaxing. The BPM and energy of each song were measured, and each subject&#39;s heart rate was monitored. Subsequently, each subject was asked to answer a questionnaire about the emotions they experienced. The results demonstrated that the proposed system is capable of visualizing audience response to music in real time.},

  abstract     = {The Artificial-Social-Agent (ASA) questionnaire is an instrument for evaluating human-ASA interaction. It consists of 19 constructs and related dimensions measured by either 24 questionnaire items (short version) or 90 questionnaire items (long version). The questionnaire was built and validated by a research community effort to make evaluation results more comparable between agents and findings more generalizable. The current questionnaire is in English, which limits its use to only a population with an adequate command of the English language. Translating the questionnaire into more languages allows for the inclusion of other populations and the possibility of comparing them. Therefore, this paper presents a Mandarin Chinese translation of the questionnaire. After three construction cycles that included forward and backward translation, we gave both the final version of the translated and original English questionnaire to 242 bilingual crowd-workers to evaluate 14 ASAs. Results show on average a good level of correlation on the construct/dimension level (ICC M = 0.79, SD = 0.09, range [0.61, 0.95]) and on the item level (ICC M = 0.62, SD = 0.14, range [0.19, 0.92]) between the two languages for the long version, and for the short version (ICC M = 0.66, SD = 0.12, range [0.41, 0.92]). The analysis also established correction values for converting questionnaire item scores between Chinese and English questionnaires. Moreover, we also found systematic differences in English questionnaire scores between the bilingual sample and a previously collected mixed-international English-speaking sample. We hope this and the Chinese questionnaire translation will motivate researchers to study human-ASA interaction among a Chinese literate population and to study cultural similarities and differences in this area.},

This study summarizes the development of one such technological system—The Modular Accessible Musical Instrument Technology Toolkit (MAMI Tech Toolkit). The four tools in the toolkit and accompanying software were developed over 5 years using an action research methodology. A range of stakeholders across four research sites were involved in the development. This study outlines the methodological process, the stakeholder involvement, and how the data were used to inform the design of the toolkit. The accessibility of the toolkit is also discussed alongside findings that have emerged from the process. This study adds to the established canon of research around accessible digital musical instruments by documenting the creation of an accessible toolkit grounded in both theory and practical application of third-wave human–computer interaction methods. This study contributes to the discourse around the use of participatory and iterative methods to explore issues with, and barriers to, active music-making with music technology. Outlined is the development of each of the novel tools in the toolkit, the functionality they offer, as well as the accessibility issues they address. The study advances knowledge around active music-making using music technology, as well as in working with diverse users to create these new types of systems.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundThe ability to maintain attention is crucial for achieving success in various aspects of life, including academic pursuits, career advancement, and social interactions. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a common symptom associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which can pose challenges for individuals affected by it, impacting their social interactions and learning abilities. To address this issue, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising tool for attention training with the ability to create personalized virtual worlds, providing a conducive platform for attention-focused interventions. Furthermore, leveraging physiological data can be instrumental in the development and enhancement of attention-training techniques for individuals.MethodsIn our preliminary study, a functional prototype for attention therapy systems was developed. In the current phase, the objective is to create a framework called VR-PDA (Virtual Reality Physiological Data Analysis) that utilizes physiological data for tracking and improving attention in individuals. Four distinct training strategies such as noise, score, object opacity, and red vignette are implemented in this framework. The primary goal is to leverage virtual reality technology and physiological data analysis to enhance attentional capabilities.ResultsOur data analysis results revealed that reinforcement training strategies are crucial for improving attention in individuals with ASD, while they are not significant for non-autistic individuals. Among all the different strategies employed, the noise strategy demonstrates superior efficacy in training attention among individuals with ASD. On the other hand, for Non-ASD individuals, no specific training proves to be effective in enhancing attention. The total gazing time feature exhibited benefits for participants with and without ASD.DiscussionThe results consistently demonstrated favorable outcomes for both groups, indicating an enhanced level of attentiveness. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different strategies for attention training and emphasize the potential of virtual reality (VR) and physiological data in attention training programs for individuals with ASD. The results of this study open up new avenues for further research and inspire future developments.},

  abstract     = {Quantum annealing has emerged as a powerful platform for simulating and optimizing classical and quantum Ising models. Quantum annealers, like other quantum and/or analog computing devices, are susceptible to non-idealities including crosstalk, device variation, and environmental noise. Compensating for these effects through calibration refinement or “shimming” can significantly improve performance but often relies on ad-hoc methods that exploit symmetries in both the problem being solved and the quantum annealer itself. In this tutorial, we attempt to demystify these methods. We introduce methods for finding exploitable symmetries in Ising models and discuss how to use these symmetries to suppress unwanted bias. We work through several examples of increasing complexity and provide complete Python code. We include automated methods for two important tasks: finding copies of small subgraphs in the qubit connectivity graph and automatically finding symmetries of an Ising model via generalized graph automorphism. We conclude the tutorial by surveying additional methods, providing practical implementation tips, and discussing limitations and remedies of the calibration procedure.

Medical imaging and deep learning methods are increasingly attractive for identifying and segmenting kidney tumors. Convolutional neural networks have successfully classified and segmented images, enabling clinicians to recognize and segment tumors effectively. CT scans of kidneys aid in tumor assessment and morphology study, using semantic segmentation techniques for pixel-level identification of kidney and surrounding anatomy. Accurate diagnostic procedures are crucial for early detection of kidney cancer.MethodsThis paper proposes an EfficientNet model for complex segmentation by linking the encoder stage EfficientNet with U-Net. This model represents a more successful system with improved encoder and decoder features. The Intersection over Union (IoU) metric quantifies model performance.Results and DiscussionThe EfficientNet models showed high IoU_Scores for background, kidney, and tumor segmentation, with mean IoU_Scores ranging from 0.976 for B0 to 0.980 for B4. B7 received the highest IoU_Score for segmenting kidneys, while B4 received the highest for segmenting tumors. The study utilizes the KiTS19 dataset for contrast-enhanced CT images. Using Semantic segmentation for EfficientNet Family U-Net Models, our method proved even more reliable and will aid doctors in accurate tumor detection and image classification for early diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) has produced many opportunities, but also new risks that must be actively managed, particularly in the health care sector with clinical practice to avoid unintended health, economic, and social consequences.MethodsGiven that much of the research and development (R&amp;amp;D) involving human subjects is reviewed and rigorously monitored by institutional review boards (IRBs), we argue that supplemental questions added to the IRB process is an efficient risk mitigation technique available for immediate use. To facilitate this, we introduce AI supplemental questions that provide a feasible, low-disruption mechanism for IRBs to elicit information necessary to inform the review of AI proposals. These questions will also be relevant to review of research using AI that is exempt from the requirement of IRB review. We pilot the questions within the Department of Veterans Affairs–the nation&#39;s largest integrated healthcare system–and demonstrate its efficacy in risk mitigation through providing vital information in a way accessible to non-AI subject matter experts responsible for reviewing IRB proposals. We provide these questions for other organizations to adapt to fit their needs and are further developing these questions into an AI IRB module with an extended application, review checklist, informed consent, and other informational materials.ResultsWe find that the supplemental AI IRB module further streamlines and expedites the review of IRB projects. We also find that the module has a positive effect on reviewers&#39; attitudes and ease of assessing the potential alignment and risks associated with proposed projects.DiscussionAs projects increasingly contain an AI component, streamlining their review and assessment is important to avoid posing too large of a burden on IRBs in their review of submissions. In addition, establishing a minimum standard that submissions must adhere to will help ensure that all projects are at least aware of potential risks unique to AI and dialogue with their local IRBs over them. Further work is needed to apply these concepts to other non-IRB pathways, like quality improvement projects.},

The present study investigates the factors that influence the behavioral use of learners to use blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in e-learning. The study proposes the integrated model of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Information System (IS) success Model that include perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, system quality, information quality, and service quality as antecedents to behavioral use of blockchain and AI in e-learning. The model also examines the moderating effect of learner self-efficacy on the relationship between behavioral use and e-learning engagement and performance. The study collected data from 322 respondents and analyzed the data using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with a bootstrapping technique. The results show that the factors of TAM model and IS model have the significant and positive effects on behavior to use blockchain and AI in e-learning. Additionally, learner self-efficacy has a significant positive effect on e-learning engagement and performance, but it does not moderate the relationship between behavior to use blockchain or AI and e-learning engagement and performance. Overall, the study provides insights into the factors that influence the adoption of blockchain and AI in e-learning and offers practical implications for educators and policymakers.},

  abstract     = {Several research works propose non-textual alternatives to textual documentation and similar forms of representing information in software development. This is because of the problems that stem from writing these documents, which range from incomprehensible requirements to ambiguous user stories. The various proposals of researchers often contain some trace of oral or visual communication. In this paper, we study the implications of eliminating textual communication and substituting unnecessary writing by extracting the values of West African oral storytellers. Traditional West African communities did not make use of writing for thousands of years and yet their legends, customs, beliefs, and knowledge were effectively transmitted across several generations. How did they manage to accomplish this? What can we learn from their storytellers? How can these lessons be applied to software products? These are all questions that this paper attempts to answer. Perhaps if we fully understand how they operated, then we can target our written communication to the activities where it is needed instead of spreading writing across plenty of tasks as it is currently. To achieve this, we performed an analysis of the two domains: West African oral storytelling and software development and found similarities, then selected some key elements from oral storytelling and explained how they can have relevance in software development. The theme directly encompasses diversity and inclusion by bringing into software engineering a perspective of a region where its literacy research is scarcely being explored. The study found that traditional oral storytelling can provide insights into effective communication and audience engagement, and identified four ways in which software development can be compared to oral storytelling. The study also found that certain elements of storytelling, such as audience relationship, story structure, parables and proverbs, and community relaxation and support, can be applied to writing tasks in software development.},

  abstract     = {FemTech, technology often in the forms of apps developed to specifically target female health issues, have billions of users globally. Yet, despite the popularity of e.g., period trackers or pregnancy apps, we know little about the potential impact of these technologies, often developed outside controlled and regulated healthcare. How interactive technology is designed, and in our case the cycle represented through the design, has the potential to shape women&#39;s understanding of menstruation. In this study we analyse the interaction design of nine of the most downloaded menstruation apps, asking how commercial menstruation apps represent the cycle through their interaction design. While previous research has criticized these types of apps for lacking privacy and for enforcing normative ideals on women, they are often marketed in terms of female empowerment and users do indeed seem to find them very useful for period and fertility tracking. However, the term &#39;empowerment&#39; is today used broadly and is known for having many potential meanings. Even within the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), &#39;empowerment&#39; is used frequently but rarely explicitly defined. The question then becomes what empowerment could mean for menstruation tracking. In order to begin exploring the way menstruation and the period is represented in current apps and the way that future apps could design for empowerment, we engage in a comparative design investigation using what we call critical app-walkthrough methodology where an app&#39;s design is explored comprehensibly at one point in time and apps interacted with over a longer time period through researcher use-diares. Our results center around three ways in which these apps represent the cycle to users through design. We analyse; (1) interface metaphors used to represent the temporality of bleeding, (2) datafication of menstruation through input and output for intimate data tracking, and (3) the ways fertility predictions convey certainty over uncertainty. In a second step, we then explore what empowerment could mean for period trackers and how design could support empowering experiences. Finally, we present four design sensitivities meant to inspire designers to design for other types of period tracking experiences that might better empower bleeders. These are: support lived temporalities, embrace uncertainty, empower the self, and design less.},

  abstract     = {The standard physiological model has serious problems accounting for many aspects of vision, particularly when stimulus configurations become slightly more complex than the ones classically used, e.g., configurations of Gabors rather than only one or a few Gabors. For example, as shown in many publications, crowding cannot be explained with most models crafted in the spirit of the physiological approach. In crowding, a target is neighbored by flanking elements, which impair target discrimination. However, when more flankers are added, performance can improve for certain flanker configurations (uncrowding), which cannot be explained by classic models. As was shown, aspects of perceptual organization play a crucial role in uncrowding. For this reason, we tested here whether known principles of perceptual organization can explain crowding and uncrowding. The answer is negative. As shown with subjective tests, whereas grouping is indeed key in uncrowding, the four Gestalt principles examined here did not provide a clear explanation to this effect, as variability in performance was found between and within categories of configurations. We discuss the philosophical foundations of both the physiological and the classic Gestalt approaches and sketch a way to a happy marriage between the two.},

  abstract     = {Mid-level vision is the intermediate visual processing stage for generating representations of shapes and partial geometries of objects. Our mechanistic understanding of these operations is limited, in part, by a lack of computational tools for analyzing image properties at these levels of representation. We introduce the Mid-Level Vision (MLV) Toolbox, an open-source software that automatically processes low- and mid-level contour features and perceptual grouping cues from real-world images. The MLV toolbox takes vectorized line drawings of scenes as input and extracts structural contour properties. We also include tools for contour detection and tracing for the automatic generation of vectorized line drawings from photographs. Various statistical properties of the contours are computed: the distributions of orientations, contour curvature, and contour lengths, as well as counts and types of contour junctions. The toolbox includes an efficient algorithm for computing the medial axis transform of contour drawings and photographs. Based on the medial axis transform, we compute several scores for local mirror symmetry, local parallelism, and local contour separation. All properties are summarized in histograms that can serve as input into statistical models to relate image properties to human behavioral measures, such as esthetic pleasure, memorability, affective processing, and scene categorization. In addition to measuring contour properties, we include functions for manipulating drawings by separating contours according to their statistical properties, randomly shifting contours, or rotating drawings behind a circular aperture. Finally, the MLV Toolbox offers visualization functions for contour orientations, lengths, curvature, junctions, and medial axis properties on computer-generated and artist-generated line drawings. We include artist-generated vectorized drawings of the Toronto Scenes image set, the International Affective Picture System, and the Snodgrass and Vanderwart object images, as well as automatically traced vectorized drawings of set architectural scenes and the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS).},

  abstract     = {Interpersonal communication in the twenty-first century is increasingly taking place within digital media. This poses the problem of understanding the factors that may facilitate or hinder communication processes in virtual contexts. Digital media require a human-machine interface, and the analysis of human-machine interfaces traditionally focuses on the dimension of usability. However, interface usability pertains to the interaction of users with digital devices, not to the interaction of users with other users. Here we argue that there is another dimension of human-media interaction that has remained largely unexplored, but plays a key role in interpersonal communication within digital media: shareability. We define shareability as the resultant of a set of interface features that: (i) make sharing of materials with fellow users easy, efficient, and timely (sharing-related usability); (ii) include features that intuitively invite users to share materials (sharing-related affordances); and (iii) provide a sensorimotor environment that includes perceptual information about both presented materials and the behavior of other users that are experiencing these materials through the medium at hand (support to shared availability). Capitalizing on concepts from semiotics, proxemics, and perceptual and cognItive neuroscience, we explore potential criteria to asses shareability in human-machine interfaces. Finally, we show how these notions may be applied in the analysis of three prototypical cases: online gaming, visual communication on social media, and online distance teaching.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing exploits quantum mechanics to perform certain computations more efficiently than classical computers. Current quantum computers have performed carefully tailored computational tasks that would be difficult or impossible for even the fastest supercomputers in the world. This “quantum supremacy” result demonstrates that quantum computing is more powerful than classical computing in some computational regimes. At present, it is unknown if any computational problems related to the Earth&#39;s subsurface fall within these regimes. Here, we describe an approach to performing seismic inverse analysis that combines a type of quantum computer called a quantum annealer with classical computing. This approach improves upon past work on applying quantum computing to the subsurface (via subsurface hydrology) in two ways. First, the seismic inverse problem enables better performance from the quantum annealer because of the Earth&#39;s relatively narrow distribution of P-wave velocities compared to the broad distribution of hydraulic conductivities. Second, we develop an iterative approach to quantum-computational inverse analysis, which works with a realistic set of observations. By contrast, the previous method used an inverse method that depended on an impractically dense set of observations. In combination, these two advances significantly narrow the gap a quantum-computational advantage for a practical subsurface geoscience problem. Closing the gap completely requires more work, but has the potential to dramatically accelerate inverse analyses for subsurface geoscience.},

As most of the approaches are dedicated to reaching the best recognition accuracies, no attention has been put into analyzing the resilience of such methods given perturbed data, a likely occurrence in real in-the-wild testing scenarios. Our first contribution is to systematically validate the decrease in performance of current U-HAR state-of-the-art using perturbed or altered data (e.g., obtained by removing some skeletal joints, rotating the entire pose, and injecting geometrical aberrations). Then, we propose a novel framework based on a transformer encoder–decoder with remarkable de-noising capabilities to counter such perturbations effectively. Moreover, we also present additional losses to have robust representations against rotation variances and provide temporal motion consistency. Our model, SKELTER, shows limited drops in performance when skeleton noise is present compared with previous approaches, favoring its use in challenging in-the-wild settings.},

This practice involves marginalized bodies highlighting social issues through the ephemerality and spectacularity of digital technologies in public space in [smart] cities. Radical Placemaking methodology, as demonstrated through three design interventions, engages participatory action research, slow design, and open pedagogies for marginal bodies to create place-based digital artifacts. Through the making and experience of the artifacts, Radical Placemaking advances and simulates a virtual manifestation of the marginal beings&#39; bodies and knowledge in public spaces, made possible through emerging technologies.

AIS is used to identify vessels in maritime navigation, to plan shipping operations, and ensure safety. This data is collected and sold by global aggregators to maritime operators and industry stakeholders. However, AIS communications are vulnerable to malicious cyber activity, changing legal landscapes, adverse physical conditions, or intentional intervention. It is the latter we will focus on in this report. Often, we won&#39;t understand the motivation behind a decision to either switch off or manipulate AIS data. However, this decision can have real world impacts, including on relationships between nation states, and the physical safety of maritime personnel. We believe maritime OSINT may represent an effective method to assist in the management of AIS failures. Maritime OSINT not only captures important maritime information when AIS fails, but it provides valuable context, giving us the who, what, and why for vessel operations. In our cast study, we will use maritime OSINT to track sanctioned Russian oil exports, demonstrating how OSINT can be used in this example to inform sanctions compliance programs.},

  abstract     = {The successful integration of highly automated vehicles (HAV) in future mixed traffic environments will depend, among other things, on their seamless, safe, and accepted interaction with other road users. Therefore, appropriate combination of light signals, as external human-machine interface (eHMI), and driving behavior, as dynamic human-machine interface (dHMI), is required consistently in order to develop trust of following manual drivers in HAVs. Especially, in borderline traffic scenarios where HAVs are confronted with challenges, such as loss of connectivity, so-called minimal risk maneuvers (MRMs) are performed abruptly. Here, understanding communication via eHMI and dHMI is crucial for road safety, as drivers need to prepare for maneuvers themselves. Therefore, two consecutive, explorative online video studies were conducted. Firstly, the appropriate braking dynamics for an MRM were evaluated. Secondly, insights into the eHMI communication strategy of an HAV during an MRM were gained. The overall aim of this work is to present strategies for implicit and explicit communication channels of an HAV in order to promote learned trust during MRMs from the perspective of drivers who follow them. The results show that adding novel eHMI designs (e.g., warning sign, 360° LED light-band) to conventional light signals positively affects the user experience in a first contact interaction. The findings could have a positive impact on the development of trust in HAVs. In conclusion, specific eHMI communication strategies can be highly supportive for following manual drivers in MRM scenarios, which may lead to legislative considerations in the future.},

In this paper, we propose a new explanation method, SLISE, for interpreting predictions from black box models. SLISE can be used with any black box model (model-agnostic), does not require any modifications to the black box model (post-hoc), and explains individual predictions (local). We evaluate our method using real-world datasets and compare it against other model-agnostic, local explanation methods. Our approach solves shortcomings in other related explanation methods by only using existing data instead of sampling new, artificial data. The method also generates more generalizable explanations and is usable without modification across various data domains.},

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent interactive learning approaches has received a lot of attention in recent years due to the trend of incorporating intelligent algorithms. Intelligent interactive education tools have a significant positive impact on user engagement, motivation, and social outcomes. This study attempts to explore the existing models, methods and technologies of intelligent interactive learning including virtual and augmented reality. The method of the current study was a semi-systematic literature review. This study is expected to make a substantial contribution to research on the use of intelligent interactive learning applications in e-learning. It supports earlier research and suggests a wide range of pertinent subject areas that might be investigated to progress the field. These findings lead to recommendations for future research on intelligent interactive learning techniques in e-learning.},

In this paper, we take the first steps toward using well-being concepts to (re)design assistants. We motivate the problem by providing an overview of assistance technologies in the industrial context and their current state of development. Next, we elucidate and map the facets of psychological well-being at work, and highlight the importance of workplace eudaimonic well-being. To help designers and researchers adopt it as a design objective, we carried out a literature review to synthesize the state-of-the-art frameworks and methods that have been proposed to incorporate psychological well-being into design. Our investigation reveals that no one framework targets eudaimonic well-being, and more work may be necessary to develop a comprehensive approach that targets the various facets of workplace eudaimonic well-being. Consequently, we discuss challenges and opportunities for developing digital assistance that could foster employees&#39; psychological well-being.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe purpose of the Stakeholder Playbook is to enable the developers of explainable AI systems to take into account the different ways in which different stakeholders or role-holders need to “look inside” the AI/XAI systems.MethodWe conducted structured cognitive interviews with senior and mid-career professionals who had direct experience either developing or using AI and/or autonomous systems.ResultsThe results show that role-holders need access to others (e.g., trusted engineers and trusted vendors) for them to be able to develop satisfying mental models of AI systems. They need to know how it fails and misleads as much as they need to know how it works. Some stakeholders need to develop an understanding that enables them to explain the AI to someone else and not just satisfy their own sense-making requirements. Only about half of our interviewees said they always wanted explanations or even needed better explanations than the ones that were provided. Based on our empirical evidence, we created a “Playbook” that lists explanation desires, explanation challenges, and explanation cautions for a variety of stakeholder groups and roles.DiscussionThis and other findings seem surprising, if not paradoxical, but they can be resolved by acknowledging that different role-holders have differing skill sets and have different sense-making desires. Individuals often serve in multiple roles and, therefore, can have different immediate goals. The goal of the Playbook is to help XAI developers by guiding the development process and creating explanations that support the different roles.},

  abstract     = {The growing pervasiveness of digital technologies has exposed the entanglements of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with its surrounding context, from the immediate vicinity of interfaces to global issues. While often providing solutions to societal issues, interactive technologies also many times contribute to them. They impact and are impacted by the world, in a process of continuous mutual influence and co-constitution that raises important implications not only to user experience, effectiveness and efficiency, but also to ethics, social responsibility and environmental health. In this article, I draw on the new materialism notion of intra-action to propose a conceptual shift to a relational approach for HCI, which I refer to as Human-Computer Intra-Action (HCIA), capable of capturing from the outset the inherent relationships with the world that inform the design of interactive technology. To that end, I propose the notion of relationalities to reflect the synergies and antagonisms around those relationships, and discuss emerging notions of spatiality and temporality by considering the increasing hybridity of socio-technical engagements both in space (local vs. remote) and in time (immediate vs. stretched). Based on that, I propose a preliminary method for mapping intra-actions associated to interactive technologies, envisaged as a starting point to a relational take on their design process.},

Many papers are published on the topic of conceptual models in the IoT context, but it is difficult to assess the current status of the conceptual modeling approaches and methods for IoT systems. This paper presents an overview of the state of the art as well as discusses fundamental concepts, challenges and current research gaps with potential future agenda for conceptual modeling of IoT. Search facilities in the selected online repositories were used to identify the most relevant papers. The primary results were scanned and papers were selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Selected papers were assessed to extract data for the defined attributes. This paper confirms that there is a large body of research related to modeling of IoT systems. However, the results show that there is a lack of commonly agreed approaches and supporting formal methods for conceptual modeling of IoT systems. On the other hand, recent studies that apply model-based or model-driven development principles that use ontology or metamodel based approaches are promising due to systematic use of models as the primary means of a development process enabling for the dissemination of the methods further to the emerging fields such as smart cities, factories, transportation, hospitals, healthcare, hospitality and tourism, etc.},

In this context, discomfort is a fundamental precursor to a necessary adaptation which leads to the development of a new skill, practice, or state. The way in which discomfort is perceived, and when it is experienced, is often part of a rationale for rejecting or adopting a practice. Factors that influence the choice to accept or reject a practice of discomfort create opportunities for designing interactions that facilitate discomfort. Enabling effective engagement with discomfort may therefore open opportunities for increased personal development. We propose incorporating discomfort-as-material into our designs explicitly as a mechanism to make desired adaptations available to more of us, more effectively, and more of the time. To explore this possibility, we offer an overview of the physiology and neurology of discomfort in adaptation and propose three issues related to incorporating discomfort into design: preparation for discomfort, need for recovery, and value of the practice.},

  abstract     = {With the growing demand for data computation and communication, the size and complexity of communication networks have grown significantly. However, due to hardware and software problems, in a large-scale communication network (e.g., telecommunication network), the daily alarm events are massive, e.g., millions of alarms occur in a serious failure, which contains crucial information such as the time, content, and device of exceptions. With the expansion of the communication network, the number of components and their interactions become more complex, leading to numerous alarm events and complex alarm propagation. Moreover, these alarm events are redundant and consume much effort to resolve. To reduce alarms and pinpoint root causes from them, we propose a data-driven and unsupervised alarm analysis framework, which can effectively compress massive alarm events and improve the efficiency of root cause localization. In our framework, an offline learning procedure obtains results of association reduction based on a period of historical alarms. Then, an online analysis procedure matches and compresses real-time alarms and generates root cause groups. The evaluation is based on real communication network alarms from telecom operators, and the results show that our method can associate and reduce communication network alarms with an accuracy of more than 91%, reducing more than 62% of redundant alarms. In addition, we validate it on fault data coming from a microservices system, and it achieves an accuracy of 95% in root cause location. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method is more suitable for operation and maintenance analysis in communication networks.},

We also test whether top-down knowledge of the talker, manipulated as a “human” or “device” guise, mediates these attitudes and accommodation. Forty-six American English-speaking participants completed identical interactions with 6 talkers (2 from each dialect) and rated each talker on a variety of social factors. Accommodation was assessed with AXB perceptual similarity by a separate group of raters. Results show that speakers had the strongest positive social attitudes toward the Indian English voices and converged toward them more. Conversely, speakers rate the American English voices as less human-like and diverge from them. Finally, speakers overall show more accommodation toward TTS voices that were presented in a “human” guise.

In this study the system is evaluated in a workshop setting using quantitative as well as qualitative methods. One of the main findings was that the sounds from the ADMIs added to the musical context without making errors that impacted the music negatively even when the assistants mentioned experiencing a split between attending to different tasks, and a feeling of insecurity toward their musical contribution. We discuss the results in terms of how we perceive them as drivers or barriers toward reaching our overarching goal of organizing a joint concert that brings together students from the SEN school with students from a music school with a specific focus on traditional orchestral instruments.

In this paper, we examine the main features of HPE approaches and discuss whether or not those features are of interest to biomedical applications. We also identify those areas where HPE is already in use and present peculiarities and trends followed by researchers and practitioners. We include here 25 approaches to HPE and more than 40 studies of HPE applied to motor development assessment, neuromuscolar rehabilitation, and gait &amp;amp; posture analysis.

Some researchers measure subjective trust using questionnaires, while others measure objective trust-related behavior such as reliance. To bridge these gaps, we investigated the effects of two promising human-centered post-hoc explanations, feature importance and counterfactuals, on trust and reliance. We compared these two explanations with a control condition in a decision-making experiment (N = 380). Results showed that human-centered explanations can significantly increase reliance but the type of decision-making (increasing a price vs. decreasing a price) had an even greater influence. This challenges the presumed importance of transparency over other factors in human decision-making involving AI, such as potential heuristics and biases. We conclude that trust does not necessarily equate to reliance and emphasize the importance of appropriate, validated, and agreed-upon metrics to design and evaluate human-centered AI.},

Recognizing and mapping unsafe areas can increase awareness among citizens and inform city projects to improve their infrastructure. This contribution presents an example in which the specific objective is to recognize the unprotected areas around the canals in the city of Amsterdam.MethodThis is accomplished through running image processing algorithms on 11K waterside panoramas taken from the city of Amsterdam&#39;s open data portal. We created an annotated subset of 2K processed images for training and evaluation. This dataset debuts a novel pixel-level annotation style using multiple lines. To determine the best inference practice, we compared the IoU and robustness of several existing segmentation frameworks.ResultsThe best method achieves an IoU of 0.79. The outcome is superimposed on the map of Amsterdam, showing the geospatial distribution of the low, middle, and high fences around the canals.DiscussionIn addition to this specific application, we discuss the broader use of the presented method for the problem of “transparent object detection” in an urban context.},

These pocket-sized devices, mobile phones, accumulate a plethora of user data, effectively becoming a beacon for individual identification. However, the prospect of exploring this data within a criminal inquiry raises palpable concerns about potential privacy encroachments. Consequently, there exists an urgent need to balance the instrumental value of these technologies with their potential to intrude upon privacy, ensuring a framework that remains legally and ethically sound.MethodsIn our study, we offer a contemplative view on the public reception of such measures, informed by interviews and a conjoint study conducted across two representative cohorts from Germany and Austria (n = 2040).ResultsOur analysis indicates a marked preference for the release of geo-spatial data over more personal content, such as photographs. Additionally, respondents showed a higher acceptance for automated analysis in comparison to human manual evaluation. The divergence between the two countries was negligible.DiscussionIn summary, despite the inherent concerns, the use of these mobile forensics tools demonstrated a high degree of public acceptance. The results highlight the significance of aligning legislation based on data types rather than analysis purposes, which can enhance the general public&#39;s comprehension of laws and potentially contribute to societal advancement. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the importance of ethical evaluations and transparent communication in the implementation of automated mobile forensics systems for civil security purposes, effectively addressing concerns regarding privacy infringement and data analysis.},

  abstract     = {Social touch technology, haptic technology to mediate social touch interactions, potentially contributes to reducing negative effects of skin hunger and social isolation. This field is developing and while there are a number of prototypes, few became products and less persisted in the market today. Viable social touch technology is essential for research on social touch and it has an unexplored market potential. Making prototypes and evaluating them is the approach of generating knowledge in Research through Design (RtD). In RtD, researchers investigate the speculative future, probing on what the world could and should be, leaving the exact method of designing prototypes open. One possible method is tinkering, characterized by a playful and creative exploration. Tinkering environments, however, need a careful design of toolkits and setting. In this study, we report on the toolkit and setup we used for a tinkering-based teaching unit on social touch technology, held within an introductory course of an Interaction Technology master program, and describe the resulting prototypes. With a qualitative analysis of the results, we consider the teaching unit as a success, w.r.t. the diversity of the concepts developed. Tinkering is well-known as a playful method for education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths, aiming at school children and high school students. It is not yet established as a design method in itself, and not considered as element of an academic skill set. Here, we argue that tinkering is a valuable design method in the context of social touch technology, and that it has a place in the design approaches within an academic setting. In a further step, we also want to include experts from other domains in the design process, such as psychologists or fashion designers. For that end, we suggest expanding a current toolkit for wearable technology with concepts from the teaching unit, more scaffolding tools, a variety of tactile actuators, and a software tool that allow for (re)configuring designs rather than programing them.},

Equally important to technical advancement is human, social, and contextual factors that impact the successful implementation and user adoption of AI-empowered CDSS (AI-CDSS). With the growing interest in human-centered design and evaluation of such tools, it is critical to synthesize the knowledge and experiences reported in prior work and shed light on future work.MethodsFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to gain an in-depth understanding of how AI-empowered CDSS was used, designed, and evaluated, and how clinician users perceived such systems. We performed literature search in five databases for articles published between the years 2011 and 2022. A total of 19874 articles were retrieved and screened, with 20 articles included for in-depth analysis.ResultsThe reviewed studies assessed different aspects of AI-CDSS, including effectiveness (e.g., improved patient evaluation and work efficiency), user needs (e.g., informational and technological needs), user experience (e.g., satisfaction, trust, usability, workload, and understandability), and other dimensions (e.g., the impact of AI-CDSS on workflow and patient-provider relationship). Despite the promising nature of AI-CDSS, our findings highlighted six major challenges of implementing such systems, including technical limitation, workflow misalignment, attitudinal barriers, informational barriers, usability issues, and environmental barriers. These sociotechnical challenges prevent the effective use of AI-based CDSS interventions in clinical settings.DiscussionOur study highlights the paucity of studies examining the user needs, perceptions, and experiences of AI-CDSS.

More specifically, agile methodologies contributed to enhancing the effectiveness and the speed of the production process as well as to improving the productivity and motivations of software developers organized in high performing teams. The agile philosophy can be and has been applied in different contexts and across several domains. This work analyses the relationship between Agile methodologies used by software engineers and the practices pursued by musicians in their daily lives. Our findings suggests that collaborative, strongly planned software development life cycle models (such as Waterfall, V-model, iterative, and Spiral) are not adequate models to describe the daily practices of musical composers. This is because their work requires a lot of flexibility, which such models intrinsically lack, because they are oriented to ensuring some form of monitorable progress. Interestingly, our findings also show that nine out of 12 Agile Principles are consciously or unconsciously followed by musicians in their practices. This suggests that there are some deep connections between these two prima facie different fields, which are both very creative. Even though our findings await replication, possibly with larger statistical samples, they contribute to open up a new strand of research in the field.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a considerable number of studies in computer vision involve deep neural architectures called vision transformers. Visual processing in these models incorporates computational models that are claimed to implement attention mechanisms. Despite an increasing body of work that attempts to understand the role of attention mechanisms in vision transformers, their effect is largely unknown. Here, we asked if the attention mechanisms in vision transformers exhibit similar effects as those known in human visual attention. To answer this question, we revisited the attention formulation in these models and found that despite the name, computationally, these models perform a special class of relaxation labeling with similarity grouping effects. Additionally, whereas modern experimental findings reveal that human visual attention involves both feed-forward and feedback mechanisms, the purely feed-forward architecture of vision transformers suggests that attention in these models cannot have the same effects as those known in humans. To quantify these observations, we evaluated grouping performance in a family of vision transformers. Our results suggest that self-attention modules group figures in the stimuli based on similarity of visual features such as color. Also, in a singleton detection experiment as an instance of salient object detection, we studied if these models exhibit similar effects as those of feed-forward visual salience mechanisms thought to be utilized in human visual attention. We found that generally, the transformer-based attention modules assign more salience either to distractors or the ground, the opposite of both human and computational salience. Together, our study suggests that the mechanisms in vision transformers perform perceptual organization based on feature similarity and not attention.},

The survey analyzes biosensing instruments for brain activity, cardiovascular, electrodermal, and respiratory measurements for efficacy in reduction in stress and anxiety. The survey also emphasizes digital music systems where biosensing is utilized to adapt music playback to the subject, forming a biofeedback loop. We also discuss how these digital music systems can use biofeedback coupled with machine learning to provide improved efficacy.

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe contribution of technology to the field of health is vast, both in diagnosis and management. More so, the use of computer-based intervention has become increasingly widespread over the past decade. Human beings experience a decline in auditory processing and cognitive skills as they age, consistent with deterioration of other bodily functions. In addition, speech perception abilities in both quiet and in the presence of noise are impacted by auditory processing abilities and cognitive skills such as working memory. This pilot study explored the use of music as an intervention for improving these skills and employed a computerized delivery of the intervention module.MethodA battery of tests was carried out to assess the baseline auditory processing and working memory skills in eight older adults between the ages of 56 and 79 years, all of whom had normal hearing. Following the assessment, a short-term computerized music-based intervention was administered. The style of music chosen was Carnatic classical music, a genre widely practiced in Southern India. The intervention module involved note and tempo discrimination and was carried out for a maximum of 10 half-hour sessions. The multi-level intervention module was constructed and administered using Apex software. Following the intervention, the auditory processing and cognitive skills of the participants were reassessed to study any changes in their auditory processing and working memory skills.Results and discussionThere were positive changes observed in all the auditory processing and some of the working memory abilities. This paper discusses in detail the systematic structuring of the computerized music-based intervention module and its effects on the auditory processing and cognitive skills in older adults.},

  abstract     = {Image understanding is often conceived as a hierarchical process with many levels, where complexity and invariance of object representation gradually increase with level in the hierarchy. In contrast, neurophysiological studies have shown that figure-ground organization and border ownership coding, which imply understanding of the object structure of an image, occur at levels as low as V1 and V2 of the visual cortex. This cannot be the result of back-projections from object recognition centers because border-ownership signals appear well-before shape selective responses emerge in inferotemporal cortex. Ultra-fast border-ownership signals have been found not only for simple figure displays, but also for complex natural scenes. In this paper I review neurophysiological evidence for the hypothesis that the brain uses dedicated grouping mechanisms early on to link elementary features to larger entities we might call “proto-objects”, a process that is pre-attentive and does not rely on object recognition. The proto-object structures enable the system to individuate objects and provide permanence, to track moving objects and cope with the displacements caused by eye movements, and to select one object out of many and scrutinize the selected object. I sketch a novel experimental paradigm for identifying grouping circuits, describe a first application targeting area V4, which yielded negative results, and suggest targets for future applications of this paradigm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we aim to segment an image degraded by blur and Poisson noise. We adopt a smoothing-and-thresholding (SaT) segmentation framework that finds a piecewise-smooth solution, followed by k-means clustering to segment the image. Specifically for the image smoothing step, we replace the least-squares fidelity for Gaussian noise in the Mumford-Shah model with a maximum posterior (MAP) term to deal with Poisson noise and we incorporate the weighted difference of anisotropic and isotropic total variation (AITV) as a regularization to promote the sparsity of image gradients. For such a nonconvex model, we develop a specific splitting scheme and utilize a proximal operator to apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Convergence analysis is provided to validate the efficacy of the ADMM scheme. Numerical experiments on various segmentation scenarios (grayscale/color and multiphase) showcase that our proposed method outperforms a number of segmentation methods, including the original SaT.},

  abstract     = {The areas of entertainment computing and persuasive technologies are interdisciplinary fields that have gained increasing attention in the last decades. Health is one of the domains that has leveraged the benefits of fun to improve the results of its technology-enabled interventions. Previous work has reviewed the area of health entertainment from many different perspectives; however, an integrative analysis across disciplines (health sciences and computer science and engineering) throughout the development and validation cycle of technologies in this domain is missing. Having such an in-depth retrospective analysis would shed light on how research on entertainment computing and persuasive technologies for health has evolved, acknowledging its contributions, recognizing its strengths and limitations, and, as a result, allowing for the definition of ways forward. This paper engages in an unprecedented systematic review of the work produced between 2004 and 2017 in this area. From an initial total of 10,350 retrieved results, a total of 1,307 full-texts were included in this review and were thoroughly examined to gain a retrospective understanding of the type of studies that have been produced. Among others, this systematic review reports on the trends, venues of publication, and the characteristics of the studies including methodologies, sample characteristics, study design, the type of solutions produced, the conditions and domains of application, and the purpose of the studies. Results show that there is a growing body of research in the area, with most studies being published in roughly the same venues, and where the lion&#39;s share of solutions fall into the area of health rehabilitation and motor conditions. With regards to the most addressed health domains, our review shows that most solutions produced are aimed at stroke and fitness, followed by balance training. Most studies (82.3%) are conducted with their target population, mostly adults (18–49 y), and are conducted either in the lab or in clinical settings. However, the median sample size of the studies has remained stable (N = 20) in the last decades. Regarding technology, 2D and 3D solutions are equally used, and most systems employ movement sensors and are single-user. Finally, only 21.4% of the studies are performed using validated instruments.},

  abstract     = {In Australia today, radio continues to draw large audiences, with high engagement among older adults. This research investigated how radio personnel and listeners regard the purpose of radio, and further how engaging with radio is perceived to influence listener wellbeing. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with radio personnel (N = 16) and focus groups with older adult listeners (N = 32) suggest that the purpose of radio is to stay informed (e.g., news and information), for entertainment (e.g., music), and for perceived social purposes (e.g., communion, social connection, company, and companionship). Findings indicate there are implicit and explicit ways in which radio facilitates the wellbeing of their listenership. Explicitly, radio promotes mental health through broadcasts and programming, as well as exploiting the medium of radio as a public service for the community to call and rely on. Participants implicitly indicated that radio acts as a surrogate friend in their home; someone to keep them company and encourage connection to their greater community. Broadly, perceived relationships with radio programs and individual presenters, built and sustained over time through repeating listening, underpin the radio&#39;s ability to support listener wellbeing. These findings have implications for broadcasting practices as well as future work concerning how the radio might be used as a widely accessible tool for promoting quality of older life.},

Developers usually resolve bugs using comments in descriptions and discussions. The time to fix a bug varies greatly. Previous studies have investigated bug reports, but the influence of comments on bug fixing time is not well understood. This study adopts a convolutional neural network (CNN) and gradient-based visualization approach called Grad-cam to elucidate the impact of comments on bug fixing time and extract features. A feature represents an observed characteristic in a bug report when processing via deep learning. Specifically, CNN classifies bug reports, and then Grad-cam visualizes the decision basis of CNN by identifying the top 10 word sequences used in the prediction. Here, the features are major word sequences extracted by Grad-cam. In an experiment, the proposed method classified more than 36,000 actual bug reports from Bugzilla with an accuracy of 75%–80%. Additionally, the visualization highlighted differences in the stack trace and word abstraction by bug fixing time. Bug reports with short bug fixing times are concrete, whereas those with a long bug fixing time are abstract.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on an identity sharing scheme known as face image morphing or simply morphing. Morphing is the process of creating a composite face image, a morph, by digitally manipulating face images of different individuals, usually two. Under certain circumstances, the composite image looks like both contributors and can be used by one of them (accomplice) to issue an ID document. The other contributor (criminal) can then use the ID document for illegal activities, which is a serious security vulnerability. So far, researchers have focused on automated morphing detection solutions. Our main contribution is the evaluation of the effectiveness and limitations of two image forensics methods in visualizing morphing related traces in digital images. Visualization of morphing traces is important as it can be used as hard evidence in forensic context (i.e., court cases) and lead to the development of morphing algorithm specific feature extraction strategies for automated detection. To evaluate the two methods, we created morphs using two state-of-the-art morphing algorithms, complying with the face image requirements of three currently existing online passport application processes. We found that complementary use of the visualization methods can reveal morphing related traces. We also show how some application process-specific requirements affect visualization results by testing three likely morphing attack scenarios with varied image processing parameters and propose application process amendments that would make forensic image analysis more reliable.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionWhen solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems using a search algorithm without a priori information, the result is a Pareto front. Selecting a solution from it is a laborious task if the number of solutions to be analyzed is large. This task would benefit from a systematic approach that facilitates the analysis, comparison and selection of a solution or a group of solutions based on the preferences of the decision makers. In the last decade, the research and development of algorithms for solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems has been growing steadily. In contrast, efforts in the a posteriori exploration of non-dominated solutions are still scarce.MethodsThis paper proposes an abstract framework based on hierarchical clustering in order to facilitate decision makers to explore such a Pareto front in search of a solution or a group of solutions according to their preferences. An extension of that abstract framework aimed at addressing the bi-objective Next Release Problem is presented, together with a Dashboard that implements that extension. Based on this implementation, two studies are conducted. The first is a usability study performed with a small group of experts. The second is a performance analysis based on computation time consumed by the clustering algorithm.ResultsThe results of the initial empirical usability study are promising and indicate directions for future improvements. The experts were able to correctly use the dashboard and properly interpret the visualizations in a very short time. In the same direction, the results of the performance comparison highlight the advantage of the hierarchical clustering-based approach in terms of response time.DiscussionBased on these excellent results, the extension of the framework to new problems is planned, as well as the implementation of new validity tests with expert decision makers using real-world data.},

  abstract     = {The amount of cellular communication network traffic has increased dramatically in recent years, and this increase has led to a demand for enhanced network performance. Communication load balancing aims to balance the load across available network resources and thus improve the quality of service for network users. Most existing load balancing algorithms are manually designed and tuned rule-based methods where near-optimality is almost impossible to achieve. Furthermore, rule-based methods are difficult to adapt to quickly changing traffic patterns in real-world environments. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, especially deep reinforcement learning algorithms, have achieved impressive successes in many application domains and offer the potential of good adaptabiity to dynamic changes in network load patterns. This survey presents a systematic overview of RL-based communication load-balancing methods and discusses related challenges and opportunities. We first provide an introduction to the load balancing problem and to RL from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we review RL approaches that address emerging communication load balancing issues important to next generation networks, including 5G and beyond. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions for applying RL for communication load balancing.},

We argue that current DMI/AMI design frameworks are lacking in their consideration of this relationship and that this deficiency can prevent designers from understanding the specific needs and desires of disabled musicians. The paper presents an autoethnographic study of the lived experience of the first author, a disabled musician, to provide insight into the evolution of his musician-instrument relationships and his definition of “success” in this context. The authors propose that incorporating these types of lived experiences into the AMI design process, and considering cultural probes or provocations related to phenomenological experiences and characteristics that contribute to a successful musician-instrument relationship, could lead to more effective and tailored DMI/AMI designs with disabled musicians.},

This work presents a retrospective and prospective review of the odyssey toward κC empowered by transdisciplinary basic research and engineering advances. A wide range of fundamental theories and innovative technologies for κC is explored, and a set of underpinning intelligent mathematics (IM) is created. The architectures of κC for cognitive computing and Autonomous Intelligence Generation (AIG) are designed as a brain-inspired cognitive engine. Applications of κC in autonomous AI (AAI) are demonstrated by pilot projects.

To achieve the research aim, the article combines primary data from interviews with industry, government and international regulators, a survey completed by practitioners, experts and academics working in the field, and relevant secondary sources. The article makes an original contribution by noting and analyzing the approaches of the IMO and the UK government–bodies which are highly influential in shaping global attitudes, preparation, adoption and responses to such innovative technologies like MASS–and how they have engaged with the difficult question of regulating the various legal, technical and cybersecurity challenges that they raise. It concludes that for the MASS technology to fulfill its potential and gradually see the integration of such vessels in international shipping in a safe, secure and sustainable way, the international community needs to work together, and update by consensus the key legal instruments and policy documents. In this major task, the UK approach and IMO&#39;s leading role can play a protagonist role in developing best practice and implementing respectively.},

  abstract     = {Novel gustatory interfaces offer the potential to use the sense of taste as a feedback modality during the interaction. They are being explored in a wide range of implementations, from chemical to electrical and thermal stimulation of taste. However, the fundamental aspect of gustatory interaction that has yet to be explored is the Sense of Agency (SoA). It is the subjective experience of voluntary control over actions in the external world. This work investigates the SoA in gustatory systems using the intentional binding paradigm to quantify how different taste outcome modalities influence users&#39; SoA. We first investigate such gustatory systems using the intentional binding paradigm to quantify how different tastes influence users&#39; SoA (Experiment 1). The gustatory stimuli were sweet (sucrose 75.31 mg/ml), bitter (caffeine powder 0.97 mg/ml), and neutral (mineral water) as the outcomes of specific keyboard presses. We then investigated how SoA was altered depending on users&#39; sweet liking phenotype, given that sweet is one of the taste outcomes (Experiment 2), and in contrast with audio as a traditional outcome. In Experiment 2, stronger taste concentrations (sweet-sucrose 342.30 g/L, bitter-quinine 0.1 g/L, and neutral) were used, with only participants being moderate sweet likers. We further contrasted tastes with audio as the traditional outcome. Our findings show that all three taste outcomes exhibit similar intentional binding compared to auditory in medium sweet likers. We also show that longer action-outcome duration improved the SoA. We finally discuss our findings and identify design opportunities considering SoA for gustatory interfaces and multisensory interaction.},

How might XAI system developers evaluate existing XAI systems with regard to the depth of support they provide for the user&#39;s sensemaking? How might XAI system developers shape new XAI systems so as to support the user&#39;s sensemaking? What might be a useful conceptual terminology to assist developers in approaching this challenge?MethodBased on cognitive theory, a scale was developed reflecting depth of explanation, that is, the degree to which explanations support the user&#39;s sensemaking. The seven levels of this scale form the Explanation Scorecard.Results and discussionThe Scorecard was utilized in an analysis of recent literature, showing that many systems still present low-level explanations. The Scorecard can be used by developers to conceptualize how they might extend their machine-generated explanations to support the user in developing a mental model that instills appropriate trust and reliance. The article concludes with recommendations for how XAI systems can be improved with regard to the cognitive considerations, and recommendations regarding the manner in which results on the evaluation of XAI systems are reported.},

Traditional graph-based SSL methods prevail in classical SSL problems for their intuitional implementation and effective performance. However, they encounter troubles when applying to image classification followed by modern deep learning, since the diffusion algorithms face the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a simple and efficient SSL method, combining a graph-based SSL paradigm with differential privacy. We aim at developing coherent latent feature space of deep neural networks so that the diffusion algorithm in the latent space can give more precise predictions for unlabeled data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cifar10, Cifar100, and Mini-imagenet benchmark datasets and obtains an error rate of 18.56% on Cifar10 using only 1% of all labels. Furthermore, our approach inherits the benefits of graph-based SSL methods with a simple training process and can be easily combined with any network architecture.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how deep neural networks resemble or differ from human vision becomes increasingly important with their widespread use in Computer Vision and as models in Neuroscience. A key aspect of human vision is shape: we decompose the visual world into distinct objects, use cues to infer their 3D geometries, and can group several object parts into a coherent whole. Do deep networks use the shape of objects similarly when they classify images? Research on this question has yielded conflicting results, with some studies showing evidence for shape selectivity in deep networks, while others demonstrated clear deficiencies. We argue that these conflicts arise from differences in experimental methods: whether studies use custom images in which only some features are available, images in which different features compete, image pairs that vary along different feature dimensions, or large sets of images to assess how representations vary overall. Each method offers a different, partial view of shape processing. After comparing their advantages and pitfalls, we propose two hypotheses that can reconcile previous results. Firstly, deep networks are sensitive to local, but not global shape. Secondly, the higher layers of deep networks discard some of the shape information that the lower layers are sensitive to. We test these hypotheses by comparing network representations for natural images and silhouettes in which local or global shape is degraded. The results support both hypotheses, but for different networks. Purely feed-forward convolutional networks are unable to integrate shape globally. In contrast, networks with residual or recurrent connections show a weak selectivity for global shape. This motivates further research into recurrent architectures for perceptual integration.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionDistributed simulations of complex systems to date have focused on scalability and correctness rather than interactive visualization. Interactive visual simulations have particular advantages for exploring emergent behaviors of complex systems. Interpretation of simulations of complex systems such as cancer cell tumors is a challenge and can be greatly assisted by using “built-in” real-time user interaction and subsequent visualization.MethodsWe explore this approach using a multi-scale model which couples a cell physics model with a cell signaling model. This paper presents a novel communication protocol for real-time user interaction and visualization with a large-scale distributed simulation with minimal impact on performance. Specifically, we explore how optimistic synchronization can be used to enable real-time user interaction and visualization in a densely packed parallel agent-based simulation, whilst maintaining scalability and determinism. We also describe the software framework created and the distribution strategy for the models utilized. The key features of the High-Performance Computing (HPC) simulation that were evaluated are scalability, deterministic verification, speed of real-time user interactions, and deadlock avoidance.ResultsWe use two commodity HPC systems, ARCHER (118,080 CPU cores) and ARCHER2 (750,080 CPU cores), where we simulate up to 256 million agents (one million cells) using up to 21,953 computational cores and record a response time overhead of ≃350 ms from the issued user events.DiscussionThe approach is viable and can be used to underpin transformative technologies offering immersive simulations such as Digital Twins. The framework explained in this paper is not limited to the models used and can be adapted to systems biology models that use similar standards (physics models using agent-based interactions, and signaling pathways using SBML) and other interactive distributed simulations.},

  abstract     = {The use of corpora represents a widespread methodology in interpersonal perception and impression formation studies. Nonetheless, the development of a corpus using the traditional approach involves a procedure that is both time- and cost-intensive and might lead to methodological flaws (e.g., high invasiveness). This might in turn lower the internal and external validities of the studies. Drawing on the technological advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, we propose an innovative approach based on deepfake technology to develop corpora while tackling the challenges of the traditional approach. This technology makes it possible to generate synthetic videos showing individuals doing things that they have never done. Through an automatized process, this approach allows to create a large scale corpus at a lesser cost and in a short time frame. This method is characterized by a low degree of invasiveness given that it requires minimal input from participants (i.e., a single image or a short video) to generate a synthetic video of a person. Furthermore, this method allows a high degree of control over the content of the videos. As a first step, a referent video is created in which an actor performs the desired behavior. Then, based on this referent video and participant input, the videos that will compose the corpus are generated by a specific class of machine learning algorithms such that either the facial features or the behavior exhibited in the referent video are transposed to the face or the body of another person. In the present paper, we apply deepfake technology to the field of social skills and more specifically to interpersonal perception and impression formation studies and provide technical information to researchers who are interested in developing a corpus using this innovative technology.},

Then we proposed a multimodal bilinear pooling mechanism to better merge textual and visual features and an attention mechanism to capture multimodal internal relationships for the detection of fake news.Results and discussionThe experimental results demonstrated that our methodology outperformed the current state-of-the-art methodology on publicly accessible Weibo and Twitter datasets.},

  abstract     = {There is increasing interest in the application of machine learning (ML) technologies to safety-critical cyber-physical systems, with the promise of increased levels of autonomy due to their potential for solving complex perception and planning tasks. However, demonstrating the safety of ML is seen as one of the most challenging hurdles to their widespread deployment for such applications. In this paper we explore the factors which make the safety assurance of ML such a challenging task. In particular we address the impact of uncertainty on the confidence in ML safety assurance arguments. We show how this uncertainty is related to complexity in the ML models as well as the inherent complexity of the tasks that they are designed to implement. Based on definitions of uncertainty as well as an exemplary assurance argument structure, we examine typical weaknesses in the argument and how these can be addressed. The analysis combines an understanding of causes of insufficiencies in ML models with a systematic analysis of the types of asserted context, asserted evidence and asserted inference within the assurance argument. This leads to a systematic identification of requirements on the assurance argument structure as well as supporting evidence. We conclude that a combination of qualitative arguments combined with quantitative evidence are required to build a robust argument for safety-related properties of ML functions that is continuously refined to reduce residual and emerging uncertainties in the arguments after the function has been deployed into the target environment.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driver assistance systems (ADAS) have been progressively pushed to extremes. Today, increasingly sophisticated algorithms, such as deep neural networks, assume responsibility for critical driving functionality, including operating the vehicle at various levels of autonomy. Elaborate obstacle detection, classification, and prediction algorithms, mostly vision-based, trajectory planning, and smooth control algorithms, take over what humans learn until they are permitted to control vehicles and beyond. And even if humans remain in the loop (e.g., to intervene in case of error, as required by autonomy levels 3 and 4), it remains questionable whether distracted human drivers will react appropriately, given the high speed at which vehicles drive and the complex traffic situations they have to cope with. A further pitfall is trusting the whole autonomous driving stack not to fail due to accidental causes and to be robust against cyberattacks of increasing sophistication. In this experience report, we share our findings in retrofitting application-agnostic resilience mechanisms into an existing hardware-/software-stack for autonomous driving—Apollo—as well as where application knowledge helps improve existing resilience algorithms. Our goal is to ultimately decrease the vulnerability of autonomously driving vehicles to accidental faults and attacks, allowing them to absorb and tolerate both, as well as to come out of them at least as secure as before the attack has happened. We demonstrate replication and rejuvenation on the driving stack&#39;s Control module and indicate how this resilience can be extended both downwards to the hardware level, as well as upwards to the prediction and planning modules.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop the concept of agentic social media use: a way of engaging with social media that emphasizes having the beliefs, knowledge, and practices to use it intentionally. In comparison to instances of “mindless” social media use, people who use social media agentically do so with a purpose in mind: they leverage the affordances of social media to do things that are meaningful, useful, or satisfying for them. For example, people can use social media to intentionally build or manage their relationships, to seek out and learn new information about their interests, or to craft a positive image of themselves through the content they post. Crucially, however, there are many other valuable uses of social media that may not be considered conventionally productive but are nonetheless deliberate and useful, such as using social media intentionally to relax, unwind, and entertain themselves in an effort to modulate their emotions. To use social media agentically means to (1) hold an agentic mindset about one&#39;s relationship with social media, (2) have the knowledge and literacy to understand how to navigate social media effectively, and (3) enact practices that assert control over specific elements of social media use, such as curating content and refining algorithmic recommendation. Approaching social media use from the perspective of agency and intentionality allows us to better understand heterogeneous social media effects and to identify new ways of helping people benefit from these technologies.},

  abstract     = {The field of tactile augmentation has progressed greatly over the past 27 years and currently constitutes an emerging area of research, bridging topics ranging from neuroscience to robotics. One particular area of interest is studying the usage of tactile augmentation to provide inclusive musical experiences for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals. This article details a scoping review that investigates and organizes tactile displays used for the augmentation of music from the field of hearing assistive devices, documented in 63 scientific publications. The focus is on the hardware, software, mapping, and evaluation of these displays, to identify established methods and techniques, as well as potential gaps in the literature. To achieve this purpose, a catalog of devices was created from the available literature indexed in the Scopus® database. We set up a list of 12 descriptors belonging to physical, auditory, perceptual, purpose and evaluation domains; each tactile display identified was categorized based on those. The frequency of use among these descriptors was analyzed and as well as the eventual relationship between them. Results indicate that the field is relatively new, with 80% of the literature indexed being published after 2009. Moreover, most of the research is conducted in laboratories, with limited industry reach. Most of the studies have low reliability due to small sample sizes, and sometimes low validity due to limited access to the targeted population (e.g., evaluating systems designed for cochlear implant users, on normal hearing individuals). When it comes to the tactile displays, the results show that the hand area is targeted by the majority of the systems, probably due to the higher sensitivity afforded by it, and that there are only a couple of popular mapping systems used by the majority of researchers. Additional aspects of the displays were investigated, including the historical distribution of various characteristics (e.g., number of actuators, or actuators type) as well as the sonic material used as input. Finally, a discussion of the current state of the tactile augmentation of music is presented, as well as suggestions for potential future research.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a paradigm shift in which the Internet is connected to real objects in a range of areas, including home automation, industrial processes, human health, and environmental monitoring. The global market for IoT devices is booming, and it is estimated that there will be 50 billion connected devices by the end of 2025. This explosion of IoT devices, which can be expanded more easily than desktop PCs, has led to an increase in cyber-attacks involving IoT devices. To address this issue, it is necessary to create novel approaches for identifying attacks launched by hacked IoT devices. Due to the possibility that these attacks would succeed, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are required. IDS&#39; feature selection stage is widely regarded as the most essential stage. This stage is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, numerous machine learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed to enhance this stage to boost an IDS&#39;s performance. These approaches, however, did not produce desirable results in terms of accuracy and detection rate (DR). In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Autoencoder and Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (HAEMPSO) for feature selection and deep neural network (DNN) for classification. The PSO with modification of inertia weight was utilized to optimize the parameters of DNN. The experimental analysis was performed on two realistic UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT datasets that are suitable for IoT environment. The findings obtained by analyzing the proposed HAEMPSO against the Generic attack in the UNSW-NB15 dataset gave an accuracy of 98.8%, and a DR of 99.9%. While the benign class revealed an accuracy of 99.9% and DR of 99.7%. In the BoT-IoT dataset, the DDoS HTTP attack revealed an accuracy of 99.22% and DR of 97.79%. While the benign class gave an accuracy of 97.54% and DR of 97.92%. In comparison with the state-of-the-art machine learning schemes, our proposed HAEMPSO-DNN achieved a competitive feat in terms of DR and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionSuicide is a leading cause of death around the world, interpolating a huge suffering to the families and communities of the individuals. Such pain and suffering are preventable with early screening and monitoring. However, current suicide risk identification relies on self-disclosure and/or the clinician&#39;s judgment.Research question/statmentTherefore, we investigate acoustic and nonverbal behavioral markers that are associated with different levels of suicide risks through a multimodal approach for suicide risk detection.Given the differences in the behavioral dynamics between subregions of facial expressions and body gestures in terms of timespans, we propose a novel region-based multimodal fusion.MethodsWe used a newly collected video interview dataset of young Japanese who are at risk of suicide to extract engineered features and deep representations from the speech, regions of the face (i.e., eyes, nose, mouth), regions of the body (i.e., shoulders, arms, legs), as well as the overall combined regions of face and body.ResultsThe results confirmed that behavioral dynamics differs between regions, where some regions benefit from a shorter timespans, while other regions benefit from longer ones. Therefore, a region-based multimodal approach is more informative in terms of behavioral markers and accounts for both subtle and strong behaviors. Our region-based multimodal results outperformed the single modality, reaching a sample-level accuracy of 96% compared with the highest single modality that reached sample-level accuracy of 80%. Interpretation of the behavioral markers, showed the higher the suicide risk levels, the lower the expressivity, movement and energy observed from the subject. Moreover, the high-risk suicide group express more disgust and contact avoidance, while the low-risk suicide group express self-soothing and anxiety behaviors.DiscussionEven though multimodal analysis is a powerful tool to enhance the model performance and its reliability, it is important to ensure through a careful selection that a strong behavioral modality (e.g., body movement) does not dominate another subtle modality (e.g., eye blink). Despite the small sample size, our unique dataset and the current results adds a new cultural dimension to the research on nonverbal markers of suicidal risks. Given a larger dataset, future work on this method can be useful in helping psychiatrists with the assessment of suicide risk and could have several applications to identify those at risk.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionIn Japan, the social climate surrounding older adults has gotten worse as a result of the spread of COVID-19 and the growing isolation of older adults who are increasingly unable to engage in prosocial behavior through work and volunteering. This is detrimental to the physical and mental well-being of older adults. The purpose of this study is to look into robot teleoperation for older adults as a viable way to deal with these issues and overcome the barriers preventing older adults from engaging in prosocial behavior.Materials and methodsWe designed and tested a remote-control approach for dialogue agents that is appropriate for older adults as well as evaluating their impressions in a real-world setting. Twelve older adults participated in experiments in two separate locations, a children&#39;s center and the city ward office, where they could remotely teleoperate a robot and have conversations with the visitors. In the city ward office, the older adults had a conversation with the visitors and gave them information and trivia quizzes about the city. In the children&#39;s center, older adults had conversations with children regarding their age, family, their likes, and dislikes. A questionnaire and interview were set up after the experiments to understand their impressions of the system and to clarify how older adults feel about certain issues regarding remote-controlled work, starting a new job, social interaction, to what extent have older adults been affected by the pandemic, how and in what ways has it affected their involvement in society, and whether teleoperating a robot can be a suitable approach to encourage prosocial behavior from them through volunteer work and social engagement.ResultsThe results show that older adults have a strong desire to engage in volunteer work, but are hampered mainly by physical isolation resulting from COVID-19 restrictions and their declining physical and mental health. Their impressions of the teleoperation system were highly positive, as they enjoyed having conversations with children through the robot. With this teleoperation system, older adults were able to remote control a robot by themselves without major issues. It made interaction simpler as conversing with children through a robot added a layer of anonymity that allowed older adults to express themselves freely without worrying about how they are perceived by others in public.DiscussionOlder adults were able to successfully engage in prosocial behavior through remote-controlling a robot. The system seems to be effective at easing the physical barriers preventing older adults from engaging in volunteer work, which have worsened since the spread of COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionSecuring wireless communications in internet-of-things (IoT) requires both generation and synchronization of random numbers in real-time. However, resource constraints on an IoT device limit the use of computationally intensive random number generators and the use of global positioning systems (GPS) for synchronization. In this paper, we propose a synchronized pseudo-random number generator (SPRNG) that uses a combination of a fast, low-complexity linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR) based PRNG and a slow but secure, synchronized seed generator based on self-powered timers.MethodsA prototype synchronized self-powered timer (SSPT) array was fabricated in a standard silicon process and was used to generate dynamic random seeds for the LFSR. The SSPTs use quantum-mechanical tunneling of electrons to operate without any external power and are practically secure against tampering, snooping, and side-channel attacks (both power and electromagnetic).ResultsIn this work, we explore protocols to periodically and securely generate random bits using the self-powered timers for seeding the LFSR. We also show that the time-varying random seeds extend and break the LFSR periodic cycles, thus making it difficult for an attacker to predict the random output or the random seed. Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite we verify the randomness of the measured seeds from the fabricated ensemble of SSPTs together with the random bit sequences generated by a software-seeded LFSR.DiscussionsIn this modality, the proposed SPRNG could be used as a trusted platform module (TPM) on IoTs and used for verifying and authenticating secure transactions (e.g., software upgrades). Since the SPRNG system does not require access to GPS for synchronization, therefore it could be used in many resource-constrained and adversarial environments.},

Workflow net with data (WFD-net) is an effective language to describe a complete model of a workflow net system. Checking their trace consistency is a significant challenge in service-based software engineering. However, most of the existing research on trace consistency measurement has not taken the data into consideration. Therefore, they cannot accurately calculate the trace consistency degree of two WFD-net systems, especially when data operations and guard functions are complex.MethodsWe explore all traces in two WFD-net systems based on guard analysis and data dependencies.ResultsWe point out that the trace consistency degree is uncertain when the values of guard functions are considered.DiscussionWe conduct experiments to evaluate our method and show its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionDespite the abundance of evidence on climate change and its consequences on future generations, people, in general, are still reluctant to change their actions and behaviors toward the environment that would particularly benefit posterity. In this study, we took a preliminary step in a new research direction to explore humans&#39; altruistic behavior toward future generations of people and whether it can be affected by dialogue.MethodsWe used an android robot called Telenoid as a representative of future generations by explaining that the robot is controlled by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) living in a simulation of our world in the future. To measure people&#39;s altruistic behavior toward it, we asked the participants to play a round of the Dictator Game with the Telenoid before having an interactive conversation with the Telenoid and then playing another round.ResultsOn average, participants gave more money to the Telenoid in the second round (after having an interactive conversation). The average amount of money increased from 20% in the first to about 30% in the second round.DiscussionThe results indicate that the conversation with the robot might have been responsible for the change in altruistic behavior toward the Telenoid. Contrary to our expectations, the personality of the participants did not appear to have an influence on their change of behavior, but other factors might have contributed. We finally discuss the influence of other possible factors such as empathy and the appearance of the robot. However, the preliminary nature of this study should deter us from making any definitive conclusions, but the results are promising for establishing the ground for future experiments.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionArtificial Intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous in medicine, business, manufacturing and transportation, and is entering our personal lives. Public perceptions of AI are often shaped either by admiration for its benefits and possibilities, or by uncertainties, potential threats and fears about this opaque and perceived as mysterious technology. Understanding the public perception of AI, as well as its requirements and attributions, is essential for responsible research and innovation and enables aligning the development and governance of future AI systems with individual and societal needs.MethodsTo contribute to this understanding, we asked 122 participants in Germany how they perceived 38 statements about artificial intelligence in different contexts (personal, economic, industrial, social, cultural, health). We assessed their personal evaluation and the perceived likelihood of these aspects becoming reality.ResultsWe visualized the responses in a criticality map that allows the identification of issues that require particular attention from research and policy-making. The results show that the perceived evaluation and the perceived expectations differ considerably between the domains. The aspect perceived as most critical is the fear of cybersecurity threats, which is seen as highly likely and least liked.DiscussionThe diversity of users influenced the evaluation: People with lower trust rated the impact of AI as more positive but less likely. Compared to people with higher trust, they consider certain features and consequences of AI to be more desirable, but they think the impact of AI will be smaller. We conclude that AI is still a “black box” for many. Neither the opportunities nor the risks can yet be adequately assessed, which can lead to biased and irrational control beliefs in the public perception of AI. The article concludes with guidelines for promoting AI literacy to facilitate informed decision-making.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionTo foster usefulness and accountability of machine learning (ML), it is essential to explain a model&#39;s decisions in addition to evaluating its performance. Accordingly, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has resurfaced as a topic of active research, offering approaches to address the “how” and “why” of automated decision-making. Within this domain, counterfactual explanations (CFEs) have gained considerable traction as a psychologically grounded approach to generate post-hoc explanations. To do so, CFEs highlight what changes to a model&#39;s input would have changed its prediction in a particular way. However, despite the introduction of numerous CFE approaches, their usability has yet to be thoroughly validated at the human level.MethodsTo advance the field of XAI, we introduce the Alien Zoo, an engaging, web-based and game-inspired experimental framework. The Alien Zoo provides the means to evaluate usability of CFEs for gaining new knowledge from an automated system, targeting novice users in a domain-general context. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the practical efficacy and feasibility of this approach in a user study.ResultsOur results suggest the efficacy of the Alien Zoo framework for empirically investigating aspects of counterfactual explanations in a game-type scenario and a low-knowledge domain. The proof of concept study reveals that users benefit from receiving CFEs compared to no explanation, both in terms of objective performance in the proposed iterative learning task, and subjective usability.DiscussionWith this work, we aim to equip research groups and practitioners with the means to easily run controlled and well-powered user studies to complement their otherwise often more technology-oriented work. Thus, in the interest of reproducible research, we provide the entire code, together with the underlying models and user data: https://github.com/ukuhl/IntroAlienZoo.},

  abstract     = {Recently, engagement has emerged as a key variable explaining the success of conversation. In the perspective of human-machine interaction, an automatic assessment of engagement becomes crucial to better understand the dynamics of an interaction and to design socially-aware robots. This paper presents a predictive model of the level of engagement in conversations. It shows in particular the interest of using a rich multimodal set of features, outperforming the existing models in this domain. In terms of methodology, study is based on two audio-visual corpora of naturalistic face-to-face interactions. These resources have been enriched with various annotations of verbal and nonverbal behaviors, such as smiles, head nods, and feedbacks. In addition, we manually annotated gestures intensity. Based on a review of previous works in psychology and human-machine interaction, we propose a new definition of the notion of engagement, adequate for the description of this phenomenon both in natural and mediated environments. This definition have been implemented in our annotation scheme. In our work, engagement is studied at the turn level, known to be crucial for the organization of the conversation. Even though there is still a lack of consensus around their precise definition, we have developed a turn detection tool. A multimodal characterization of engagement is performed using a multi-level classification of turns. We claim a set of multimodal cues, involving prosodic, mimo-gestural and morpho-syntactic information, is relevant to characterize the level of engagement of speakers in conversation. Our results significantly outperform the baseline and reach state-of-the-art level (0.76 weighted F-score). The most contributing modalities are identified by testing the performance of a two-layer perceptron when trained on unimodal feature sets and on combinations of two to four modalities. These results support our claim about multimodality: combining features related to the speech fundamental frequency and energy with mimo-gestural features leads to the best performance.},

  abstract     = {With the recent advances in motion tracking technologies and three-dimensional computer graphics software, communication through avatars has become increasingly popular. Can avatars be sufficiently persuasive, when compared to traditional forms of interpersonal communication? What factors contribute to the persuasiveness of virtual influencers? Existing literature has studied the differences in persuasiveness between human and virtual speakers extensively, particularly in education. However, few studies have been conducted on product promotion. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the characteristics of persuasiveness for humans and virtual influencers, as well as the differences between them in this regard in a more modern and practical situation: product introduction videos used in influencer marketing. Specifically, we recruited participants to watch product introduction videos on YouTube, presented by either humans or avatars. The videos were similar, except for the appearance of the presenter. Before and after watching the videos, the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to purchase the products and the characteristics of presenters&#39; persuasiveness. The results show that although promotion via avatars can increase the participants&#39; willingness to purchase, human influencers were more persuasive. However, the virtual YouTubers (VTubers) were more persuasive in certain product domains. VTubers who can change their appearance to match the product domain have potential for future applications. We also attempted to construct a model of persuasiveness in this pragmatic context based on Dyson&#39;s persuasiveness rating scale and the overall impression of the video. The degree of persuasiveness was found to be related to the presenters&#39; likability, whether the presenter was a human or an avatar, the degree of familiarity between the presenter and the audience, the presenters&#39; trustworthiness, and the quality as well as the entertainment level of the video. This model may be helpful for running successful promotions on YouTube. Our findings verify that avatars can be fairly persuasive in some situations, including promotional videos. These findings contribute to the future development of communication through avatars.},

  abstract     = {Automatic emotion recognition (AER) systems are burgeoning and systems based on either audio, video, text, or physiological signals have emerged. Multimodal systems, in turn, have shown to improve overall AER accuracy and to also provide some robustness against artifacts and missing data. Collecting multiple signal modalities, however, can be very intrusive, time consuming, and expensive. Recent advances in deep learning based speech-to-text and natural language processing systems, however, have enabled the development of reliable multimodal systems based on speech and text while only requiring the collection of audio data. Audio data, however, is extremely sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as additive noise, thus faces some challenges when deployed “in the wild.” To overcome this issue, speech enhancement algorithms have been deployed at the input signal level to improve testing accuracy in noisy conditions. Speech enhancement algorithms can come in different flavors and can be optimized for different tasks (e.g., for human perception vs. machine performance). Data augmentation, in turn, has also been deployed at the model level during training time to improve accuracy in noisy testing conditions. In this paper, we explore the combination of task-specific speech enhancement and data augmentation as a strategy to improve overall multimodal emotion recognition in noisy conditions. We show that AER accuracy under noisy conditions can be improved to levels close to those seen in clean conditions. When compared against a system without speech enhancement or data augmentation, an increase in AER accuracy of 40% was seen in a cross-corpus test, thus showing promising results for “in the wild” AER.},

We limit the size of input images provided to DCGAN, thereby reducing the training time and yet producing detailed 3D animation frames. This is made possible through our preprocessing of the source videos, wherein several corrections are applied to the extracted frames to provide an adequate input training data set to DCGAN. A significant advantage of the presented cloud animation is that it does not require any underlying physics simulation. We present detailed results of our approach and verify its effectiveness using human perceptual evaluation. Our results indicate that the proposed method is capable of convincingly realistic 3D cloud animation, as perceived by the participants, without introducing too much computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {Robotic assistive technology for frail older adults has drawn attention, along with raising ethical concerns. The ethical implications of a robot&#39;s usage have been characterized in the literature as detrimental, such as emotional deception, unhealthy attachment, and reduced human contact from a deontological perspective. These concerns require practical investigations, although the long-term effect of robot usage on older adults remains uncertain. Our longitudinal study aimed to investigate how older adults with cognitive decline could be affected by using a robot for communication in their homes and how this situation could be reflected in possible emotional attachment to the robot i.e., emotional distress from the robot being taken away once they had become attached to it. We selected 13 older adults living alone and set up a humanoid robot in their homes with whom they could interact at any time for a period of 1–4 months. Questionnaire results indicated participants had a close attachment to the robots even after they were taken away. Interviews revealed that participants became distressed without the robots; however, despite the distress caused by feeling lonely, participants reported that their relationships with the robots were meaningful and that they were satisfied with the memories of having had the robot as a companion. The results raised new questions for further investigation into issues that should be addressed and potential factors affecting the user&#39;s adaptation processes. Regarding the consequences of the use of a companion robot, it is important to evaluate the positive aspects of the robot&#39;s usage including the emotional support lasting after it was no longer available and other effects on the users. Accordingly, we emphasize the significance of real-world exploration into the effects on the users as well as theoretical reflection on appropriate robot usage.},

  abstract     = {In Ontario, Canada, universities are obligated under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) to ensure that people with disabilities do not face barriers to education, and they are free from barriers in society more broadly. Those who produce online curriculum for postsecondary education in the province need at least a basic understanding of digital accessibility, and for some roles, like software or web developers, a level of expertise is required. However, finding people with the right knowledge, skills, and attitude can be difficult. This problem can be attributed to the fact that until recently digital accessibility skills have received little attention in post-secondary education. To address the issue, in 2015, with support from the Government of Ontario, we began several projects to develop digital accessibility curriculum. These efforts created a series of free Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) aimed at teaching digital accessibility skills to audiences ranging from office support workers, to managers, to developers, to digital accessibility specialists. The MOOCs ran between 2016 and 2019 and served more than 5000 participants, with more than 600 successfully completing the requirements for the digital badge(s) awarded. Following the MOOCs project, the content of the courses was converted into Open Educational Resources (OERs) that could be used as textbooks to support the introduction of digital accessibility topics over a range of subject areas, with encouragement for others to reuse the content to add accessibility related topics into their teaching. The OERs were downloaded more than 10,000 times between late 2020 and late 2022 and provided the base content for four open courses developed through OERU. In this article the pedagogy and curriculum for this digital accessibility training are described.},

The methods we present derive from our integration of extensive research literatures and our own psychometric evaluations. We point to the previous research that led to the measurement scales which we aggregated and tailored specifically for the XAI context.

  abstract     = {Understanding children&#39;s conversational skills is crucial for understanding their social, cognitive, and linguistic development, with important applications in health and education. To develop theories based on quantitative studies of conversational development, we need (i) data recorded in naturalistic contexts (e.g., child-caregiver dyads talking in their daily environment) where children are more likely to show much of their conversational competencies, as opposed to controlled laboratory contexts which typically involve talking to a stranger (e.g., the experimenter); (ii) data that allows for clear access to children&#39;s multimodal behavior in face-to-face conversations; and (iii) data whose acquisition method is cost-effective with the potential of being deployed at a large scale to capture individual and cultural variability. The current work is a first step to achieving this goal. We built a corpus of video chats involving children in middle childhood (6–12 years old) and their caregivers using a weakly structured word-guessing game to prompt spontaneous conversation. The manual annotations of these recordings have shown a similarity in the frequency distribution of multimodal communicative signals from both children and caregivers. As a case study, we capitalize on this rich behavioral data to study how verbal and non-verbal cues contribute to the children&#39;s conversational coordination. In particular, we looked at how children learn to engage in coordinated conversations, not only as speakers but also as listeners, by analyzing children&#39;s use of backchannel signaling (e.g., verbal “mh” or head nods) during these conversations. Contrary to results from previous in-lab studies, our use of a more spontaneous conversational setting (as well as more adequate controls) revealed that school-age children are strikingly close to adult-level mastery in many measures of backchanneling. Our work demonstrates the usefulness of recent technology in video calling for acquiring quality data that can be used for research on children&#39;s conversational development in the wild.},

We propose a novel, multistage fusion method where the two information streams are integrated in several layers of a DNN, and contrast it with a single-stage one where the streams are merged in a single point. Both methods depend on extracting summary linguistic embeddings from a pre-trained BERT model, and conditioning one or more intermediate representations of a convolutional model operating on log-Mel spectrograms.ResultsExperiments on the MSP-Podcast and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the two fusion methods clearly outperform a shallow (late) fusion baseline and their unimodal constituents, both in terms of quantitative performance and qualitative behavior.DiscussionOverall, our multistage fusion shows better quantitative performance, surpassing alternatives on most of our evaluations.

  abstract     = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can provide clinicians with fast and accurate predictions that are highly valuable for high-stakes medical decision-making, such as in brain tumor segmentation and treatment planning. However, these models largely lack transparency about the uncertainty in their predictions, potentially giving clinicians a false sense of reliability that may lead to grave consequences in patient care. Growing calls for Transparent and Responsible AI have promoted Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to capture and communicate uncertainty in a systematic and principled manner. However, traditional Bayesian UQ methods remain prohibitively costly for large, million-dimensional tumor segmentation DNNs such as the U-Net. In this work, we discuss a computationally-efficient UQ approach via the partially Bayesian neural networks (pBNN). In pBNN, only a single layer, strategically selected based on gradient-based sensitivity analysis, is targeted for Bayesian inference. We illustrate the effectiveness of pBNN in capturing the full uncertainty for a 7.8-million parameter U-Net. We also demonstrate how practitioners and model developers can use the pBNN&#39;s predictions to better understand the model&#39;s capabilities and behavior.},

An automaton is history deterministic (HD) if it can successfully resolve its nondeterministic choices in a way that only depends on the past. Formally, an HD automaton has a strategy that maps each finite word to the transition to be taken after the word is read and following this strategy results in accepting all the words in the language of the automaton. Beyond being theoretically interesting and intriguing, HD automata can replace deterministic automata in several applications, most notably reactive synthesis, and they attract a lot of interest in the research community. The survey describes the development of HD ω-regular automata, relates history determinism to other types of bounded nondeterminism, studies the determinization of HD automata and their succinctness with respect to deterministic ones, and discusses variants, extensions, and open problems around HD automata.},

  abstract     = {Modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) show increasing levels of automation, intelligence, and optimization capabilities. Both creators and adopters of these technologies emphasize the benefits: safety, cost-savings, and efficiencies. Existing literature under-represents the potential risks associated with the adoption of individually complex systems and interconnected Systems-of-Systems (SoS). Research primarily focuses on the potential benefits, and many recent deployments of new technology have received little rigorous scrutiny. The studies that do explore issues, such as cyber-attacks on CPS, often lack an analysis of the potential impact based on the way cyber-physical risks are communicated. Due to high levels of interaction and inter dependencies in CPS, disruptions in one sector can propagate to other sectors. The initial economic impacts may start locally but will often lead to global effects if response mechanisms prove insufficient. This case study aims to address a research gap in modeling, and quantifies how a cyber-attack, with physical consequences, can affect local and global trade if a single maritime port is affected. Additionally, to further understanding of the public&#39;s perception of risk about cyber-attacks and its emergent threat to global supply chains, members of the public were asked to react to the potential econometric losses. This study produced the five-part CyPEM (Cyber Physical Econometric Model) that has the capability to translate a cyber-attack to an econometric loss. Each framework part may also be swapped out to analyze different CPS. With this, we discovered a gap in the perceptions of cyber-physical risk regarding maritime transport.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionIn recent years, software ecosystems have become more complex with the proliferation of distributed systems such as blockchains and distributed ledgers. Effective management of these systems requires constant monitoring to identify any potential malfunctions, anomalies, vulnerabilities, or attacks. Traditional log auditing methods can effectively monitor the health of conventional systems. Yet, they run short of handling the higher levels of complexity of distributed systems. This study aims to propose an innovative architecture for system auditing that can effectively manage the complexity of distributed systems using advanced data analytics, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.MethodsTo develop this architecture, we considered the unique characteristics of distributed systems and the various signals that may arise within them. We also felt the need for flexibility to capture these signals effectively. The resulting architecture utilizes advanced data analytics, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence to analyze and interpret the various signals emitted by the system.ResultsWe have implemented this architecture in the DELTA (Distributed Elastic Log Text Analyzer) auditing tool and applied it to the Hyperledger Fabric platform, a widely used implementation of private blockchains.DiscussionThe proposed architecture for system auditing can effectively handle the complexity of distributed systems, and the DELTA tool provides a practical implementation of this approach. Further research could explore this approach&#39;s potential applications and effectiveness in other distributed systems.},

  abstract     = {Information systems alignment with enterprise evolution affects the performance of enterprises. The systems conceptual and data quality, development time and sustainable life cycle management, are issues for enterprise competitiveness. The ability to directly generate enterprise information systems from models has been thought of as a solution to improve on these issues. Model-driven systems have been a research topic for decades. Fundamental principles for a proven model-driven information systems architecture are outlined in this article. Architectural foundation is a separation of user communities conceptual domain from the information technical domain. The users domain is modeled as an information system model in three layers, conceptual data logic model, interface model and user community model. The technical domain is a platform, allowing the modeling and execution of such a model. These principles have been applied in practice and proven viable. Two platforms and applications, which adhere to these principles, are briefly described.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionBlended modeling aims at boosting the development of complex multi-domain systems by enabling seamless multi-notation modeling. The synchronization mechanisms between notations are embodied in model transformations. Manually defining model transformations requires specific knowledge of transformation languages, and it is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Moreover, whenever any of the synchronized languages or notations evolves, those transformations become obsolete.MethodsIn this paper, we propose an automated solution for generating synchronization transformations in an industrial setting.ResultsThe approach entails i) the specification of mapping rules between two arbitrary domain-specific modeling languages leveraging a mapping modeling language, appositely defined for this purpose, and ii) the automatic generation of synchronization model transformations driven by the mapping rules.DiscussionWe validated the proposed approach in two use cases. Although our main goal was to provide a solution for synchronization between graphical and textual notations of UML-RT state machines, the proposed approach is language- and notation-agnostic.},

  abstract     = {Fault detection is an essential task for large-scale industrial maintenance. However, in practical applications, due to the possible harm caused by the collection of fault data, the fault samples that lead to the labeling are usually very few. Most existing methods consider training unsupervised models with a large amount of unlabeled data while ignoring the rich knowledge that existed in a small amount of labeled data. To make full use of this prior knowledge, this article proposes a reinforcement learning model, namely, adversarial reinforcement learning in weakly supervised (WS-ARL), which performs significantly better by jointly learning small labeled anomaly data and large unlabeled data. We use an agent of the reinforcement learning model as a fault detector and add a new environment agent as a sample selector, by providing an opposite reward for two agents, and they learn in an adversarial environment. The feasibility and effectiveness of the model are verified by experimental analysis and compared the performance of the model with five state-of-the-art weakly/un-supervised methods in the hydraulic press fault detection task.},

  abstract     = {Philosophers have long recognized the value of metaphor as a tool that opens new avenues of investigation. By seeing brains as having the goal of representation, the computer metaphor in its various guises has helped systems neuroscience approach a wide array of neuronal behaviors at small and large scales. Here I advocate a complementary metaphor, the internet. Adopting this metaphor shifts our focus from computing to communication, and from seeing neuronal signals as localized representational elements to seeing neuronal signals as traveling messages. In doing so, we can take advantage of a comparison with the internet&#39;s robust and efficient routing strategies to understand how the brain might meet the challenges of network communication. I lay out nine engineering strategies that help the internet solve routing challenges similar to those faced by brain networks. The internet metaphor helps us by reframing neuronal activity across the brain as, in part, a manifestation of routing, which may, in different parts of the system, resemble the internet more, less, or not at all. I describe suggestive evidence consistent with the brain&#39;s use of internet-like routing strategies and conclude that, even if empirical data do not directly implicate internet-like routing, the metaphor is valuable as a reference point for those investigating the difficult problem of network communication in the brain and in particular the problem of routing.},

  abstract     = {One traditional model of research on mixed-reality systems, is the laboratory-based experiment where a number of small variants of a user experience are presented to participants under the guidance of an experimenter. This type of experiment can give reliable and generalisable results, but there are arguments for running experiments that are distributed and remote from the laboratory. These include, expanding the participant pool, reaching specific classes of user, access to a variety of equipment, and simply because laboratories might be inaccessible. However, running experiments out of the laboratory brings a different set of issues into consideration. Here, we present some lessons learnt in running eleven distributed and remote mixed-reality experiments. We describe opportunities and challenges of this type of experiment as well as some technical lessons learnt.},
