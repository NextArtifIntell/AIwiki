  abstract = {Proton imaging has become a key diagnostic for measuring electromagnetic fields in high-energy-density (HED) laboratory plasmas. Compared to other techniques for diagnosing fields, proton imaging is a measurement that can simultaneously offer high spatial and temporal resolution and the ability to distinguish between electric and magnetic fields without the protons perturbing the plasma of interest. Consequently, proton imaging has been used in a wide range of HED experiments, from inertial-confinement fusion to laboratory astrophysics. An overview is provided on the state of the art of proton imaging, including a discussion of experimental considerations like proton sources and detectors, the theory of proton-imaging analysis, and a survey of experimental results demonstrating the breadth of applications. Topics at the frontiers of proton-imaging development are also described, along with an outlook on the future of the field.},

  abstract = {A quantum internet is the holy grail of quantum information processing, enabling the deployment of a broad range of quantum technologies and protocols on a global scale. However, numerous challenges must be addressed before the quantum internet can become a reality. Perhaps the most crucial of these is the realization of a quantum repeater, an essential component in the long-distance transmission of quantum information. As the analog of a classical repeater, extender, or booster, the quantum repeater works to overcome loss and noise in the quantum channels constituting a quantum network. Here the conceptual frameworks and architectures for quantum repeaters, as well as the experimental progress toward their realization, are reviewed. Various near-term proposals to overcome the limits to the communication rates set by point-to-point quantum communication are also discussed. Finally, the manner in which quantum repeaters fit within the broader challenge of designing and implementing a quantum internet is overviewed.},

  abstract = {For quantum computers to successfully solve real-world problems, it is necessary to tackle the challenge of noise : the errors that occur in elementary physical components due to unwanted or imperfect interactions. The theory of quantum fault tolerance can provide an answer in the long term, but in the coming era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum machines one must seek to mitigate errors rather than completely eliminate them. This review surveys the diverse methods that have been proposed for quantum error mitigation, assesses their in-principle efficacy, and describes the hardware demonstrations achieved to date. Commonalities and limitations among the methods are identified, while mention is made of how mitigation methods can be chosen according to the primary type of noise present, including algorithmic errors. Open problems in the field are identified, and the prospects for realizing mitigation-based devices that can deliver a quantum advantage with an impact on science and business are discussed.},

  abstract = {Kinematic variables play an important role in collider phenomenology, as they expedite discoveries of new particles by separating signal events from unwanted background events and allow for measurements of particle properties such as masses, couplings, and spins. For the past ten years, an enormous number of kinematic variables have been designed and proposed, primarily for the experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, allowing for a drastic reduction of high-dimensional experimental data to lower-dimensional observables, from which one can readily extract underlying features of phase space and develop better-optimized data-analysis strategies. Recent developments in the area of phase-space kinematics are reviewd, and new kinematic variables with important phenomenological implications and physics applications are summarized. Recently proposed analysis methods and techniques specifically designed to leverage new kinematic variables are also reviewed. As machine learning is currently percolating through many fields of particle physics, including collider phenomenology, the interconnection and mutual complementarity of kinematic variables and machine-learning techniques are discussed. Finally, the manner in which utilization of kinematic variables originally developed for colliders can be extended to other high-energy physics experiments, including neutrino experiments, is discussed.},

  abstract = {The optics of correlated disordered media is a conceptually rich research topic emerging at the interface between the physics of waves in complex media and nanophotonics. Inspired by photonic structures in nature and enabled by advances in nanofabrication processes, recent investigations have unveiled how the design of structural correlations down to the subwavelength scale could be exploited to control the scattering, transport, and localization of light in matter. From optical transparency to superdiffusive light transport to photonic gaps, the optics of correlated disordered media challenges our physical intuition and offers new perspectives for applications. This review examines the theoretical foundations, state-of-the-art experimental techniques, and major achievements in the study of light interaction with correlated disorder, covering a wide range of systems: from short-range correlated photonic liquids to Lévy glasses containing fractal heterogeneities to hyperuniform disordered photonic materials. The mechanisms underlying light scattering and transport phenomena are elucidated on the basis of rigorous theoretical arguments. Ongoing research on mesoscopic phenomena such as transport phase transitions and speckle statistics and the current development of disorder engineering for applications such as light-energy management and visual appearance design are overviewed. Finally, special efforts are made to identify the main theoretical and experimental challenges to address in the near future.},

  abstract = {New particle formation of liquid or solid nanoparticles from gas-phase precursors is a decisive process in Earth’s atmosphere and is considered one of the largest uncertainties in climate change predictions. Key for the climate relevance of new particle formation is the growth of freshly formed molecular clusters, as it determines the survival of these particles to cloud condensation nuclei sizes, where they can contribute to the aerosol-indirect effect. This review lays out the fundamental definitions of nanoparticle growth and addresses the rapidly emerging field of new particle formation studies with a focus on the diverse processes contributing to nanoparticle growth, explicitly comparing the latest experimental findings and their implementation in large-scale models. Atmospheric nanoparticle growth is a complex phenomenon including condensational and reactive vapor uptake, aerosol coagulation, and sink processes. It is linked to thermodynamics, cluster- and phase-transition physics. Nanoparticle growth rates measured from the evolution of the particle-size distribution describe growth as a collective phenomenon, while models often interpret them on a single-particle level and incorporate it into highly simplified size-distribution representations. Recent atmospheric observations show that sulfuric acid together with ammonia and amines, iodic acid, and oxidized organic species can contribute to nanoparticle growth, whereas most models describe the growth effects from a limited subset of this variety of condensable vapors. Atmospheric simulation chamber experiments have clarified the role of ions, intermolecular forces, the interplay of acids and bases, and the contribution of different types of organic vapors. Especially in the complex thermodynamics of organic vapor condensation, the field has had noteworthy advances over the last decade. While the experimental field has achieved significant progress in methodology and process level understanding, this has not led to a similar improvement in the description of the climate impact of nanoparticle formation in large-scale models. This review sets the basis to better align experimental and modeling studies on nanoparticle growth, giving specific guidance for future studies aiming to resolve the questions as to why the climate response in large-scale models seems to be buffered against high survival probabilities and why the global growth observations herein show surprisingly low variation.},

This review provides a critical consideration and synthesis of scientific knowledge on the number concentrations, size distributions, composition, mixing state, and related properties of respiratory particles emitted upon breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing. A parametrization of respiratory particle size distributions is derived and presented based on five log-normal modes related to different origins in the respiratory tract, which can be used to trace and localize the sources of infectious particles. This approach may support the medical treatment as well as the risk assessment for aerosol and droplet transmission of infectious diseases. It was applied to analyze which respiratory activities may drive the spread of specific pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , influenza viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The results confirm the high relevance of vocalization for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the usefulness of physical distancing, face masks, room ventilation, and air filtration as preventative measures against coronavirus disease 2019 and other airborne infectious diseases.},

  abstract = {Many of the existing winged-insect species are extremely small (wing length ≈ 0.3 – 4 mm ); they are referred to as miniature insects. Yet, until recently much of our knowledge about the mechanics of insect flight was derived from studies on relatively large insects, such as flies, honeybees, hawkmoths, and dragonflies. Because of their small size, many miniature insects fly at a Reynolds number ( Re ) on the order of 10 or less. At such a low Re , the viscous effect of the air is substantial: A miniature insect moves through the air as a bumblebee would move through mineral oil. The great importance of viscosity for miniature insects means that their flight relies on physical mechanisms that are different than those exploited by large insects. These differences range from the nature of the wing stroke to the structure of the wings, with some insects even using porous (bristled) wings to fly. Over the past decade, much work has been done in the study of the mechanics of flight in miniature insects: novel flapping modes have been discovered and new mechanisms of aerodynamic-force generation have been revealed; progress has also been made on fluid-mechanics-related flight problems such as flight power requirements and flight dynamic stability. This Colloquium reviews these developments and discusses potential future directions.},

  abstract = {Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) was born in the late 1970s, when it was realized at nuclear physics laboratories that the accelerator systems can be used as a sensitive mass spectrometer to measure ultralow traces of long-lived radioisotopes. It soon became possible to measure radioisotope-to-stable-isotope ratios in the range from 10 − 1 2 to 10 − 1 6 by counting the radioisotope ions “atom by atom” and comparing the count rate with ion currents of stable isotopes ( 1.6 μ A = 1 × 10 1 3 singly charged ions/s). It turned out that electrostatic tandem accelerators are best suited for this, and there are now worldwide about 160 AMS facilities based on this principle. This review presents the history, technological developments, and research areas of AMS through the 45 yr since its discovery. Many different fields are touched by AMS measurements, including archaeology, astrophysics, atmospheric science, biology, climatology, cosmic-ray physics, environmental physics, forensic science, glaciology, geophormology, hydrology, ice core research, meteoritics, nuclear physics, oceanography, and particle physics. Since it is virtually impossible to discuss all fields in detail in this review, only specific fields with recent advances are highlighted in detail. For the others, an effort is made to provide relevant references for in-depth studies of the respective fields.},

The rapid accumulation of observational data has painted the following sketch about the physical origin of FRBs: They predominantly originate from cosmological distances, so their sources produce the most extreme coherent radio emission in the Universe; at least some, probably most, FRBs are repeating sources that do not invoke cataclysmic events; and at least some FRBs are produced by magnetars, neutron stars with the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. Many open questions regarding the physical origin(s) and mechanism(s) of FRBs remain. This review addresses the phenomenology and possible underlying physics of FRBs. Topics include a summary of the observational data, basic plasma physics, general constraints on FRB models from the data, radiation mechanisms, source and environment models, and propagation effects, as well as FRBs as cosmological probes.

  abstract = {This review addresses the method of explicit calculations of interatomic exchange interactions of magnetic materials. This involves exchange mechanisms normally referred to as a Heisenberg exchange, a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and an anisotropic symmetric exchange. The connection between microscopic theories of the electronic structure, such as density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory, and interatomic exchange is examined. The different aspects of extracting information for an effective spin Hamiltonian that involves thousands of atoms, from electronic structure calculations considering significantly fewer atoms (1–50), is highlighted. Examples of exchange interactions of a large group of materials is presented, which involves heavy elements of the 3 d period, alloys between transition metals, Heusler compounds, multilayer systems as well as overlayers and adatoms on a substrate, transition metal oxides, 4 f elements, magnetic materials in two dimensions, and molecular magnets. Where possible, a comparison to experimental data is made that becomes focused on the magnon dispersion. The influence of relativity is reviewed in a few cases, as is the importance of dynamical correlations. Development to theories that handle out-of-equilibrium conditions is also described here. The review ends with a description of extensions of the theories behind explicit calculations of interatomic exchange to nonmagnetic situations, such as those that describe chemical (charge) order and superconductivity.},

These related conjectures and the evidence for their validity in the string theory landscape are reviewed.

  abstract = {Diffusion occurs in numerous physical systems throughout nature, drawing its generality from the universality of the central limit theorem. Approximately a century ago it was realized that an extension to this type of dynamics can be obtained in the form of “anomalous” diffusion, where distributions are allowed to have heavy power-law tails. Owing to a unique feature of its momentum-dependent dissipative friction force, laser-cooled atomic ensembles can be used as a test bed for such dynamics. The interplay between laser cooling and anomalous dynamics bears deep predictive implications for fundamental concepts in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics. The high degree of control available in cold-atom experiments allows for the parameters of the friction to be tuned, revealing transitions in the dynamical properties of the system. Rare events in both the momentum and spatial distributions are described by non-normalized states using tools adapted from infinite ergodic theory. This leads to new experimental and theoretical results that illuminate the various features of the system.},

  abstract = {The heavy-fermion metal CeCu 2 Si 2 was the first discovered unconventional, non-phonon-mediated superconductor and, for a long time, was believed to exhibit single-band d -wave superconductivity, as inferred from various measurements hinting at a nodal gap structure. More recently, however, measurements using a range of techniques at low temperatures ( T ⪅ 0.1 K ) provided evidence for a fully gapped superconducting order parameter. In this Colloquium, after a historical overview the apparently conflicting results of numerous experimental studies on this compound are surveyed. The different theoretical scenarios that have been applied to understanding the particular gap structure are then addressed, including both isotropic (sign-preserving) and anisotropic two-band s -wave superconductivity, as well as an effective two-band d -wave model, where the latter can explain the currently available experimental data on CeCu 2 Si 2 . The lessons from CeCu 2 Si 2 are expected to help uncover the Cooper-pair states in other unconventional, fully gapped superconductors with strongly correlated carriers, and, in particular, highlight the rich variety of such states enabled by orbital degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {The spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry has led to the discovery of a new phase of matter: the discrete time crystal. Discrete time crystals exhibit rigid subharmonic oscillations that result from a combination of many-body interactions, collective synchronization, and ergodicity breaking. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in the study of quantum and classical discrete time crystals. The breaking of ergodicity is focused upon as the key to discrete time crystals and the delaying of ergodicity as the source of numerous phenomena that share many of the properties of discrete time crystals, including the ac Josephson effect, coupled map lattices, and Faraday waves. Theoretically, there is a diverse array of strategies to stabilize time-crystalline order in both closed and open systems, ranging from localization and prethermalization to dissipation and error correction. Experimentally, many-body quantum simulators provide a natural platform for investigating signatures of time-crystalline order; recent work utilizing trapped ions, solid-state spin systems, and superconducting qubits are reviewed. Finally, this Colloquium concludes by describing outstanding challenges in the field and a vision for new directions on both the experimental and theoretical fronts.},

While the technology of ICF facilities themselves is interesting, this review concentrates upon the physics principles of the targets fielded on U.S. ICF facilities and upon results from the last decade of research. While there have been periods of frustration on the road to ICF ignition, recent research has demonstrated great leaps in understanding what aspects of the implosions need more control. Tangible progress in ICF is evident as burning plasmas and ignited plasmas have recently been generated, repeatedly, on the NIF stemming from decades of science and engineering understanding generated from work at the three previously mentioned facilities and in the international community.},

  abstract = {The spin degree of freedom of an electron or a nucleus is one of the most basic properties of nature and functions as an excellent qubit, as it provides a natural two-level system that is insensitive to electric fields, leading to long quantum coherence times. This coherence survives when the spin is isolated and controlled within nanometer-scale, lithographically fabricated semiconductor devices, enabling the existing microelectronics industry to help advance spin qubits into a scalable technology. Driven by the burgeoning field of quantum information science, worldwide efforts have developed semiconductor spin qubits to the point where quantum state preparation, multiqubit coherent control, and single-shot quantum measurement are now routine. The small size, high density, long coherence times, and available industrial infrastructure of these qubits provide a highly competitive candidate for scalable solid-state quantum information processing. Here the physics of semiconductor spin qubits is reviewed, with a focus not only on the early achievements of spin initialization, control, and readout in GaAs quantum dots but also on recent advances in Si and Ge spin qubits, including improved charge control and readout, coupling to other quantum degrees of freedom, and scaling to larger system sizes. First introduced are the four major types of spin qubits: single spin qubits, donor spin qubits, singlet triplet spin qubits, and exchange-only spin qubits. The mesoscopic physics of quantum dots, including single-electron charging, valleys, and spin-orbit coupling, are then reviewed. Next a comprehensive overview of the physics of exchange interactions is given, a crucial resource for single- and two-qubit control in spin qubits. The bulk of the review is centered on the presentation of results from each major spin-qubit type, the present limits of fidelity, and an overview of alternative spin-qubit platforms. A physical description of the impact of noise on semiconductor spin qubits, aided in large part by an introduction to the filter-function formalism, is then given. Last, recent efforts to hybridize spin qubits with superconducting systems, including charge-photon coupling, spin-photon coupling, and long-range cavity-mediated spin-spin interactions, are reviewed. Cavity-based readout approaches are also discussed. The review is intended to give an appreciation for the future prospects of semiconductor spin qubits while highlighting the key advances in mesoscopic physics over the past two decades that underlie the operation of modern quantum-dot and donor spin qubits.},

  abstract = {The discovery of neutrinoless β β decay could soon be within reach. This hypothetical ultrarare nuclear decay offers a privileged portal to physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. Its observation would constitute the discovery of a matter-creating process, corroborating leading theories of why the Universe contains more matter than antimatter, and how forces unify at high energy scales. It would also prove that neutrinos and antineutrinos are not two distinct particles but can transform into each other, with their mass described by a unique mechanism conceived by Majorana. The recognition that neutrinos are not massless necessitates an explanation and has boosted interest in neutrinoless β β decay. The field stands now at a turning point. A new round of experiments is currently being prepared for the next decade to cover an important region of parameter space. In parallel, advances in nuclear theory are laying the groundwork to connect the nuclear decay with the underlying new physics. Meanwhile, the particle theory landscape continues to find new motivations for neutrinos to be their own antiparticle. This review brings together the experimental, nuclear theory, and particle theory aspects connected to neutrinoless β β decay to explore the path toward, and beyond, its discovery.},

  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed dramatic progress related to various aspects of emergent topological polar textures in oxide nanostructures displaying vortices, skyrmions, merons, hopfions, dipolar waves, or labyrinthine domains, among others. For a long time, these nontrivial structures (the electric counterparts of the exotic spin textures) were not expected due to the high energy cost associated with the dipolar anisotropy: the smooth and continuous evolution of the local polarization to produce topologically protected structures would result in a large elastic energy penalty. However, it was discovered that the delicate balance and intricate interplay between the electric, elastic, and gradient energies can be altered in low-dimensional forms of ferroelectric oxide nanostructures. These can be tuned to manipulate order parameters in ways once considered impossible. This review addresses the historical context that provided the fertile background for the dawning of the polar topological era. This has been possible thanks to a fruitful, positive feedback between theory and experiment: advances in materials synthesis and preparation (with a control at the atomic scale) and characterization have come together with great progress in theoretical modeling of ferroelectrics at larger length and timescales. An in-depth scientific description to formalize and generalize the prediction, observation, and probing of exotic, novel, and emergent states of matter is provided. Extensive discussions of the fundamental physics of such polar textures, a primer explaining the basic topological concepts, an explanation of the modern theoretical and computational methodologies that enable the design and study of such structures, what it takes to achieve deterministic, on-demand control of order-parameter topologies through atomically precise synthesis, the range of characterization methods that are key to probing these structures, and their thermodynamic field-driven (temperature-driven, stress-driven, etc.) susceptibilities are included. The new emergent states of matter join together with exotic functional properties (such as chirality, negative capacitance, and coexistence of phases) that, along with their small size and ultrafast dynamical response, make them potential candidates in multifunctional devices. Finally, some open questions and challenges for the future are presented, underlining the interesting future that is anticipated in this field.},

Searches for rare decays and measurements of the effect of gravitation on positronium are used to look for new physics phenomena. In biological materials positronium decays are sensitive to the intermolecular and intramolecular structure and to the metabolism of living organisms ranging from single cells to human beings. This leads to new ideas of positronium imaging in medicine using the fact that during positron emission tomography (PET) as much as 40\% of positron annihilation occurs through the production of positronium atoms inside the patient’s body.

  abstract = {For half a century after the discovery of superconductivity, materials exploration for better superconductors proceeded without knowledge of the underlying mechanism. The 1957 BCS theory cleared that up. The superconducting state occurs due to strong correlation in the electronic system: pairing of electrons over the Fermi surface. Over the following half century a higher critical temperature T c was achieved only serendipitously as new materials were synthesized. Meanwhile, the formal theory of phonon-coupled superconductivity at the material-dependent level became progressively more highly developed: by 2000, given a known compound, its value of T c , the corresponding superconducting gap function, and several other properties of the superconducting state became available independent of further experimental input. In this century, density-functional-theory-based computational materials design has progressed to a predictive level; new materials can be predicted from free energy functionals on the basis of various numerical algorithms. Taken together these capabilities enable theoretical predictions for new superconductors, justified by applications to superconductors ranging from weak to strong coupling. Limitations of the current procedures are discussed; most of them can be handled with additional procedures. Here the process that has resulted in the three new highest temperature superconductors is recounted, with compressed structures predicted computationally and values of T c obtained numerically that have subsequently been confirmed experimentally: the designed superconductors SH 3 , LaH 10 , and YH 9 . These hydrides have T c in the 200–260 K range at megabar pressures; the experimental results and confirmations are discussed. While the small mass of hydrogen provides the anticipated strong coupling at high frequency, it is shown that it also enables identification of the atom-specific contributions to coupling, in a manner that was previously possible only for elemental superconductors. The following challenge is posed: that progress in understanding of higher T c is limited by the lack of understanding of screening of H displacements. Ongoing activities are mentioned and current challenges are suggested, together with regularities that are observed in compressed hydrides that may be useful to guide further exploration.},

  abstract = {The Helfrich-Hurault (HH) elastic instability is a well-known mechanism behind patterns that form as a result of strain upon liquid crystal systems with periodic ground states. In the HH model, layered structures undulate and buckle in response to local, geometric incompatibilities in order to maintain the preferred layer spacing. Classic HH systems include cholesteric liquid crystals under electromagnetic field distortions and smectic liquid crystals under mechanical strains, where both materials are confined between rigid substrates. However, richer phenomena are observed when undulation instabilities occur in the presence of deformable interfaces and variable boundary conditions. Understanding how the HH instability is affected by deformable surfaces is imperative for applying the instability to a broader range of materials. In this review, the HH mechanism is reexamined and special focus is given to how the boundary conditions influence the response of lamellar systems to geometrical frustration. Lamellar liquid crystals confined within a spherical shell geometry are used as the model system. Made possible by the relatively recent advances in microfluidics within the past 15 years, liquid crystal shells are composed entirely of fluid interfaces and have boundary conditions that can be dynamically controlled at will. Past and recent work that exemplifies how topological constraints, molecular anchoring conditions, and boundary curvature can trigger the HH mechanism in liquid crystals with periodic ground states is examined. The review ends by identifying similar phenomena across a wide variety of materials, both biological and synthetic. The fact that the HH mechanism is a generic and often overlooked response of periodic materials to geometrical frustration is highlighted.},

For future applications, an accurate measurement of its strength is indispensable. Here the state of the art of measurement techniques involving the coefficient of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the DMI constant D , is reviewed, with a focus on systems where the interaction arises from the interface between two materials (i.e., the interfacial DMI). An overview of the experimental techniques, as well as their theoretical background and models for the quantification of the DMI constant, is given. The measurement techniques are divided into three categories: (a) domain-wall-based measurements, (b) spin-wave-based measurements, and (c) spin-orbit torque-based measurements. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed, and D values at different interfaces are compared. The review aims to obtain a better understanding of the applicability of the different techniques to various stacks and of the origin of apparent disagreements among literature values.},

  abstract = {This review describes the emerging field of waveguide quantum electrodynamics concerned with the interaction of photons propagating in a waveguide with localized quantum emitters. The collective emitter-photon interactions can lead to both enhanced and suppressed coupling compared to the case of independent emitters. Here the focus is on guided photons and ordered emitter arrays, manifesting superradiant and subradiant states, bound photon states, and quantum correlations with promising quantum information applications. Recent groundbreaking experiments performed with different quantum platforms, including cold atoms, superconducting qubits, semiconductor quantum dots, and quantum solid-state defects, are highlighted. The review also provides a comprehensive introduction to theoretical techniques to study the interactions and dynamics of these emitters and the photons in the waveguide.},

  abstract = {Research on actinide materials, both basic and applied, has been greatly advanced by the general techniques available from high-intensity photon beams from x-ray synchrotron sources. The most important single reason is that such x-ray sources can work with minute (e.g., microgram) samples, and at this level the radioactive hazards of actinides are significantly reduced. The form and encapsulation procedures used for different techniques are discussed, followed by the basic theory for interpreting the results. To demonstrate the potential of synchrotron radiation techniques for the study of lattice and electronic structure, hybridization effects, multipolar order, and lattice dynamics in actinide materials, a selection of x-ray diffraction, resonant elastic x-ray scattering, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant and nonresonant inelastic scattering, dispersive inelastic x-ray scattering, and conventional and resonant photoemission experiments are reviewed.},

  abstract = {Arrays of quantum dots (QDs) are a promising candidate system to realize scalable, coupled qubit systems and serve as a fundamental building block for quantum computers. In such semiconductor quantum systems, devices now have tens of individual electrostatic and dynamical voltages that must be carefully set to localize the system into the single-electron regime and to realize good qubit operational performance. The mapping of requisite QD locations and charges to gate voltages presents a challenging classical control problem. With an increasing number of QD qubits, the relevant parameter space grows sufficiently to make heuristic control unfeasible. In recent years, there has been considerable effort to automate device control that combines script-based algorithms with machine learning (ML) techniques. In this Colloquium, a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in the automation of QD device control is presented, with a particular emphasis on silicon- and GaAs-based QDs formed in two-dimensional electron gases. Combining physics-based modeling with modern numerical optimization and ML has proven effective in yielding efficient, scalable control. Further integration of theoretical, computational, and experimental efforts with computer science and ML holds vast potential in advancing semiconductor and other platforms for quantum computing.},

  abstract = {Some measurements in quantum mechanics disturb each other. This has puzzled physicists since the formulation of the theory, but only in recent decades has the incompatibility of measurements been analyzed in depth and detail, using the notion of joint measurability of generalized measurements. In this Colloquium joint measurability and incompatibility are reviewed from the perspective of quantum information science. The Colloquium starts by discussing the basic definitions and concepts. An overview on applications of incompatibility, such as in measurement uncertainty relations, the characterization of quantum correlations, or information processing tasks like quantum state discrimination, is then presented. Finally, emerging directions of research, such as a resource theory of incompatibility as well as other concepts to grasp the nature of measurements in quantum mechanics, are discussed.},

  abstract = {The quantum Hall (QH) effect, quantized Hall resistance combined with zero longitudinal resistance, is the characteristic experimental fingerprint of Chern insulators—topologically nontrivial states of two-dimensional matter with broken time-reversal symmetry. In Chern insulators, nontrivial bulk band topology is expressed by chiral states that carry current along sample edges without dissipation. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect refers to QH effects that occur in the absence of external magnetic fields due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. The QAH effect has now been realized in four different classes of two-dimensional materials: (i) thin films of magnetically (Cr- and/or V-) doped topological insulators in the ( Bi , Sb ) 2 Te 3 family, (ii) thin films of the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi 2 Te 4 , (iii) moiré materials formed from graphene, and (iv) moiré materials formed from transition-metal dichalcogenides. In this Colloquium, the physical mechanisms responsible for each class of QAH insulator are reviewed, with both differences and commonalities highlighted, and potential applications of the QAH effect are commented upon.},

In real materials, disorder is inevitable and pins the Goldstones of broken translations. The Colloquium describes how pinning can be incorporated into the effective field theory at low energies without making any assumptions on the presence of boost symmetry. The essential role played by gauge-gravity duality models in establishing these effective field theories with only approximate symmetries is reviewed. The Colloquium closes with a discussion on the relevance of these models to the phenomenology of dc and ac transport in strongly correlated strange and bad metals, such as high-temperature superconductors.},
