  abstract     = {Topological defects in active polar fluids can organize spontaneous flows and influence macroscopic density patterns. Both of them play an important role during animal development. Yet the influence of density on active flows is poorly understood. Motivated by experiments on cell monolayers confined to disks, we study the coupling between density and polar order for a compressible active polar fluid in the presence of a + 1 topological defect. As in the experiments, we find a density-controlled spiral-to-aster transition. In addition, biphasic orientational phases emerge as a generic outcome of such coupling. Our results highlight the importance of density gradients as a potential mechanism for controlling flow and orientational patterns in biological systems.},

  abstract     = {I report on the experimental confirmation that critical percolation statistics underlie the ordering kinetics of twisted nematic phases in the Allen-Cahn universality class. Soon after the ordering starts from a homogeneous disordered phase and proceeds toward a broken Z 2 -symmetry phase, the system seems to be attracted to the random percolation fixed point at a special timescale t p . At this time, exact formulas for crossing probabilities in percolation theory agree with the corresponding probabilities in the experimental data. The ensuing evolution for the number density of hull-enclosed areas is described by an exact expression derived from a percolation model endowed with curvature-driven interface motion. Scaling relation for hull-enclosed areas versus perimeters reveals that the fractal percolation geometry is progressively morphed into a regular geometry up to the order of the classical coarsening length. In view of its universality and experimental possibilities, the study opens a path for exploring percolation keystones in the realm of nonequilibrium, phase-ordering systems.},

We prove that, for the critical Kauffman model with connectivity one, the number of attractors grows at least, and at most, as ( 2 / e ) N .

However, since passengers often travel greedily to maximize their own benefit and trigger traffic jams, overall transportation performance can be heavily disrupted. We develop adaptation rules that leverage optimal transport theory to effectively route passengers along their shortest paths while also strategically tuning edge weights to optimize traffic. As a result, we enforce both global and local optimality of transport. We prove the efficacy of our approach on synthetic networks and on real data. Our findings on the international European highways suggest that thoughtfully devised routing schemes might help to lower car-produced carbon emissions.},

Such states, however, are rarely observed in the lowest-energy Landau level, namely at filling factors ν &lt; 1 . Here, we report evidence for an even-denominator FQHS at ν = 1 / 4 in ultra-high-quality two-dimensional hole systems confined to modulation-doped GaAs quantum wells. We observe a deep minimum in the longitudinal resistance at ν = 1 / 4 , superimposed on a highly insulating background, suggesting a close competition between the ν = 1 / 4 FQHS and the magnetic-field-induced, pinned Wigner solid states. Our experimental observations are consistent with the very recent theoretical calculations that predict that substantial Landau level mixing, caused by the large hole effective mass, can induce composite fermion pairing and lead to a non-Abelian FQHS at ν = 1 / 4 . Our results demonstrate that Landau level mixing can provide a very potent means for tuning the interaction between composite fermions and creating new non-Abelian FQHSs.},

When only one layer has Kekulé-O order, there is a parameter regime for which the lowest four bands at charge neutrality form an isolated two-orbital honeycomb lattice model with two flat bands. The bandwidths are minimal at a magic twist angle θ ≈ 0.7 ° and Dirac mass m ≈ 100 meV . When both layers have Kekulé-O order, there is a large parameter regime around θ ≈ 1 ° and m ≳ 100 meV in which the lowest three valence and conduction bands at charge neutrality each realize isolated kagome lattice models with one flat band, while the next three valence and conduction bands are flat bands on triangular lattices.

The operators O q satisfy the so-called Abelian fusion expressed as a simple operator product expansion.

We use a setup composed of two molecular smooth incommensurate surfaces: graphene-covered tip and substrate. The experiments and molecular dynamic simulations demonstrate independence of the friction force on the normal load for a wide range of normal loads and relative surface velocities. We propose an atomistic mechanism for this phenomenon, associated with synchronic out-of-plane surface fluctuations of thermal origin, and confirm it by numerical experiments. Based on this mechanism, we develop a theory for this type of superlubricity and show that friction force increases linearly with increasing temperature and relative velocity for velocities larger than a threshold velocity. The molecular dynamic results are in a fair agreement with predictions of the theory.},

Thus, direct experimental Grüneisen parameter data in a wide range of pressures is sparse. In this work, we developed a new device that can apply pressure (up to tens of GPa) with an extremely short time of about 0.5 ms, confidently achieving isentropic adiabatic compression. Then, we applied our new technique to sodium chloride and measured its Grüneisen parameter, which conforms to previous theoretical predictions. According to our obtained sodium chloride Grüneisen parameters, the calculated Hugoniot curve of the NaCl B1 phase appears up to 20 GPa and 960 K, which compares very well with the shock compression experimental data by Fritz et al. and other calculation works. Our results suggest that this new method can reliably measure the Grüneisen parameter of even more materials, which is significant for researching the equation of state in substances.},

In addition to weak internal wave turbulence at large scales, we observe strongly nonlinear waves, the breaking of which triggers intermittently strong turbulence at small scales. A transition to strongly nonlinear turbulence is observed at smaller scales. Our measurements are reminiscent of oceanic observations.

The keystone of our description is the assumption that the energy transfers are dominated by a class of nonlocal resonant interactions, known as the “induced diffusion” triads, which conserve the ratio between the wave frequency and vertical wave number.

We also provide ways to construct spin textures of arbitrary Hopf charges. When extending the system to four dimensions by introducing a parameter dimension, a new type of topological defect in the form of a monopole loop in photonic spin is encountered. Each point on the loop is a topological spin defect in three dimensions, and the loop itself carries quantized Hopf charges.

Our result is based on the ballistic fluctuation theory combined with generalized hydrodynamics, and can be seen as an exact “dressing” of the phenomenological soliton-gas picture first introduced by Sachdev and Young [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 , 2220 (1997) ], to the modes of generalized hydrodynamics. The resulting physics of phase fluctuations in the sine-Gordon model is qualitatively different, as the stable quasiparticles of integrability give coherent ballistic propagation instead of diffusive spreading. We provide extensive numerical checks of our analytical predictions within the classical regime of the field theory by using Monte Carlo methods. We discuss how our results are of ready applicability to experiments on tunnel-coupled quasicondensates.},

Blackbody radiation (BBR) is a major contributor to the systematic error budget of conventional atomic clocks and is notoriously difficult to characterize and control. Here, we combine infrared Stark-shift spectroscopy in a molecular lattice clock and modern quantum chemistry methods to characterize the polarizabilities of the Sr 2 molecule from dc to infrared. Using this description, we determine the static and dynamic blackbody radiation shifts for all possible vibrational clock transitions to the 10 − 16 level. This constitutes an important step toward millihertz-level molecular spectroscopy in Sr 2 and provides a framework for evaluating BBR shifts in other homonuclear molecules.},

The latter corresponds to a 2D Peierls transition, generalizing the spontaneous bond dimerization driven by phonon-electron interactions in the 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Here the bosonic nature of the atoms plays a crucial role to generate the phase, as similar generalizations with fermionic matter do not lead to a plaquette structure. Similar to the SSH model, we show how this pattern opens a nontrivial topological gap in 2D, resulting in a higher-order topological phase hosting corner states, that we characterize by means of a many-body topological invariant and through its entanglement structure. Finally, we demonstrate how this higher-order topological Peierls insulator can be readily prepared in atomic experiments through adiabatic protocols. Our work thus shows how atomic quantum simulators can be harnessed to investigate novel strongly correlated topological phenomena beyond those observed in natural materials.},

From the γ -ray branching and E 2 / M 1 mixing ratios for transitions deexciting the 2 2 + and 3 1 + states, the B ( E 2 ) and B ( M 1 ) were determined. Various chiral effective field theory Hamiltonians, describing the nuclear properties beyond ground states, along with a standard USDB interaction, were compared with the experimentally obtained data. Such a comparison for a large set of γ -ray transition probabilities with the valence space in medium similarity renormalization group ab initio calculations was performed for the first time in a nucleus far from stability. It was shown that the ab initio approaches using chiral effective field theory forces are challenged by detailed high-precision spectroscopic properties of nuclei.

For the particular case of a binary system with Cahn-Hilliard dynamics augmented by nonreciprocal cross-diffusion terms, we observe a nontrivial scaling of the entropy production rate across a parity-time symmetry breaking phase transition. We derive a closed-form analytic expression in the weak-noise regime for the entropy production rate due to the emergence of a macroscopic dynamic phase, showing it can be written in terms of the global polar order parameter, a measure of parity-time symmetry breaking.},

We show using Monte Carlo simulations that the majority of hard Platonic solids self-assemble entropically into space-filling crystals when constrained to the surface volume of a 3-sphere. As we gradually decrease curvature to “flatten” space and compare the local morphologies of crystals assembling in curved and flat space, we show that the Euclidean assemblies can be categorized as either remnants of tessellations in curved space (tetrahedra and dodecahedra) or nontessellation-based assemblies caused by large-scale geometric frustration (octahedra and icosahedra).},

Here, P binary patterns of length N are generated by applying to Gaussian vectors sampled in a latent space of dimension D a random projection followed by a nonlinearity. Using the replica method from statistical physics, we derive the phase diagram of the model in the limit P , N , D → ∞ with fixed ratios α = P / N and α D = D / N . Besides the usual retrieval phase, where the patterns can be dynamically recovered from some initial corruption, we uncover a new phase where the features characterizing the projection can be recovered instead. We call this phenomena the learning phase transition , as the features are not explicitly given to the model but rather are inferred from the patterns in an unsupervised fashion.},

The addition of hydrogen to the amorphous silicon network reduces both optical absorption and mechanical loss for films prepared under a range of conditions at all measured wavelengths and temperatures, with a particularly large effect on films grown at room temperature. The uptake of hydrogen is greatest in the films grown at room temperature, but still below 1.5 at.\% H, which show an ultralow optical absorption (below 10 ppm) measured at 2000 nm for 500-nm-thick films.

This Berry curvature is closely related to the uniaxial strain in accordance with the symmetry constraint, leading to a highly tunable NDD, whose sign and strength can be tuned via strain direction. We choose the lattice model of MnBi 2 Te 4 as a concrete example. The coupling between mixed Berry curvature and strain also suggests the magnetic quadrupole of the Bloch wave packet as the macroscopic order parameter probed by the NDD in two dimensions, which is distinct from the multiferroic order P × M or the spin toroidal and quadrupole order within a unit cell in previous studies.

Applying a unidirectional bias can activate multiple switching pathways in ferroelectric HfO 2 , leading to polar-antipolar phase cycling that appears to contradict classical electrodynamics. This apparent conflict is resolved by the geometric-quantum-phase nature of electric polarization that carries no definite direction.

Here we theoretically demonstrate a new class of magnons on a prototypical d -wave altermagnet RuO 2 with the compensated antiparallel magnetic order in the ground state. Based on density-functional-theory calculations we observe that the THz-range magnon bands in RuO 2 have an alternating chirality splitting, similar to the alternating spin splitting of the electronic bands, and a linear magnon dispersion near the zero wave vector. We also show that, overall, the Landau damping of this metallic altermagnet is suppressed due to the spin-split electronic structure, as compared to an artificial antiferromagnetic phase of the same RuO 2 crystal with spin-degenerate electronic bands and chirality-degenerate magnon bands.},

The diffraction pattern distortion shows a threshold dependence with laser fluence, not seen for magnetization quenching, consistent with a picture of domain wall motion with pinning sites. Supported by simulations, we show that a speed of ≈ 66 km / s for highly curved domain walls can explain the experimental data.

Here we show that the sub-kelvin thermal transport of the three-dimensional S = 1 / 2 hyperhyperkagome quantum magnet PbCuTe 2 O 6 is governed by a sizeable charge-neutral fermionic contribution which is compatible with the itinerant fractionalized excitations of a spinon Fermi surface. We demonstrate that this hallmark feature of the QSL state is remarkably robust against sample crystallinity, large magnetic field, and field-induced magnetic order, ruling out the imitation of QSL features by extrinsic effects. Our findings thus reveal the characteristic low-energy features of PbCuTe 2 O 6 which qualify this compound as a true QSL material.},

  abstract     = {Whereas point-gap topological phases are responsible for exceptional phenomena intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, their realization in quantum materials is still elusive. Here, we propose a simple and universal platform of point-gap topological phases constructed from Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors. We show that ( d − 1 )-dimensional point-gap topological phases are realized by making a boundary in d -dimensional topological insulators and superconductors dissipative. A crucial observation of the proposal is that adding a decay constant to boundary modes in d -dimensional topological insulators and superconductors is topologically equivalent to attaching a ( d − 1 )-dimensional point-gap topological phase to the boundary. We furthermore establish the proposal from the extended version of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, relating dissipative gapless modes to point-gap topological numbers. From the bulk-boundary correspondence of the point-gap topological phases, the resultant point-gap topological phases exhibit exceptional boundary states or in-gap higher-order non-Hermitian skin effects.},

Here, we show that, even when driven far from their equilibrium ground state, Chern insulators can inherit topological edge features from their parent Hamiltonian. In particular, we show that the asymptotic long-time approach of the nonequilibrium steady state, governed by a Lindblad master equation, can exhibit edge-selective extremal damping. This phenomenon derives from edge states of non-Hermitian extensions of the parent Chern insulator Hamiltonian. The combination of (non-Hermitian) topology and dissipation hence allows one to design topologically robust, spatially localized damping patterns.},

Such interactions are challenging to deduce from linear response measurements. The signature takes the form of a divergent-in-time contribution to the response—linear in time in the case when quasiparticles propagate ballistically—that is absent for free bosonic excitations. We give a physically transparent semiclassical picture of this singular behavior. While the semiclassical picture applies to a broad class of systems we benchmark it in two simple models: in the Ising chain using a form-factor expansion, and in a nonintegrable model—the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki chain—using time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulations. We comment on extensions of these results to finite temperatures.},

In a second step the DFT is used as input for a dedicated multiplet theory by which we achieve excellent agreement with available multiplet spectroscopy.

The key role of lattice order parameter (OP) reversal, occurring on a timescale comparable to that of purely electronic processes ( &lt; 100 fs ), is identified. This reversal is enabled by the anharmonic interactions between EI-OP-coupled phonons and the conventional coherent phonons, leading to a modified potential energy landscape and a high-frequency mode up-conversion. The phonon excitation depends on the dynamics of photocarriers distributed around the Fermi level, and thus intertwines with the excitonic quenching and the complete gap collapse.

Notable progress has been witnessed, but such correlated states are achievable usually at low temperatures.

Correlated insulating states at moiré band filling factors v = 1 , 2, 3 are unambiguously established in twisted bilayer MoS 2 . Remarkably, the correlated electronic state at v = 1 shows a giant correlated gap of ∼ 1 2 6 meV and may persist up to a record-high critical temperature over 285 K. The realization of a possible room-temperature correlated state with a large correlated gap in twisted bilayer MoS 2 can be understood as the cooperation effects of the stacking-specific atomic reconstruction and the resonantly enhanced interlayer hybridization, which largely amplify the moiré superlattice effects on electronic correlations. Furthermore, extreme large nonlinear Hall responses up to room temperature are uncovered near correlated electronic states, demonstrating the quantum geometry of moiré flat conduction band.},

However, for the superconducting FeSe / SrTiO 3 monolayer ( FeSe / STO ) with an interface-enhanced high transition temperature ( T c ), the electronic evolution from its Fe vacancy ordered parent phase to the superconducting state, has not been explored due to the challenge to realize an Fe vacancy order in the FeSe / STO monolayer, even though important to the understanding of superconductivity mechanism. In this study, we developed a new method to generate Fe vacancies within the FeSe / STO monolayer in a tunable fashion, with the assistance of atomic hydrogen. As a consequence, an insulating 5 × 5 Fe vacancy ordered monolayer is realized as the parent state. By using scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, the spectral evolution from superconductivity to insulator is fully characterized. Surprisingly, a prominent spectral weight transfer occurs, thus implying a strong electron correlation effect. Moreover, the Fe vacancy induced insulating gap exhibits no Mott gap-like features.

By employing a superconducting quantum interference device, we determine how orbital hybridization and detuning affect the current-phase relation in the Coulomb blockade regime. For weak hybridization between the QDs, we find π junction characteristics if at least one QD has an unpaired electron. Notably the critical current is higher when both QDs have an odd electron occupation. By increasing the inter-QD hybridization the critical current is reduced, until eventually a π − 0 transition occurs. A similar transition appears when detuning the QD levels at finite hybridization. Based on a zero-bandwidth model, we argue that both cases of phase-shift transitions can be understood considering an increased weight of states with a double occupancy in the ground state and with the Cooper pair transport dominated by local Andreev reflection.},

We illuminate the array with light directed transverse to the cavity axis, in the low saturation regime, and detect photons scattered into the cavity. For an array with integer-optical-wavelength spacing each atom scatters light into the cavity with nearly identical scattering amplitude, leading to an observed N 2 scaling of cavity photon number as the atom number increases stepwise from N = 1 to N = 8 . By contrast, for an array with half-integer-wavelength spacing, destructive interference of scattering amplitudes yields a nonmonotonic, subradiant cavity intensity versus N . By analyzing the polarization of light emitted from the cavity, we find that Rayleigh scattering can be collectively enhanced or suppressed with respect to Raman scattering. We observe also that atom-induced shifts and broadenings of the cavity resonance are precisely tuned by varying the atom number and positions. Altogether, tweezer arrays provide exquisite control of atomic cavity QED spanning from the single- to the many-body regime.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between light and cold atoms is a complex phenomenon potentially featuring many-body resonant dipole interactions. A major obstacle toward exploring these quantum resources of the system is macroscopic light propagation effects, which not only limit the available time for the microscopic correlations to locally build up, but also create a directional, superradiant emission background whose variations can overwhelm the microscopic effects. In this Letter, we demonstrate a method to perform “background-free” detection of the microscopic optical dynamics in a laser-cooled atomic ensemble. This is made possible by transiently suppressing the macroscopic optical propagation over a substantial time, before a recall of superradiance that imprints the effect of the accumulated microscopic dynamics onto an efficiently detectable outgoing field. We apply this technique to unveil and precisely characterize a density-dependent, microscopic dipolar dephasing effect that generally limits the lifetime of optical spin-wave order in ensemble-based atom-light interfaces.},

The world’s most intense pulsed negative muon beam at the Muon Science Facility of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex allows improvement of previous measurements and testing further C P T invariance by comparing the magnetic moments and masses of positive and negative muons (second-generation leptons). We report new ground-state HFS measurements of muonic helium-4 atoms at a near-zero magnetic field, performed for the first time using a small admixture of CH 4 as an electron donor to form neutral muonic helium atoms efficiently. Our analysis gives Δ ν = 4464.980 ( 20 ) MHz (4.5 ppm), which is more precise than both previous measurements at weak and high fields. The muonium ground-state HFS was also measured under the same conditions to investigate the isotopic effect on the frequency shift due to the gas density dependence in He with CH 4 admixture and compared with previous studies. Muonium and muonic helium can be regarded as light and heavy hydrogen isotopes with an isotopic mass ratio of 36. No isotopic effect was observed within the current experimental precision.},

  abstract     = {Interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) is a significant fragmentation mechanism observed in weakly bound systems. It has been widely accepted that ICD-induced molecular fragmentation occurs through a two-step process, involving ICD as the first step and dissociative-electron attachment (DEA) as the second step. In this study, we conducted a fragmentation experiment of ArCH 4 by electron impact, utilizing the coincident detection of one electron and two ions. In addition to the well-known decay pathway that induces pure ionization of CH 4 , we observed a new channel where ICD triggers the ionization dissociation of CH 4 , resulting in the cleavage of the C-H bond and the formation of the CH 3 + and H ion pair. The high efficiency of this channel, as indicated by the relative yield of the Ar + / CH 3 + ion pair, agrees with the theoretical prediction [L. S. Cederbaum, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 8964 (2020) .; Y. C. Chiang et al. , Phys. Rev. A 100 , 052701 (2019) .]. These results suggest that ICD can directly break covalent bonds with high efficiency, bypassing the need for DEA. This finding introduces a novel approach to enhance the fragmentation efficiency of molecules containing covalent bonds, such as DNA backbone.},

These bonus relations go beyond the famous 1 / z 2 behavior under a large BCFW shift and use knowledge about certain zeros of graviton amplitudes in collinear kinematics. This extra knowledge can be used in the context of global residue theorems by writing the amplitude in a special form using canonical building blocks. In the next-to-maximally-helicity-violating case, these building blocks are dressed one-loop leading singularities, the same objects that appear in the expansion of Yang-Mills amplitudes, where each term corresponds to an R invariant. Unlike other approaches, our formula is not an expansion in terms of cyclic objects and does not manifest color-kinematics duality but rather preserves the permutational symmetry of its building blocks. We also comment on the possible connection to Grassmannian geometry and give some nontrivial evidence of such structure for graviton amplitudes.},

Soon thereafter, Carpet-2 at Baksan Neutrino Observatory reported the observation of an air shower consistent with being caused by a photon of energy 251 TeV from the same GRB. Given the source redshift z = 0.151 , the expected attenuation due to the extragalactic background light is very severe so that these detections have proven very hard to explain.

Numerical simulations for moderate-sized networks show that the preparation time for these complex multiqubit states increases at most linearly with the system size and that one may benefit from an additional speedup in the limit of a large amplifier bandwidth. Therefore, this scheme offers an intriguing new route for distributing ready-to-use multipartite entangled states across large quantum networks, without requiring any precise pulse control and relying on a single Gaussian entanglement source only.},

  abstract     = {Ergodicity of quantum dynamics is often defined through statistical properties of energy eigenstates, as exemplified by Berry’s conjecture in single-particle quantum chaos and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in many-body settings. In this work, we investigate whether quantum systems can exhibit a stronger form of ergodicity, wherein any time-evolved state uniformly visits the entire Hilbert space over time. We call such a phenomenon complete Hilbert-space ergodicity (CHSE), which is more akin to the intuitive notion of ergodicity as an inherently dynamical concept. CHSE cannot hold for time-independent or even time-periodic Hamiltonian dynamics, owing to the existence of (quasi)energy eigenstates which precludes exploration of the full Hilbert space. However, we find that there exists a family of aperiodic, yet deterministic drives with minimal symbolic complexity—generated by the Fibonacci word and its generalizations—for which CHSE can be proven to occur. Our results provide a basis for understanding thermalization in general time-dependent quantum systems.},

To explain the observed drop in evaporation rate at higher RH, we need to invoke compressive stresses due to interfacial polymer gelation. Moreover, RH-insensitive evaporation sets in earlier than theory predicts, suggesting a further role for a gelled “skin.” We discuss the relevance of these observations for respiratory virus transmission via aerosols.},

  abstract     = {Transport properties of doped conjugated polymers (CPs) have been widely analyzed with the Gaussian disorder model (GDM) in conjunction with hopping transport between localized states. These models reveal that even in highly doped CPs, a majority of carriers are still localized because dielectric permittivity of CPs is well below that of inorganic materials, making Coulomb interactions between carriers and dopant counterions much more pronounced. However, previous studies within the GDM did not consider the role of screening the dielectric interactions by carriers. Here we implement carrier screening in the Debye-Hückel formalism in our calculations of dopant-induced energetic disorder, which modifies the Gaussian density of states (DOS). Then we solve the Pauli master equation using Miller-Abrahams hopping rates with states from the resulting screened DOS to obtain conductivity and Seebeck coefficient across a broad range of carrier concentrations and compare them to measurements. Our results show that screening has significant impact on the shape of the DOS and consequently on carrier transport, particularly at high doping. We prove that the slope of Seebeck coefficient versus electric conductivity, which was previously thought to be universal, is impacted by screening and decreases for systems with small dopant-carrier separation, explaining our measurements. We also show that thermoelectric power factor is underestimated by a factor of ∼ 10 at higher doping concentrations if screening is neglected. We conclude that carrier screening plays a crucial role in curtailing dopant-induced energetic disorder, particularly at high carrier concentrations.},

In one dimension, the KPZ equation is exactly solvable and its statistical properties are known to an exquisite degree. Yet recent numerical simulations in the tensionless (or inviscid) limit of the KPZ equation [C.

In this Letter, we show that this scaling is controlled by a fixed point which had been missed so far and which corresponds to an infinite nonlinear coupling. Using the functional renormalization group (FRG), we demonstrate the existence of this fixed point and show that it yields z = 1 . We calculate the correlation function and associated scaling function at this fixed point, providing both a numerical solution of the FRG equations within a reliable approximation, and an exact asymptotic form obtained in the limit of large wave numbers. Both scaling functions accurately match the one from the numerical simulations.},

Polariton condensation was shown to occur above a saddle point of the two-dimensional polariton dispersion in a one-dimensional photonic crystal waveguide. A rigorous analysis of the condensation phenomenon in these systems, as well as the role of the BIC, is still missing. In the present Letter, we theoretically and experimentally fill this gap by showing that polariton confinement resulting from the negative effective mass and the photonic energy gap in the dispersion play a key role in enhancing the relaxation toward the condensed state. In fact, our results show that low-threshold polariton condensation is achieved within the effective trap created by the exciting laser spot, regardless of whether the resulting confined mode is long-lived (polariton BIC) or short-lived (lossy mode). In both cases, the spatial quantization of the polariton condensate and the threshold differences associated to the corresponding state lifetime are measured and characterized. For a given negative mass, a slightly lower condensation threshold from the polariton BIC mode is found and associated to its reduced radiative losses, as compared to the lossy one.},

Room-temperature saturation magnetization and spontaneous polarization reach ∼ 1 0 emu / cm 3 and ∼ 2 5 μ C / cm 2 , respectively, with high transition temperatures (101 K and 236 K for spin and dipole glass temperatures and 556 K and 1100 K for Curie temperatures, respectively).

This study advances our understanding of the nature of the intricate couplings of ferroic glasses.

We identified a pair of modes that form a very weakly gapped linear anticrossing at the K point that can be essentially viewed as a Dirac cone approximant. The IXS intensity in the vicinity of the quasi-Dirac point reveals a harmonic modulation of the phonon spectral weight above and below the Dirac energy, which was previously proposed as an experimental fingerprint of the nontrivial topology.

Different doping of the electrode and spacer regions in these tunnel junctions results in momentum filtering of the tunneling Dirac fermions, generating a strong transverse valley Hall current dependent on the Dirac-cone tilting. Using the parameters of an existing 2D valley material, we demonstrate that such a strong TVHE can host a giant valley Hall angle even in the absence of the Berry curvature. Finally, we predict that resonant tunneling can occur in a tunnel junction with properly engineered device parameters such as the spacer width and transport direction, providing significant enhancement of the valley Hall angle. Our work opens a new approach to generate valley polarization in realistic valleytronic systems.},

We use this approach to generate dark-current-free 1.2 GeV, 4.5\% relative energy spread electron bunches with 120 TW laser pulses guided in a 110 mm-long hydrodynamic optical-field-ionized plasma channel. Our experiments and particle-in-cell simulations show that high-quality electron bunches were only obtained when the drive pulse was closely aligned with the channel axis, and was focused close to the density down ramp formed at the channel entrance. Start-to-end simulations of the channel formation, and electron injection and acceleration show that increasing the channel length to 410 mm would yield 3.65 GeV bunches, with a slice energy spread ∼ 5 × 10 − 4 .},

A direct analog of frequency combs in the magnonic systems has not been demonstrated to date. In our experiment, we generate a new magnonic frequency comb in the resonator with giant mechanical oscillations through the magnomechanical interaction. We observe the magnonic frequency comb contains up to 20 comb lines, which are separated by the mechanical frequency of 10.08 MHz. The thermal effect based on the strong pump power induces the cyclic oscillation of the magnon frequency shift, which leads to a periodic oscillation of the magnonic frequency comb. Moreover, we demonstrate the stabilization and control of the frequency spacing of the magnonic frequency comb via injection locking. Our Letter lays the groundwork for magnonic frequency combs in the fields of sensing and metrology.},

Interestingly, these concepts may be extended to excited states, for which it is possible to define equivalent excited-state quantum phase transitions. However, the experimental mapping of a phase diagram of excited quantum states has not yet been realized. Here we present the experimental determination of the excited-state phase diagram of an atomic ferromagnetic quantum gas, where, crucially, the excitation energy is one of the control parameters.

Here we report an experimental observation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a degenerate Fermi gas in the cavity after quenching the pump strength over a superradiant quantum phase transition. The relaxation dynamics exhibits impressively different stages of a delay, violent relaxation, long-lifetime prethermalization, and slowly final thermalization due to the photon-mediated long-range interaction with dissipation. Importantly, we reveal that the lifetime of the system stayed on the prethermalization exhibits the superlinear scaling of the atom number. Furthermore, we show that the backaction of the superradiant cavity field on the gas causes the exchange of atoms between the normal and superradiant state in the early evolution and then induces the prethermalization. This work opens an avenue to explore complex nonequilibrium dynamics of the dissipatively long-range interacting Fermi gases.},

Resolving those transitions and possible metastable phases temporally are key enablers for these applications, but challenge existing experimental approaches. Extreme nonlinear optics can help probe phase changes, as higher-order nonlinearities have higher sensitivity and temporal resolution to band structure and lattice deformations. Here the ultrafast transition from the semiconducting to the metallic phases in polycrystalline thin-film NbO 2 is investigated by time-resolved harmonic spectroscopy. The emission strength of all harmonic orders shows a steplike suppression when the excitation fluence exceeds a threshold ( ∼ 11 – 12 mJ / cm 2 ), below the fluence required for the thermal transition—a signature of the nonthermal emergence of a metallic phase within 100 ± 20 fs . This observation is backed by full ab initio simulations as well as a 1D chain model of high-harmonic generation from both phases. Our results demonstrate femtosecond harmonic probing of phase transitions and nonthermal dynamics in solids.},

Here we combine one- and two-electron reduced density matrix (1- and 2-RDM) theories with DFT to obtain a universal O ( N 3 ) generalization of DFT for static correlation. Using the lowest unitary invariant of the cumulant 2-RDM, we generate a 1-RDM functional theory that corrects the convexity of any DFT functional to capture static correlation in its fractional orbital occupations. Importantly, the unitary invariant yields a predictive theory by revealing the dependence of the correction’s strength upon the trace of the two-electron repulsion matrix. We apply the theory to the barrier to rotation in ethylene, the relative energies of the benzynes, as well as an 11-molecule, dissociation benchmark. By inheriting the computational efficiency of DFT without sacrificing the treatment of static correlation, the theory opens new possibilities for the prediction and interpretation of significant quantum molecular effects and phenomena.},

In addition to the usual calculations of energies and eigenstate observables, quantum Monte Carlo simulations can in principle be used to build fast and accurate many-body emulators using eigenvector continuation or design time-dependent Hamiltonians for adiabatic quantum computing. These new applications require something that is missing from the published literature, an efficient quantum Monte Carlo scheme for computing the inner product of ground state eigenvectors corresponding to different Hamiltonians. In this work, we introduce an algorithm called the floating block method, which solves the problem by performing Euclidean time evolution with two different Hamiltonians and interleaving the corresponding time blocks. We use the floating block method and nuclear lattice simulations to build eigenvector continuation emulators for energies of He 4 , Be 8 , C 12 , and O 16 nuclei over a range of local and nonlocal interaction couplings. From the emulator data, we identify the quantum phase transition line from a Bose gas of alpha particles to a nuclear liquid.},

To better understand the nature of this state, which lies only ∼ 410 keV above the proton emission threshold, we employ the coupled-channel representation of the no-core Gamow shell model. By considering the [ H 3 + p ] , [ He 3 + n ] , and [ H 2 + H 2 ] reaction channels, we explain the excitation energy and monopole form factor of the 0 2 + state.

This conjecture is in accord with experimental data from the electron-proton collider HERA at the smallest accessible x . In this Letter, we propose to study the onset of the maximal entanglement inside the proton using diffractive deep inelastic scattering. It is shown that the data collected by the H1 Collaboration at HERA allow one to probe the transition to the maximal entanglement regime. By relating the entanglement entropy to the entropy of final-state hadrons, we find a good agreement with the H1 data using both the exact entropy formula as well as its asymptotic expansion which indicates the presence of a nearly maximally entangled state. Finally, future opportunities at the Electron Ion Collider are discussed.},

A short exposure to surface antimuons from beam line M20 at TRIUMF generates a branching ratio limit of ≲ 10 − 5 . This is comparable to or better than previous searches for this channel, although in a thus-far-unexplored region of X 0 phase space very close to the kinematic limit of the decay, where m X 0 approaches m μ + .

  abstract     = {Electroweak dipole operators in the standard-model-effective-field theory (SMEFT) are important indirect probes of quantum effects of new physics beyond the standard model (SM), yet they remain poorly constrained by current experimental analyses for lack of interference with the SM amplitudes in constructing cross section observables. In this Letter, we point out that dipole operators flip fermion helicities and so are ideally studied through single transverse spin asymmetries. We illustrate this at a future electron-positron collider with transversely polarized beams, where such an effect exhibits as azimuthal cos ϕ and sin ϕ distributions which originate from the interference of the electron dipole operators with the SM and are linearly dependent on their Wilson coefficients. This new method can improve the current constraints on the electron dipole couplings by 1–2 orders of magnitude, without depending on other new physics operators, and can also simultaneously constrain both their real and imaginary parts, offering a new opportunity for probing potential C P -violating effects.},

A theoretical model of NBrS EL in noble liquids was developed accordingly in the frameworks of Cohen-Lekner and Atrazhev. In this work, we confirm this prediction: For the first time, visible-range EL has been observed in liquid argon at electric fields reaching 90 kV / cm , using gas electron multiplier (GEM) and thick GEM structures. Absolute light yields of the EL were measured and found to be in excellent agreement with the theory, provided that the momentum-transfer cross section of electron scattering is used for calculation of the NBrS cross section (instead of the energy-transfer one).},

To date, it remains a challenge to develop an efficient high-dimensional quantum memory. Here, we experimentally realize a quantum memory that is operational in Hilbert spaces of up to 25 dimensions with a storage efficiency of close to 60\% and a fidelity of 84.2 ± 0.6\% . The proposed approach exploits the spatial-mode-independent interaction between atoms and photons which are encoded in transverse-size-invariant vortex modes. In particular, our memory features uniform storage efficiency and low crosstalk disturbance for 25 individual spatial modes of photons, thus allowing the storing of qudit states programmed from 25 eigenstates within the high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These results have great prospects for the implementation of long-distance high-dimensional quantum networks and quantum information processing.},

In this Letter we study the statistical efficiency of this approach in light of near-term quantum computing. We propose a more practical variant of the protocol, thrifty shadow estimation, in which quantum circuits are reused many times instead of having to be freshly generated for each measurement. We show that reuse is maximally effective when sampling Haar random unitaries, and maximally ineffective when sampling from the Clifford group, i.e., one should not reuse circuits when performing shadow estimation with the Clifford group. We provide an efficiently simulable family of quantum circuits that interpolates between these extremes, which we believe should be used instead of the Clifford group. Finally, we consider tail bounds for shadow estimation and discuss when median-of-means estimation can be replaced with standard mean estimation.},

  abstract     = {In the standard quantum theory, the causal order of occurrence between events is prescribed, and must be definite. This has been maintained in all conventional scenarios of operation for quantum batteries. In this study we take a step further to allow the charging of quantum batteries in an indefinite causal order (ICO). We propose a nonunitary dynamics-based charging protocol and experimentally investigate this using a photonic quantum switch. Our results demonstrate that both the amount of energy charged and the thermal efficiency can be boosted simultaneously. Moreover, we reveal a counterintuitive effect that a relatively less powerful charger guarantees a charged battery with more energy at a higher efficiency. Through investigation of different charger configurations, we find that ICO protocol can outperform the conventional protocols and gives rise to the anomalous inverse interaction effect. Our findings highlight a fundamental difference between the novelties arising from ICO and other coherently controlled processes, providing new insights into ICO and its potential applications.},

The phase distance is characterized by the Berry curvature and thus relates to topological phenomena. The significance of the full quantum geometry, including the amplitude distance characterized by the quantum metric, has started to receive attention in the last few years. Various quantum transport and interaction phenomena have been found to be critically influenced by quantum geometry. For example, quantum geometry allows counterintuitive flow of supercurrent in a flat band where single electrons are immobile. In this Essay, I will discuss my view of the important open problems and future applications of this research topic and will try to inspire the reader to come up with further ideas. At its best, quantum geometry can open a new chapter in band theory and lead to breakthroughs as transformative as room-temperature superconductivity. However, first, more experiments directly showing the effect of quantum geometry are needed. We also have to integrate quantum geometry analysis in our most advanced numerical methods. Further, the ramifications of quantum geometry should be studied in a wider range, including electric and electromagnetic responses and interaction phenomena in free- and correlated-electron materials, bosonic systems, optics, and other fields.},

Although less studied than in proteins, allosteric effects have been observed in experiments with DNA as well. In these experiments two or more proteins bind at distinct DNA sites and interact indirectly with each other, via a mechanism mediated by the linker DNA molecule. We develop a mechanical model of DNA/protein interactions which predicts three distinct mechanisms of allostery. Two of these involve an enthalpy-mediated allostery, while a third mechanism is entropy driven. We analyze experiments of DNA allostery and highlight the distinctive signatures allowing one to identify which of the proposed mechanisms best fits the data.},

  abstract     = {We reveal that the mechanical pulsation of locally synchronized particles is a generic route to propagate deformation waves. We consider a model of dense repulsive particles whose activity drives periodic change in size of each individual. The dynamics is inspired by biological tissues where cells consume fuel to sustain active deformation. We show that the competition between repulsion and synchronization triggers an instability which promotes a wealth of dynamical patterns, ranging from spiral waves to defect turbulence. We identify the mechanisms underlying the emergence of patterns, and characterize the corresponding transitions. By coarse-graining the dynamics, we propose a hydrodynamic description of an assembly of pulsating particles, and discuss an analogy with reaction-diffusion systems.},

  abstract     = {Convergence extension, the simultaneous elongation of tissue along one axis while narrowing along a perpendicular axis, occurs during embryonic development. A fundamental process that contributes to shaping the organism, it happens in many different species and tissue types. Here, we present a minimal continuum model, that can be directly linked to the controlling microscopic biochemistry, which shows spontaneous convergence extension. It is comprised of a 2D viscoelastic active material with a mechanochemical active feedback mechanism coupled to a substrate via friction. Robust convergent extension behavior emerges beyond a critical value of the activity parameter and is controlled by the boundary conditions and the coupling to the substrate. Oscillations and spatial patterns emerge in this model when internal dissipation dominates over friction, as well as in the active elastic limit.},

  abstract     = {A simple dynamical model, biased random organization (BRO), appears to produce configurations known as random close packing (RCP) as BRO’s densest critical point in dimension d = 3 . We conjecture that BRO likewise produces RCP in any dimension; if so, then RCP does not exist in d = 1 – 2 (where BRO dynamics lead to crystalline order). In d = 3 – 5 , BRO produces isostatic configurations and previously estimated RCP volume fractions 0.64, 0.46, and 0.30, respectively. For all investigated dimensions ( d = 2 – 5 ), we find that BRO belongs to the Manna universality class of dynamical phase transitions by measuring critical exponents associated with the steady-state activity and the long-range density fluctuations. Additionally, BRO’s distribution of near contacts (gaps) displays behavior consistent with the infinite-dimensional theoretical treatment of RCP when d ≥ 4 . The association of BRO’s densest critical configurations with random close packing implies that RCP’s upper-critical dimension is consistent with the Manna class d uc = 4 .},

Here, using a recently developed reservoir engineering technique, we designed and quantified the performance of a colloidal Stirling engine operating in a viscoelastic bath. While the bath acts like a viscous fluid in the quasistatic limit, and the engine’s performance agrees with equilibrium predictions, on reducing the cycle time to the bath’s structural relaxation time, the increasingly elastic response of the bath aids suppress the buildup of irreversibility. We show that the elastic energy stored during the isothermal compression step of the Stirling cycle facilitates quick equilibration in the isothermal expansion step. This results in equilibriumlike efficiencies even for cycle times shorter than the equilibration time of the colloidal particle.},

We heat a planar LCE slab to isotropic, clamp the lower surface, then cool back to nematic. Clamping prevents macroscopic elongation, producing compression and microstructure. We see that the free surface destabilizes, adopting topography with amplitude and wavelength similar to thickness. To understand the instability, we numerically compute the microstructural relaxation of a “nonideal” LCE energy. Linear stability reveals a Biot-like scale-free instability, but with oblique wave vector. However, simulation and experiment show that, unlike classic elastic creasing, instability culminates in a crosshatch without cusps or hysteresis, and is constructed entirely from low-stress soft modes.},

A first-principles description of such nuclear-electronic quantum dynamics requires not only the time-dependent treatment of nonequilibrium electron dynamics but also that of quantum protons. Quantum mechanical correlation between electrons and protons adds further complexity to such coupled dynamics. Here we extend real-time nuclear-electronic orbital time-dependent density functional theory (RT-NEO-TDDFT) to periodic systems and perform first-principles simulations of coupled quantum dynamics of electrons and protons in complex heterogeneous systems. The process studied is an electronically excited-state intramolecular proton transfer of o-hydroxybenzaldehyde in water and at a silicon (111) semiconductor-molecule interface. These simulations illustrate how environments such as hydrogen-bonding water molecules and an extended material surface impact the dynamical process on the atomistic level. Depending on how the molecule is chemisorbed on the surface, excited-state electron transfer from the molecule to the semiconductor surface can inhibit ultrafast proton transfer within the molecule. This Letter elucidates how heterogeneous environments influence the balance between the quantum mechanical proton transfer and excited electron dynamics. The periodic RT-NEO-TDDFT approach is applicable to a wide range of other photoinduced heterogeneous processes.},

In particular, the exact nature of the involved energy transfers in the indirect desorption pathway highlighted in previous experiments is not explained. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we explore a new indirect desorption mechanism in which a highly vibrationally excited CO ( v = 40 ) within an aggregate of 50 CO molecules triggers the desorption of molecules at the surface. The desorption originates first from a mutual attraction between the excited molecule and the surrounding molecule(s), followed by a cascade of energy transfers, ultimately resulting in the desorption of vibrationally cold CO ( ∼ 95\% in v = 0 ). The theoretical vibrational distribution, along with the kinetic energy one, which peaks around 25 meV for CO with low rotational levels ( v = 0 , J &lt; 7 ), is in excellent agreement with the results obtained from VUV laser induced desorption (157 nm) of CO ( v = 0 , 1) probed using REMPI.},

However, when more elaborate exceptional structures are considered, the role of symmetry becomes critical. One such case is the exceptional chain (EC), which is formed by the intersection or osculation of multiple exceptional lines (ELs). In this Letter, we investigate a non-Hermitian classical mechanical system and reveal that a symmetry intrinsic to second-order dynamical equations, in combination with the source-free principle of ELs, guarantees the emergence of ECs. This symmetry can be understood as a non-Hermitian generalized latent symmetry, which is absent in prevailing formalisms rooted in first-order Schrödinger-like equations and has largely been overlooked so far. We experimentally confirm and characterize the ECs using an active mechanical oscillator system. Moreover, by measuring eigenvalue braiding around the ELs meeting at a chain point, we demonstrate the source-free principle of directed ELs that underlies the mechanism for EC formation. Our Letter not only enriches the diversity of non-Hermitian exceptional point configurations, but also highlights the new potential for non-Hermitian physics in second-order dynamical systems.},

We construct nonasymptotic confidence intervals that hold in the elusive small-sample regime and thus fill the gap between asymptotic methods and the Bayesian approach that is known to be sensitive to prior belief and tends to underestimate uncertainty in the small-sample setting. We prove sharp bounds on extreme first-passage times that control uncertainty even in cases where the mean alone does not sufficiently characterize the statistics. Our concentration-of-measure-based results allow for model-free error control and reliable error estimation in kinetic inference, and are thus important for the analysis of experimental and simulation data in the presence of limited sampling.},

Here, we focus on the regime of cryogenic temperatures and examine the impact of spin-selective, narrow-band laser excitation on NV readout. Specifically, we demonstrate a more than fourfold improvement in sensitivity compared to that possible with nonresonant (green) illumination, largely due to a boost in readout contrast and integrated photon count. We also leverage nuclear spin relaxation under resonant excitation to polarize the N 14 host, which we then prove beneficial for spin magnetometry.

So far, reported examples are mostly three-dimensional bulk materials, either compounds with strong ionic bonds or layered materials with van der Waals interlayer gaps. Here, we report the first example in two-dimensional elemental materials—the class of group-Va monolayers. From first-principles calculations, we show that these materials possess giant negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient e 11 . Importantly, its physical mechanism is also distinct from all previous proposals, connected with the special buckling driven polarization in these elemental systems. As a result, the usually positive internal strain contribution to piezoelectricity becomes negative and even dominates over the clamped ion contribution in Bi monolayers. Based on this new mechanism, we also find several 2D crystal structures that may support negative longitudinal piezoelectricity. As another consequence, piezoelectric response in Bi monolayers exhibits a significant nonanalytic behavior, namely, the e 11 coefficient takes sizably different values (differed by ∼ 18\% ) under tensile and compressive strains, a phenomenon not known before and helpful for the development of novel electromechanical devices.},

  abstract     = {Certain types of media breaking both space-inversion (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries but preserving their combination PT exhibit the polarization rotation of reflected light even when that of transmitted light is prohibited. Such an effect is termed nonreciprocal rotation of reflected light (NRR). Although NRR shows nearly the same phenomenon as the magnetooptical Kerr effect or, equivalently, the Hall effect at optical frequencies, its origin is distinct and ascribed to a magnetoelectric (ME) effect at optical frequencies, i.e., the optical ME effect. Here we show the observation of NRR in a metallic antiferromagnet TbB 4 . The result demonstrates that the ME effect in a metallic system, which is considered to be ill defined, can be detected using reflected light. Furthermore, we spatially resolve antiferromagnetic domains in TbB 4 by microscope observations of NRR. Our work offers a unique way to probe the ME effect in metallic systems.},

  abstract     = {In the Kitaev chiral spin liquid, Ising anyons are realized as Z 2 fluxes binding Majorana zero modes, which, however, are thermal excitations with finite decay rates. On the other hand, a lattice vacancy traps a Z 2 flux even in the ground state, resulting in the stable realization of a Majorana zero mode in a vacancy. We demonstrate that spin-spin correlation functions between two vacancy sites exhibit long-range correlation arising from the fractionalized character of Majorana zero modes, in spite of the strong decay of bulk spin correlations. Remarkably, this nonlocal spin correlation does not decrease as the distance between two vacancy sites increases, signaling Majorana teleportation. Furthermore, we clarify that the nonlocal correlation can be detected electrically via the measurement of nonlocal conductance between two vacancy sites, which is straightforwardly utilized for the readout of Majorana qubits. These findings pave the way to the measurement-based quantum computation with Ising anyons trapped in vacancies of the Kitaev spin liquid.},

Here, we use Středa’s formula to derive an expression for the many-body Chern number in terms of the single-particle interacting Green’s function and its derivative with respect to a magnetic field. In this approach, we find that this many-body topological invariant can be decomposed in terms of two contributions, N 3 [ G ] + Δ N 3 [ G ] , where N 3 [ G ] is known as the Ishikawa-Matsuyama invariant and where the second term involves derivatives of Green’s function and the self-energy with respect to the magnetic perturbation. As a by-product, the invariant N 3 [ G ] is shown to stem from the derivative of Luttinger’s theorem with respect to the probe magnetic field. These results reveal under which conditions the quantized Hall conductivity of correlated topological insulators is solely dictated by the invariant N 3 [ G ] , providing new insight on the origin of fractionalization in strongly correlated topological phases.},

  abstract     = {In low-disorder, two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs), the fractional quantum Hall states at very small Landau level fillings ( ν ) terminate in a Wigner solid (WS) phase, where electrons arrange themselves in a periodic array. The WS is typically pinned by the residual disorder sites and manifests an insulating behavior, with nonlinear current-voltage ( I − V ) and noise characteristics. We report here measurements on an ultralow-disorder, dilute 2DES, confined to a GaAs quantum well. In the ν &lt; 1 / 5 range, superimposed on a highly insulating longitudinal resistance, the 2DES exhibits a developing fractional quantum Hall state at ν = 1 / 7 , attesting to its exceptional high quality and dominance of electron-electron interaction in the low filling regime. In the nearby insulating phases, we observe remarkable nonlinear I − V and noise characteristics as a function of increasing current, with current thresholds delineating three distinct phases of the WS: a pinned phase (P1) with very small noise, a second phase (P2) in which d V / d I fluctuates between positive and negative values and is accompanied by very high noise, and a third phase (P3) where d V / d I is nearly constant and small, and noise is about an order of magnitude lower than in P2. In the depinned (P2 and P3) phases, the noise spectrum also reveals well-defined peaks at frequencies that vary linearly with the applied current, suggestive of washboard frequencies. We discuss the data in light of a recent theory that proposes different dynamic phases for a driven WS.},

The positions of the observed diffraction peaks provide an accurate measurement of the local lattice spacing, while a combination of close-coupled scattering calculations and Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations reproduce the main variations in diffracted intensity. Subsequently, the diffraction results are used to enhance image contrast by measuring at different points in reciprocal space. The results open up the possibility for using helium microdiffraction to characterize the morphology of delicate or electron-sensitive materials on small scales. These include many fundamentally and technologically important samples which cannot be studied in conventional atom scattering instruments, such as small grain size exfoliated 2D materials, polycrystalline samples, and other surfaces that do not exhibit long-range order.},

Most of the nanoparticles yield by amorphization at strains greater than 20\%, with no evidence of the β -tin phase for Si. Original and unexpected mechanisms are also identified, such as the homogeneous formation of a dislocation loop embryo for the ⟨ 111 ⟩ compression of SiC nanoparticles, and an elastic softening for the ⟨ 001 ⟩ compression of Si nanoparticles.},

A vector autoregressive model can generate trajectories over yield points, resample from new initial conditions and forecast trajectory futures. A forecast confidence, essential for practical application, is derived by propagating forecasts through the Mahalanobis outlier distance, providing a powerful tool to assess coarse-grained models. Application to nanoparticles and yielding of nanoscale dislocation networks confirms low uncertainty forecasts are accurate and resampling allows for the propagation of smooth property distributions.

Here we point out a 2D bosonic system whose low energy physics goes beyond conventional paradigm of 2D homogeneous bosons, i.e., intralayer excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. With intrinsic valley-orbit coupling and valley Zeeman energy, exciton dispersion becomes linear at small momentum, giving rise to a series of novel features. The critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation of these excitons is nonzero, suggesting true long-range order in 2D homogeneous system. The dispersion of Goldstone mode at long wavelength has the form ϵ ( q ) ∼ q , in contrast to conventional linear phonon spectrum. The vortex energy deviates from the usual logarithmic form with respect to system size, but instead has an additional linear term. Superfluid to normal phase transition is no longer BKT type for system size beyond a characteristic scale, without discontinuous jump in superfluid density. With the recent experimental progress on exciton fluid at thermal equilibrium in monolayer semiconductors, our work points out an experimentally accessible system to search for unconventional 2D superfluids beyond BKT paradigm.},

Our analysis reveals an s ± -wave pairing symmetry driven by spin fluctuations. The crucial role of pressure lies in that it induces the emergence of the γ pocket, which is involved in the strongest Fermi-surface nesting. We further found the emergence of local moments in the vicinity of apical-oxygen deficiencies, which significantly suppresses the T c . Therefore, it is possible to significantly enhance the T c by eliminating oxygen deficiencies during the synthesis of the samples.},

[High-resolution photoemission on Sr 2 RuO 4 reveals correlation-enhanced effective spin-orbit coupling and dominantly local self-energies, Phys. Rev. X 9 , 021048 (2019) ]. Our analysis reveals that a simple nodal superconducting energy gap, described by the lowest possible harmonic of a gap function, does not capture the dependence of λ ab − 2 on T , so the higher angular harmonics of the energy gap function need to be introduced.},

  abstract     = {Melting and solidification processes, intertwined with convective flows, play a fundamental role in geophysical contexts. One of these processes is the formation of melt ponds on glaciers, ice shelves, and sea ice. It is driven by solar radiation and is of great significance for Earth’s heat balance, as it significantly lowers the albedo. Through direct numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we unveil a bistability phenomenon in the melt pond dynamics. As solar radiation intensity and the melt pond’s initial depth vary, an abrupt transition occurs: this tipping point transforms the system from a stable fully frozen state to another stable equilibrium state, characterized by a distinct melt pond depth. The physics of this transition can be understood within a heat flux balance model, which exhibits excellent agreement with our numerical results. Together with the Grossmann-Lohse theory for internally heated convection, the model correctly predicts the bulk temperature and the flow strength within the melt ponds, offering insight into the coupling of phase transitions with adjacent turbulent flows and the interplay between convective melting and radiation-driven processes.},

Here, we report that the interlayer twist angle in two-dimensional (2D) materials creates a nonlinear geometric phase that can compensate for the phase mismatch, and the vertical assembly of the 2D layers with a proper twist sequence generates a nontrivial “twist-phase-matching” (twist-PM) regime. The twist-PM model provides superior flexibility in the design of optical crystals, which can be applied for twisted layers with either periodic or random thickness distributions. The designed crystal from the twisted rhombohedral boron nitride films within a thickness of only 3.2 μ m is capable of producing a second-harmonic generation with conversion efficiency of ∼ 8\% and facile polarization controllability that is absent in conventional crystals. Our methodology establishes a platform for the rational design and atomic manufacturing of nonlinear optical crystals based on abundant 2D materials.},

In an experimental and theoretical study of the spectral HOM effect between a thermal field and a heralded single-photon state, we demonstrate that the HOM visibility varies dependent on the relative photon statistics of the interacting fields. Our findings reveal that multiphoton components in a heralded state get engaged in quantum interference with a thermal field, resulting in improved visibilities at certain mean photon numbers. We derive a theoretical relationship for the HOM visibility as a function of the mean photon number of the thermal field and the thermal part of the heralded state. We show that the nonclassicality degree of a heralded state is reflected in its HOM visibility with a thermal field; our results establish a lower bound of 41.42\% for the peak visibility, indicating the minimum assignable degree of nonclassicality to the heralded state. This research enhances our understanding of the HOM effect and its application to high-speed remote secret key sharing, addressing security concerns due to multiphoton contamination in heralded states.},

We present the first next-to-next-to-leading order QCD computation of t t ¯ W production at hadron colliders. The calculation is exact, except for the finite part of the two-loop virtual corrections, which is estimated using two different approaches that lead to consistent results within their uncertainties. We combine the newly computed next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections with the complete next-to-leading order QCD plus electroweak results, thus obtaining the most advanced perturbative prediction available to date for the t t ¯ W inclusive cross section.

In this Letter, we establish that the new neutral as well as the charged Higgs bosons in this model can all be simultaneously observable in the multi- b final state. The statistical significance of the signature for each of these Higgs states, resulting from the electroweak (EW) production of their pairs, can exceed 5 σ at the 13 TeV high-luminosity Large Hadron collider (HL-LHC). Since the parameter space configurations where this is achievable are precluded in the other, more extensively pursued, 2HDM types, an experimental validation of our findings would be a clear indication that the true underlying Higgs sector in nature is the type-I 2HDM.},

Unlike with shallow heating, the flow with deep heating exhibits a new dynamic equilibrium state, characterized by repeated generation of giant cyclonic storms that move away westward once formed. The formation is accompanied by a burst of heightened turbulence, leading to the production of small-scale flow structures and large-scale mixing of temperature on a timescale of ∼ 3 planetary rotations. Significantly, while effects that could be important (e.g., coupled radiative flux and convectively excited gravity waves) are not included, over a timescale of several hundred days the simulations robustly show that the emergent thermal flux depends strongly on the heating type and is distinguishable by current observations.},

Here, we point out that there exists a purely leptonic mechanism to produce TeV-scale neutrinos in astrophysical environments. In particular, very high-energy synchrotron photons can scatter with x rays, exceeding the threshold for muon-antimuon pair production. When these muons decay, they produce neutrinos without any cosmic-ray protons or nuclei being involved. In order for this mechanism to be efficient, the source in question must produce very high-energy photons which interact in an environment that is dominated by keV-scale radiation.

We first design probabilistic implementations of our scheme that are plug and play, independent of the noise characteristic and require no postprocessing. We then enhance the success probability (up to deterministic) using adaptive corrections. We provide an analysis of our protocol performance and demonstrate that unit fidelity can be achieved asymptotically. Our approaches are suitable to both standard gate-based and measurement-based computational models.},

  abstract     = {The fission of a string connecting two charges is an astounding phenomenon in confining gauge theories. The dynamics of this process have been studied intensively in recent years, with plenty of numerical results yielding a dichotomy: the confining string can decay relatively fast or persist up to extremely long times. Here, we put forward a dynamical localization transition as the mechanism underlying this dichotomy. To this end, we derive an effective string breaking description in the light-meson sector of a confined spin chain and show that the problem can be regarded as a dynamical localization transition in Fock space. Fast and suppressed string breaking dynamics are identified with delocalized and localized behavior, respectively. We then provide a further reduction of the dynamical string breaking problem onto a quantum impurity model, where the string is represented as an “impurity” immersed in a meson bath. It is shown that this model features a localization-delocalization transition, giving a general and simple physical basis to understand the qualitatively distinct string breaking regimes. These findings are directly relevant for a wider class of confining lattice models in any dimension and could be realized on present-day Rydberg quantum simulators.},

There exists a large geodesically convex component that is attractive for a wide range of optimization dynamics. Inside this region we identify a subset of atypical high-margin solutions that are geodesically connected with most other solutions, giving rise to a star-shaped geometry.

Yet, finding such initial conditions is a daunting task precisely because of the chaotic nature of the system. In this Letter, we circumvent this problem by proposing a framework for finding an effective topologically conjugate map whose typical trajectories correspond to atypical ones of the original map. This is illustrated by means of examples which focus on counterbalancing the instability of fixed points and periodic orbits, as well as on the characterization of a dynamical phase transition involving the finite-time Lyapunov exponent. The procedure parallels that of the application of the generalized Doob transform in the stochastic dynamics of Markov chains, diffusive processes, and open quantum systems, which in each case results in a new process having the prescribed statistics in its stationary state. This Letter thus brings chaotic maps into the growing family of systems whose rare fluctuations—sustaining prescribed statistics of dynamical observables—can be characterized and controlled by means of a large-deviation formalism.},

They show complex emergent dynamics and stationary phenomena which, despite the collective nature of their interaction, are still largely not understood. Here, we derive exact results on the emergent behavior of open quantum central spin systems. The latter crucially depends on the scaling of the interaction strength with the bath size. For scalings with the inverse square root of the bath size (typical of one-to-many interactions), the system behaves, in the thermodynamic limit, as an open quantum Jaynes-Cummings model, whose bosonic mode encodes the quantum fluctuations of the bath spins. In this case, non-Gaussian correlations are dynamically generated and persist at stationarity. For scalings with the inverse bath size, the emergent dynamics is instead of mean-field type. Our Letter provides a fundamental understanding of the different dynamical regimes of central spin systems and a simple theory for efficiently exploring their nonequilibrium behavior. Our findings may become relevant for developing fully quantum descriptions of many-body solid-state devices and their applications.},

  abstract     = {The mean first passage time (MFPT) of random walks is a key quantity characterizing dynamic processes on disordered media. In a random fractal embedded in the Euclidean space, the MFPT is known to obey the power law scaling with the distance between a source and a target site with a universal exponent. We find that the scaling law for the MFPT is not determined solely by the distance between a source and a target but also by their locations. The role of a site in the first passage processes is quantified by the random walk centrality. It turns out that the site of highest random walk centrality, dubbed as a hub, intervenes in first passage processes. We show that the MFPT from a departure site to a target site is determined by a competition between direct paths and indirect paths detouring via the hub. Consequently, the MFPT displays a crossover scaling between a short distance regime, where direct paths are dominant, and a long distance regime, where indirect paths are dominant. The two regimes are characterized by power laws with different scaling exponents. The crossover scaling behavior is confirmed by extensive numerical calculations of the MFPTs on the critical percolation cluster in two dimensional square lattices.},

The response moves from a regime where state filling of the excited carrier population around the Fermi level dominates towards localization of carriers onto the outer d orbitals. This is in contrast to previous measurements using ultrafast element-specific core-level spectroscopy enabled by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy on transition metals such as titanium and around the transition metal atom in transition metal dichalchogenides MoTe 2 and MoSe 2 . This surprisingly different dynamical response for β -tungsten can be explained by considering the electron-electron dynamics on a few-femtosecond timescale and the slower electron-phonon thermalization dynamics.},

  abstract     = {HfO 2 -based ferroelectric thin films are promising for their application in ferroelectric devices. Predicting the ultimate magnitude of polarization and understanding its switching mechanism are critical to realize the optimal performance of these devices. Here, a generalized solid-state variable cell nudged elastic band method is employed to predict the switching pathway associated with domain-wall motion in ( Hf , Zr ) O 2 ferroelectrics. It is found that the polarization reversal pathway, where threefold coordinated O atoms pass across the nominal unit-cell boundaries defined by the Hf / Zr atomic planes, is energetically more favorable than the conventional pathway where the O atoms do not pass through these planes. This finding implies that the polarization orientation in the orthorhombic P c a 2 1 phase of HfO 2 and its derivatives is opposite to that normally assumed, predicts the spontaneous polarization magnitude of about 70 μ C / cm 2 that is nearly 50\% larger than the commonly accepted value, signifies a positive intrinsic longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, and suggests growth of ferroelectric domains, in response to an applied electric field, structurally reversed to those usually anticipated. These results provide important insights into the understanding of ferroelectricity in HfO 2 -based ferroelectrics.},

Here, we consider bosons in a kagome lattice with π -flux hopping, which, in the presence of mean-field interactions, exhibit degenerate condensates in the Γ and the K point. We analyze the excitation above both condensates and find strikingly different properties: For the K -point condensate, the Bogoliubov–de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian has broken particle-hole symmetry and exhibits a topologically trivial quasiparticle band structure. However, band flatness plays a key role in breaking the time-reversal symmetry of the BdG Hamiltonian for a Γ -point condensate. Consequently, its quasiparticle band structure exhibits nontrivial topology, characterized by nonzero Chern numbers and by the presence of edge states. Although quantum fluctuations energetically favor the K -point condensate, the interesting properties of the Γ -point condensate become relevant for anisotropic hopping. The topological properties of the Γ -point condensate get even richer in the presence of extended Bose-Hubbard interactions. We find a topological phase transition into a topological condensate characterized by high Chern number and also comment on the realization and detection of such excitations.},

While the fractional quantum Hall states that dominate in the lower-energy Landau levels have been explored experimentally in a variety of two-dimensional systems, much less work has been done to explore electron solids owing to their subtle transport signatures and extreme sensitivity to disorder. Here, we use chemical potential measurements to map the phase diagram of electron solid states in N = 2 , N = 3 , and N = 4 Landau levels in monolayer graphene. Direct comparison between our data and theoretical calculations reveals a cascade of density-tuned phase transitions between electron bubble phases up to two, three, or four electrons per bubble in the N = 2 , 3, and 4 Landau levels, respectively.

Here, we report the experimental realization of an unconventional Bose-Einstein condensate of Rb 87 atoms populating degenerate p orbitals in a triangular optical lattice, exhibiting remarkably long coherence times. Using time-of-flight spectroscopy, we observe that this state spontaneously breaks the rotational symmetry and its momentum spectrum agrees with the theoretically predicted coexistence of exotic stripe and loop-current orders.

We identify a slingshotlike injection process induced by the drifting electric field sustained by the flowing focus of backward-moving electrons, which is distinct from the well-known stochastic acceleration. The flowing focus signifies the plasma kinetic transition from a preturbulent laminar motion to a chaotic turbulence. We find a characteristic correlation between the electron dynamics in the slingshot acceleration and the photon emission features. In particular, the integrated radiation from the RCS exhibits a counterintuitive nonmonotonic dependence of the photon polarization degree on the photon energy, which originates from a polarization degradation of relatively high-energy photons emitted by the slingshot-injected electrons. Our results demonstrate the potential of photon polarization as an essential information source in exploring intricate transient dynamics in RCSs with relevance for Earth-based plasma and astrophysical scenarios.},

The condensate state requires partiy + time -reversal symmetry breaking. We demonstrate distinct universal mechanisms for the even and odd correlators under this symmetry.

Nonlinear light matter interactions serve as a coherent probe for resolving symmetries and symmetry breaking via their link to selection rules of the interaction. In the extreme nonlinear regime, high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy offers a unique spectroscopic approach to study this link, probing the crystal spatial properties with high sensitivity while opening new paths for selection rules in the XUV regime. In this Letter we establish an advanced HHG polarimetry scheme, driven by a multicolor strong laser field, to observe the structural symmetries of solids and their interplay with the HHG selection rules. By controlling the crystal symmetries, we resolve nontrivial polarization states associated with new spectral features in the HHG spectrum. Our scheme opens new opportunities in resolving the symmetries of quantum materials, as well as ultrafast light driven symmetries in condensed matter systems.},

We identify the requirements on the couplings between this boundary and the bulk, which reveals that this approach is intrinsically non-Hermitian. We then provide several examples with either an arbitrary or structured bulk, forming spectrally embedded zero modes in the bulk continuum, midgap zero modes, and even restoring the “zeroness” of coupling or disorder-shifted topological corner states. Focusing on viable realizations using photonic lattices, we show that the resulting SFZM can be observed as the single lasing mode when optical gain is applied to the boundary.},

By driving the system, we generate squeezing which has the unique property of time-independent uncertainties and squeezed dynamics.

However, the ranging capability of coherent LIDAR is principally constrained by the coherence time of the light source determined by the spectral bandwidth. Here, we introduce coherent two-photon LIDAR, which eliminates the range limitation of coherent LIDAR due to the coherence time. Our scheme capitalizes on the counterintuitive phenomenon of two-photon interference of thermal light, in which the second-order interference fringe remains impervious to the short coherence time of the light source determined by the spectral bandwidth. By combining this feature with transverse two-photon interference of thermal light, we demonstrate distance ranging beyond the coherence time without relying on time-domain interference fringes. Moreover, we show that our coherent two-photon LIDAR scheme is robust to turbulence and ambient noise. This work opens up novel applications of two-photon correlation in classical light.},

The development of extreme ultraviolet frequency combs has enabled the search for clock transitions based on shorter wavelengths in HCIs. However, without initial knowledge of the energy of the clock states, these narrow transitions are difficult to be probed by lasers. In this Letter, we provide experimental observation and theoretical calculation of a long-lived electronic state in Nb-like Pb 41 + that could be used as a clock state. With the mass spectrometer PENTATRAP, the excitation energy of this metastable state is directly determined as a mass difference at an energy of 31.2(8) eV, corresponding to one of the most precise relative mass determinations to date with a fractional uncertainty of 4 × 10 − 12 . This experimental result agrees within 1 σ with two partially different ab initio multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculations of 31.68(13) eV and 31.76(35) eV, respectively. With a calculated lifetime of 26.5(5.3) days, the transition from this metastable state to the ground state bears a quality factor of 1.1 × 10 23 and allows for the construction of a HCI clock with a fractional frequency instability of &lt; 10 − 19 / τ .},

We derive bounds on the two new mass scales that arise: v ′ where parity and mirror electroweak symmetry are spontaneously broken, and v 3 where the color groups break to the diagonal strong interactions. The strong C P problem is solved even if v 3 ≪ v ′ , when heavy colored states at the scale v 3 may be accessible at LHC and future colliders. Furthermore, we argue that the breaking of P introduces negligible contributions to θ ¯ QCD , starting at three-loop order. The symmetry breaking at v 3 can be made dynamical, without introducing an additional hierarchy problem.},

Iodine is one the heaviest targets for which low-energy ( ≤ 50 MeV ) inelastic neutrino-nucleus processes have been measured, and this is the first measurement of its inclusive cross section. After a five-year detector exposure, COHERENT reports a flux-averaged cross section for electron neutrinos of 9.2 − 1.8 + 2.1 × 10 − 40 cm 2 . This corresponds to a value that is ∼ 41\% lower than predicted using the MARLEY event generator with a measured Gamow-Teller strength distribution. In addition, the observed visible spectrum from charged-current scattering on I 127 has been measured between 10 and 55 MeV, and the exclusive zero-neutron and one-or-more-neutron emission cross sections are measured to be 5.2 − 3.1 + 3.4 × 10 − 40 and 2.2 − 0.5 + 0.4 × 10 − 40 cm 2 , respectively.},

Through linear stability analysis, we reveal the occurrence of two consecutive dynamical transitions. At a specific low temperature, the dominant unstable mode transitions from the twofold rotational symmetry mode to the threefold one, followed by a transition from the threefold one to the fourfold one at a higher temperature. As the temperature is increased, we also observe the fivefold and sixfold rotational symmetry unstable modes get excited successively. Employing the full nonlinear numerical simulations, we further demonstrate that these two novel dynamical transitions, along with the temperature-induced instabilities for the fivefold and sixfold rotational symmetry modes, can be identified by examining the resulting distinct splitting patterns, which offers a promising route for the experimental verification in the cold atom gases.},

The interplay between temporal and spatial symmetries, as well as symmetries from other internal degrees of freedom, can give rise to novel nonequilibrium phases of matter. In this Letter, we investigate a driven-dissipative superfluid model using holographic methods and reveal the existence of a spacetime supersolid (STS) phase that concomitantly breaks the time translation, spatial translation, and the internal U(1) symmetry. The holographic methods naturally include finite temperature effects, which enables us to explore the complex phase diagram of this model and observe a cascade of out-of-equilibrium phase transitions from the STS phase to a synchronized superfluid phase, and finally to a normal fluid phase, by increasing the temperature.},

We show here how this sample limit can be calculated and apply this to three separate configurations of ground-based detectors placed at existing and planned sites. Our results show that in the idealized, best-case scenario, individual multipoles of the anisotropies at ℓ ≤ 8 can only be measured to ∼ 10 − 5 – 10 − 4 level over five years of observation as a fraction of the isotropic component. As the sensitivity improves as the square root of the observation time, this poses a very serious challenge for measuring the anisotropies of SGWB of cosmological origin, even in the case of idealized detectors with arbitrarily low instrumental noise.},

  abstract     = {When two black holes merge, the late stage of gravitational wave emission is a superposition of exponentially damped sinusoids. According to the black hole no-hair theorem, this ringdown spectrum depends only on the mass and angular momentum of the final black hole. An observation of more than one ringdown mode can test this fundamental prediction of general relativity. Here, we provide strong observational evidence for a multimode black hole ringdown spectrum using the gravitational wave event GW190521, with a maximum Bayes factor of 56 ± 1 ( 1 σ uncertainty) preferring two fundamental modes over one. The dominant mode is the ℓ = m = 2 harmonic, and the subdominant mode corresponds to the ℓ = m = 3 harmonic. The amplitude of this mode relative to the dominant harmonic is estimated to be A 330 / A 220 = 0.2 − 0.1 + 0.2 . We estimate the redshifted mass and dimensionless spin of the final black hole as 33 0 − 40 + 30 M ⊙ and 0.86 − 0.11 + 0.06 , respectively. We find that the final black hole is consistent with the no-hair theorem and constrain the fractional deviation from general relativity of the subdominant mode’s frequency to be − 0.0 1 − 0.09 + 0.08 .},

Most ac sensing sequences involve a periodic echolike structure, in which the target signal is synchronized with the echo period. We show that for strongly interacting systems, this construction leads to a fundamental sensitivity limit associated with imperfect interaction decoupling. We present a simple physical picture demonstrating the origin of this limitation, and further formalize these considerations in terms of concise higher-order decoupling rules. We then show how these limitations can be surpassed by identifying a novel sequence building block, in which the signal period matches twice the echo period. Using these decoupling rules and the resulting sequence building block, we experimentally demonstrate significant improvements in dynamical decoupling timescales and magnetic field sensitivity, opening the door for new applications in quantum sensing and quantum many-body physics.},

Here, we propose rate regions to characterize the performance of duplex quantum transduction. Using this tool, we find that quantum transducers optimized for simultaneous duplex transduction can outperform strategies based on the standard protocol of time-shared unidirectional transduction. Integrated over the frequency domain, we demonstrate that the rate region can also characterize quantum transducers with finite bandwidth.},

Using the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) to characterize scrambling, we find a nonequilibrium phase transition in the directed percolation universality class at a critical swap rate p c : for p p c the OTOC fails to percolate within the system and vanishes uniformly within a finite timescale, indicating that all local operators are rapidly swapped into the environment. To elucidate its information-theoretic consequences, we demonstrate that the transition in operator spreading coincides with a transition in an observer’s ability to decode the system’s initial quantum information from the swapped-out, or “radiated,” qubits. We present a simple decoding scheme which recovers the system’s initial information with perfect fidelity in the nonpercolating phase, and with continuously decreasing fidelity with decreasing swap rate in the percolating phase. Depending on the initial state of the swapped-in qubits, we further observe a corresponding entanglement transition in the coherent information from the system into the radiated qubits.},

Our approach further allows us to identify exotic Krylov-space-resolved diffusive relaxation despite the presence of dipole conservation, which we verify numerically.

  abstract     = {We show that certain lattice gauge theories exhibiting disorder-free localization have a characteristic response in spatially averaged spectral functions: a few sharp peaks combined with vanishing response in the zero frequency limit. This reflects the discrete spectra of small clusters of kinetically active regions formed in such gauge theories when they fragment into spatially finite clusters in the localized phase due to the presence of static charges. We obtain the transverse component of the dynamic structure factor, which is probed by neutron scattering experiments, deep in this phase from a combination of analytical estimates and a numerical cluster expansion. We also show that local spectral functions of large finite clusters host discrete peaks whose positions agree with our analytical estimates. Further, information spreading, diagnosed by an unequal time commutator, halts due to real space fragmentation. Our results can be used to distinguish the disorder-free localized phase from conventional paramagnetic counterparts in those frustrated magnets which might realize such an emergent gauge theory.},

  abstract     = {The Jarzynski equality (JE), which connects the equilibrium free energy with nonequilibrium work statistics, plays a crucial role in quantum thermodynamics. Although practical quantum systems are usually multilevel systems, most tests of the JE were executed in two-level systems. A rigorous test of the JE by directly measuring the work distribution of a physical process in a high-dimensional quantum system remains elusive. Here, we report an experimental test of the JE in a single spin-1 system. We realized nondemolition projective measurement of this three-level system via cascading high-fidelity single-shot readouts and directly measured the work distribution utilizing the two-point measurement protocol. The validity of the JE was verified from the nonadiabatic to adiabatic zone and under different effective temperatures. Our work puts the JE on a solid experimental foundation and makes the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center system a mature toolbox to perform advanced experiments of stochastic quantum thermodynamics.},

Additionally, one can use oscillatory systems to temporally modulate the thermodynamic flux towards equilibrium. Focusing on the most elementary thermalization events, this modulation can be thought of as a temporal probability concentration for these events. There are two fundamental factors limiting the performance of clocks: On the one level, the inevitable drifts of the oscillatory system, which are addressed by finding stable atomic or nuclear transitions that lead to astounding precision of today’s clocks. On the other level, there is the intrinsically stochastic nature of the irreversible events upon which the clock’s operation is based. This becomes relevant when seeking to maximize a clock’s resolution at high accuracy, which is ultimately limited by the number of such stochastic events per reference time unit. We address this essential trade-off between clock accuracy and resolution, proving a universal bound for all clocks whose elementary thermalization events are memoryless.},

Our results showed that FNIII 10 follows a consistent transition pathway with an intermediate state characterized by detached A and G β strands. We determined the folding free energies and all force-dependent transition rates of FNIII 10 and found that both unfolding rates from the native state to the intermediate state and from the intermediate state to the unfolded state deviate from Bell’s model. We constructed a quantitative free energy landscape with well-defined traps and barriers that exhibits a hierarchical symmetrical pattern. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of FNIII 10 conformational dynamics and demonstrate how free energy landscape of multistate biomolecules can be precisely mapped, illuminating the relationship between thermal stability, intermediate states, and folding rates in protein folding.},

Under this model, the lifetime τ ex of the heterogeneities has little effect on the position t = t 4 ∼ τ α of the peak of χ 4 ( t ) , but it controls the decay of χ 4 ( t ) after the peak, and we show how to estimate it from this decay.},

By contrast with supported polymer thin films, the evaporative cooling experienced by suspended droplets suffices to yield ubiquitous BF formation, owing to their thermal insulation and the synchronous condensation and self-assembly of water microdroplets, accompanied by capsule skin formation and kinetic arrest. A simple model describes simultaneously the radius and temperature evolution along the droplet-to-particle transformation, and the scaling of surface pore dimensions, with environmental parameters. The generality of the approach is demonstrated with a range of model polymers, and the coupled roles of solution thermodynamics and droplet environment are shown to permit the facile design of capsules with tunable transport and dissolution kinetics.},

We show that this provides us with a faithful classification through extensive numerical simulations for a large variety of paradigmatic model systems including random matrix theories, free fermions, Bethe-ansatz solvable systems, and models of many-body localization. While existing indicators, such as those obtained from level-spacing statistics, have already been utilized with great success, they also face limitations. This concerns, for instance, the quantum many-body kicked top, which is exactly solvable but classified as chaotic in certain regimes based on the level-spacing statistics, while our introduced indicator signals the expected quantum many-body integrability. We discuss the universal behaviors we observe for the nearest-neighbor trace distances and point out that our indicator might be useful also in other contexts such as for the many-body localization transition.},

We propose a multichannel self-energy that is static and only contains the bare Coulomb interaction, making frequency convolutions and self-consistency unnecessary.

Those zeros are found to be distributed on a semicircle in the complex plane of the interaction strength due to the Fermi-surface instability. A renormalization-group analysis shows that the semicircle theorem holds for a generic quantum many-body system with a marginal coupling, in sharp contrast with the Lee-Yang circle theorem for the Ising spin system. This indicates that the geometry of Yang-Lee zeros is directly connected to the Fermi-surface instability.

However, many topological photonic devices share a boundary with free space, which raises a subtle but critical problem as free space is gapless for photons above the light line. Here, we use a local theory of topological materials to resolve bulk-boundary correspondence in heterostructures containing gapless materials and in radiative environments. In particular, we construct the heterostructure’s spectral localizer, a composite operator based on the system’s real-space description that provides a local marker for the system’s topology and a corresponding local measure of its topological protection; both quantities are independent of the material’s bulk band gap (or lack thereof). Moreover, we show that approximating radiative outcoupling as material absorption overestimates a heterostructure’s topological protection. As the spectral localizer is applicable to systems in any physical dimension and in any discrete symmetry class (i.e., any Altland-Zirnbauer class), our results show how to calculate topological invariants, quantify topological protection, and locate topological boundary-localized resonances in topological materials that interface with gapless media in general.},

Starting from a Mott-insulator state with predominantly single-site occupancy, we detect loss and heating features at specific values for the confinement length and the 3D scattering length. Two independent models, based on the coupling between the center-of-mass and the relative motion of the particles as mediated by the lattice, predict the resonance positions to a good approximation, suggesting a universal behavior. Our results extend confinement-induced resonances to any dimensionality and open up an alternative method for interaction tuning and controlled molecule formation under strong 3D confinement.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of single-particle strengths as the neutron-to-proton asymmetry changes informs us of the importance of short- and long-range correlations in nuclei and has therefore been extensively studied for the last two decades. Surprisingly, the strong asymmetry dependence of these strengths and their extreme values for highly asymmetric nuclei inferred from knockout reaction measurements on a target nucleus are not consistent with what is extracted from electron-induced, transfer, and quasi-free reaction data, constituting a two-decade old puzzle. This work presents the first consistent analysis of one-nucleon transfer and one-nucleon knockout data, in which theoretical uncertainties associated with the nucleon-nucleus effective interactions considered in the reaction models are quantified using a Bayesian analysis. Our results demonstrate that, taking into account these uncertainties, the spectroscopic strengths of loosely bound nucleons extracted from both probes agree with each other and, although there are still discrepancies for deeply bound nucleons, the slope of the asymmetry dependence of the single-particle strengths inferred from transfer and knockout reactions are consistent within 1 σ . Both probes are consistent with a small asymmetry dependence of these strengths. The uncertainties obtained in this work represent a lower bound and are already significantly larger than the original estimates.},

These physical regimes are pregeometric in the sense that they do not admit a mathematical representation of the physical degrees of freedom in terms of fields that live on a spacetime. In regimes in which a spacetime representation does emerge, the geometric properties of the emergent spacetime, such as its dimension and volume, depend on the balance of fermionic pressure and bosonic and gravitational pull. That balance depends, at any given energy scale, on the number of bosonic and fermionic species that contribute, which in turn depends on their masses.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel dark matter detection method utilizing the excitation of superconducting transmon qubits. Assuming the hidden photon dark matter of a mass of O ( 10 ) μ eV , the classical wave-matter oscillation induces an effective ac electric field via the small kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon. This serves as a coherent drive field for a qubit when it is resonant, evolving it from the ground state towards the first-excited state. We evaluate the rate of such evolution and observable excitations in the measurements, as well as the search sensitivity to the hidden photon dark matter. For a selected mass, one can reach ε ∼ 10 − 13 – 10 − 12 (where ε is the kinetic mixing parameter of the hidden photon) with a few tens of seconds using a single standard transmon qubit. A simple extension to the frequency-tunable SQUID-based transmon enables the mass scan to cover the range of 4 – 40 μ eV (1–10 GHz) within a reasonable length of run time. The scheme has great potential to extend the sensitivity towards various directions including being incorporated into the cavity-based haloscope experiments or the currently available multibit noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computer machines.},

In high-quality devices, self-assembled GaAs quantum dots are near-perfect emitters of on-demand coherent photons. However, the spin rapidly decoheres via the magnetic noise arising from the host nuclei. Here, we address this drawback by implementing an all-optical nuclear-spin cooling scheme on a GaAs quantum dot. The electron-spin coherence time increases 156-fold from T 2 * = 3.9 ns to 0.608 μ s . The cooling scheme depends on a non-collinear term in the hyperfine interaction. The results show that such a term is present even though the strain is low and no external stress is applied. Our work highlights the potential of optically active GaAs quantum dots as fast, highly coherent spin-photon interfaces.},

Assuming that the Hamiltonians representing the signals before and after the change are known, we aim to find a discrimination strategy that can detect the change point with the best possible accuracy. This problem has potential applications in accurately detecting the precise timing of events such as stellar explosions, foreign object intrusions, specific chemical bonds, and phase transitions. We formulate this problem as a quantum process discrimination problem by discretizing the time evolution of a quantum system as a sequence of unitary channels. However, due to the complexity of the dynamics, solving such a multiple process discrimination problem is typically challenging. We demonstrate that the maximum success probability for the Hamiltonian change point problem with any finite number of candidate change points can be determined and has a simple analytical form.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of measurement-based feedback control protocols is hampered by the presence of measurement noise, which affects the ability to accurately infer the underlying dynamics of a quantum system from noisy continuous measurement records to determine an accurate control strategy. To circumvent such limitations, this Letter explores a real-time stochastic state estimation approach that enables noise-free monitoring of the conditional dynamics including the full density matrix of the quantum system using noisy measurement records within a single quantum trajectory—a method we name as “conditional state tomography.” This, in turn, enables the development of precise measurement-based feedback control strategies that lead to effective control of quantum systems by essentially mitigating the constraints imposed by measurement noise and has potential applications in various feedback quantum control scenarios. This approach is particularly useful for reinforcement-learning-(RL) based control, where the RL-agent can be trained with arbitrary conditional averages of observables, and/or the full density matrix as input (observation), to quickly and accurately learn control strategies.},

Through quantum control theory, we develop an analytical condition for achieving crosstalk-robust single-qubit control of multiqubit systems. We examine the effects of quantum crosstalk via a cumulant expansion and develop a condition to suppress the leading order contributions to the dynamics. The efficacy of the condition is illustrated in the domains of quantum state preservation and noise characterization through the development of crosstalk-robust dynamical decoupling and quantum noise spectroscopy (QNS) protocols. Using the IBM Quantum Experience, crosstalk-robust state preservation is demonstrated on 27 qubits, where up to a 3.5 × improvement in coherence decay is observed for single-qubit product and multipartite entangled states. Through the use of noise injection, we demonstrate crosstalk-robust dephasing QNS on a seven qubit processor, where a 10 4 improvement in reconstruction accuracy over alternative protocols is found. Together, these experiments highlight the significant impact the crosstalk suppression condition can have on improving multiqubit characterization and control on current quantum devices.},

To achieve universality, magic states preparation is a commonly approach for introducing non-Clifford gates. Here, we present a hardware-efficient and scalable protocol for arbitrary logical state preparation for the rotated surface code, and further experimentally implement it on the Zuchongzhi 2.1 superconducting quantum processor. An average of 0.8983 ± 0.0002 logical fidelity at different logical states with distance three is achieved, taking into account both state preparation and measurement errors. In particular, the logical magic states | A π / 4 ⟩ L , | H ⟩ L , and | T ⟩ L are prepared nondestructively with logical fidelities of 0.8771 ± 0.0009 , 0.9090 ± 0.0009 , and 0.8890 ± 0.0010 , respectively, which are higher than the state distillation protocol threshold, 0.859 (for H -type magic state) and 0.827 (for T -type magic state).

Yet, their general potential and limitations remain elusive. In particular, to understand the ultimate feasibility of quantum error mitigation, it is crucial to characterize the fundamental sampling cost—how many times an arbitrary mitigation protocol must run a noisy quantum device. Here, we establish universal lower bounds on the sampling cost for quantum error mitigation to achieve the desired accuracy with high probability. Our bounds apply to general mitigation protocols, including the ones involving nonlinear postprocessing and those yet to be discovered. The results imply that the sampling cost required for a wide class of protocols to mitigate errors must grow exponentially with the circuit depth for various noise models, revealing the fundamental obstacles in the scalability of useful noisy near-term quantum devices.},

By analyzing the quantum Fisher information matrix of a virtual quantum circuit that effectively represents the operations of quantum error mitigation methods, we derive for a generic layered quantum circuit under a wide class of Markovian noise that, unbiased estimation of an observable encounters an exponential growth with the circuit depth in the lower bound on the measurement cost. Under the global depolarizing noise, we in particular find that the bound can be asymptotically saturated by merely rescaling the measurement results. Moreover, we prove for random circuits with local noise that the cost grows exponentially also with the qubit count. Our numerical simulations support the observation that, even if the circuit has only linear connectivity, such as the brick-wall structure, each noise channel converges to the global depolarizing channel with its strength growing exponentially with the qubit count. This not only implies the exponential growth of cost both with the depth and qubit count, but also validates the rescaling technique for sufficiently deep quantum circuits. Our results contribute to the understanding of the physical limitations of quantum error mitigation and offer a new criterion for evaluating the performance of quantum error mitigation techniques.},

We consider this task for an N -body system whose constituents are identical and uncorrelated at the beginning and end of the process. In the regime of slow but finite-time processes, we show that W diss can be dramatically reduced by considering collective protocols in which interactions are suitably created along the protocol. This can even lead to a sublinear growth of W diss with N : W diss ∝ N x with x &lt; 1 ; to be contrasted to the expected W diss ∝ N satisfied in any noninteracting protocol. We derive the fundamental limits to such collective advantages and show that x = 0 is in principle possible; however, it requires long-range interactions. We explore collective processes with spin models featuring two-body interactions and achieve noticeable gains under realistic levels of control in simple interaction architectures. As an application of these results, we focus on the erasure of information in finite time and prove a faster convergence to Landauer’s bound.},

In this Letter, we present the WAY theorem for possibly unbounded and continuous conserved observables under the Yanase condition, which requires that the probe positive operator-valued measure should commute with the conserved observable of the probe system. As a result of this WAY theorem, we show that exact implementations of the projective measurement of the position under momentum conservation and of the quadrature amplitude using linear optical instruments and photon counters are impossible. We also consider implementations of unitary channels under conservation laws and find that the conserved observable L S of the system commutes with the implemented unitary U S if L S is semibounded, while U S † L S U S can shift up to possibly nonzero constant factor if the spectrum of L S is upper and lower unbounded.

This requirement also holds for molecular motors that drive vital cellular processes and imposes constraints on their conformational changes as well as the rates at which they occur. It remains unclear whether, during evolution, features required for functional molecular machines can emerge simultaneously or require sequential adaptation to different selection pressures. We address this question by theoretically analyzing the evolution of filament treadmilling. This process refers to the self-assembly of linear polymers that grow and shrink at equal rates at their opposite ends. It constitutes a simple biological molecular machine that is involved in bacterial cell division and requires that several conditions are met. In our simulation framework, treadmilling emerges as a consequence of selecting for a target average polymer length. We discuss why other forms of assembly dynamics, which also reach the imposed target length, do not emerge in our simulations. Our work shows that complex molecular functions can evolve de novo under selection for a single physical feature.},

The NHSE is a topological effect owing to the nontrivial spectral winding, and such spectral behaviors appear naturally in nonreciprocal systems. Hence prevailing approaches rely on nonreciprocity to achieve the NHSE. Here, we report the experimental realization of the geometry-dependent skin effect in a two-dimensional reciprocal system, in which the skin effect occurs only at boundaries whose macroscopic symmetry mismatches with the lattice symmetry. The role of spectral reciprocity and symmetry is revealed by connecting reflective channels at given boundaries with the spectral topology of the PBC spectrum. Our work highlights the vital role of reciprocity, symmetry, and macroscopic geometry on the NHSE in dimensionality larger than one and opens new routes for wave structuring using non-Hermitian effects.},

Using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we study the critical phenomena of plane defects in three- and four-dimensional O ( n ) critical systems. In three dimensions, we provide the first numerical proof for the E-Log criticality of plane defects. In particular, for n = 2 , the critical exponent q ^ of two-point correlation and the renormalization-group parameter α of helicity modulus conform to the scaling relation q ^ = ( n − 1 ) / ( 2 π α ) , whereas the results for n ≥ 3 violate this scaling relation. In four dimensions, it is strikingly found that the E-Log criticality also emerges in the plane defect. These findings have numerous potential realizations and would boost the ongoing advancement of conformal field theory.},

In this Letter, we report that, besides interfacial resistance, the inevitable heat leap caused by the Peltier effect is the main factor affecting the conversion efficiency of TEGs. In fact, the heat leap is proven to have an impact of approximately 10\% on the conversion efficiency of common TEGs. In addition, we enhance the formula for maximum conversion efficiency with heat leap from the classical expression to allow for the prediction of the performance of advanced materials in TEGs. For the first time, the experimental data from conversion efficiency corresponds exactly to that obtained theoretically by considering both the heat leap and interfacial resistivity.},

We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on ultraviolet-light emission in hexagonal and rhombohedral bulk boron nitride crystals. Emission spectra of high-quality samples are measured via cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, displaying characteristic differences between the two polytypes. These differences are explained using a fully first-principles computational technique that takes into account radiative emission from “indirect,” finite-momentum excitons via coupling to finite-momentum phonons. We show that the differences in peak positions, number of peaks, and relative intensities can be qualitatively and quantitatively explained, once a full integration over all relevant momenta of excitons and phonons is performed.},

Here, we study the photon statistics via the second-order temporal correlation function of polariton lasing emerging from an optical microcavity with an embedded atomically thin MoSe 2 crystal. Furthermore, we investigate the macroscopic polariton phase transition for varying excitation powers and temperatures. The lower-polariton exhibits photon bunching below the threshold, implying a dominant thermal distribution of the emission, while above the threshold, the second-order correlation transits towards unity, which evidences the formation of a coherent state. Our findings are in agreement with a microscopic numerical model, which explicitly includes scattering with phonons on the quantum level.},

The nonlocal correlation and screening effects captured by G W + EDMFT result in an instability toward the formation of charge stripes, with the 3 d z 2 as the main active orbital.

Just below the critical levels of the current flow, the DW achieves maximal velocity of about 3 × 10 4 m / s , entering a strongly nonadiabatic regime of DW propagation, followed by a breakdown at higher biases. Above this threshold, a further increase of the current with the applied bias is impossible—the electronic current suffers a heavy suppression and the DW stops. This poses a fundamental limit to the current densities attainable in atomic wires. At the same time it opens up an exciting way of generating the alternative quasiparticle currents, described above, once the requisite electronic-structure properties are met.},

  abstract     = {Superfluidity is a well-characterized quantum phenomenon which entails frictionless motion of mesoscopic particles through a superfluid, such as He 4 or dilute atomic gases at very low temperatures. As shown by Landau, the incompatibility between energy and momentum conservation, which ultimately stems from the spectrum of the elementary excitations of the superfluid, forbids quantum scattering between the superfluid and the moving mesoscopic particle, below a critical speed threshold. Here, we predict that frictionless motion can also occur in the absence of a standard superfluid, i.e., when a He atom travels through a narrow (5,5) carbon nanotube (CNT). Because of the quasilinear dispersion of the plasmon and phonon modes that could interact with He, the (5,5) CNT embodies a solid-state analog of the superfluid, thereby enabling straightforward transfer of Landau’s criterion of superfluidity. As a result, Landau’s equations acquire broader generality and may be applicable to other nanoscale friction phenomena, whose description has been so far purely classical.},

At room temperature, the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase is stable up to ∼ 500 GPa whereas the body-centered cubic (bcc) phase only appears above 1 TPa. At higher temperature, we do not highlight any fcc-bcc transition line between 200 and 400 GPa, in agreement with ramp-compressed experiments.

However, no suitable method has been established so far for the spectrotemporal characterization of these ultrashort x-ray pulses. In this Letter, a simple method has been proposed based on self-referenced spectral interferometry for reconstructing the temporal profile and phase of ultrashort FEL pulses. We have demonstrated that the proposed method is reliable to completely characterize the attosecond x-ray FEL pulses with an error at the level of a few percent. Moreover, the first proof-of-principle experiment has been performed to achieve the single-shot spectrotemporal characterization of ultrashort pulses from a high-gain FEL.

The Lagrangian scaling exponents likewise saturate at ≈ 2 for p ≥ 8 . The saturation of Lagrangian exponents and transverse Eulerian exponents is related by the same multifractal spectrum by utilizing the well-known frozen hypothesis to relate spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, this spectrum is different from the known spectra for Eulerian longitudinal exponents, suggesting that Lagrangian intermittency is characterized solely by transverse Eulerian intermittency. We discuss possible implications of this outlook when extending multifractal predictions to the dissipation range, especially for Lagrangian acceleration.},

  abstract     = {High harmonic generation (HHG) has become a core pillar of attosecond science. Traditionally described with field-based models, HHG can also be viewed in a parametric picture, which predicts all properties of the emitted photons, but not the nonperturbative efficiency of the process. Driving HHG with two noncollinear beams and deriving analytically the corresponding yield scaling laws for any intensity ratio, we herein reconcile the two interpretations, introducing a generalized photonic description of HHG. It is in full agreement with field-based simulations and experimental data, opening the route to smart engineering of HHG with multiple driving beams.},

  abstract     = {Multiphoton light-matter interactions invoke a so-called “black box” in which the experimental observations contain the quantum interference between multiple pathways. Here, we employ polarization-controlled attosecond photoelectron metrology with a partial wave manipulator to deduce the pathway interference within this quantum ‘black box” for the two-photon ionization of neon atoms. The angle-dependent and attosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectra are measured across a broad energy range. Two-photon phase shifts for each partial wave are reconstructed through the comprehensive analysis of these photoelectron spectra. We resolve the quantum interference between the degenerate p → d → p and p → s → p two-photon ionization pathways, in agreement with our theoretical simulations. Our approach thus provides an attosecond time-resolved microscope to look inside the “black box” of pathway interference in ultrafast dynamics of atoms, molecules, and condensed matter.},

Their study is hard to realize with conventional quantum simulators. In this regard, Rydberg atoms provide an exception as their excited manifold of states have both density-density and exchange interactions whose strength and range can vary considerably. Focusing on one-dimensional systems, we leverage the Van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions of the Rydberg atoms to obtain the zero-temperature phase diagram for a uniform chain and a dimer model. For the uniform chain, we can influence the boundaries between ordered phases and a Luttinger liquid phase. For the dimerized case, a new type of bond-order-density-wave phase is identified. This demonstrates the versatility of the Rydberg platform in studying physics involving short- and long-ranged interactions simultaneously.},

Here we reveal the underlying reason for this mysterious phenomenon. By exactly solving the trapped small clusters with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that the reason lies in the distinct spectral responses between sTG gas and its decaying channel (bound state) when a weak dipolar interaction is present. Specifically, a tiny dipolar force can produce a visible energy shift for the localized bound state, but can hardly affect the extended sTG branch. As a result, the avoided level crossing between two branches is greatly modified in both location and width in the parameter axis of coupling strength, leading to a more (less) stable sTG gas for a repulsive (attractive) dipolar force. These results, consistent with experimental observations, are found to robustly apply to both bosonic and fermionic systems.},

  abstract     = {Traditional photonuclear reactions primarily excite giant dipole resonances, making the measurement of isovector giant resonances with higher multipolarities a great challenge. In this Letter, the manipulation of collective excitations of different multipole transitions in even-even nuclei via vortex γ photons is investigated. We develop the calculation method for photonuclear cross sections induced by the vortex γ photon beam using the fully self-consistent random-phase approximation plus particle-vibration coupling ( RPA + PVC ) model based on Skyrme density functional. We find that the electromagnetic transitions with multipolarity J &lt; | m γ | are forbidden for vortex γ photons due to the angular momentum conservation, with m γ being the projection of total angular momentum of γ photon on its propagation direction. For instance, this allows for probing the isovector giant quadrupole resonance without interference from dipole transitions using vortex γ photons with m γ = 2 . Furthermore, the electromagnetic transition with J = | m γ | + 1 vanishes at a specific polar angle. Therefore, the giant resonances with specific multipolarity can be extracted via vortex γ photons. Moreover, the vortex properties of γ photons can be meticulously diagnosed by measuring the nuclear photon-absorption cross section. Our method opens new avenues for photonuclear excitations, generation of coherent γ photon laser and precise detection of vortex particles, and consequently, has significant impact on nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics and strong laser physics.},

From these new data, nuclear deformations are inferred, revealing a competition between deformed and spherical configurations. The isotopes Au 180 , 181 , 182 are observed to possess well-deformed ground states and, when moving to lighter masses, a sudden transition to near-spherical shapes is seen in the extremely neutron-deficient nuclides, Au 176 , 177 , 179 . A case of shape coexistence and shape staggering is identified in Au 178 which has a ground and isomeric state with different deformations. These new data reveal a pattern in ground-state deformation unique to the gold isotopes, whereby, when moving from the heavy to light masses, a plateau of well-deformed isotopes exists around the neutron midshell, flanked by near-spherical shapes in the heavier and lighter isotopes—a trend hitherto unseen elsewhere in the nuclear chart. The experimental charge radii are compared to those from Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations using the D1M Gogny interaction and configuration mixing between states of different deformation. The calculations are constrained by the known spins, parities, and magnetic moments of the ground states in gold nuclei and show a good agreement with the experimental results.},

They can be accessed on Earth by measuring the spatial extent of the outer skin made of neutrons that characterizes the surface of heavy nuclei. The isotope Pb 208 , owing to its simple structure and neutron excess, has been in this context the target of many dedicated efforts. Here, we determine the neutron skin from measurements of particle distributions and their collective flow in Pb 208 + Pb 208 collisions at ultrarelativistic energy performed at the Large Hadron Collider, which are mediated by interactions of gluons and thus sensitive to the overall size of the colliding Pb 208 ions. By means of state-of-the-art global analysis tools within the hydrodynamic model of heavy-ion collisions, we infer a neutron skin Δ r n p = 0.217 ± 0.058 fm , consistent with nuclear theory predictions, and competitive in accuracy with a recent determination from parity-violating asymmetries in polarized electron scattering. We establish thus a new experimental method to systematically measure neutron distributions in the ground state of atomic nuclei.},

This is the first experimental evidence of the hyperon polarization by the triangular flow originating from the initial density fluctuations. The amplitudes of the sine modulation for the second and third harmonic results are comparable in magnitude, increase from central to peripheral collisions, and show a mild p T dependence. The azimuthal angle dependence of the polarization follows the vorticity pattern expected due to elliptic and triangular anisotropic flow, and qualitatively disagrees with most hydrodynamic model calculations based on thermal vorticity and shear induced contributions. The model results based on one of existing implementations of the shear contribution lead to a correct azimuthal angle dependence, but predict centrality and p T dependence that still disagree with experimental measurements. Thus, our results provide stringent constraints on the thermal vorticity and shear-induced contributions to hyperon polarization. Comparison to previous measurements at RHIC and the LHC for the second-order harmonic results shows little dependence on the collision system size and collision energy.},

  abstract     = {Current cosmological data exhibit discordance between indirect and some direct inferences of the present-day expansion rate H 0 . Early dark energy (EDE), which briefly increases the cosmic expansion rate prior to recombination, is a leading scenario for resolving this “Hubble tension” while preserving a good fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. However, this comes at the cost of changes in parameters that affect structure formation in the late-time universe, including the spectral index of scalar perturbations n s . Here, we present the first constraints on axionlike EDE using data from the Lyman- α forest, i.e., absorption lines imprinted in background quasar spectra by neutral hydrogen gas along the line of sight. We consider two independent measurements of the one-dimensional Ly α forest flux power spectrum from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS eBOSS) and from the MIKE/HIRES and X-Shooter spectrographs. We combine these with a baseline dataset comprised of Planck CMB data and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. Combining the eBOSS Ly α data with the CMB and BAO dataset reduces the 95\% confidence level (C.L.) upper bound on the maximum fractional contribution of EDE to the cosmic energy budget f EDE from 0.07 to 0.03 and constrains H 0 = 67.9 − 0.4 + 0.4 km / s / Mpc (68\% C.L.), with maximum a posteriori value H 0 = 67.9 km / s / Mpc . Similar results are obtained for the MIKE/HIRES and X-Shooter Ly α data. Our Ly α -based EDE constraints yield H 0 values that are in &gt; 4 σ tension with the SH0ES distance-ladder measurement and are driven by the preference of the Ly α forest data for n s values lower than those required by EDE cosmologies that fit Planck CMB data. Taken at face value, the Ly α forest severely constrains canonical EDE models that could resolve the Hubble tension.},

  abstract     = {The lack of ability to determine and implement accurately quantum optimal control is a strong limitation to the development of quantum technologies. We propose a digital procedure based on a series of pulses where their amplitudes and (static) phases are designed from an optimal continuous-time protocol for given type and degree of robustness, determined from a geometric analysis. This digitalization combines the ease of implementation of composite pulses with the potential to achieve global optimality, i.e., to operate at the ultimate speed limit, even for a moderate number of control parameters. We demonstrate the protocol on IBM’s quantum computers for a single qubit, obtaining a robust transfer with a series of Gaussian or square pulses in a time T = 382 ns for a moderate amplitude. We find that the digital solution is practically as fast as the continuous one for square subpulses with the same peak amplitudes.},

  abstract     = {Energetic coherence is indispensable for various operations, including precise measurement of time and acceleration of quantum manipulations. Since energetic coherence is fragile, it is essential to understand the limits in distillation and dilution to restore damage. The resource theory of asymmetry (RTA) provides a rigorous framework to investigate energetic coherence as a resource to break time-translation symmetry. Recently, in the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) regime where identical copies of a state are converted into identical copies of another state, it was shown that the convertibility of energetic coherence is governed by a standard measure of energetic coherence, called the quantum Fisher information (QFI). This fact means that QFI in the theory of energetic coherence takes the place of entropy in thermodynamics and entanglement entropy in entanglement theory. However, distillation and dilution in realistic situations take place in regimes beyond i.i.d., where quantum states often have complex correlations. Unlike entanglement theory, the conversion theory of energetic coherence in pure states in the non-i.i.d. regime has been an open problem. In this Letter, we solve this problem by introducing a new technique: an information-spectrum method for QFI. Two fundamental quantities, coherence cost and distillable coherence, are shown to be equal to the spectral QFI rates for arbitrary sequences of pure states. As a consequence, we find that both entanglement theory and RTA in the non-i.i.d. regime are understood in the information-spectrum method, while they are based on different quantities, i.e., entropy and QFI, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The geometric phase is a fundamental quantity characterizing the holonomic feature of quantum systems. It is well known that the evolution operator of a quantum system undergoing a cyclic evolution can be simply written as the product of holonomic and dynamical components for the three special cases concerning the Berry phase, adiabatic non-Abelian geometric phase, and nonadiabatic Abelian geometric phase. However, for the most general case concerning the nonadiabatic non-Abelian geometric phase, how to separate the evolution operator into holonomic and dynamical components is a long-standing open problem. In this Letter, we solve this open problem. We show that the evolution operator of a quantum system can always be separated into the product of holonomy and dynamic operators. Based on it, we further derive a matrix representation of this separation formula for cyclic evolution, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for a general evolution being purely holonomic. Our finding is not only of theoretical interest itself, but also of vital importance for the application of quantum holonomy. It unifies the representations of all four types of evolution concerning the adiabatic/nonadiabatic Abelian/non-Abelian geometric phase, and provides a general approach to realizing purely holonomic evolution.},

  abstract     = {In the field of monitored quantum circuits, it has remained an open question whether finite-time protocols for preparing long-range entangled states lead to phases of matter that are stable to gate imperfections, that can convert projective into weak measurements. Here, we show that in certain cases, long-range entanglement persists in the presence of weak measurements, and gives rise to novel forms of quantum criticality. We demonstrate this explicitly for preparing the two-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger cat state and the three-dimensional toric code as minimal instances. In contrast to random monitored circuits, our circuit of gates and measurements is deterministic; the only randomness is in the measurement outcomes. We show how the randomness in these weak measurements allows us to track the solvable Nishimori line of the random-bond Ising model, rigorously establishing the stability of the glassy long-range entangled states in two and three spatial dimensions. Away from this exactly solvable construction, we use hybrid tensor network and Monte Carlo simulations to obtain a nonzero Edwards-Anderson order parameter as an indicator of long-range entanglement in the two-dimensional scenario. We argue that our protocol admits a natural implementation in existing quantum computing architectures, requiring only a depth-3 circuit on IBM’s heavy-hexagon transmon chips.},

  abstract     = {In financial markets, the market-order sign exhibits strong persistence, widely known as the long-range correlation (LRC) of order flow; specifically, the sign autocorrelation function (ACF) displays long memory with power-law exponent γ , such that C ( τ ) ∝ τ − γ for large time-lag τ . One of the most promising microscopic hypotheses is the order-splitting behavior at the level of individual traders. Indeed, Lillo, Mike, and Farmer (LMF) introduced in 2005 a simple microscopic model of order-splitting behavior, which predicts that the macroscopic sign correlation is quantitatively associated with the microscopic distribution of metaorders. While this hypothesis has been a central issue of debate in econophysics, its direct quantitative validation has been missing because it requires large microscopic datasets with high resolution to observe the order-splitting behavior of all individual traders. Here we present the first quantitative validation of this LMF prediction by analyzing a large microscopic dataset in the Tokyo Stock Exchange market for more than nine years. On classifying all traders as either order-splitting traders or random traders as a statistical clustering, we directly measured the metaorder-length distributions P ( L ) ∝ L − α − 1 as the microscopic parameter of the LMF model and examined the theoretical prediction on the macroscopic order correlation γ ≈ α − 1 . We discover that the LMF prediction agrees with the actual data even at the quantitative level. We also discuss the estimation of the total number of the order-splitting traders from the ACF prefactor, showing that microscopic financial information can be inferred from the LRC in the ACF. Our Letter provides the first solid support of the microscopic model and solves directly a long-standing problem in the field of econophysics and market microstructure.},

The two known cases α = 1 and α = ∞ are recovered and receive the new interpretation of being associated with a risk-neutral and an extreme risk-averse player, respectively. Among the new results, the condition for α = 0 describes the behavior of a risk-seeking player willing to bet on the transient violations of the second law.

We put forward a nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic theory consisting of two coupled stochastic modes: the local spin magnetization and its effective velocity. Our theory fully explains the emergence of anomalous spin dynamics in isotropic chains: it predicts KPZ scaling for the spin structure factor but with a symmetric, quasi-Gaussian, distribution of spin fluctuations. We substantiate our results using matrix-product states calculations.},

Here, we introduce an alternative driving mechanism mediated by the strong spin-orbit interactions in hole spin qubits, where a far-detuned oscillating field couples to the qubit phase. Phase-driving at radio frequencies, orders of magnitude slower than the microwave qubit frequency, induces highly nontrivial spin dynamics, violating the Rabi resonance condition. By using a qubit integrated in a silicon fin field-effect transistor, we demonstrate a controllable suppression of resonant Rabi oscillations and their revivals at tunable sidebands. These sidebands enable alternative qubit control schemes using global fields and local far-detuned pulses, facilitating the design of dense large-scale qubit architectures with local qubit addressability. Phase-driving also decouples Rabi oscillations from noise, an effect due to a gapped Floquet spectrum and can enable Floquet engineering high-fidelity gates in future quantum processors.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have revealed that chiral phonons resonantly excited by ultrafast laser pulses carry magnetic moments and can enhance the magnetization of materials. In this work, using first-principles-based simulations, we present a real-space scenario where circular motions of electric dipoles in ultrathin two-dimensional ferroelectric and nonmagnetic films are driven by orbital angular momentum of light via strong coupling between electric dipoles and optical field. Rotations of these dipoles follow the evolving pattern of the optical field and create strong on-site orbital magnetic moments of ions. By characterizing topology of orbital magnetic moments in each 2D layer, we identify the vortex type of topological texture—magnetic merons with a one-half topological charge and robust stability. Our study thus provides alternative approaches for generating magnetic fields and topological textures from light-matter interaction and dynamical multiferroicity in nonmagnetic materials.},

Despite numerous recent studies, the interconnection of magnetism and other complex collective phenomena in these systems has yet not arrived at any conclusion. Using first-principles tools, we demonstrate that their electronic structures, complex fermiologies and phonon dispersions are strongly influenced by the interplay of dynamic electron correlations, nontrivial spin-polarization and spin-orbit coupling. An investigation of the first-principles-derived intersite magnetic exchanges with the complementary analysis of q dependence of the electronic response functions and the electron-phonon coupling indicate that the system conforms as a frustrated spin cluster, where the occurrence of the charge-order phase is intimately related to the mechanism of electron-phonon coupling, rather than the Fermi-surface nesting.},

In particular, we show within a semiclassical band-projected theory that resonances in the dressed Hall conductivity are proportional to the lattice Fourier components of the Berry curvature.

  abstract     = {We study the quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas coupled to a quantum cavity field. As initially pointed out by Kohn, Galilean invariance for a homogeneous quantum Hall system implies that the electronic center of mass (c.m.) decouples from the electron-electron interaction, and the energy of the c.m. mode, also known as Kohn mode, is equal to the single particle cyclotron transition. In this work, we point out that strong light-matter hybridization between the Kohn mode and the cavity photons gives rise to collective hybrid modes between the Landau levels and the photons. We provide the exact solution for the collective Landau polaritons and we demonstrate the weakening of topological protection at zero temperature due to the existence of the lower polariton mode which is softer than the Kohn mode. This provides an intrinsic mechanism for the recently observed topological breakdown of the quantum Hall effect in a cavity [F. Appugliese et al. , Breakdown of topological protection by cavity vacuum fields in the integer quantum Hall effect, Science 375 , 1030 (2022) .]. Importantly, our theory predicts the cavity suppression of the thermal activation gap in the quantum Hall transport. Our work paves the way for future developments in cavity control of quantum materials.},

  abstract     = {The unexpected chiral order observed in 1 T − TiSe 2 represents an exciting area to explore chirality in condensed matter, while its microscopic mechanism remains elusive. Here, we have identified three metastable collective modes—the so-called single- q modes—in single layer TiSe 2 , which originate from the unstable phonon eigenvectors at the zone boundary and break the threefold rotational symmetry. We show that polarized laser pulse is a unique and efficient tool to reconstruct the transient potential energy surface, so as to drive phase transitions between these states. By designing sequent layers with chiral stacking order, we propose a practical means to realize chiral charge density waves in 1 T − TiSe 2 . Further, the constructed chiral structure is predicted to exhibit circular dichroism as observed in recent experiments. These facts strongly indicate the chirality transfer from photons to the electron subsystem, meanwhile being strongly coupled to the lattice degree of freedom. Our work provides new insights into understanding and modulating chirality in quantum materials that we hope will spark further experimental investigation.},

At the critical value of the chemical potential, the resistivity diverges as a power law, R c ∼ 1 / T . Consequently, on the metallic side there is a regime with negative d R / d T , which is often misinterpreted as insulating. We show that scaling and this “fake insulator” regime are observed in a wide range of experimental systems. In particular, we show that Mooij correlations in high-temperature metals with negative d R / d T can be quantitatively understood with our scaling theory in the presence of T -linear scattering.},

Yet, SPhP-mediated NFRHT at cryogenic temperatures remains experimentally unexplored. Here, we probe thermal transport in nanoscale gaps between a silica sphere and a planar silica surface from 77–300 K. These experiments reveal that cryogenic NFRHT has strong contributions from SPhPs and does not follow the T 3 temperature ( T ) dependence of far-field thermal radiation. Our modeling based on fluctuational electrodynamics shows that the temperature dependence of NFRHT can be related to the confinement of heat transfer to two narrow frequency ranges and is well accounted for by a simple analytical model. These advances enable detailed NFRHT studies at cryogenic temperatures that are relevant to thermal management and solid-state cooling applications.},

The effect has been investigated in a number of systems recently, and requires a combination of broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. We demonstrate a dual of the usual Josephson diode effect, a nonreciprocal response of Andreev bound states to a superconducting phase difference across the normal region of a superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction, fabricated using an epitaxial InAs / Al heterostructure. Phase asymmetry of the subgap Andreev spectrum is absent in the absence of in-plane magnetic field and reaches a maximum at 0.15 T applied in the plane of the junction transverse to the current direction. We interpret the phase diode effect in this system as resulting from finite-momentum Cooper pairing due to orbital coupling to the in-plane magnetic field. At higher magnetic fields, we observe a sign reversal of the diode effect that appears together with a reopening of the spectral gap. Within our model, the sign reversal of the diode effect at higher fields is correlated with a topological phase transition that requires Zeeman and spin-orbit interactions in addition to orbital coupling.},

We demonstrate that stability of supercurrents controlled by quantum phase slips (instantons), and other exotic infrared properties of the superfluid dislocations readily follow from a one-dimensional quantum liquid distinguished by an effectively infinite compressibility (in the absence of Peierls potential) associated with the edge dislocation’s ability to climb. This establishes a new class of quasi-one-dimensional superfluid states that remain stable and long-range ordered despite their dimensionality. Our theory is consistent with the existing experimental data, and we propose an experiment to test the mass-current–pressure characteristic prediction.},

  abstract     = {Low power optical phase tracking is an enabling capability for intersatellite laser interferometry, as minimum trackable power places significant constraints on mission design. Through the combination of laser stabilization and control-loop parameter optimization, we have demonstrated continuous tracking of a subfemtowatt optical field with a mean time between slips of more than 1000 s. Comparison with analytical models and numerical simulations verified that the observed experimental performance was limited by photon shot noise and unsuppressed laser frequency fluctuations. Furthermore, with two stabilized lasers, we have demonstrated 100 min of continuous phase tracking of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-like signal dynamics with an optical carrier ranging in power between 1–7 fW with zero cycle slips. These results indicate the feasibility of future interspacecraft laser links operating with significantly reduced received optical power.},

This is demonstrated as simultaneous input spin-dependent directional guiding of waves (spin-direction coupling) and wave-vector–dependent spin acquisition (direction-spin coupling) of the scattered light. These effects, manifested as the forward and the inverse spin Hall effect of light in the far field, and other accompanying spin-orbit interaction effects are observed and analyzed using a momentum ( k ) domain polarization Mueller matrix. Resonance-enabled enhancement of these effects is also demonstrated by utilizing the spectral Fano resonance of the hybridized modes. The fundamental origin and the unconventional manifestation of the spin-direction-spin coupling phenomenon from a relatively simple system, ability to probe and interpret the resulting spin-orbit phenomena in the far field through momentum-domain polarization analysis, and their regulated control in plasmonic-photonic crystals open up exciting avenues in spin-orbit-photonic research.},

This theory, among others, predicts a pressurelike intensive quantity ( p ^ ) that is conjugate to the system’s total number of modes ( M )—its corresponding extensive variable. Yet at this point, the nature of this intensive quantity is still nebulous. In this Letter, we elucidate the physical origin of the optical thermodynamic pressure and demonstrate its dual essence. In this context, we rigorously derive an expression that splits p ^ into two distinct components, a term that is explicitly tied to the electrodynamic radiation pressure and a second entropic part that is responsible for the entropy change. We utilize this result to establish a formalism that simplifies the quantification of radiation pressure under nonlinear equilibrium conditions, thus eliminating the need for a tedious evaluation of the Maxwell stress tensor. Our theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations carried out in highly multimoded nonlinear optical structures. These results may provide a novel way in predicting and controlling radiation pressure processes in a variety of nonlinear electromagnetic settings.},

By applying the uncertainty principle, we explain the fundamental limit of this achromatic bandwidth and obtain the achromatic spectrum using perturbation analysis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this extended limit, we simulate a quasiachromatic metalens with a diameter of 2 mm and a NA of 0.55 in the range of 400–1500 nm.

Comprehensive studies beyond these approximations applicable to transmon-based circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems are unfortunately rare, as the relevant works have been mainly limited to single-mode or two-state systems. In this work, we investigate a microwave-dressed transmon coupled to a single quantized mode over a wide range of driving parameters. We reveal that the interaction between the transmon and resonator as well as the properties of each mode is significantly renormalized in the strong driving limit. Unlike previous theoretical works, we establish a nonrecursive and non-Floquet theory beyond the perturbative regimes, which excellently quantifies the experiments. This work expands our fundamental understanding of dressed cavity QED-like systems beyond the conventional approximations. Our work will also contribute to fast quantum gate implementation, qubit parameter engineering, and fundamental studies on driven nonlinear systems.},

We study this non-Markovian process in a subwavelength atom chain coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide and find that retardation is not the only cause of non-Markovianity. The other factor is the memory of the photonic environment, for which a single excited atom needs a finite time, the Zeno regime, to transition from quadratic decay to exponential decay. In the waveguide setup, this crossover has a time scale longer than the retardation, thus impacting the development of collective behavior. By comparing a full quantum treatment with an approach incorporating only the retardation effect, we find that the field memory effect, characterized by the population of atomic excitation, is much more pronounced in collective emissions than that in the decay of a single atom. Our results maybe useful for the dissipation engineering of quantum information processings based on compact atom arrays.},

Recently, continuous-variable quantum computing with the vibrational modes of trapped atoms has emerged with significant progress, featuring a high degree of control in hybridizing with spin qubits. Creating two-mode squeezed states in such a platform could enable applications that are only viable with photons. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two-mode squeezed states by employing atoms in a two-dimensional optical lattice as quantum registers. The states are generated by a controlled projection conditioned on the relative phase of two independent squeezed states. The individual squeezing is created by sudden jumps of the oscillators’ frequencies, allowing generating of the two-mode squeezed states at a rate within a fraction of the oscillation frequency. We validate the states by entanglement steering criteria and Fock state analysis. Our results can be applied in other mechanical oscillators for quantum sensing and continuous-variable quantum information.},

This is facilitated by the formation of a quartet bound state in vacuum that consists of a light atom and three heavy fermions. For an optimized heavy-light number ratio 3 : 1 , we identify QSF as the ground state in a considerable parameter regime of mass imbalance and 2D coupling strength. Its unique high-order correlation can be manifested in the momentum-space crystallization of a pairing field and density distribution of heavy fermions. Our results can be readily detected in Fermi-Fermi mixtures nowadays realized in cold atoms laboratories, and meanwhile shed light on exotic superfluidity in a broad context of mass-imbalanced fermion mixtures.},

  abstract     = {We develop and experimentally demonstrate a methodology for a full molecular frame quantum tomography (MFQT) of dynamical polyatomic systems. We exemplify this approach through the complete characterization of an electronically nonadiabatic wave packet in ammonia ( NH 3 ). The method exploits both energy and time-domain spectroscopic data, and yields the lab frame density matrix (LFDM) for the system, the elements of which are populations and coherences. The LFDM fully characterizes electronic and nuclear dynamics in the molecular frame, yielding the time- and orientation-angle dependent expectation values of any relevant operator. For example, the time-dependent molecular frame electronic probability density may be constructed, yielding information on electronic dynamics in the molecular frame. In NH 3 , we observe that electronic coherences are induced by nuclear dynamics which nonadiabatically drive electronic motions (charge migration) in the molecular frame. Here, the nuclear dynamics are rotational and it is nonadiabatic Coriolis coupling which drives the coherences. Interestingly, the nuclear-driven electronic coherence is preserved over longer timescales. In general, MFQT can help quantify entanglement between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, and provide new routes to the study of ultrafast molecular dynamics, charge migration, quantum information processing, and optimal control schemes.},

  abstract     = {Models that postulate the existence of hidden sectors address contemporary questions, such as the source of baryogenesis and the nature of dark matter. Neutron-to-hidden-neutron oscillations are among the possible mixing processes and have been tested with ultracold neutron storage and passing-through-wall experiments to set constraints on the oscillation period τ n n ′ . These searches probe the oscillations as a function of the mass splitting due to the neutron-hidden-neutron energy degeneracy. In this work, we present a new limit derived from neutron disappearance in ultracold neutron beam experiments. The overall limit, given by τ n n ′ &gt; 1 s for | δ m | ∈ [ 2 , 69 ] peV ( 95.45\% C . L . ) , covers the yet unexplored intermediate mass-splitting range and contributes to the ongoing research on hidden sectors.},

  abstract     = {Detailed measurements of the spectral structure of cosmic-ray electrons and positrons from 10.6 GeV to 7.5 TeV are presented from over 7 years of observations with the CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) on the International Space Station. The instrument, consisting of a charge detector, an imaging calorimeter, and a total absorption calorimeter with a total depth of 30 radiation lengths at normal incidence and a fine shower imaging capability, is optimized to measure the all-electron spectrum well into the TeV region. Because of the excellent energy resolution (a few percent above 10 GeV) and the outstanding e / p separation ( 10 5 ), CALET provides optimal performance for a detailed search of structures in the energy spectrum. The analysis uses data up to the end of 2022, and the statistics of observed electron candidates has increased more than 3 times since the last publication in 2018. By adopting an updated boosted decision tree analysis, a sufficient proton rejection power up to 7.5 TeV is achieved, with a residual proton contamination less than 10\%. The observed energy spectrum becomes gradually harder in the lower energy region from around 30 GeV, consistently with AMS-02, but from 300 to 600 GeV it is considerably softer than the spectra measured by DAMPE and Fermi-LAT. At high energies, the spectrum presents a sharp break around 1 TeV, with a spectral index change from − 3.15 to − 3.91 , and a broken power law fitting the data in the energy range from 30 GeV to 4.8 TeV better than a single power law with 6.9 sigma significance, which is compatible with the DAMPE results. The break is consistent with the expected effects of radiation loss during the propagation from distant sources (except the highest energy bin). We have fitted the spectrum with a model consistent with the positron flux measured by AMS-02 below 1 TeV and interpreted the electron + positron spectrum with possible contributions from pulsars and nearby sources. Above 4.8 TeV, a possible contribution from known nearby supernova remnants, including Vela, is addressed by an event-by-event analysis providing a higher proton-rejection power than a purely statistical analysis.},

Error mitigation allows us to suppress errors in extracting expectation values without the need for any error correction code, but its applications are limited to estimating expectation values, and cannot provide us with high-fidelity quantum operations acting on arbitrary quantum states. To address this challenge, we propose to use error filtration (EF) for gate-based quantum computation, as a practical error suppression scheme without resorting to full quantum error correction. The result is a general-purpose error suppression protocol where the resources required to suppress errors scale independently of the size of the quantum operation, and does not require any logical encoding of the operation. The protocol provides error suppression whenever an error hierarchy is respected—that is, when the ancillary controlled- swap operations are less noisy than the operation to be corrected. We further analyze the application of EF to quantum random access memory, where EF offers hardware-efficient error suppression.},

Here, we present an exact solution for the steady state of the transverse-field Ising model in the limit of infinite-range interactions, with local dissipation and inhomogeneous transverse fields. Our solution holds despite the lack of any collective spin symmetry or even permutation symmetry. It allows us to investigate first- and second-order dissipative phase transitions, driven-dissipative criticality, and captures the emergence of a surprising “spin blockade” phenomenon. The ability of the solution to describe spatially varying local fields provides a new tool to study disordered open quantum systems in regimes that would be extremely difficult to treat with numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {We consider a quantum lattice spin model featuring exact quasiparticle towers of eigenstates with low entanglement at finite size, known as quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We show that the states in the neighboring part of the energy spectrum can be superposed to construct entire families of low-entanglement states whose energy variance decreases asymptotically to zero as the lattice size is increased. As a consequence, they have a relaxation time that diverges in the thermodynamic limit, and therefore exhibit the typical behavior of exact QMBS, although they are not exact eigenstates of the Hamiltonian for any finite size. We refer to such states as asymptotic QMBS. These states are orthogonal to any exact QMBS at any finite size, and their existence shows that the presence of an exact QMBS leaves important signatures of nonthermalness in the rest of the spectrum; therefore, QMBS-like phenomena can hide in what is typically considered the thermal part of the spectrum. We support our study using numerical simulations in the spin-1 XY model, a paradigmatic model for QMBS, and we conclude by presenting a weak perturbation of the model that destroys the exact QMBS while keeping the asymptotic QMBS.},

This result is directly relevant to explain the smooth stationary structures in physical systems as diverse as curved liquid crystal and magnetic films, heat and Ohmic transport in wrinkled two-dimensional materials, and flows in confined channels. Combining microfluidic experiments and theory, we explain how curvature heterogeneities shape confined viscous flows. We show that isotropic bumps induce local distortions to Darcy’s flows, whereas anisotropic curvature heterogeneities disturb them algebraically over system-spanning scales. Thanks to an electrostatic analogy, we gain insight into this singular geometric perturbation, and quantitatively explain it using both conformal mapping and numerical simulations.

  abstract     = {Solitons in liquid crystals have generated considerable interest. Several hypotheses of varying complexity have been advanced to explain how they arise, but consensus has not emerged yet about the underlying forces responsible for their formation or their structure. In this work, we present a minimal model for solitons in achiral nematic liquid crystals, which reveals the key requirements needed to generate them in the absence of added charges. These include a surface inhomogeneity, consisting of an adsorbed particle capable of producing a twist, flexoelectricity, dielectric contrast, and an applied ac electric field that can couple to the director’s orientation. Our proposed model is based on a tensorial representation of a confined liquid crystal, and it predicts the formation of “butterfly” structures, quadrupolar in character, in regions of a slit channel where the director is twisted by the surface imperfection. As the applied electric field is increased, solitons (or “bullets”) become detached from the wings of the butterfly, and then propagate rapidly throughout the system. The main observations that emerge from the model, including the formation and structure of butterflies, bullets, and stripes, as well as the role of surface inhomogeneity and the strength of the applied field, are consistent with experimental findings presented here for nematic LCs confined between two chemically treated parallel plates.},

Thus quantum wave packets and eigenstates may explore more of the intricate Arnold web than previously expected. Such a drift typically occurs, as resonance channels widen toward a large chaotic region or toward a junction with other resonance channels. If this drift is strong enough, we find that dynamical localization is destroyed. We establish that this drift-induced delocalization transition is universal and is described by a single transition parameter. Numerical verification is given using a time-periodically kicked Hamiltonian with a four-dimensional phase space.},

The temperature and excitation density dependent dynamics follow the behavior predicted by the phenomenological bottleneck model for the single-gap SC, implying adiabatic coupling between the two condensates on the ps timescale. The amplitude of the THz-driven suppression of condensate density reveals an unexpected decrease in pair-breaking efficiency with increasing temperature—unlike in the case of optical excitation. The reduced pair-breaking efficiency of narrow-band THz pulses, displaying minimum near ≈ 0.7 T c , is attributed to THz-driven, long-lived, nonthermal quasiparticle distribution, resulting in Eliashberg-type enhancement of superconductivity, competing with pair breaking.},

This is achieved by introducing an extra intracavity semiconductor layer, nonresonant to the cavity mode. Partial saturation of the optical absorption in the uncoupled layer enables the ultrafast modulation of the effective refractive index and, through excited-state absorption, the polariton dissipation.

While heterobilayers such as WSe 2 / MoSe 2 have received significant attention, there has been comparatively less research on heterotrilayers, which may offer new excitonic species and phases, as well as unique physical properties. In this Letter, we present theoretical and experimental investigations on the emission properties of quadrupolar excitons (QXs), a newly predicted type of exciton, in a WSe 2 / MoSe 2 / WSe 2 heterotrilayer device. Our findings reveal that the optical brightness or darkness of QXs is determined by horizontal mirror symmetry and valley and spin selection rules. Additionally, the emission intensity and energy of both bright and dark QXs can be adjusted by applying an out-of-plane electric field, due to changes in hole distribution and the Stark effect. These results not only provide experimental evidence for the existence of QXs in heterotrilayers but also uncover their novel properties, which have the potential to drive the development of new exciton-based applications.},

  abstract     = {Magnons serve as a testing ground for fundamental aspects of Hermitian and non-Hermitian wave mechanics and are of high relevance for information technology. This study presents setups for realizing spatiotemporally driven parity-time- (PT) symmetric magnonics based on coupled magnetic waveguides and magnonic crystals. A charge current in a metal layer with strong spin-orbit coupling sandwiched between two insulating magnetic waveguides leads to gain or loss in the magnon amplitude depending on the directions of the magnetization and the charge currents. When gain in one waveguide is balanced by loss in the other waveguide, a PT-symmetric system hosting non-Hermitian degeneracies [or exceptional points (EPs)] is realized. For ac current, multiple EPs appear for a certain gain-loss strength and mark the boundaries between the preserved PT-symmetry and the broken PT-symmetry phases. The number of islands of broken PT-symmetry phases and their extensions is tunable by the frequency and the strength of the spacer current. At EP and beyond, the induced and amplified magnetization oscillations are strong and self-sustained. In particular, these magnetization auto-oscillations in a broken PT-symmetry phase occur at low current densities and do not require further adjustments such as tilt angle between electric polarization and equilibrium magnetization direction in spin-torque oscillators, pointing to a new design of these oscillators and their utilization in computing and sensorics. It is also shown how the periodic gain-loss mechanism allows for the generation of high-frequency spin waves with low-frequency currents. For spatially periodic gain and loss acting on a magnonic crystal, magnon modes approaching each other at the Brillouin-zone boundaries are highly susceptible to PT symmetry, allowing for a wave-vector-resolved experimental realization at very low currents.},

We show that the EuCd 2 As 2 is in fact a semiconductor with a gap of 0.77 eV. We show that the externally applied magnetic field has a profound impact on the electronic band structure of this system. This is manifested by a huge decrease of the observed band gap, as large as 125 meV at 2 T, and, consequently, by a giant redshift of the interband absorption edge. However, the semiconductor nature of the material remains preserved. EuCd 2 As 2 is therefore a magnetic semiconductor rather than a Dirac or Weyl semimetal, as suggested by ab initio computations carried out within the local spin-density approximation.},

We show how, instead, the correct symmetries may be restored at the level of LSWT. In the process we give examples, supported by nonperturbative matrix product based time evolution calculations, where symmetry dictates topological features but where LSWT fails to implement them.

We describe the case of the dilute beam in terms of a time-domain interferometer between the anyons flowing along the edge and quasiparticle-quasihole excitations created at the tunneling quantum point contact. In both cases, temperature is kept large, such that the measured current is given to linear response.

We study the full, nonperturbative inclusion of triple excitations (CCSDT) and propose a new, iterative method, which we call ring-CCSDT, that resums the essential triple excitations with the same N 7 run-time scaling as CCSD(T). CCSDT and ring-CCSDT are used to calculate the correlation energy of the uniform electron gas at metallic densities and the structural properties of solid lithium. Inclusion of connected triple excitations is shown to be essential to achieving high accuracy.

  abstract     = {Coupled-cluster theories can be used to compute ab initio electronic correlation energies of real materials with systematically improvable accuracy. However, the widely used coupled cluster singles and doubles plus perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] method is only applicable to insulating materials. For zero-gap materials the truncation of the underlying many-body perturbation expansion leads to an infrared catastrophe. Here, we present a novel perturbative triples formalism denoted as (cT) that yields convergent correlation energies in metallic systems. Furthermore, the computed correlation energies for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at metallic densities are in good agreement with quantum Monte Carlo results. At the same time the newly proposed method retains all desirable properties of CCSD(T) such as its accuracy for insulating systems as well as its low computational cost compared to a full inclusion of the triples. This paves the way for ab initio calculations of real metals with chemical accuracy.},

Limiting cases include the Aubry-André model and the models of Sriram Ganeshan, J. H. Pixley, and S. Das Sarma [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 , 146601 (2015) ] and J. Biddle and S. Das Sarma [ Phys. Rev.

Beyond known limits, the proposed class of models extends previously encountered localized-delocalized duality transformations to points within multifractal critical phases. Besides an experimental confirmation of multifractal duality, realizing the proposed class of models in optical lattices allows stabilizing multifractal critical phases and nontrivial mobility edges in an undriven system without the need for the unbounded potentials required by previous proposals.},

Under an applied electric field, the Berry curvature exhibits an asymmetric distribution, forming a field-induced Berry curvature dipole, resulting in a measurable third-order Hall voltage with a cubic relationship to the longitudinal electric field. Notably, the magnitude and polarity of this third-order nonlinear Hall effect can be effectively modulated by gate voltages. Furthermore, our scaling relation analysis demonstrates that the sign of the Berry curvature dipole polarizability changes when tuning the Fermi level across the Dirac point, in agreement with theoretical calculations.

The formula is shown to satisfy all formal properties of the Hall conductance: it is odd under time reversal and reflection, even under charge conjugation, universal and topologically rigid in the thermodynamic limit. Further evidence for relating the formula to the Hall conductance is obtained from conformal field theory arguments. Finally, we numerically check the formula by applying it to a noninteracting Chern band where excellent agreement is obtained.},

This corrugation, which reflects a molecular displacement perpendicular to the surface plane, presents an astonishing pattern: It is well described by a frustrated Ising spin Hamiltonian whose thermodynamics is compatible with a spin liquid about to transit toward an ordered zigzag state. Here we study the statistical properties of such a molecular corrugation using a structure factor analysis, a tool generally employed in frustrated magnetism. More specifically, the real and reciprocal space analysis of pairwise molecule correlations allows us to demonstrate that the C 60 / Cu system, in which magnetism is totally absent, has all the characteristics of a triangular Ising antiferromagnet. Our results indicate that the organization of two-dimensional matter, at the molecular length scale, sometimes turns out to be particularly close to that encountered in highly frustrated magnets.},

We present detailed analysis of an arbitrarily strong impurity-boson coupling in a wide range of temperatures within a microscopic theory. Focusing mostly on weakly interacting bosons, we derive an analytical result for the friction force and uncover new regimes of the impurity dynamics. Particularly interesting is the low-temperature T 2 dependence of the friction force obtained for a strongly coupled impurity, which should be contrasted with the expected T 4 scaling. This new regime applies to systems of bosons with an arbitrary repulsion strength. We finally study the evolution of the impurity with a given initial momentum. We evaluate analytically its nonstationary momentum distribution function. The impurity relaxation towards the equilibrium is a realization of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in momentum space.},

Measurements of this intensity distribution at the MAX-IV low emittance storage ring are compared to theoretical predictions, and found to be in excellent agreement. This work shows upon the possibility of performing high resolution emittance diagnostics with visible or near-visible SR on upcoming low-emittance storage ring based light sources. As a byproduct of our study, we derive a closed analytical expression for the intensity distribution from a zero-emittance beam, in the limiting case of wide orbital collection angles.

We show that this remarkable increase stems from the shape of the dynamical meniscus between the two fibers. We first study the dynamical meniscus around one fiber and obtain experimental and numerical scaling of its size increase with the capillary number, which is not captured by the classical Landau-Levich-Derjaguin theory. We then show that the shape of the deformed air-liquid interface around two fibers can be inferred from the linear superposition of the interface around a single fiber. These results yield an analytical expression for the capillary force which compares well with the experimental data.

When the drop is made of a volatile liquid and the medium is superheated, the gas shell inflates at a rate governed by the evaporation flux from the drop. This thermal process represents an alternate strategy for delaying the antibubble collapse. We model the dynamics of such “thermal” antibubbles by incorporating to the film drainage equation the heat-transfer-limited evaporation of the drop, which nourishes the gas shell with vapor, as for Leidenfrost drops. We demonstrate that the inflation of the gas shell is drastically inhibited by the thermalization of the initially colder drop. Because of this thermalization effect, smaller drops evaporate much faster than larger ones.},

Under feedback cooling on all the librational motions, we recover the velocity distributions in reasonable agreement with an expectation from the occupation number, with approximately twice the width of the quantum limit. The strong impact of librational motions on the translational motions is understood as a result of the deviation between the libration center and the center of mass, induced by the asymmetry of the nanoparticle.

  abstract     = {Controlling the photon statistics of light is paramount for quantum science and technologies. Recently, we demonstrated that transmitting resonant laser light past an ensemble of two-level emitters can result in a stream of single photons or excess photon pairs. This transformation is due to quantum interference between the transmitted laser light and the incoherently scattered photon pairs [Prasad et al. , Nat. Photonics 14 , 719 (2020) ]. Here, using the dispersion of the atomic medium, we actively control the relative quantum phase between these two components. We thereby realize a tunable two-photon interferometer and observe interference fringes in the normalized photon coincidence rate. When tuning the relative phase, the coincidence rate varies periodically, giving rise to a continuous modification of the photon statistics from antibunching to bunching. Beyond the fundamental insight that there exists a tunable quantum phase between incoherent and coherent light that dictates the photon statistics, our results lend themselves to the development of novel quantum light sources.},

  abstract     = {Isolated many-body systems far from equilibrium may exhibit scaling dynamics with universal exponents indicating the proximity of the time evolution to a nonthermal fixed point. We find universal dynamics connected with the occurrence of extreme wave excitations in the mutually coupled magnetic components of a spinor gas which propagate in an effectively random potential. The frequency of these rogue waves is affected by the time-varying spatial correlation length of the potential, giving rise to an additional exponent δ c ≃ 1 / 3 for temporal scaling, which is different from the exponent β V ≃ 1 / 4 characterizing the scaling of the correlation length ℓ V ∼ t β V in time. As a result of the caustics, i.e., focusing events, real-time instanton defects appear in the Larmor phase of the spin-1 system as vortices in space and time. The temporal correlations governing the instanton occurrence frequency scale as t δ I . This suggests that the universality class of a nonthermal fixed point could be characterized by different, mutually related exponents defining the evolution in time and space, respectively. Our results have a strong relevance for understanding pattern coarsening from first principles and potential implications for dynamics ranging from the early Universe to geophysical dynamics and microphysics.},

The EUV pulse ionizes an inner-shell electron, and the midinfrared laser drives the photoelectron and steers the electron-ion rescattering. Depending on the spin of the photoelectron, the residual ion including two bound electrons can be either in a single spin configuration or in a coherent superposition of different spin configurations. In the latter case, the two electrons in the ion swap their orbits, leading to a deep valley in the harmonic spectrum. The model results agree with the time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations including three active electrons. The intriguing picture explored in this work is fundamentally distinguished from all reported scenarios relied on spin-orbit coupling, but originates from the exchanges asymmetry of two-electron wave functions.},

As experimental sensitivities improve, it is important to develop new methods to suppress sensitivity to external electromagnetic fields, as limits on the ability to control these fields are a major experimental concern. Here we show that sensitivity to both external magnetic and electric fields can be simultaneously suppressed using engineered radio frequency, microwave, or two-photon transitions that maintain large amplification of C P -violating effects. By performing a clock measurement on these transitions, C P -violating observables including the electron electric dipole moment, nuclear Schiff moment, and magnetic quadrupole moment can be measured with suppression of external field sensitivity of ≳ 100 generically, and even more in many cases. Furthermore, the method is compatible with traditional Ramsey measurements, offers internal co-magnetometry, and is useful for systems with large angular momentum commonly present in molecular searches for nuclear C P violation.},

Precise optical control of molecular ions remains a challenge due to the scarcity of suitable level schemes, and direct laser cooling has not yet been achieved for either positive or negative molecular ions. Using a cryogenic wire trap, we show how the internal quantum states of C 2 − anions can be manipulated using optical pumping and inelastic quenching collisions with H 2 gas. We obtained optical pumping efficiencies of about 96\% into the first vibrational level of C 2 − and determined the absolute inelastic rate coefficient from v = 1 to 0 to be k q = ( 3.2 ± 0.2 stat ± 1.3 sys ) × 10 − 13 cm 3 / s at 20(3) K, over 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the capture limit. Reduced-dimensional quantum scattering calculations yield a small rate coefficient as well, but significantly larger than the experimental value. Using optical pumping and inelastic collisions, we also realized fluorescence imaging of negative molecular ions. Our work demonstrates high control of a cold ensemble of C 2 − , providing a solid foundation for future work on laser cooling of molecular ions.},

  abstract     = {Observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have cemented the notion that the large-scale Universe is both statistically homogeneous and isotropic. But is it invariant also under reflections? To probe this we require parity-sensitive statistics: for scalar observables, the simplest is the trispectrum. We make the first measurements of the parity-odd scalar CMB, focusing on the large-scale ( 2 &lt; ℓ &lt; 510 ) temperature anisotropies measured by Planck . This is facilitated by new quasi-maximum-likelihood estimators for binned correlators, which account for mask convolution and leakage between even- and odd-parity components, and achieve ideal variances within ≈ 20\% . We perform a blind test for parity violation by comparing a χ 2 statistic from Planck to theoretical expectations, using two suites of simulations to account for the possible likelihood non-Gaussianity and residual foregrounds. We find consistency at the ≈ 0.4 σ level, yielding no evidence for novel early-Universe phenomena. The measured trispectra allow for a wealth of new physics to be constrained; here, we use them to constrain eight primordial models, including ghost inflation, cosmological collider scenarios, and Chern-Simons gauge fields. We find no signatures of new physics, with a maximal detection significance of 2.0 σ . Our results also indicate that the recent parity excesses seen in the BOSS galaxy survey are not primordial in origin, given that the CMB dataset contains roughly 250 × more primordial modes, and is far easier to interpret, given the linear physics, Gaussian statistics, and accurate mocks. Tighter CMB constraints can be wrought by including smaller scales (though rotational invariance washes out the flat-sky limit) and adding polarization data.},

Moreover, we present and implement an algorithm guaranteed to meet our bound and which finds contraction orders with vastly lower computational times in practice. In practically relevant cases this beats standard simulation schemes and, for certain quantum circuits, also a state-of-the-art method. Specifically, our algorithm leads to speedups of several orders of magnitude over naive contraction schemes for two-dimensional quantum circuits on as little as an 8 × 8 lattice. We obtain similarly efficient contraction schemes for Google’s Sycamore-type quantum circuits, instantaneous quantum polynomial-time circuits, and nonhomogeneous ( 2 + 1 )-dimensional random quantum circuits.},

  abstract     = {We show that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) constitute a probe for local-operator entanglement (LOE). There is strong evidence that a volumetric growth of LOE is a faithful dynamical indicator of quantum chaos, while OTOC decay corresponds to operator scrambling, often conflated with chaos. We show that rapid OTOC decay is a necessary but not sufficient condition for linear (chaotic) growth of the LOE entropy. We analytically support our results through wide classes of local-circuit models of many-body dynamics, including both integrable and nonintegrable dual-unitary circuits. We show sufficient conditions under which local dynamics leads to an equivalence of scrambling and chaos.},

  abstract     = {We show that locally interacting, periodically driven (Floquet) Hamiltonian dynamics coupled to a Langevin bath support finite-temperature discrete time crystals (DTCs) with an infinite autocorrelation time. By contrast to both prethermal and many-body localized DTCs, the time crystalline order we uncover is stable to arbitrary perturbations, including those that break the time translation symmetry of the underlying drive. Our approach utilizes a general mapping from probabilistic cellular automata to open classical Floquet systems undergoing continuous-time Langevin dynamics. Applying this mapping to a variant of the Toom cellular automaton, which we dub the “ π -Toom time crystal,” leads to a 2D Floquet Hamiltonian with a finite-temperature DTC phase transition. We provide numerical evidence for the existence of this transition, and analyze the statistics of the finite temperature fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how general results from the field of probabilistic cellular automata imply the existence of discrete time crystals (with an infinite autocorrelation time) in all dimensions, d ≥ 1 .},

We show that the exponentially hard evaluation of the SREs can be achieved by means of a simple perfect sampling of the many-body wave function over the Pauli string configurations. The sampling is achieved with a novel MPS technique, which enables us to compute each sample in an efficient way with a computational cost O ( N χ 3 ) . We benchmark our method over randomly generated magic states, as well as in the ground-state of the quantum Ising chain. Exploiting the extremely favorable scaling, we easily have access to the nonequilibrium dynamics of the SREs after a quantum quench.},

At low shear rates, we find a Newtonian regime, where a Green-Kubo relation with an effective temperature provides the linear viscosity. It is followed by a shear-thinning regime at high shear rates. At high densities, solidification is signaled by the emergence of a finite yield stress. We construct a “fluid-glass-jamming” phase diagram with activity replacing temperature. While both parameters gauge fluctuations, activity also changes the exponent characterizing the decay of the diffusivity close to the glass transition and the shape of the yield stress surface. The dense disordered active solid appears to be mostly dominated by athermal jamming rather than glass rheology.},

Here, we describe a simple quantitative relationship between nonaffinity and the excess viscosity. We test this nonaffinity-viscosity relationship computationally and demonstrate its rheological consequences in simulations of strained filament networks and dense suspensions.

By axial rotation of one end, the winding number was progressively changed from the natural one ( n = n 0 ) to complete chirality inversion ( n = − n 0 ) while keeping the total elongation fixed and monitoring the applied torque M and tension T . Along the unwinding process, the system crosses three distinct states: natural helix ( + ), mixed state ( + / − ), and inverted helix ( − ). The mixed state involves two helices with opposite chiralities spatially connected by a perversion (helicity inversion). Upon unwinding, the perversion is “injected” (nucleated) from one side and travels toward the opposite side where it is eventually “absorbed” (annihilated), leaving the system in the ( − ) state. In the mixed state, the profile of M ( n ) is almost flat: the system behaves as a constant torque actuator. The three states are quantitatively well described in the framework of a biphasic model which neglects the perversion energy and finite size effects. The latter are taken into account in a numerical simulation based on the Kirchhoff theory of elastic rods. The traveling perversion in helical elastic rods and related topological phenomena are universal, with applications from condensed matter to biological and bioinspired systems, including in particular mechanical engineering and soft robotics.},

Resolving the true bulk spectra and the thermodynamic response functions of these models requires converging periodic boundary conditions and our Letter delivers a practical and rigorous solution for this open problem on generic { p , q } -tessellations. This enables us to identify the true spectral gaps of bulk Hamiltonians and construct all but one topological models that deliver the topological gaps predicted by the K theory of the lattices. We demonstrate the emergence of the expected topological spectral flows whenever two such bulk models are deformed into each other and prove the emergence of topological channels whenever a soft physical interface is created between different topological classes of Hamiltonians.},

Simulating the braiding process of multiple Majorana zero modes corresponds to the quantum dynamics of a superconducting many-body system. It is crucial to study the Majorana dynamics both in the presence of all other quasiparticles and for reasonably large system sizes. We present a method to calculate arbitrary many-body wave functions as well as their expectation values, correlators, and overlaps from time evolved single-particle states of a superconductor, allowing for significantly larger system sizes. We calculate the fidelity, transition probabilities, and joint parities of Majorana pairs to track the quality of the braiding process. We show how the braiding success depends on the speed of the braid. Moreover, we demonstrate the topological CNOT two-qubit gate as an example of two-qubit entanglement. Our Letter opens the path to test and analyze the many theoretical implementations of Majorana qubits. Moreover, this method can be used to study the dynamics of any noninteracting superconductor.},

For time-reversal ( T ) and sublattice symmetries, there are six ramified symmetry classes leading to novel topological classifications with various non-Hermitian skin effects. As artificial crystals are the main experimental platforms for non-Hermitian physics, there exists the symmetry barrier for realizing topological physics in the six ramified symmetry classes: while artificial crystals are in spinless classes with T 2 = 1 , nontrivial classifications dominantly appear in spinful classes with T 2 = − 1 . Here, we present a general mechanism to cross the symmetry barrier. With an internal parity symmetry P , the square of the combination T ˜ = P T can be modified by appropriate gauge fluxes. Using the general mechanism, we systematically construct spinless models for all non-Hermitian spinful topological phases in one and two dimensions, which are experimentally realizable. Our Letter suggests that gauge structures may significantly enrich non-Hermitian physics at the fundamental level.},

Here we propose a class of exactly solvable models which host a novel type of exact mobility edges (MEs) separating localized states from robust critical states, and propose experimental realization. Here the robustness refers to the stability against both single-particle perturbation and interactions in the few-body regime. The exactly solvable one-dimensional models are featured by a quasiperiodic mosaic type of both hopping terms and on-site potentials. The analytic results enable us to unambiguously obtain the critical states which otherwise require arduous numerical verification including the careful finite size scalings. The critical states and new MEs are shown to be robust, illustrating a generic mechanism unveiled here that the critical states are protected by zeros of quasiperiodic hopping terms in the thermodynamic limit. Further, we propose a novel experimental scheme to realize the exactly solvable model and the new MEs in an incommensurate Rydberg Raman superarray.

  abstract     = {We put forward a novel method for producing ultrarelativistic high-density high-polarization positrons through a single-shot interaction of a strong laser with a tilted solid foil. In our method, the driving laser ionizes the target, and the emitted electrons are accelerated and subsequently generate abundant γ photons via the nonlinear Compton scattering, dominated by the laser. These γ photons then generate polarized positrons via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process, dominated by a strong self-generated quasistatic magnetic field B S . We find that placing the foil at an appropriate angle can result in a directional orientation of B S , thereby polarizing positrons. Manipulating the laser polarization direction can control the angle between the γ photon polarization and B S , significantly enhancing the positron polarization degree. Our spin-resolved quantum electrodynamics particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that employing a laser with a peak intensity of about 10 23 W / cm 2 can obtain dense ( ≳ 10 18 cm − 3 ) polarized positrons with an average polarization degree of about 70\% and a yield of above 0.1 nC per shot. Moreover, our method is feasible using currently available or upcoming laser facilities and robust with respect to the laser and target parameters. Such high-density high-polarization positrons hold great significance in laboratory astrophysics, high-energy physics, and new physics beyond the standard model.},

However, generating these nonclassical states of light, especially with high intensity and a high degree of squeezing, is challenging. To address this problem, we introduce a new concept which uses gain to generate intense sub-Poissonian light at optical frequencies. It exploits a strongly nonlinear gain for photons which arises from a combination of frequency-dependent gain and Kerr nonlinearity. In this laser architecture, the interaction between the gain medium and Kerr nonlinearity suppresses the spontaneous emission at high photon number states, leading to a strong “negative feedback” that suppresses photon-number fluctuations. We discuss realistic implementations of this concept based on the use of solid-state gain media in laser cavities with Kerr nonlinear materials, showing how 90\% squeezing of photon number fluctuations below the shot noise level can be realized.},

Furthermore, we determine the critical point where the line of first-order transition ends and investigate the behavior of the density discontinuity in its vicinity.

Momentum distribution calculations highlight a thermally broadened occupation of the Rashba circle of low-energy states with macroscopic and isotropic occupation around the ring.

By means of numerically exact path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we show that for sufficiently weak interactions the system is a homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate that develops density modulations for increasing filling factor. The simultaneous occurrence of sizeable condensate fraction and density modulation can be interpreted as the analogous, in a quasicrystalline lattice, of supersolid phases occurring in conventional periodic lattices. For sufficiently large interaction strength and particle density, global condensation is lost and quantum exchanges are restricted to specific spatial regions. The emerging quantum phase is therefore a Bose glass, which here is stabilized in the absence of any source of disorder or quasidisorder, purely as a result of the interplay between quantum effects, particle interactions and quasicrystalline substrate. This finding clearly indicates that (quasi)disorder is not essential to observe Bose glass physics. Our results are of interest for ongoing experiments on (quasi)disorder-free quasicrystalline lattices.},

Motivated by recent experimental progress in multimode cavity QED, we propose a scheme to implement and study supersolid and droplet states with phononlike lattice excitations by coupling a Bose gas to many longitudinal modes of a ring cavity. The interplay between contact collisional and tunable-range cavity-mediated interactions leads to a rich phase diagram, which includes elastic supersolid as well as insulating droplet phases exhibiting roton-type mode softening for a continuous range of momenta across the superradiant phase transition. The nontrivial dynamic response of the system to a local density perturbation further proves the existence of phononlike modes.},

The invariant-mass spectrum of its decay products can be fit with two peaks whose energies are consistent with the theoretical predictions of an open-quantum-system approach; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that only a single resonancelike peak is present in the spectrum.},

  abstract     = {This letter presents a measurement of the nuclear modification factor of large-radius jets in s N N = 5.02 TeV Pb + Pb collisions by the ATLAS experiment. The measurement is performed using 1.72 nb − 1 and 257 pb − 1 of Pb + Pb and p p data, respectively. The large-radius jets are reconstructed with the anti- k t algorithm using a radius parameter of R = 1.0 , by reclustering anti- k t R = 0.2 jets, and are measured over the transverse momentum ( p T ) kinematic range of 158 &lt; p T &lt; 1000 GeV and absolute pseudorapidity | y | &lt; 2.0 . The large-radius jet constituents are further reclustered using the k t algorithm in order to obtain the splitting parameters, d 12 and Δ R 12 , which characterize the transverse momentum scale and angular separation for the hardest splitting in the jet, respectively. The nuclear modification factor, R A A , obtained by comparing the Pb + Pb jet yields to those in p p collisions, is measured as a function of jet transverse momentum ( p T ) and d 12 or Δ R 12 . A significant difference in the quenching of large-radius jets having single subjet and those with more complex substructure is observed. Systematic comparison of jet suppression in terms of R A A for different jet definitions is also provided. Presented results support the hypothesis that jets with hard internal splittings lose more energy through quenching and provide a new perspective for understanding the role of jet structure in jet suppression.},

  abstract     = {Treating the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of non-Abelian gauge theories is an outstanding challenge for classical and quantum simulations. Here, we employ q - deformed Kogut-Susskind lattice gauge theories , obtained by deforming the defining symmetry algebra to a quantum group. In contrast to other formulations, this approach simultaneously provides a controlled regularization of the infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space while preserving essential symmetry-related properties. This enables the development of both quantum as well as quantum-inspired classical spin-network algorithms for q -deformed gauge theories. To be explicit, we focus on SU ( 2 ) k gauge theories with k ∈ N that are controlled by the deformation parameter q = e 2 π i / ( k + 2 ) , a root of unity, and converge to the standard SU(2) Kogut-Susskind model as k → ∞ . In particular, we demonstrate that this formulation is well suited for efficient tensor network representations by variational ground-state simulations in 2D, providing first evidence that the continuum limit can be reached with k = O ( 10 ) . Finally, we develop a scalable quantum algorithm for Trotterized real-time evolution by analytically diagonalizing the SU ( 2 ) k plaquette interactions. Our work gives a new perspective for the application of tensor network methods to high-energy physics and paves the way for quantum simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories far from equilibrium where no other methods are currently available.},

  abstract     = {The entanglement entropy of an arbitrary spacetime region A in a three-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) contains a constant universal coefficient, F ( A ) . For general theories, the value of F ( A ) is minimized when A is a round disk, F 0 , and in that case it coincides with the Euclidean free energy on the sphere. We conjecture that, for general CFTs, the quantity F ( A ) / F 0 is bounded above by the free scalar field result and below by the Maxwell field one. We provide strong evidence in favor of this claim and argue that an analogous conjecture in the four-dimensional case is equivalent to the Hofman-Maldacena bounds. In three dimensions, our conjecture gives rise to similar bounds on the quotients of various constants characterizing the CFT. In particular, it implies that the quotient of the stress-tensor two-point function coefficient and the sphere free energy satisfies C T / F 0 ≤ 3 / ( 4 π 2 log 2 − 6 ζ [ 3 ] ) ≃ 0.14887 for general CFTs. We verify the validity of this bound for free scalars and fermions, general O ( N ) and Gross-Neveu models, holographic theories, N = 2 Wess-Zumino models and general ABJM theories.},

In a nutshell, this implies that the problem of observables is to “analysis” what the Delian problem was to “straightedge and compass.” Our results remain true even after restricting the space of solutions to vacuum solutions.

Here we develop efficient certification methods for quantum memories. Considering a device-independent approach, where no a priori characterization of sources or measurement devices is required, we develop a robust self-testing method for quantum memories. We then illustrate the practical relevance of our technique in a relaxed scenario by certifying a fidelity of 0.87 in a recent solid-state ensemble quantum memory experiment. More generally, our methods apply for the characterization of any device implementing a qubit identity quantum channel.},

  abstract     = {Single quantum emitters embedded in solid-state hosts are an ideal platform for realizing quantum information processors and quantum network nodes. Among the currently investigated candidates, Er 3 + ions are particularly appealing due to their 1.5 μ m optical transition in the telecom band as well as their long spin coherence times. However, the long lifetimes of the excited state—generally in excess of 1 ms—along with the inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transition result in significant challenges. Photon emission rates are prohibitively small, and different emitters generally create photons with distinct spectra, thereby preventing multiphoton interference—a requirement for building large-scale, multinode quantum networks. Here we solve this challenge by demonstrating for the first time linear Stark tuning of the emission frequency of a single Er 3 + ion. Our ions are embedded in a lithium niobate crystal and couple evanescently to a silicon nanophotonic crystal cavity that provides a strong increase of the measured decay rate. By applying an electric field along the crystal c axis, we achieve a Stark tuning greater than the ion’s linewidth without changing the single-photon emission statistics of the ion. These results are a key step towards rare earth ion-based quantum networks.},

We present two constructions: for the first, the circuit is imprinted in the trap positions of the atoms and executed by the pulses; for the second, the atom arrangement is circuit-independent, and the algorithm is entirely encoded in the global driving sequence. Our results show in particular that a quadratic overhead in atom number is sufficient to eliminate the need for local control to realize a universal quantum processor. We give explicit protocols for all steps of an arbitrary quantum computation, and discuss strategies for error suppression specific to our model. Our scheme is based on dual-species processors with atoms subjected to Rydberg blockade constraints, but it might be transposed to other setups as well.},

The first is based on measurements in mutually unbiased bases and the second is based on equiangular measurements. Both criteria give a qualitative result in terms of the state’s entanglement dimension and a quantitative result in terms of its fidelity with the maximally entangled state. The criteria are universally applicable since no assumptions on the state are required. Moreover, the experimenter can control the trade-off between resource-efficiency and noise-tolerance by selecting the number of measurements performed. For paradigmatic noise models, we show that only a small number of measurements are necessary to achieve nearly-optimal detection in any dimension. The number of global product projections scales only linearly in the local dimension, thus paving the way for detection and quantification of very high-dimensional entanglement.},

Comparing explicit-particle simulations with mean-field calculations we show that for high grafting densities the salt concentration effect can be explained using the ideal Donnan theory, but for low grafting densities the full shift is due to a combination of the Donnan effect and the polyelectrolyte effect. The latter originates from electrostatic correlations that are neglected in the Donnan picture and that are only approximately included in the mean-field theory. Moreover, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the polyelectrolyte effect is almost invariant with respect to salt concentration but depends on the grafting density of the brush. This invariance is due to a complex cancellation of multiple effects. Based on our results, we show how the experimentally determined p K a shifts may be used to infer the grafting density of brushes, a parameter that is difficult to measure directly.},

As a consequence of this variational expression, we obtain lower bounds on the correlation time, which provide speed limits on the self-averaging of observables. In equilibrium, the bound takes the form of a trade-off relation between the long- and short-time fluctuations of an observable. Out of equilibrium, the trade-off can be violated, leading to an acceleration of self-averaging. We relate this violation to the steady-state entropy production rate, as well as the geometric structure of the irreversible currents, giving rise to two complementary speed limits. One of these can be formulated as a lower estimate on the entropy production from the measurement of time-symmetric observables. Using an illustrating example, we show the intricate behavior of the correlation time out of equilibrium for different classes of observables and how this can be used to partially infer dissipation even if no time-reversal symmetry breaking can be observed in the trajectories of the observable.},

To date, only one of the three independent components of the gauge fields has been found to play a role in generating the fictitious magnetic field, while the other two are perfectly hidden. In this Letter, we show that they are concealed in the nonlinear magnon transport in magnetic textures. Without loss of generality, we theoretically study the nonlinear magnon-skyrmion interaction in antiferromagnets. By analyzing the scattering features of three-magnon processes between the circularly polarized incident magnon and breathing skyrmion, we predict a giant Hall angle of both the confluence and splitting modes. Furthermore, we find that the Hall angle reverses its sign when one switches the handedness of the incident magnons. We dub this the nonlinear topological magnon spin Hall effect. Our findings are deeply rooted in the bosonic nature of magnons that the particle number is not conserved, which has no counterpart in low-energy fermionic systems and may open the door for probing gauge fields by nonlinear means.},

Under increased electron doping, the coercivities and anomalous Hall effects (AHEs) vanished, indicating a doping-induced magnetic phase transition. This occurred up to room temperature.

This phenomenon, known as the “arctic circle,” has been studied theoretically in combinatorial mathematics and statistical mechanics. Here, we realize the physics of the arctic circle experimentally for the first time, using a programmable lattice of superconducting qubits, and investigate its properties under the prism of a highly frustrated magnet. Our work reveals two unexpected properties. First, the disordered spin manifold confined within the arctic curve is a spin liquid whose average spin texture resembles that of an antivortex, i.e., it is a topologically charged Coulomb phase. Second, monopole quasiparticle excitations, which are totally absent in theoretical works, can be isolated in a phase-separated system. Remarkably, a monopole segregation mechanism is observed, in which the monopoles are sorted according to the magnetic charge and magnetic moment they carry, without the application of an external driving force.},

  abstract     = {We use the topological heavy fermion (THF) model and its Kondo lattice (KL) formulation to study the possibility of a symmetric Kondo (SK) state in twisted bilayer graphene. Via a large- N N approximation, we find a SK state in the KL model at fillings ν = 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 ν=0,±1,±2 where a KL model can be constructed. In the SK state, all symmetries are preserved and the local moments are Kondo screened by the conduction electrons. At the mean-field level of the THF model at ν = 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 , ± 3 ν=0,±1,±2,±3 we also find a similar symmetric state that is adiabatically connected to the symmetric Kondo state. We study the stability of the symmetric state by comparing its energy with the ordered (symmetry-breaking) states found in [H. Hu et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 131 , 026502 (2023) ., Z.-D. Song and B. A. Bernevig, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129 , 047601 (2022) .] and find the ordered states to have lower energy at ν = 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 ν=0,±1,±2 . However, moving away from integer fillings by doping the light bands, our mean-field calculations find the energy difference between the ordered state and the symmetric state to be reduced, which suggests the loss of ordering and a tendency toward Kondo screening. In order to include many-body effects beyond the mean-field approximation, we also performed dynamical mean-field theory calculations on the THF model in the nonordered phase. The spin susceptibility follows a Curie behavior at ν = 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 ν=0,±1,±2 down to ∼ 2 K ∼2  K where the onset of screening of the local moment becomes visible. This hints to very low Kondo temperatures at these fillings, in agreement with the outcome of our mean-field calculations. At noninteger filling ν = ± 0.5 , ± 0.8 , ± 1.2 ν=±0.5,±0.8,±1.2 dynamical mean-field theory shows deviations from a 1 / T 1/T susceptibility at much higher temperatures, suggesting a more effective screening of local moments with doping. Finally, we study the effect of a C 3 z C3z -rotational-symmetry-breaking strain via mean-field approaches and find that a symmetric phase (that only breaks C 3 z C3z symmetry) can be stabilized at sufficiently large strain at ν = 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 ν=0,±1,±2 . Our results suggest that a symmetric Kondo phase is strongly suppressed at integer fillings, but could be stabilized either at noninteger fillings or by applying strain.},

The measurement reveals that the diffraction intensity is highly suppressed when the x-ray intensity reaches of the order of 10 19 W / cm 2 . With a dedicated simulation, we confirm that the observed reduction of the diffraction intensity can be attributed to the femtosecond change in individual atomic scattering factors due to the ultrafast creation of highly ionized atoms through photoionization, Auger decay, and subsequent collisional ionization. We anticipate that this ultrafast reduction of atomic scattering factor will be a basis for new x-ray nonlinear techniques, such as pulse shortening and contrast variation x-ray scattering.},

Both reactions have been studied at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) in Italy down to the lowest energies to date ( E c . m . = 60 keV ) reaching for the first time the high energy tail of hydrogen burning in the shell of giant stars. Our cross sections, obtained with both prompt γ -ray detection and activation measurements, are the most precise to date with overall systematic uncertainties of 7\%–8\%. Compared with most of the literature, our results are systematically lower, by 25\% for the C 12 ( p , γ ) N 13 reaction and by 30\% for C 13 ( p , γ ) N 14 .

In particular, it is not known whether jets or their soft fragments are correlated with particles in the underlying event. To address this question, two-particle correlations are measured in p p collisions at s = 13 TeV using data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, with an integrated luminosity of 15.8 pb − 1 , in two different configurations. In the first case, charged particles associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis, while in the second case, correlations are measured between particles within jets and charged particles from the underlying event. Second-order flow coefficients, v 2 , are presented as a function of event multiplicity and transverse momentum. These measurements show that excluding particles associated with jets does not affect the measured correlations. Moreover, particles associated with jets do not exhibit any significant azimuthal correlations with the underlying event, ruling out hard processes contributing to the ridge.},

The interaction of D * D in the isoscalar and S -wave channel, derived from the hadronic spacetime correlation by the HAL QCD method, is attractive for all distances and leads to a near-threshold virtual state with a pole position E pole = − 59 ( − 99 + 53 ) ( − 67 + 2 ) keV and a large scattering length 1 / a 0 = 0.05 ( 5 ) ( − 2 + 2 ) fm − 1 . The virtual state is shown to evolve into a loosely bound state as m π decreases to its physical value by using a potential modified to m π = 135 MeV based on the pion-exchange interaction. Such a potential is found to give a semiquantitative description of the LHCb data on the D 0 D 0 π + mass spectrum. Future study is necessary to perform physical-point simulations with the isospin-breaking and open three-body-channel effects taken into account.},

A generalized King plot has been proposed to distinguish them from possible standard model effects arising from, e.g., finite nuclear size and electronic correlations. Additional isotopes and transitions are required for this approach. Xenon is an excellent candidate, with seven stable isotopes with zero nuclear spin, however it has no known visible ground-state transitions for high resolution spectroscopy. To address this, we have found and measured twelve magnetic-dipole lines in its highly charged ions and theoretically studied their sensitivity to fifth forces as well as the suppression of spurious higher-order standard model effects. Moreover, we identified at 764.8753(16) nm a E2-type ground-state transition with 500 s excited state lifetime as a potential clock candidate further enhancing our proposed scheme.},

We have analyzed more than 4 times the number of positrons from muon decay than in our previous result from 2018 data. The systematic error is reduced by more than a factor of 2 due to better running conditions, a more stable beam, and improved knowledge of the magnetic field weighted by the muon distribution, ω ˜ p ′ , and of the anomalous precession frequency corrected for beam dynamics effects, ω a . From the ratio ω a / ω ˜ p ′ , together with precisely determined external parameters, we determine a μ = 116 592 057 ( 25 ) × 10 − 11 (0.21 ppm). Combining this result with our previous result from the 2018 data, we obtain a μ ( FNAL ) = 116 592 055 ( 24 ) × 10 − 11 (0.20 ppm).

With 9.37 × 10 11 electrons on target collected during 2016–2022 runs NA64 probes for the first time the well-motivated region of parameter space of benchmark thermal scalar and fermionic dark matter models. No evidence for dark matter production has been found. This allows us to set the most sensitive limits on the A ′ couplings to photons for masses m A ′ ≲ 0.35 GeV , and to exclude scalar and Majorana dark matter with the χ − A ′ coupling α D ≤ 0.1 for masses 0.001 ≲ m χ ≲ 0.1 GeV and 3 m χ ≤ m A ′ .},

Translating it to the space of dual momenta produces a remarkably simple geometry given by configurations of spacelike separated off-shell momenta living inside a curvy polytope defined by momenta of scattered particles. We conjecture that the canonical differential form on this space gives amplitude integrands, and we provide a new formula for all one-loop n -particle integrands in the positive branch.

  abstract     = {For the efficient simulation of open quantum systems, we often use quantum jump trajectories given by pure states that evolve stochastically to unravel the dynamics of the underlying master equation. In the Markovian regime, when the dynamics is described by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation, this procedure is known as Monte Carlo wave function approach. However, beyond ultraweak system-bath coupling, the dynamics of the system is not described by an equation of GKSL type, but rather by the Redfield equation, which can be brought into pseudo-Lindblad form. Here, negative dissipation strengths prohibit the conventional approach. To overcome this problem, we propose a pseudo-Lindblad quantum trajectory (PLQT) unraveling. It does not require an effective extension of the state space, like other approaches, except for the addition of a single classical bit. We test the PLQT for the eternal non-Markovian master equation for a single qubit and an interacting Fermi-Hubbard chain coupled to a thermal bath and discuss its computational effort compared to solving the full master equation.},

  abstract     = {Filamentous cyanobacteria can show fascinating examples of nonequilibrium self-organization, which, however, are not well understood from a physical perspective. We investigate the motility and collective organization of colonies of these simple multicellular lifeforms. As their area density increases, linear chains of cells gliding on a substrate show a transition from an isotropic distribution to bundles of filaments arranged in a reticulate pattern. Based on our experimental observations of individual behavior and pairwise interactions, we introduce a nonreciprocal model accounting for the filaments’ large aspect ratio, fluctuations in curvature, motility, and nematic interactions. This minimal model of active filaments recapitulates the observations, and rationalizes the appearance of a characteristic length scale in the system, based on the Péclet number of the cyanobacteria filaments.},

The plates are found to experience a long-range attraction, which increases linearly with bacterial density and decreases with plate separation. The higher bacterial density and orientation order between plates observed in the experiments imply that the long-range effective attraction mainly arises from the bacterial flow field, instead of the direct bacterium-plate collisions, which is confirmed by the simulations. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic contribution is inversely proportional to the squared interplate separation in the far field. Our findings highlight the importance of hydrodynamics on the effective forces between passive objects in active baths, providing new possibilities to control activity-directed assembly.},

Lacking equilibrium sampling of the ionization pathway will cause ambiguities in the mechanistic study. Here, we obtain convergent free energy surfaces through nanosecond timescale metadynamics simulations with classical nuclei enhanced by atomic neural network potentials, which yields good reproduction of the equilibrium constant ( p K w = 14.14 ) and ionization rate constant ( 1.369 × 10 − 3 s − 1 ). The character of transition state unveils the triple-proton transfer occurs through a concerted but asynchronous mechanism. Conditional ensemble average analyses establish the dual-presolvation mechanism, where a pair of hypercoordinated and undercoordinated waters bridged by one H 2 O cooperatively constitutes the initiation environment for autoionization, and contributes extremely to the local electric field fluctuation to promote water dissociation.},

Our phase has an MCN of 4, protecting the existence of 4 midgap topological corner modes at each corner.

  abstract     = {In the systems showing critical behavior, various response functions have a singularity at the critical point. Therefore, as the driving field is tuned toward its critical value, the response functions change drastically, typically diverging with universal critical exponents. In this Letter, we quantify the inequality of response functions with measures traditionally used in economics, namely by constructing a Lorenz curve and calculating the corresponding Gini index. The scaling of such a response function, when written in terms of the Gini index, shows singularity at a point that is at least as universal as the corresponding critical exponent. The critical scaling, therefore, becomes a single parameter fit, which is a considerable simplification from the usual form where the critical point and critical exponents are independent. We also show that another measure of inequality, the Kolkata index, crosses the Gini index at a point just prior to the critical point. Therefore, monitoring these two inequality indices for a system where the critical point is not known can produce a precursory signal for the imminent criticality. This could be useful in many systems, including that in condensed matter, bio- and geophysics to atmospheric physics. The generality and numerical validity of the calculations are shown with the Monte Carlo simulations of the two dimensional Ising model, site percolation on square lattice, and the fiber bundle model of fracture.},

Different polarizations of the intracavity field give access to all components of the quantum geometric tensor on contours in the Brillouin zone defined by the transition energy. Combining recent results based on the metric-curvature correspondence with the measured quantum metric allows us to characterize the topological phase of the material. Moreover, in systems where S z is a good quantum number, the procedure also allows us to extract the spin Chern number. As an interesting application, we consider a minimal model for twisted bilayer graphene at the magic angle, and discuss the feasibility of extracting the Euler number.},

The auto-oscillations’ initiation, bandwidth, and amplitude are investigated by deriving an effective theory, which captures the reactive and dissipative SOTs. We find that the dynamics strongly depends on the ground state’s chirality, with one chirality having gapped excitations, whereas the opposite chirality provides gapless self-oscillations.

In this work, we study the dynamics of an exactly solvable non-Hermitian system, hosting both PT -symmetric and PT -broken modes subject to a linear quench. Employing a fully consistent framework, in which the Hilbert space is endowed with a nontrivial dynamical metric, we analyze the dynamics of the generated defects. In contrast to Hermitian systems, our study reveals that PT -broken time evolution leads to defect freezing and hence the violation of adiabaticity. This physics necessitates the so-called metric framework, as it is missed by the oft used approach of normalizing quantities by the time-dependent norm of the state.

  abstract     = {Quantum impurity models (QIMs) are ubiquitous throughout physics. As simplified toy models they provide crucial insights for understanding more complicated strongly correlated systems, while in their own right are accurate descriptions of many experimental platforms. In equilibrium, their physics is well understood and have proven a testing ground for many powerful theoretical tools, both numerical and analytical, in use today. Their nonequilibrium physics is much less studied and understood. However, the recent advancements in nonequilibrium integrable quantum systems through the development of generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) coupled with the fact that many archetypal QIMs are in fact integrable presents an enticing opportunity to enhance our understanding of these systems. We take a step towards this by expanding the framework of GHD to incorporate integrable interacting QIMs. We present a set of Bethe-Boltzmann type equations which incorporate the effects of impurity scattering and discuss the new aspects which include entropy production. These impurity GHD equations are then used to study a bipartioning quench wherein a relevant backscattering impurity is included at the location of the bipartition. The density and current profiles are studied as a function of the impurity strength and expressions for the entanglement entropy and full counting statistics are derived.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of ultrafast experimental techniques for the research of carrier dynamics in solid-state systems, a microscopic understanding of the related phenomena, particularly a first-principle calculation, is highly desirable. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) offers a real-time direct simulation of the carrier transfer or carrier thermalization. However, when applied to a periodic supercell, there is no cross- k -point transitions during the NAMD simulation. This often leads to a significant underestimation of the transition rate with the single- k -point band structure in a supercell. In this work, based on the surface hopping scheme used for NAMD, we propose a practical method to enable the cross- k transitions for a periodic system. We demonstrate our formalism by showing that the hot electron thermalization process by the multi- k -point NAMD in a small silicon supercell is equivalent to such simulation in a large supercell with a single Γ point. The simulated hot carrier thermalization process of the bulk silicon is compared with the recent ultrafast experiments, which shows excellent agreements. We have also demonstrated our method for the hot carrier coolings in the amorphous silicons and the GaAlAs 2 solid solutions with the various cation distributions.},

Both vertical and lateral electric transport are measured in the millikelvin temperature range. The conductivity between the layers shows a sharp tunnel resonance at a density of 1.1 × 10 10 cm − 2 , which is consistent with a Josephson-like enhanced tunnel conductance. The tunnel resonance disappears with increasing densities and the two 2D charge gases start to show 2D-Fermi-gas behavior. Interlayer interactions persist causing a positive drag voltage that is very large at small densities. The transition from the Josephson-like tunnel resonance to the Fermi-gas behavior is interpreted as a phase transition from an exciton gas in the Bose-Einstein-condensate state to a degenerate electron-hole Fermi gas.},

Compressibility-induced coupling is found to substantially increase maximum tensile stresses, which cause materials to fail, and to decrease friction such that Amontons’ law is violated macroscopically even when it holds microscopically. Confinement-induced coupling increases friction and enlarges domains of high tension. Moreover, both types of coupling affect the gap topography and thereby leakage. Thus, coupling can be much more than a minor perturbation of a mechanical contact.},

Electron heating preferentially parallel to the magnetic field is localized to one separatrix, and anisotropies of 1.5 are measured. The mechanism for electron energization is identified as the parallel reconnection electric field because of the anisotropic nature of the heating and spatial localization. These characteristics are reproduced in a 2D particle-in-cell simulation and are also consistent with numerous magnetosheath observations. A measured increase in the perpendicular temperature along both separatrices is not reproduced by our 2D simulations.

  abstract     = {In ordinary circumstances the highest frequency present in a wave is the highest frequency in its Fourier decomposition. It is however possible for there to be a spatial or temporal region where the wave locally oscillates at a still greater frequency in a phenomenon known as superoscillation. Superoscillations find application in wide range of disciplines, but at present their generation is based upon constructive approaches that are difficult to implement. Here, we address this, exploiting the fact that superoscillations are a product of destructive interference to produce a prescription for generating superoscillations from the superposition of arbitrary waveforms. As a first test of the technique, we use it to combine four quasisinusoidal THz waveforms to produce THz optical superoscillations for the first time. The ability to generate superoscillations in this manner has potential application in a wide range of fields, which we demonstrate with a method we term “superspectroscopy.” This employs the generated superoscillations to obtain an observed enhancement of almost an order of magnitude in the spectroscopic sensitivity to materials whose resonance lies outside the range of the component waveform frequencies.},

The directionality of optical propagation dictates the characteristic length scales of intensity variations, which play a pivotal role in nonlinear light-matter interactions. While wavelength-scale intensity variations tend to stabilize lasing dynamics, modulation on much longer scales causes spatial filamentation and irregular pulsation.

Its remarkably long lifetime surpasses the half-lives of all other known β and electron capture decays due to the large K-spin differences and small energy differences between the isomeric and lower-energy states. Detecting its decay presents a significant experimental challenge but could shed light on neutrino-induced nucleosynthesis mechanisms, the nature of dark matter, and K-spin violation. For this study, we repurposed the Majorana Demonstrator, an experimental search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of Ge 76 using an array of high-purity germanium detectors, to search for the decay of Ta 180 m . More than 17 kg, the largest amount of tantalum metal ever used for such a search, was installed within the ultralow-background detector array. In this Letter, we present results from the first year of Ta data taking and provide an updated limit for the Ta 180 m half-life on the different decay channels. With new limits up to 1.5 × 10 19 yr , we improved existing limits by 1–2 orders of magnitude which are the most sensitive searches for a single β and electron capture decay ever achieved. Over all channels, the decay can be excluded for T 1 / 2 &lt; 0.29 × 10 18 yr .},

We study an index analog of the microcanonical spectrum form factor in four-dimensional N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. In the large N limit and at large enough energy, the most dominant saddle corresponds to the black hole in the AdS bulk. This gives rise to the slope that decreases exponentially for a small imaginary chemical potential, which is a natural analog of an early time. We find that the “late-time” behavior is governed by the multicut saddles that arise in the index matrix model, which are nonperturbatively subdominant at early times. These saddles become dominant at late times, preventing the SFF from decaying. These multicut saddles correspond to the orbifolded Euclidean black holes in the AdS bulk, therefore giving the geometrical interpretation of the “ramp”. Our analysis is done in the standard AdS / CFT setting without ensemble average or wormholes.},

Our spin-orbit results agree with next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order post-Newtonian and test-body data in the respective limits. We also reconfirm the conservative 4PM nonspinning results.},

The positron fluxes show distinctly different time variations from the electron fluxes at short and long timescales. A hysteresis between the electron fluxes and the positron fluxes is observed with a significance greater than 5 σ at rigidities below 8.5 GV. On the contrary, the positron fluxes and the proton fluxes show similar time variation. Remarkably, we found that positron fluxes are modulated more than proton fluxes with a significance greater than 5 σ for rigidities below 7 GV. These continuous daily positron fluxes, together with AMS daily electron, proton, and helium fluxes over an 11-year solar cycle, provide unique input to the understanding of both the charge-sign and mass dependencies of cosmic rays in the heliosphere.},

Diffuse emissions from the inner ( 15 ° 10 TeV ). The energy spectrum in the inner Galaxy regions can be described by a power-law function with an index of − 2.99 ± 0.04 , which is different from the curved spectrum as expected from hadronic interactions between locally measured cosmic rays and the line-of-sight integrated gas content. Furthermore, the measured flux is higher by a factor of ∼ 3 than the prediction. A similar spectrum with an index of − 2.99 ± 0.07 is found in the outer Galaxy region, and the absolute flux for 10 ≲ E ≲ 60 TeV is again higher than the prediction for hadronic cosmic ray interactions. The latitude distributions of the diffuse emission are consistent with the gas distribution, while the longitude distributions show clear deviation from the gas distribution. The LHAASO measurements imply that either additional emission sources exist or cosmic ray intensities have spatial variations.},

Here, we present a quantum memory with built-in excess-noise eraser by integrating a photon-correlated quantum interferometry in quantum memory, where the memory efficiency can be enhanced and the excess noises can be suppressed to the vacuum level via destructive interference. This quantum memory is demonstrated in a rubidium vapor cell with a 10-ns-long photonics signal. We observe ∼ 80\% noise suppression, the write-in efficiency enhancement from 87\% to 96.2\% without and with interferometry, and the corresponding memory efficiency excluding the noises from 70\% to 77\%. The fidelity is 93.7\% at the single-photon level, significantly exceeding the no-cloning limit.

Here we propose a simple recipe for the implementation of a general positive-operator valued measurement (POVM) on a higher-dimensional quantum system via a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk with a two-dimensional coin. Furthermore, using single photons and linear optics, we realize experimentally a symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) POVM on a three-dimensional system with high fidelity. As an application, we realize a qutrit state tomography with SIC-POVM and confirm that the infidelity scaling achieved by the qutrit SIC-POVM is as good as that based on mutually unbiased bases. Our study paves the way to explore physics and information in higher-dimensional quantum systems and finds applications in various quantum information processing tasks that rely on generalized quantum measurements.},

In this paper we show that the maximal obtainable sensitivity using a given quantum state is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) and the corresponding evolution is uniquely determined by the coinciding eigenvector. Since we optimize the process of parameter encoding rather than focusing on state preparation protocols, our scheme is relevant for any quantum sensor. This procedure naturally optimizes multiparameter estimation by determining, through the eigenvectors of the QFIM, the maximal set of commuting observables with optimal sensitivity.},

Estimating with the best classical algorithms to date, generating a single ideal sample from the same distribution on the supercomputer Frontier would take ∼ 600 yr using exact methods, whereas our quantum computer, Jiǔzhāng 3.0, takes only 1.27 μ s to produce a sample.

We compute the spin squeezing as a measure of correlations in the system, and compare to semiclassical phase-space calculations utilizing the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA). We find the latter efficiently and accurately captures the scaling of entanglement with system size in these systems, despite the comparatively resource-intensive tensor network representation of the dynamics. We also compare the steady-state behavior of DTWA to thermal ensemble calculations with tensor networks.

Going beyond, here we report the first experimental study of MUR of three quantum observables. We establish rigorously MURs for triplets of unbiased qubit observables as combined approximation errors lower bounded by an incompatibility measure, inspired by the proposal of Busch et al. [ Phys. Rev. A 89 , 012129 (2014) ]. We develop a convex programming protocol to numerically find the exact value of the incompatibility measure and the optimal measurements. We propose a novel implementation of the optimal joint measurements and present several experimental demonstrations with a single-photon qubit. We stress that our method is universally applicable to the study of many qubit observables. Besides, we theoretically show that MURs for joint measurement can be attained by sequential measurements in two of our explored cases. We anticipate that this work may stimulate broad interests associated with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in the case of multiple observables, enriching our understanding of quantum mechanics and inspiring innovative applications in quantum information science.},

The existence of closed timelike curves is hypothetical. Nevertheless, they can be simulated probabilistically by quantum-teleportation circuits. We leverage such simulations to pinpoint a counterintuitive nonclassical advantage achievable with entanglement. Our experiment echoes a common information-processing task: A metrologist must prepare probes to input into an unknown quantum interaction. The goal is to infer as much information per probe as possible. If the input is optimal, the information gained per probe can exceed any value achievable classically. The problem is that, only after the interaction does the metrologist learn which input would have been optimal. The metrologist can attempt to change the input by effectively teleporting the optimal input back in time, via entanglement manipulation. The effective time travel sometimes fails but ensures that, summed over trials, the metrologist’s winnings are positive. Our Gedankenexperiment demonstrates that entanglement can generate operational advantages forbidden in classical chronology-respecting theories.},

To characterize these phenomena, we provide a general theory that incorporates active cellular contractility into the classical Cahn-Hilliard-Larché model for phase separation in passive viscoelastic solids. Within this framework, we show how a homogeneous cell-matrix mixture can be destabilized by activity via either a pitchfork or Hopf bifurcation, resulting in stable phase separation and/or traveling waves. Numerical simulations of the full equations allow us to track the evolution of the resulting self-organized patterns in periodic and mechanically constrained domains, and in different geometries. Altogether, our study underscores the importance of integrating both cellular activity and mechanical phase separation in understanding patterning in soft, active biosolids in both in vivo and in vitro settings.},

Combining simulations of the microscopic model and linear stability analysis of the associated coarse-grained field theory, we identify a mechanism for dynamical pattern formation that does not rely on the standard route of intraspecies effective attractive interactions. Instead, our results reveal a highly dynamical phase of chasing bands induced only by the combined effects of self-propulsion and nonreciprocity in the interspecies couplings. Turning on self-attraction, we find that the system may phase separate into a macroscopic domain of such chaotic chasing bands coexisting with a dilute gas. We show that the chaotic dynamics of bands at the interfaces of this phase-separated phase results in anomalously slow coarsening.},

Such buckling begins in a region of greatly amplified azimuthal compression generated in an outer boundary layer with oscillatory bend. Experimentally and numerically, buckling then grows subcritically over the full cone. We derive a new thin-limit formula for the critical load, ∝ t 5 / 2 , and validate it numerically. We also investigate deep postbuckling, finding further instabilities producing intricate states with multiple Pogorelov-type curved ridges arranged in concentric circles or Archimedean spirals.

We argue that recent single-crystal inelastic neutron scattering data place the honeycomb magnet Na 2 Co 2 TeO 6 in proximity to such a hidden-SU(2)-symmetric point. The low-temperature order is identified as a triple- q state arising from the Néel antiferromagnet with staggered magnetization in the out-of-plane direction via a 4-sublattice duality transformation. This state naturally explains various distinctive features of the magnetic excitation spectrum, including its surprisingly high symmetry and the dispersive low-energy and flat high-energy bands.

Our inelastic neutron scattering measurement on single crystals clearly shows a dominant excitation continuum, which exhibits a distinct temperature-dependent behavior from that of spin waves, and is rooted in strong quantum spin fluctuations. Further using the self-consistent-Gaussian-approximation method, we determine that the fourth- and fifth-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions are dominant.

  abstract     = {The Dirac material ZrTe 5 at very low carrier density was recently found to be a nodal-line semimetal, where ultraflat bands are expected to emerge in magnetic fields parallel to the nodal-line plane. Here, we report that in very low carrier-density samples of ZrTe 5 , when the current and the magnetic field are both along the crystallographic a axis, the current-voltage characteristics presents a pronounced nonlinearity which tends to saturate in the ultra quantum limit. The magnetic-field dependence of the nonlinear coefficient is well explained by the Boltzmann theory for flat-band transport, and we argue that this nonlinear transport is likely due to the combined effect of flat bands and charge puddles; the latter appear due to very low carrier densities.},

Although theoretical predictions on the transition from diamond to the BC8 ( I a 3 ¯ ) carbon were made more than thirty years ago, after tremendous experimental efforts, direct evidence for the existence of BC8 carbon is still lacking. In this study, a machine learning potential was developed for high-pressure carbon fitted from first-principles calculations, which exhibited great capabilities in modeling the melting and Hugoniot line. Using the molecular dynamics based on this machine learning potential, we designed a thermodynamic pathway that is achievable for the double shock compression experiment to obtain the elusive BC8 carbon. Diamond was compressed up to 584 GPa after the first shock at 2 0.5 km / s . Subsequently, in the second shock compression at 24.8 or 2 5.0 km / s , diamond was compressed to a supercooled liquid and then solidified to BC8 in around 1 ns. Furthermore, the critical nucleus size and nucleation rate of BC8 were calculated, which are crucial for nano-second x-ray diffraction measurements to observe BC8 carbon during shock compressions. The key to obtaining BC8 carbon lies in the formation of liquid at a sufficient supercooling. Our work provides a feasible pathway by which the long-sought BC8 phase of carbon can be reached in experiments.},

Using three-dimensional particle-in-cell and far-field time-domain radiation simulations, we show that an isolated subcycle pulse is coherently emitted towards the Cherenkov angle by bubble-sheath electrons successively at the rear of the REB-induced superluminal plasma wake. A theoretical model based on a superluminal current dipole has been developed to interpret such coherent radiation, and agrees well with the simulation results. This radiation has ultrashort attosecond-scale duration and high intensity, and exhibits excellent directionality with ultralow angular divergence and stable carrier envelope phase. Its intensity increases with the square of the propagation length and its central frequency can be easily tuned over a wide range, from the far infrared to the ultraviolet.},

  abstract     = {The ability to form monoenergetic electron beams is vital for high-resolution electron spectroscopy and imaging. Such capabilities are commonly achieved using an electron monochromator, which energy filters a dispersed electron beam, thus reducing the electron flux to yield down to meV energy resolution. This reduction in flux hinders the use of monochromators in many applications, such as ultrafast transmission electron microscopes (UTEMs). Here, we develop and demonstrate a mechanism for electron energy monochromation that does not reduce the flux—a lossless monochromator. The mechanism is based on the interaction of free-electron pulses with single-cycle THz near fields, created by nonlinear conversion of an optical laser pulse near the electron beam path inside a UTEM. Our experiment reduces the electron energy spread by a factor of up to 2.9 without compromising the beam flux. Moreover, as the electron-THz interaction takes place over an extended region of many tens of microns in free space, the realized technique is highly robust—granting uniform monochromation over a wide area, larger than the electron beam diameter. We further demonstrate the wide tunability of our method by monochromating the electron beam at multiple primary electron energies from 60 to 200 keV, studying the effect of various electron and THz parameters on its performance. Our findings have direct applications in the fast-growing field of ultrafast electron microscopy, allowing time- and energy-resolved studies of exciton physics, phononic vibrational resonances, charge transport effects, and optical excitations in the mid IR to the far IR.},

  abstract     = {In seeded free electron lasers (FELs), the temporal profile of FEL pulses usually reflects that of the seed pulse, and, thus, shorter FEL pulses are available with shorter seed pulses. In an extreme condition, however, this correlation is violated; the FEL pulse is stretched by the so-called slippage effect in undulators, when the seed pulse is ultimately short, e.g., few-cycles long. In a previous Letter, we have proposed a scheme to suppress the slippage effect and reduce the pulse length of FELs ultimately down to a single-cycle duration, which is based on “chirped microbunching,” or an electron density modulation with a varying modulation period. Toward realization of FELs based on the proposed scheme, experiments have been carried out to demonstrate its fundamental mechanism in the NewSUBARU synchrotron radiation facility, using an ultrashort seed pulse with the pulse length shorter than five cycles. Experimental results of spectral and cross-correlation measurements have been found to be in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions, which strongly suggests the successful demonstration of the proposed scheme.},

We demonstrate a quench protocol that can maintain highly non-Gaussian states over long timescales.

Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a direct dispersive coupling between a qubit and a noneigenmode magnon enables detecting the magnonic number states’ quantum superposition that forms the ground state of the actual eigenmode—squeezed magnon—via qubit excitation spectroscopy. Furthermore, this unique coupling is found to enable control over the equilibrium magnon squeezing and a deterministic generation of squeezed even Fock states via the qubit state and its excitation. Our work demonstrates direct dispersive coupling to noneigenmodes, realizable in spin systems, as a general pathway to exploiting the equilibrium squeezing and related quantum properties thereby motivating a search for similar realizations in other platforms.},

  abstract     = {Complementarity is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. The preparation of an eigenstate of one observable implies complete randomness in its complementary observable. In quantum cryptography, complementarity allows us to formulate security analyses in terms of phase-error correction. However, the concept becomes much subtler in the device-independent regime that offers security without device characterization. Security proofs of device-independent quantum cryptography tasks are often complex and quite different from those of their more standard device-dependent cousins. The existing proofs pose huge challenges to experiments, among which large data-size requirement is a crux. Here, we show the complementarity security origin of the device-independent tasks. By linking complementarity with quantum nonlocality, we recast the device-independent scheme into a quantum error correction protocol. Going beyond the identical-and-independent-distribution case, we consider the most general attack. We generalize the sample entropy in classical Shannon theory for the finite-size analysis. Our method exhibits good finite-size performance and brings the device-independent scheme to a more practical regime. Applying it to the data in a recent ion-trap-based device-independent quantum key distribution experiment, one could reduce the requirement on data size to less than a third. Furthermore, the operational meaning of complementarity naturally extends device-independent scenarios to advantage key distillation, easing experiments by tolerating higher loss and lower transmittance.},

Some QNNs with specific encoding methods can be efficiently simulated by classical surrogates, while others with quantum memory may perform better than classical classifiers. Here we systematically investigate the problem-dependent power of quantum neural classifiers (QCs) on multiclass classification tasks. Through the analysis of expected risk, a measure that weighs the training loss and the generalization error of a classifier jointly, we identify two key findings: first, the training loss dominates the power rather than the generalization ability; second, QCs undergo a U-shaped risk curve, in contrast to the double-descent risk curve of deep neural classifiers. We also reveal the intrinsic connection between optimal QCs and the Helstrom bound and the equiangular tight frame. Using these findings, we propose a method that exploits loss dynamics of QCs to estimate the optimal hyperparameter settings yielding the minimal risk. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to explain the superiority of QCs over multilayer Perceptron on parity datasets and their limitations over convolutional neural networks on image datasets. Our work sheds light on the problem-dependent power of QNNs and offers a practical tool for evaluating their potential merit.},

  abstract     = {Owing to its probabilistic nature, a measurement process in quantum mechanics produces a distribution of possible outcomes. This distribution—or its Fourier transform known as full counting statistics (FCS)—contains much more information than say the mean value of the measured observable, and accessing it is sometimes the only way to obtain relevant information about the system. In fact, the FCS is the limit of an even more general family of observables—the charged moments —that characterize how quantum entanglement is split in different symmetry sectors in the presence of a global symmetry. Here we consider the evolution of the FCS and of the charged moments of a U(1) charge truncated to a finite region after a global quantum quench. For large scales these quantities take a simple large-deviation form, showing two different regimes as functions of time: while for times much larger than the size of the region they approach a stationary value set by the local equilibrium state, for times shorter than region size they show a nontrivial dependence on time. We show that, whenever the initial state is also U(1) symmetric, the leading order in time of FCS and charged moments in the out-of-equilibrium regime can be determined by means of a space-time duality. Namely, it coincides with the stationary value in the system where the roles of time and space are exchanged. We use this observation to find some general properties of FCS and charged moments out of equilibrium, and to derive an exact expression for these quantities in interacting integrable models. We test this expression against exact results in the Rule 54 quantum cellular automaton and exact numerics in the X X Z spin- 1 / 2 chain.},

We introduce the paradigm of self-testing with dishonest parties and provide a certification protocol for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state in this framework, together with robust statements about the fidelity of the shared state. We extend our results to the cluster scenario, where many subgroups of parties may collude.

  abstract     = {Interfacial instabilities are common phenomena observed during adhesion measurements involving viscoelastic polymers or fluids. Typical probe-tack adhesion measurements with soft adhesives are conducted with rigid probes. However, in many settings, such as for medical applications, adhesives make and break contact from soft surfaces such as skin. Here we study how detachment from soft probes alters the debonding mechanism of a model viscoelastic polymer film. We demonstrate that detachment from a soft probe suppresses Saffman-Taylor instabilities commonly encountered in adhesion. We suggest the mechanism for interface stabilization is elastohydrodynamic deformation of the probe and propose a scaling for the onset of stabilization.},

Here we achieve two-dimensional Berry curvature reconstruction in a photonic quantum anomalous Hall system via Hall transport measurement of a momentum-resolved wave packet. Integrating measured Berry curvature over the two-dimensional Brillouin zone, we obtain Chern numbers corresponding to − 1 and 0. Further, we identify bulk-boundary correspondence by measuring topology-linked chiral edge states at the boundary. The full topological characterization of photonic Chern bands from Berry curvature, Chern number, and edge transport measurements enables our photonic system to serve as a versatile platform for further in-depth study of novel topological physics.},

  abstract     = {Quantum correlations and nonprojective measurements underlie a plethora of information-theoretic tasks, otherwise impossible in the classical world. Existing schemes to certify such nonclassical resources in a device-independent manner require seed randomness—which is often costly and vulnerable to loopholes—for choosing the local measurements performed on different parts of a multipartite quantum system. In this Letter, we propose and experimentally implement a semi-device-independent certification technique for both quantum correlations and nonprojective measurements without seed randomness. Our test is semi–device independent in the sense that it requires only prior knowledge of the dimension of the parts. We experimentally show a novel quantum advantage in correlated coin tossing by producing specific correlated coins from pairs of photons entangled in their transverse spatial modes. We establish the advantage by showing that the correlated coin obtained from the entangled photons cannot be obtained from two two-level classical correlated coins. The quantum advantage requires performing qubit trine positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) on each part of the entangled pair, thus also certifying such POVMs in a semi-device-independent manner. This proof of concept firmly establishes a new cost-effective certification technique for both generating nonclassical shared randomness and implementing nonclassical measurements, which will be important for future multiparty quantum communications.},

Our experimental data demonstrate that triangular lattice arrays form a “tripod ice” that exhibits charge ordering among the effective vertex magnetic charges, in direct analogy to artificial kagome spin ice. The results indicate that the interacting tripods have effective moments that act as emergent local variables, with strong connections to the well-studied Potts and clock models. In addition, the tripod moments display a tendency toward a nearest neighbor alignment in our thermalized samples that separates this system from kagome spin ice. Our results open a path toward the study of the collective behavior of nonbinary moments that is unavailable in other physical systems.},

In general, a term proportional to cos ( ϕ ) is also present, alongside microscopic electronic retardation effects. We show that voltage pulses sharply varying in time prompt a significant impact of the cos ( ϕ ) term. Its interplay with the sin ( ϕ ) term results in a nonequilibrium fractional Josephson effect (NFJE) ∼ sin ( ϕ / 2 ) in the presence of bound states close to zero frequency. Our microscopic analysis reveals that the interference of nonequilibrium virtual quasiparticle excitations is responsible for this phenomenon. We also analyze this phenomenon for topological Josephson junctions with Majorana bound states. Remarkably, the NFJE is independent of the ground state fermion parity unlike its equilibrium counterpart.},

Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we show that the implementation of losses can lead to an increase of the AIR without deteriorating the AT.

  abstract     = {Polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is sensitive to new physics violating parity symmetry, such as the presence of a pseudoscalar “axionlike” field. Such a field may be responsible for early dark energy (EDE), which is active prior to recombination and provides a solution to the so-called Hubble tension. The EDE field coupled to photons in a parity-violating manner would rotate the plane of linear polarization of the CMB and produce a cross-correlation power spectrum of E - and B -mode polarization fields with opposite parities. In this Letter, we fit the E B power spectrum predicted by the photon-axion coupling of the EDE model with a potential V ( ϕ ) ∝ [ 1 − cos ( ϕ / f ) ] 3 to polarization data from Planck . We find that the unique shape of the predicted E B power spectrum is not favored by the data and obtain a first constraint on the photon-axion coupling constant, g = ( 0.04 ± 0.16 ) M Pl − 1 (68\% C.L.), for the EDE model that best fits the CMB and galaxy clustering data. This constraint is independent of the miscalibration of polarization angles of the instrument or the polarized Galactic foreground emission. Our limit on g may have important implications for embedding EDE in fundamental physics, such as string theory.},

To avoid known no-go results on universal deterministic exact unitary inversion, we consider the most general class of protocols transforming unknown unitary operations within the quantum circuit model, where the input unitary operation is called multiple times in sequence and fixed quantum circuits are inserted between the calls. In the proposed protocol, the input qubit-unitary operation is called 4 times to achieve the inverse operation, and the output state in an auxiliary system can be reused as a catalyst state in another run of the unitary inversion. We also present the simplification of the semidefinite programming for searching the optimal deterministic unitary inversion protocol for an arbitrary dimension presented by M. T. Quintino and D. Ebler [ Quantum 6 , 679 (2022) ]. We show a method to reduce the large search space representing all possible protocols, which provides a useful tool for analyzing higher-order quantum transformations for unitary operations.},

  abstract     = {Quantum theory admits ensembles of quantum nonlocality without entanglement (QNLWE). These ensembles consist of seemingly classical states (they are perfectly distinguishable and nonentangled) that cannot be perfectly discriminated with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Here, we analyze QNLWE from a causal perspective, and show how to perfectly discriminate some of these ensembles using local operations and classical communication without definite causal order. Specifically, three parties with access to an instance of indefinite causal order—the Araújo-Feix–Baumeler-Wolf process—can perfectly discriminate the states in a QNLWE ensemble—the SHIFT ensemble—with local operations. Hence, this type of quantum nonlocality disappears at the expense of definite causal order while retaining classical communication. Our results thereby leverage the fact that LOCC is a conjunction of three constraints: local operations, classical communication, and definite causal order. Moreover, we show how multipartite generalizations of the Araújo-Feix–Baumeler-Wolf process are transformed into multiqubit ensembles that exhibit QNLWE. Such ensembles are of independent interest for cryptographic protocols and for the study of separable quantum operations unachievable with LOCC.},

Understanding how biological and machine-learning networks function and learn requires knowledge of the structure of this coordinated activity, information contained, for example, in cross covariances between units. Self-consistent dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) has elucidated several features of random neural networks—in particular, that they can generate chaotic activity—however, a calculation of cross covariances using this approach has not been provided. Here, we calculate cross covariances self-consistently via a two-site cavity DMFT. We use this theory to probe spatiotemporal features of activity coordination in a classic random-network model with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) couplings, showing an extensive but fractionally low effective dimension of activity and a long population-level timescale. Our formulas apply to a wide range of single-unit dynamics and generalize to non-i.i.d. couplings. As an example of the latter, we analyze the case of partially symmetric couplings.},

MIPS is well-studied for randomly moving particles with no directional bias. However, many forms of active matter exhibit collective chemotaxis, directed motion along a chemical gradient that the constituent particles can generate themselves. Here, using theory and simulations, we demonstrate that collective chemotaxis strongly competes with MIPS—in some cases, arresting or completely suppressing phase separation, or in other cases, generating fundamentally new dynamic instabilities. We establish principles describing this competition, thereby helping to reveal and clarify the rich physics underlying active matter systems that perform chemotaxis, ranging from cells to robots.},

Despite this, we observe only moderate differences in the period of oscillations of the pressure with the slit width and virtually coinciding decay lengths as functions of the scaling variable σ ion / λ D , where σ ion is the ion diameter and λ D the Debye length. Moreover, in the electrostatic-dominated regime, this scaling behavior is practically independent of the relative permittivity and its dependence on the ion concentration. In contrast, the crossover to the hard-core-dominated regime depends sensitively on all three factors.},

Coherent control of Andreev bound states has recently been achieved within each parity sector, but it is impeded by incoherent parity switches due to excess quasiparticles in the superconducting environment. Here, we show that we can polarize the fermion parity dynamically using microwave pulses by embedding the junction in a superconducting LC resonator. We demonstrate polarization up to 94\% ± 1\% ( 89\% ± 1\% ) for the even (odd) parity as verified by single shot parity readout. Finally, we apply this scheme to probe the flux-dependent transition spectrum of the even or odd parity sector selectively, without any postprocessing or heralding.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the exciton fine structure in atomically thin WSe 2 -based van der Waals heterostructures where the density of optical modes at the location of the semiconductor monolayer can be tuned. The energy splitting Δ between the bright and dark exciton is measured by photoluminescence spectroscopy. We demonstrate that Δ can be tuned by a few meV as a result of a significant Lamb shift of the optically active exciton that arises from emission and absorption of virtual photons triggered by the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. We also measure strong variations of the bright exciton radiative linewidth as a result of the Purcell effect. All these experimental results illustrate the strong sensitivity of the excitons to local vacuum field fluctuations. We find a very good agreement with a model that demonstrates the equivalence, for our system, of a classical electrodynamical transfer matrix formalism and quantum-electrodynamical approach. The bright-dark splitting control we demonstrate here in the weak light-matter coupling regime should apply to any semiconductor structures.},

  abstract     = {More than twenty years ago, multiferroic compounds combining in particular magnetism and ferroelectricity were rediscovered. Since then, BiFeO 3 has emerged as the most outstanding multiferroic by combining at room temperature almost all the fundamental or applicative properties that may be desired: electroactive spin wave excitations called electromagnons, conductive domain walls, or a low band gap of interest for magnonic devices. All these properties have so far only been discontinuously strain engineered in thin films according to the lattice parameter imposed by the substrate. Here we explore the ferroelectricity and the dynamic magnetic response of BiFeO 3 bulk under continuously tunable uniaxial strain. Using elasto-Raman spectroscopy, we show that the ferroelectric soft mode is strongly enhanced under tensile strain and driven by the volume preserving deformation at low strain. The magnonic response is entirely modified with low energy magnon modes being suppressed for tensile strain above pointing out a transition from a cycloid to an homogeneous magnetic state. Effective Hamiltonian calculations show that the ferroelectric and the antiferrodistortive modes compete in the tensile regime. In addition, the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state becomes more stable compared to the cycloidal state above a + 2\% tensile strain close to the experimental value. Finally, we reveal the ferroelectric and magnetic orders of BiFeO 3 under uniaxial strain and how the tensile strain allows us to unlock and to modify in a differentiated way the polarization and the magnetic structure.},

By calculating thermodynamics, correlations, and susceptibilities, we find, in zero magnetic field, not only a line of first-order dimer-singlet to plaquette-singlet phase transition ending with a critical point, but also signatures of the ordered plaquette-singlet transition with its critical end point terminating on this first-order line. Moreover, we uncover prominent magnetic barocaloric responses, a novel type of quantum correlation induced cooling effect, in the strongly fluctuating supercritical regime. Under finite fields, we identify a quantum phase transition from the plaquette-singlet phase to the spin supersolid phase that breaks simultaneously lattice translational and spin rotational symmetries. The present findings on the Shastry-Sutherland model are accessible in current experiments and would shed new light on the critical and supercritical phenomena in the archetypal frustrated quantum magnet SrCu 2 ( BO 3 ) 2 .},

Here, we study the topological circular dichroism in chiral semimetals using linear response theory and first-principles calculations. We show that, when the low-energy spectrum respects emergent SO(3) rotational symmetry, topological circular dichroism is forbidden for Weyl fermions, and thus is unique to chiral multifold fermions. This is a result of the selection rule that is imposed by the emergent symmetry under the combination of particle-hole conjugation and spatial inversion. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that topological circular dichroism occurs in CoSi for photon energy below about 0.2 eV. Our Letter demonstrates the existence of a response property of unconventional fermions that is fundamentally different from the response of Dirac and Weyl fermions, motivating further study to uncover other unique responses.},

  abstract     = {Phonons, as the most fundamental emergent bosons in condensed matter systems, play an essential role in the thermal, mechanical, and electronic properties of crystalline materials. Recently, the concept of topology has been introduced to phonon systems, and the nontrivial topological states also exist in phonons due to the constraint by the crystal symmetry of the space group. Although the classification of various topological phonons has been enriched theoretically, experimental studies were limited to several three-dimensional (3D) single crystals with inelastic x-ray or neutron scatterings. The experimental evidence of topological phonons in two-dimensional (2D) materials is absent. Here, using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy following our theoretical predictions, we directly map out the phonon spectra of the atomically thin graphene in the entire 2D Brillouin zone, and observe two nodal-ring phonons and four Dirac phonons. The closed loops of nodal-ring phonons and the conical structure of Dirac phonons in 2D momentum space are clearly revealed by our measurements, in nice agreement with our theoretical calculations. The ability of 3D mapping (2D momentum space and energy space) of phonon spectra opens up a new avenue to the systematic identification of the topological phononic states. Our work lays a solid foundation for potential applications of topological phonons in superconductivity, dynamic instability, and phonon diode.},

Recent studies show that the non-Hermitian skin effect is significantly suppressed by magnetic fields. In contrast, we demonstrate that the second-order skin effect (SOSE) is robust and can even be enhanced by magnetic fields. Remarkably, SOSE can also be induced by magnetic fields from a trivial non-Hermitian system that does not experience any skin effect at zero field. These properties are intimately related to to the persistence and emergence of topological line gaps in the complex energy spectrum in the presence of magnetic fields. Moreover, we show that a magnetic field can drive a non-Hermitian system from a hybrid skin effect, where the first-order skin effect and SOSE coexist, to pure SOSE. Our results describe a qualitatively new magnetic field behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect.},

First, on the CrO 2 -terminated polar surface we detect a gaplike feature both below and above the Néel temperature. The dynamical mean-field theory calculations indicate that this gap is opened due to the strong correlations of Cr − 3 d electrons, suggesting the hidden Mott nature of the gap. Then, we observe two kinds of Pd-terminated polar surfaces. One is a well-ordered Pd surface with the Fermi-surface-nesting-induced incommensurate charge modulation, while the other one is a reconstructed Pd surface with the individual nanoscale nonperiodic domain structures. On the well-ordered Pd surface, the interference between the incommensurate charge modulation and the atomic lattice forms the periodic moiré pattern. Our results provide important microscopic information for fully understanding the correlated electronic properties of this class of materials.},

Here we present magnetization measurements in graphene monolayers aligned on hexagonal boron nitride crystals.

  abstract     = {We study the kinematics and dynamics of a highly compliant membrane disk placed head-on in a uniform flow. With increasing flow velocity, the membrane deforms nonlinearly into increasingly parachutelike shapes. These aerodynamically elongated materials exhibit a modified drag law, which is linked to the elastohydrodynamic interactions. We predict the unsteady structural response of the membranes using a nonlinear, aeroelastic model—in excellent agreement with experimental measurements of deformations and force fluctuations. With simultaneous membrane interface tracking, force measurements and flow tracing, we reveal that a peculiar skewness in the membrane’s oscillations triggers turbulence production in the wake, thereby modulating the drag. The present work provides a demonstration of the complex interplay between soft materials and fluid turbulence, leading to new, emergent system properties.},

The interaction between an evanescent wave propagating at the interface of two immiscible fluids and an isolated droplet is considered. The elliptical motion of the fluid supporting the incident wave is associated with a simple state of spin angular momentum, a quantity recently introduced for acoustic waves in the literature. We experimentally observe that this field predominantly forces a directional wave transport circling the droplet’s interior, revealing the existence of confined phase singularities. The circulation of the phase, around a singular point, is characteristic of angular momentum in its orbital form, thereby demonstrating the conversion mechanism. The numerical and experimental observations presented in this Letter have implications for the fundamental understanding of the angular momentum of acoustic waves, and for applications such as particle manipulation with radiation forces or torques, acoustic sensing and imaging.},

We show that the model, which we dub nonreciprocal Dicke model, exhibits a discrete parity-time ( P T ) symmetry and we characterize the emergence of a nonstationary phase, so far explained in terms of dissipation-induced instability, as spontaneous breaking of P T symmetry. We further show that such P T symmetry breaking embodies an instance of a nonreciprocal phase transition, a concept recently introduced by Fruchart et al. [ Nature (London) 592 , 363 (2021) ]. Remarkably, the phase transition in our model does not necessitate the presence of any underlying broken symmetry or exceptional points in the spectrum, both believed to be essential requirements for nonreciprocal phase transitions. Our results establish driven-dissipative light-matter systems as a new avenue for exploring nonreciprocal phase transitions and contribute to the theory of nonreciprocal collective phenomena.},

Here we report an experimental demonstration of the SPT featuring the emergence of a highly nonclassical photonic field, realized with a resonator coupled to a superconducting qubit, implementing the quantum Rabi model. We fully characterize the light-matter state by Wigner matrix tomography.

The sensitivity of the electric quadrupole hyperfine structure to both the variation of the quark mass and the effects of dark matter exceeds that of the magnetic hyperfine structure by 1–2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, the measurement of the variation of the ratio of the electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole hyperfine constants is proposed.

  abstract     = {When a charged particle penetrates through an optical interface, photon emissions emerge—a phenomenon known as transition radiation. Being paramount to fundamental physics, transition radiation has enabled many applications from high-energy particle identification to novel light sources. A rule of thumb in transition radiation is that the radiation intensity generally decreases with the decrease of particle velocity v ; as a result, low-energy particles are not favored in practice. Here, we find that there exist situations where transition radiation from particles with extremely low velocities (e.g., v / c &lt; 10 − 3 ) exhibits comparable intensity as that from high-energy particles (e.g., v / c = 0.9 9 9 ), where c is the light speed in free space. The comparable radiation intensity implies an extremely high photon extraction efficiency from low-energy particles, up to 8 orders of magnitude larger than that from high-energy particles. This exotic phenomenon of low-velocity-favored transition radiation originates from the interference of the excited Ferrell-Berreman modes in an ultrathin epsilon-near-zero slab. Our findings may provide a promising route toward the design of integrated light sources based on low-energy electrons and specialized detectors for beyond-standard-model particles.},

The decay of nuclei excited by the inelastic scattering of DM is an unexploited channel which has significantly better sensitivity than similar searches using the elastic scattering channel. We show that this channel is a powerful probe of DM by demonstrating sensitivity to the thermal relic abundance benchmark in a scalar DM dark-photon portal model. This is achieved through the use of existing data, obtained by the KARMEN experiment over two decades ago, which allow us to set world-leading constraints on this model over a wide mass range. With experimental improvements planned for the future, this technique will be able to probe the thermal relic benchmark for fermionic DM across a wide mass range.},

First-principle considerations in quantum field theory force generalized symmetries to appear in dual pairs. Verifying this prediction helps us find the full set of nontrivial conserved charges—associated, in equal parts, with 2-form and ( D − 2 )-form currents. Their total number is D ( D + 1 ) . We compute the quantum commutators of pairs of dual charges, showing that they are nonvanishing for regions whose boundaries are nontrivially linked with each other and zero otherwise, as expected on general grounds. We also consider general linearized higher-curvature gravities. These propagate, in addition to the usual graviton, a spin-0 mode as well as a massive ghostlike spin-2 mode. When the latter is absent, the theory is unitary and the dual-pairs principle is respected. In particular, we find that the number and types of charges remain the same as for Einstein gravity, and that they correspond to continuous generalizations of the Einsteinian ones.},

  abstract     = {Energy exchange mechanisms have important applications in particle physics, gravity, fluid mechanics, and practically every field in physics. In this Letter we show, both in the frequency and time domain, that energy enhancement is possible for waves scattering off fundamental solitons (time-periodic localized structures of bosonic fields), without the need for rotation nor translational motion. We use two-dimensional Q -balls as a test bed, providing the correct criteria for energy amplification, as well as the respective amplification factors, and we discuss possible instability mechanisms. Our results lend support to the qualitative picture drawn in Saffin et al. [preceding Letter, Q -ball superradiance, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131 , 111601 (2023) .]; however, we show that this enhancement mechanism is not of superradiant type, but instead is a “blueshiftlike” energy exchange between scattering states induced by the background Q -ball, which should occur generically for any time-periodic fundamental soliton. This mechanism does not seem to lead to instabilities.},

Despite the conservation of the particle number in the scattering, the mismatch between the frequencies of the two modes allows for the enhancement of the energy and angular momentum of incident waves. When the Q -ball spins in real space, additional rotational superradiance is also possible, which can further boost the enhancements.

Such signals might be experimentally difficult to observe and probing this instability will be a technical challenge. Here, we investigate the spectral instability of time-independent data. This leads us to study the Regge poles (RPs), the counterparts to the quasinormal modes in the complex angular momentum plane. We present evidence that the RP spectrum is unstable but that not all overtones are affected equally by this instability. In addition, we reveal that behind this spectral instability lies an underlying structure. The RP spectrum is perturbed in such a way that one can still recover stable scattering quantities using the complex angular momentum approach. Overall, the study proposes a novel and complementary approach on the black hole spectral instability phenomena that allows us to reveal a surprising and unexpected mechanism at play that protects scattering quantities from the instability.},

In this Letter we provide the first consistent estimate of such effects in the observed galaxy power spectrum, and discuss their possible degeneracy with local primordial non Gaussianities. We also clarify the physical differences between the two signatures, as revealed by their different sensitivity to the large scale gravitational potential. Our results indicate that, while relativistic effects could easily account for 10\% of the observed power spectrum, the subset of those with a similar scale dependence to a primordial signal can be safely ignored for current galaxy surveys, but it will become relevant for future observational programs.},

As these axions stream away from the neutron star they can resonantly transition into photons, generating a large broadband contribution to the neutron star’s intrinsic radio flux. In this Letter, we develop a comprehensive end-to-end framework to model this process from the initial production of axions to the final detection of radio photons, and derive constraints on the axion-photon coupling, g a γ γ , using observations of 27 nearby pulsars. We study the modeling uncertainty in the sourced axion spectrum by comparing predictions from 2.5 dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with those derived using a semianalytic model; these results show remarkable agreement, leading to constraints on the axion-photon coupling that typically differ by a factor of no more than ∼ 2 . The limits presented here are the strongest to date for axion masses 10 − 8 eV ≲ m a ≲ 10 − 5 eV , and crucially do not rely on the assumption that axions are dark matter.},

Over such long times, cosmic-ray transport can be significantly affected by scatterings with sub-GeV dark matter. Here we point out that this scattering distorts the cosmic-ray spectrum, and the distortion can be indirectly observed by measuring the gamma rays produced by cosmic rays via hadronic collisions. Present gamma-ray data show no sign of such a distortion, leading to stringent bounds on the cross section between protons and dark matter. These are highly complementary with current bounds and have large room for improvement with the future gamma-ray measurements in the 0.1–10 TeV range from the Cherenkov Telescope Array, which can strengthen the limits by as much as 2 orders of magnitude.},

To robustly answer this question, we use a very flexible parametrization for the dark energy equation of state such that every cosmological distance still allowed by data exists within this prior volume. To then answer whether there exists a satisfactory solution to the H 0 tension within this comprehensive parametrization, we constrained the parametric form using different partitions of the Planck cosmic microwave background, SDSS-IV/eBOSS DR16 baryon acoustic oscillation, and Pantheon supernova datasets. When constrained by just the cosmic microwave background dataset, there exists a set of equations of state which yields high H 0 values, but these equations of state are ruled out by the combination of the supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation datasets. In other words, the constraint from the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation, and supernova datasets together does not allow for high H 0 values and converges around an equation of state consistent with a cosmological constant. Thus, since this very flexible parametrization does not offer a solution to the H 0 tension, there can be no solution to the H 0 tension that adds physics at only low redshifts. This is directly related to the expansion history of the Universe and its geometrical properties and would include models beyond those parametrized by w ( z ) .},

Both the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the large-scale structure data from weak lensing, galaxy clustering, and cosmic velocities separately favor growth suppression. When combined, they yield γ = 0.63 3 − 0.024 + 0.025 , excluding γ = 0.55 at a statistical significance of 3.7 σ . The combination of f σ 8 and Planck measurements prefers an even higher growth index of γ = 0.63 9 − 0.025 + 0.024 , corresponding to a 4.2 σ tension with the concordance model. In Planck data, the suppressed growth rate offsets the preference for nonzero curvature and fits the data equally well as the latter model. A higher γ leads to a higher matter fluctuation amplitude S 8 inferred from galaxy clustering and weak lensing measurements, and a lower S 8 from Planck data, effectively resolving the S 8 tension.},

Here we present a simulation scheme for these general dynamical maps, which occur when the underlying system-reservoir model undergoes entangling (and thus non-Markovian) dynamics. Such maps also arise as the inverse of C P maps, which are commonly used in error mitigation. We illustrate our simulation scheme on an IBM quantum processor, demonstrating its ability to recover the initial state of a Lindblad evolution. This paves the way for a novel form of quantum error mitigation. Our scheme only requires one ancilla qubit as an overhead and a small number of one and two qubit gates.

  abstract     = {Protecting coherent quantum dynamics from chaotic environment is key to realizations of fragile many-body phenomena and their applications in quantum technology. We present a general construction that embeds a desired periodic orbit into a family of nonintegrable many-body Hamiltonians, whose dynamics is otherwise chaotic. Our construction is based on time-dependent variational principle that projects quantum dynamics onto a manifold of low-entangled states, and it complements earlier approaches for embedding nonthermal eigenstates, known as quantum many-body scars, into thermalizing spectra. By designing terms that suppress “leakage” of the dynamics outside the variational manifold, we engineer families of Floquet models that host exact scarred dynamics, as we illustrate using a driven Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and a recent experimental realization of scars in a dimerized superconducting qubit chain.},

In other words, Alice can convince Bob that they share an entangled state of arbitrarily high Schmidt number, while Bob can never convince Alice that the state is even simply entangled. In this sense, one-way steering can become unlimited.

Starting from a linear large-scale oscillatory instability—a conserved-Hopf instability—that naturally occurs in many active systems with two conservation laws, we derive a corresponding amplitude equation. It belongs to a hierarchy of such universal equations for the eight types of instabilities in homogeneous isotropic systems resulting from the combination of three features: large-scale vs small-scale instability, stationary vs oscillatory instability, and instability without and with conservation law(s). The derived universal equation generalizes a phenomenological model of considerable recent interest, namely, the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, and may be of a similar relevance for the classification of pattern forming systems as the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.},

We obtain exact analytic expressions for the photoluminescence and we predict new features such as a nontrivial shape of the attractive branch peak related to universal resonant exciton-electron scattering and an associated energy shift from the trion energy. Our theory furthermore allows us to formally unify the two distinct theoretical pictures that have been applied to this system, where we reveal that the predictions of the conventional trion picture correspond to a high-temperature and weak-interaction limit of Fermi-polaron theory. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on doped monolayer MoSe 2 and they provide the foundation for modeling a range of emerging optically active materials such as van der Waals heterostructures.},

The earlier proposal of correlated insulating states at n ± 1 / 3 filling in twisted bilayer graphene and recent experimental observations of insulating states at those fillings strongly suggest that moiré graphene systems provide a new platform to realize time-reversal symmetric fractionalized states. However, the nature of fractional excitations and the effect of quantum fluctuation on the fractional correlated insulating states are unknown. We show that excitations of the fractional correlated insulator phases in the strong coupling limit carry fractional charges and exhibit fractonic restricted mobility. Upon introduction of quantum fluctuations, the resonance of “lemniscate” structured operators drives the system into quantum lemniscate liquid (QLL) or quantum lemniscate solid (QLS). We find an emergent U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) 1-form symmetry unifies distinct motions of the fractionally charged excitations in the strong coupling limit and in the QLL phase, while providing a new mechanism for fractional excitations in two dimensions. We predict emergent Luttinger liquid behavior upon dilute doping in the strong coupling limit due to restricted mobility and discuss implications at a general n ± 1 / 3 filling.},

The gain compensates for the cavity dissipation, but preserves the cavity radiation that mediates the indirect photon-magnon coupling. It thus enables the long-range strong photon-magnon coupling. With full access to traveling waves, we demonstrate a remote control of photon-magnon coupling by modulating the phase and amplitude of traveling waves, rather than reconfiguring subsystems themselves. Our method for realizing long-range strong coupling in cavity magnonics provides a general idea for other physical systems. Our experimental achievements may promote the construction of information networks based on cavity magnonics.},

In particular, it is desirable to have a conceptual tool similar to nonequilibrium spin currents in spintronics to describe the creation and transport of multipole moments. In this context, we present a theory for Cartesian spin magnetic multipole moments of Bloch quasiparticles and their transport based on a general gauge-invariant formula obtained using the wave packet approach. As a concrete example, we point out that the low-energy Hamiltonian of phosphorene subject to a perpendicular electric field has a valley structure that hosts magnetic octupole moments. The magnetic octupole moments can be exhibited by an in-plane electric current and lead to accumulation of staggered spin densities at the corners of a rectangular sample. Our Letter paves the way for systematically seeking and utilizing quasiparticles with higher-order magnetic multipole moments in crystal materials towards the emergence of multipoletronics.},

Since such a process does not change the many-body ground state, the Hall conductance remains fixed. This disconnect with the Hall conductance arises from the replacement of the Hamiltonian, h ( k ) , with G − 1 in the current operator, thereby laying plain why perturbative arguments fail.},

  abstract     = {When a system is swept through a quantum critical point, the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism makes universal predictions for quantities such as the number and energy of excitations produced. This mechanism is now being used to obtain critical exponents on emerging quantum computers and emulators, which in some cases can be compared to matrix product state (MPS) numerical studies. However, the mechanism is modified when the divergence of entanglement entropy required for a faithful description of many quantum critical points is not fully captured by the experiment or classical calculation. In this Letter, we study how low-energy dynamics of quantum systems near criticality are modified by finite entanglement, using conformally invariant critical points described approximately by a MPS as an example. We derive that the effect of finite entanglement on a Kibble-Zurek process is captured by a dimensionless scaling function of the ratio of two length scales, one determined dynamically and one by the entanglement restriction. Numerically we confirm first that dynamics at finite bond dimension χ is independent of the algorithm chosen, then obtain scaling collapses for sweeps in the transverse field Ising model and the three-state Potts model. Our result establishes the precise role played by entanglement in time-dependent critical phenomena and has direct implications for quantum state preparation and classical simulation of quantum states.},

We derive a quantitative description of these dynamics in short-ranged one-dimensional systems using a model of successive many-body resonances. The model explains the decay timescale of mean autocorrelators, the functional form of the decay—a stretched exponential—and relates the value of the stretch exponent to the broad distribution of resonance timescales. The Jacobi method of matrix diagonalization provides numerical access to this distribution, as well as a conceptual framework for our analysis. The resonance model correctly predicts the stretch exponents for several models in the literature. Successive resonances may also underlie slow thermalization in strongly disordered systems in higher dimensions, or with long-range interactions.},

Near the eutectic temperature, T C , the propagation direction of thermal gradient driven motion of eutectic Ge-Pt droplets on Ge(110) is determined by presolidification. Well above T C , the micron-sized droplets move towards the hottest location at the substrate, irrespective of crystalline direction. At 90 K above T C , a strong, unanticipated preference for propagation along the substrate [001] azimuth suddenly emerges, which is attributed to presolidification at the liquid-solid interface. The propagation along [001] is accompanied by a distinct change in shape from compact to elongated along [001].},

The impact of varying bandwidth on the performance of direct-drive DT-layered implosions was studied in targets with different hydrodynamic stability properties. The stability was controlled by changing the shell adiabat from ( α F ≃ 5 ) (more stable) to ( α F ≃ 3.5 ) (less stable). These experiments show that the performance of lower adiabat implosions improves considerably as the bandwidth is raised indicating that further bandwidth increases, beyond the current capabilities of OMEGA, would be greatly beneficial. These results suggest that the future generation of ultra-broadband lasers could enable achieving high convergence and possibly high gains in direct drive ICF.},

  abstract     = {The long-standing puzzle of why two colliding bubbles in an electrolyte solution do not coalesce immediately upon contact is resolved. The water film between the bubbles needs to be drained out first before its rupture, i.e., coalescence. Experiments reveal clearly that the film thinning exhibits a rather sudden slowdown (around 30–50 nm), which is orders of magnitude smaller than similar experiments involving surfactants. A critical step in explaining this phenomenon is to realize that the solute concentration is different in bulk and at the surface. During thinning, this will generate an electrolyte concentration difference in film solution along the interacting region, which in turn causes a Marangoni stress to resist film thinning. We develop a film drainage model that explains the experimentally observed phenomena well. The underlying physical mechanism, that confused the scientific community for decades, is now finally revealed.},

Here, we document an unexpected phenomenon that when a bubble bursts at a viscoelastic surface of a bovine serum albumin solution, a secondary (daughter) bubble is entrapped with no subsequent jet drop ejection, contrary to the counterpart experimentally observed at a Newtonian surface. We show that the strong surface dilatational elastic stress from the viscoelastic surface retards the cavity collapse and efficiently damps out the precursor waves, thus facilitating the dominant wave focusing above the cavity nadir. The onset of daughter bubble entrainment is well predicted by an interfacial elastocapillary number comparing the effects of surface dilatational elasticity and surface tension. Our Letter highlights the important role of surface rheology on free surface flows and may find important implications in bubble dynamics with a contaminated interface exhibiting complex surface rheology.},

We investigate the process experimentally and numerically, and find that the Rayleigth-Plateau instability is able to pinch off the cylinder when its height-to-neck ratio exceeds one. Surfactants are found to attenuate the cylinder and produce multiple droplets at moderate concentrations. For both the pinch-off of the mother drop and the subsequent breakup of the liquid threads in partial coalescence, the neck thinning is initially in the inertial (I) regime and then shifts to the inertial-viscous (IV) regime. An intermediate regime is seen at larger surfactant concentrations, which accelerates the thinning and favours the generation of multiple droplets.},

Here, we introduce a concept of the inverse energy band and explore analytically topological scattering in a waveguide with an array of quantum emitters. We uncover a rich structure of topological phase transitions, symmetric scale-free localization, completely flat bands, and the corresponding dark Wannier states. Although bulk-edge correspondence is partially broken because of radiative decay, we prove analytically that the scale-free localized states are distributed in a single inverse energy band in the topological phase and in two inverse bands in the trivial phase. Surprisingly, the winding number of the scattering textures depends on both the topological phase of inverse subradiant band and the odevity of the cell number. Our Letter uncovers the field of the topological inverse bands, and it brings a novel vision to topological phases in light-matter interactions.},

Both cavity and waveguide QED share the common goal of harnessing and deepening the understanding of light-matter coupling. However, they often rely on very different experimental setups and theoretical descriptions. Here, we experimentally investigate the transition from cavity to waveguide QED with an ensemble of cold atoms that is coupled to a fiber-ring resonator, which contains a nanofiber section. By varying the length of the resonator from a few meters to several tens of meters, we tailor the spectral density of modes of the resonator while remaining in the strong coupling regime. When increasing the resonator length, we observe a continuous transition from the paradigmatic Rabi oscillations of cavity QED to non-Markovian dynamics reminiscent of waveguide QED.},

The anti- PT phase transition controlled by atomic couplings in mirrors indicates the emergence of two degenerate cavity supermodes. Interestingly, a threshold of mirror reflection is identified for realizing strong coherent cavity-atom coupling. This reflection threshold reveals the criterion of atomic mirrors to produce a good cavity. Moreover, cavity quantum electrodynamics with a probe atom shows mirror-tuned properties, including reflection-dependent polaritons formed by the cavity and probe atom.

Here, we show the atom cavity system is universal for quantum optimization with arbitrary connectivity. We consider a single-mode cavity and develop a Raman coupling scheme by which the engineered quantum Hamiltonian for atoms directly encodes number partition problems. The programmability is introduced by placing the atoms at different positions in the cavity with optical tweezers. The number partition problem solution is encoded in the ground state of atomic qubits coupled through a photonic cavity mode, which can be reached by adiabatic quantum computing. We construct an explicit mapping for the 3-SAT and vertex cover problems to be efficiently encoded by the cavity system, which costs linear overhead in the number of atomic qubits. The atom cavity encoding is further extended to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. The encoding protocol is optimal in the cost of atom number scaling with the number of binary degrees of freedom of the computation problem. Our theory implies the atom cavity system is a promising quantum optimization platform searching for practical quantum advantage.},

A narrow-linewidth laser system generating more than 1 W of light in the 420–422 nm range was developed for this purpose. Used as a cold-atom gravity gradiometer, our Raman interferometer attains a stability to differential acceleration measurements of 1 × 10 − 8 g at 1 s and 2 × 10 − 10 g after 2000 s of integration time. When operated on first-order Bragg transitions, the interferometer shows a stability of 6 × 10 − 8 g at 1 s, averaging to 1 × 10 − 9 g after 2000 s of integration time. The instrument sensitivity, currently limited by the noise due to spontaneous emission, can be further improved by increasing the laser power and the detuning from the atomic resonance.

  abstract     = {Skimmed supersonic beams provide intense, cold, collision-free samples of atoms and molecules and are one of the most widely used tools in atomic and molecular laser spectroscopy. High-resolution optical spectra are typically recorded in a perpendicular arrangement of laser and supersonic beams to minimize Doppler broadening. Typical Doppler widths are nevertheless limited to tens of MHz by the residual transverse-velocity distribution in the gas-expansion cones. We present an imaging method to overcome this limitation that exploits the correlation between the positions of the atoms and molecules in the supersonic expansion and their transverse velocities, and thus their Doppler shifts. With the example of spectra of ( 1 s ) ( n p ) P 0 − 2 3 ← ( 1 s ) ( 2 s ) S 1 3 transitions to high Rydberg states of metastable triplet He, we demonstrate the suppression of the residual Doppler broadening and a reduction of the full linewidths at half maximum to only about 1 MHz in the UV. Using a retroreflection arrangement for the laser beam and a cross-correlation method, we determine Doppler-free spectra without any signal loss from the selection, by imaging, of atoms within ultranarrow transverse-velocity classes. As an illustration, we determine the ionization energy of triplet metastable He and confirm the significant discrepancy between recent experimental [G. Clausen et al. , Phys. Rev.

  abstract     = {The absolute scale of the neutrino mass plays a critical role in physics at every scale, from the subatomic to the cosmological. Measurements of the tritium end-point spectrum have provided the most precise direct limit on the neutrino mass scale. In this Letter, we present advances by Project 8 to the cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES) technique culminating in the first frequency-based neutrino mass limit. With only a cm 3 -scale physical detection volume, a limit of m β &lt; 155 eV / c 2 ( 152 eV / c 2 ) is extracted from the background-free measurement of the continuous tritium beta spectrum in a Bayesian (frequentist) analysis. Using Kr 83 m calibration data, a resolution of 1.66 ± 0.19 eV (FWHM) is measured, the detector response model is validated, and the efficiency is characterized over the multi-keV tritium analysis window. These measurements establish the potential of CRES for a high-sensitivity next-generation direct neutrino mass experiment featuring low background and high resolution.},

We find that the measured cross sections in different phase-space regions are sensitive to different nuclear effects. Therefore, they enable the impact of specific nuclear effects on the neutrino-nucleus interaction to be isolated more completely than was possible using previous single-differential cross section measurements. Our results provide precision data to help test and improve neutrino-nucleus interaction models.

Conventional haloscope analyses search for a signal with a narrow bandwidth, as predicted for dark matter, whereas the C a B will be broad. We introduce a novel analysis strategy, which searches for a C a B induced daily modulation in the power measured by the haloscope. Using this, we repurpose data collected to search for dark matter to set a limit on the axion photon coupling of a C a B originating from dark matter cascade decay via a mediator in the 800–995 MHz frequency range. We find that the present sensitivity is limited by fluctuations in the cavity readout as the instrument scans across dark matter masses. Nevertheless, we suggest that these challenges can be surmounted using superconducting qubits as single photon counters, and allow ADMX to operate as a telescope searching for axions emerging from the decay of dark matter. The daily modulation analysis technique we introduce can be deployed for various broadband rf signals, such as other forms of a C a B or even high-frequency gravitational waves.},

They named their conjecture ER = EPR . We present a concrete quantitative model for ER = EPR , in which two spin- 1 / 2 particles in a singlet state are connected by a nontraversable wormhole in asymptotically flat general relativity. In our model, the fermions are described by the charged Dirac equation minimally coupled to gravity. This system has static wormhole solutions. We use these solutions as initial data and numerically evolve them forward in time. Our simulations show that black holes form, which are connected by the wormhole and which render the wormhole nontraversable. We also find that the wormhole throat shrinks, which places the particles in close proximity to one another and suggests an explanation for how the wormhole facilitates the nonlocal communication required by entanglement.},

The echo manifests itself as a coherent modulation of the number of photons spontaneously emitted after a π / 2 X − τ − π Y − τ − π / 2 Φ sequence, dependent on the relative phase Φ . We demonstrate experimentally this detection method using an ensemble of Er 3 + ion spins in a scheelite crystal of CaWO 4 . We use fluorescence-detected echoes to measure the erbium spin coherence time, as well as the echo envelope modulation due to the coupling to the W 183 nuclear spins surrounding each ion.

One area where hopes for an advantage through near-term quantum computers are high is quantum machine learning, where variational quantum learning models based on parametrized quantum circuits are discussed. In this work, we introduce the concept of a classical surrogate, a classical model which can be efficiently obtained from a trained quantum learning model and reproduces its input-output relations. As inference can be performed classically, the existence of a classical surrogate greatly enhances the applicability of a quantum learning strategy. However, the classical surrogate also challenges possible advantages of quantum schemes. As it is possible to directly optimize the Ansatz of the classical surrogate, they create a natural benchmark the quantum model has to outperform. We show that large classes of well-analyzed reuploading models have a classical surrogate. We conducted numerical experiments and found that these quantum models show no advantage in performance or trainability in the problems we analyze. This leaves only generalization capability as a possible point of quantum advantage and emphasizes the dire need for a better understanding of inductive biases of quantum learning models.},

Using the electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as sensors, we leverage the on-site nitrogen nuclear spins of the NV centers as memory qubits, in combination with homogeneous and stable bias and control fields, ensuring that all of the ∼ 10 9 two-qubit sensors are sufficiently identical to permit global control of the NV ensemble spin states. We find quantum logic sensitivity enhancement for multiple measurement protocols with varying optimal sensing intervals, including XY8 and DROID-60 dynamical decoupling, as well as correlation spectroscopy, using an applied ac magnetic field signal. The results are independent of the nature of the target signal and broadly applicable to measurements using NV centers and other solid-state spin ensembles.

The dynamics is shown to be governed by a pair of coupled continuity equations identical to inhomogeneous Dirac–Bogoliubov–de Gennes equations with a local gap and solved by analytical means. We obtain their exact Green’s functions and scattering matrix using a Magnus expansion, which generalize previous results for conformal interfaces and quantum wires coupled to leads. Our results explicitly describe the late-time evolution following quantum quenches, including inhomogeneous interaction quenches, and Andreev reflections between coupled quantum Hall edges, revealing remarkably universal dependence on details at stationarity or at late times out of equilibrium.},

We establish a non-Hermitian perturbation theory based on constructing a biorthogonal complete basis and further identify the optimal condition to obtain the maximally entangled state. Our study of speeding up entanglement generation in non-Hermitian quantum systems opens new avenues for harnessing coherent nonunitary dissipation for quantum technologies.},

Here we consider this effect on ring networks, and show that the underlying quantum strategy can be partially characterized, or self-tested, from observed correlations. Applying these results to the triangle network allows us to show that the nonlocal distribution of Renou et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 123 , 140401 (2019) ] requires that (i) all sources produce a minimal amount of entanglement, (ii) all local measurements are entangled, and (iii) each local outcome features a minimal entropy.

Here we combine the physics of thin elastic plates with feedback control theory to explore how a leaf can remain flat while growing. We investigate both in-plane (metric) and out-of-plane (curvature) growth variation and account for both local and nonlocal feedback laws. We show that a linearized feedback theory that accounts for both spatially nonlocal and temporally delayed effects suffices to suppress long wavelength fluctuations effectively and explains recently observed statistical features of growth in tobacco leaves. Our work provides a framework for understanding the regulation of the shape of leaves and other leaflike laminar objects.},

As packing fraction increases, the packing structure transforms from a nematic loose packing to a dense packing with randomly oriented stacks.

On one side, the obstacle eases the destruction of weak arches, a phenomenon that can be explained by the pressure screening that it causes in the outlet proximities. But on the other side, we discover that the obstacle presence leads to the development of a few very strong arches. These arches, which dominate in the heavy tailed distributions of unclogging times, correlate with configurations where the number of particles contacting the obstacle from below are higher than the average; hence suggesting that the obstacle acts as an anchoring point for the granular packing. This finding may help one to understand the ambiguous effect of obstacles in the bottleneck flow of other systems, such as pedestrians evacuating a room or active matter in general.},

Solitons have recently been observed in thin films of liquid crystals (LCs) in the presence of ac electric fields, where localized LC director distortions arise and propagate due to flexoelectric polarization. Here we report that collisions between LC solitons and interfaces to isotropic fluids can generate a range of interfacial hydrodynamic phenomena. We find that single solitons can either generate single droplets or, alternatively, form jets of LC that subsequently break up into organized assemblies of droplets. We show that the influence of key parameters, such as electric field strength, LC film thickness, and LC-oil interfacial tension, map onto a universal state diagram that characterizes the transduction of soliton flexoelectric energy into droplet interfacial energy. Overall, we reveal that solitons in LCs can be used to focus the energy of nonlocalized electric fields to generate a new class of nonlinear electrohydrodynamic effects at fluid interfaces, including jetting and emulsification.},

Optimizing the trade-off yields time-entropy bounds that put speed limits on thermalization schemes. We further show how optimization expands the possibilities for accelerating Brownian thermalization down to its fundamental limits.

Such inhomogeneous strains build up spontaneously in the devices due to process and cool down stress. We discuss spin qubits in Ge / GeSi heterostructures as an illustration. We highlight that Rabi frequencies can be enhanced by 1 order of magnitude by shear strain gradients as small as 3 × 10 − 6 nm − 1 within the dots. This underlines that spins in solids can be very sensitive to strains and opens the way for strain engineering in hole spin devices for quantum information and spintronics.},

Strain induced modifications to these states lead to the emergence of different classes of nodal rings with qualitatively different physical properties. Here we study optical response and the electromagnetic wave propagation in type I nodal ring semimetals, in which the low-energy quasiparticle dispersion is parabolic in momentum k x and k y and is linear in k z . This leads to a highly anisotropic dielectric permittivity tensor in which the optical response is plasmonic in one spatial direction and dielectric in the other two directions. The resulting normal modes (polaritons) in the bulk material become hyperbolic over a broad frequency range, which is furthermore tunable by the doping level. The propagation, reflection, and polarization properties of the hyperbolic polaritons not only provide valuable information about the electronic structure of these fascinating materials in the most interesting region near the nodal rings but also pave the way to tunable hyperbolic materials with applications ranging from anomalous refraction and waveguiding to perfect absorption in ultrathin subwavelength films.},

Herein, we show first-principles evidence that multilayer graphene with N &gt; 3 can all be ferroelectric, where the polarizations of polar states stem from the symmetry breaking in stacking configurations of across layer instead of adjacent layer, which are electrically switchable via interlayer sliding. The nonpolar states can also be electrically driven to polar states via sliding, and more diverse states with distinct polarizations will emerge in more layers. In contrast to the ferroelectric moiré domains with opposite polarization directions in twisted bilayers reported previously, the moiré pattern in some multilayer graphene systems (e.g., twisted monolayer-trilayer graphene) possess nonzero net polarizations with domains of the same direction separated by nonpolar regions, which can be electrically reversed upon interlayer sliding. The distinct moiré bands of two polar states should facilitate electrical detection of such sliding moiré ferroelectricity during switching.},

Here, we will propose a simple, experimentally feasible setup based on periodically strained graphene that reproduces several key aspects of twisted moiré heterostructures—but without introducing a twist. We consider a monolayer graphene sheet subject to a C 2 -breaking periodic strain-induced pseudomagnetic field with period L M ≫ a , along with a scalar potential of the same period. This system has almost ideal flat bands with valley-resolved Chern number ± 1 , where the deviation from ideal band geometry is analytically controlled and exponentially small in the dimensionless ratio ( L M / l B ) 2 , where l B is the magnetic length corresponding to the maximum value of the pseudomagnetic field. Moreover, the scalar potential can tune the bandwidth far below the Coulomb scale, making this a very promising platform for strongly interacting topological phases. Using a combination of strong-coupling theory and self-consistent Hartree-Fock, we find quantum anomalous Hall states at integer fillings. At fractional filling, exact diagonaliztion reveals a fractional Chern insulator at parameters in the experimentally feasible range. Overall, we find that this system has larger interaction-induced gaps, smaller quasiparticle dispersion, and enhanced tunability compared to twisted graphene systems, even in their ideal limit.},

Here, we report the interference of paired electrons employing “interface edge modes.” These modes are born at the interface between the bulk of the Fabry-Perot interferometer and an outer gated region tuned to a lower filling factor. Such a configuration allows toggling the spin and the orbital of the Landau level of the edge modes at the interface. We find that electron pairing occurs only when the two modes (the interfering outer and the first inner) belong to the same spinless Landau level.},

While classical theories suggest an exothermic nature, experiments revealed that it can be endothermic, depending on the polarization and electrolyte. Here, we perform constant-potential molecular dynamics simulations and develop a lattice gas model to explore the reversible heat of EDL formation in aqueous and ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes. Our Letter reveals that EDL formation in aqueous electrolytes exhibits endothermicity under negative polarization; it shows new complexity of endothermicity followed by exothermicity in ILs, regardless of electrode polarity. These thermal behaviors are determined by the structural evolution during EDL formation, dominated by adsorbed solvent molecules rather than ions in aqueous electrolytes but governed by “demixing” and “vacancy occupation” phenomena in ILs. This Letter provides new insights into the reversible heat of supercapacitors and presents a theoretical approach to investigating thermal behaviors involving the dynamics of EDLs.},

So far, no self-consistent kinetic simulation has reported nonthermal tails at quasiperpendicular shocks. Unlike 2D simulations, 3D runs show that protons develop a nonthermal tail spontaneously (i.e., from the thermal bath and without preexisting magnetic turbulence). They are rapidly accelerated via shock drift acceleration up to a maximum energy determined by their escape upstream. We discuss the implications of our results for the phenomenology of heliospheric shocks, supernova remnants, and radio supernovae.},

An essential finding is that this mechanism works solely under a linear relation between the MI gain and a vanishingly small wavenumber of the modulational perturbation. The same mechanism leads to the creation of RWs by MI in other multicomponent systems—in particular, in the massive Thirring model.},

We report the first demonstration of CRAs laser trapping in a programmable array of optical bottle beams. We observe the decay of a trapped rubidium circular level over 5 ms using a novel optical detection method. This first optical detection of alkali CRAs is both spatially and level selective. We finally observe the mechanical oscillations of the CRAs in the traps. This work opens the route to the use of circular levels in quantum devices.

State-dependent operations are realized by exploiting electrostatic dipolar interactions that emerge, when two atoms are simultaneously excited to high-lying electronic states, so-called Rydberg states. These interactions also lead to state-dependent mechanical forces, which couple the electronic dynamics of the atoms to their vibrational motion. We explore these vibronic couplings within an artificial molecular system in which Rydberg states are excited under so-called facilitation conditions. This system, which is not necessarily self-bound, undergoes a structural transition between an equilateral triangle and an equal-weighted superposition of distorted triangular states (Jahn-Teller regime) exhibiting spin-phonon entanglement on a micrometer distance. This highlights the potential of Rydberg tweezer arrays for the study of molecular phenomena at exaggerated length scales.},

The numerically dominant penguin amplitude arises from the soft-gluon radiation off the light up-quark loop rather than the counterpart charm-loop effect. Importantly, the long-distance up-quark penguin contribution brings about the substantial cancellation of the known factorizable power correction, thus enabling B d , s → γ γ to become new benchmark probes of physics beyond the standard model.},

We show that nondetection of gravitational waves from mergers of such low-mass black holes can constrain the interactions of nonannihilating dark matter particles with nucleons. We find benchmark constraints with LIGO O3 data, viz., σ χ n ≥ O ( 10 − 47 ) cm 2 for bosonic DM with m χ ∼ PeV (or m χ ∼ GeV , if they can Bose-condense) and ≥ O ( 10 − 46 ) cm 2 for fermionic DM with m χ ∼ 10 3 PeV . These bounds depend on the priors on DM parameters and on the currently uncertain binary neutron star merger rate density. However, with increased exposure by the end of this decade, LIGO will probe cross sections that are many orders of magnitude below the neutrino floor and completely test the dark matter solution to missing pulsars in the Galactic center, demonstrating a windfall science case for gravitational wave detectors as probes of particle dark matter.},

We reconsider this problem in the setting of the standard model extended by gauged baryon minus lepton number, which we spontaneously break by a scalar with charge six. Cosmic strings from this breaking can support interactions converting three protons into three positrons, and we argue that an “electric”-“magnetic” interplay can give this process an amplified, strong-scale cross section in an analog of the Callan-Rubakov effect. We suggest such cosmic strings have disintegrated O ( 1 ) of the primordial lithium nuclei, and lay out what is necessary for this scheme to succeed. To our knowledge this is the first new physics mechanism with microphysical justification for the abundance of lithium uniquely to be modified after big bang nucleosynthesis.},

Interactions between polarized neutrons ( n ) and unpolarized nucleons ( N ) occur in three forms: g S N g P n σ · r , g V N g A n σ · v , and g A N g A n σ · v × r , where σ is the spin and g ’s are the corresponding coupling constants for scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector vertexes. If such interactions exist, the Sun and Moon could induce sidereal variations of effective fields in laboratories. By analyzing existing data from laboratory measurements on Lorentz and C P T violation, we derive new experimental upper limits on these exotic spin-dependent interactions at astronomical ranges. Our limits on g S N g P n surpass the previous combined astrophysical-laboratory limits, setting the most stringent experimental constraints to date. We also report new constraints on vector-axial-vector and axial-axial-vector interactions at astronomical scales, with vector-axial-vector limits improved by ∼ 12 orders of magnitude. We extend our analysis to Hari Dass interactions and obtain new constraints.},

By assuming that a system Hamiltonian and a system-environment interaction Hamiltonian are extensive in L , we prove that the absolute value of the heat current scales at most as Θ ( L 3 ) in a limit of large L . Furthermore, we present an example of noninteracting particles globally coupled with a thermal bath, for which this bound is saturated in terms of scaling. However, the construction of such a system requires many-body interactions induced by the environment, which may be difficult to realize with the existing technology. To consider more feasible cases, we consider a class of the system where any nondiagonal elements of the noise operator (derived from the system-environment interaction Hamiltonian) become zero in the system energy basis, if the energy difference exceeds a certain value Δ E . Then, for Δ E = Θ ( L 0 ) , we derive another scaling bound Θ ( L 2 ) on the absolute value of the heat current, and the so-called superradiance belongs to a class for which this bound is saturated. Our results are useful for evaluating the best achievable performance of quantum-enhanced thermodynamic devices, including far-reaching applications such as quantum heat engines, quantum refrigerators, and quantum batteries.},

  abstract     = {The fact that quantum mechanics predicts stronger correlations than classical physics is an essential cornerstone of quantum information processing. Indeed, these quantum correlations are a valuable resource for various tasks, such as quantum key distribution or quantum teleportation, but characterizing these correlations in an experimental setting is a formidable task, especially in scenarios where no shared reference frames are available. By definition, quantum correlations are reference-frame independent, i.e., invariant under local transformations; this physically motivated invariance implies, however, a dedicated mathematical structure and, therefore, constitutes a roadblock for an efficient analysis of these correlations in experiments. Here we provide a method to directly measure any locally invariant property of quantum states using locally randomized measurements, and we present a detailed toolbox to analyze these correlations for two quantum bits. We implement these methods experimentally using pairs of entangled photons, characterizing their usefulness for quantum teleportation and their potential to display quantum nonlocality in its simplest form. Our results can be applied to various quantum computing platforms, allowing simple analysis of correlations between arbitrary distant qubits in the architecture.},

However, energy transport by polaritons at shorter separations is reduced due to the metallic response of TDPM stronger than that predicted by the local model. Our experiments conducted for a configuration with a silica sphere and a doped silicon plate coated with an ultrathin layer of platinum as the TDPM show good agreement with the nonlocal near-field radiation theory.

Here, commencing from the 2-by-2 charge density wave phases, we bridge the gap between topological superconductivity and time-reversal asymmetric CFP in kagome systems. Several chiral topological superconductor (TSC) states featuring distinct Chern numbers emerge for an s -wave or a d -wave superconducting pairing symmetry. Importantly, these CFP-based TSC phases possess unique gapless edge modes with mixed chiralities (i.e., both positive and negative chiralities), but with the net chiralities consistent with the Bogoliubov–de Gennes Chern numbers. We further study the transport properties of a two-terminal junction, using Chern insulator or normal metal leads via atomic Green’s function method with Landauer-Büttiker formalism. In both cases, the normal electron tunneling and the crossed Andreev reflection oscillate as the chemical potential changes, but together contribute to plateau transmissions (1 and 3 2 , respectively) that exhibit robustness against disorder. These behaviors can be regarded as the signature of a TSC hosting edge states with mixed chiralities.},

A normal state at a QCP is a non-Fermi liquid with no coherent quasiparticles. A superconducting order gaps out low-energy excitations, except for a sliver of states for non- s -wave gap symmetry, and at a first glance, restores coherent quasiparticle behavior. We argue that this does not necessarily hold as the fermionic self-energy may remain singular above the gap edge. This singularity gives rise to markedly non-BCS behavior of the density of states and to the appearance of a nondispersing mode at the gap edge in the spectral function. We analyze the set of quantum-critical models with an effective dynamical four-fermion interaction V ( Ω ) ∝ 1 / Ω γ , where Ω is a frequency of a boson, which mediates the interaction. We show that coherent quasiparticle behavior in a superconducting state holds for γ &lt; 1 / 2 , but breaks down for larger γ .

  abstract     = {One of the challenging problems related to the liquid-glass transition phenomenon is establishing a link between the character of intermolecular interactions and the behavior of molecular dynamics. Introducing the density scaling concept, according to which dynamic quantities, e.g., viscosity or structural relaxation time ( τ α ) measured at different thermodynamic conditions are expressed as a single universal curve if plotted against ρ γ / T , led to significant progress in solving this problem since the scaling exponent γ defines the steepness of the repulsive part of the intermolecular potential. Herein, we found that relaxation dynamics of van der Waals and H-bonding glass formers, for which the Kirkwood factor ( g K ) is an isomorph-invariant quantity, satisfy an alternative scaling, log τ α vs T ( Δ ϵ s T ) − γ . As a result, the exponent γ is determined from the temperature and pressure evolutions of τ α and dielectric relaxation strength Δ ϵ —both obtained in a single dielectric experiment, which makes the γ coefficient to be accessed in the future for an extensive database of glass-forming liquids.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence are ubiquitous processes important for laboratory, space, and astrophysical plasmas. Reconnection has been suggested to play an important role in the energetics and dynamics of turbulence by observations, simulations, and theory for two decades. The fundamental properties of reconnection at kinetic scales, essential to understanding the general problem of reconnection in magnetized turbulence, remain largely unknown at present. Here, we present an application of the magnetic flux transport method that can accurately identify reconnection in turbulence to a three-dimensional simulation. Contrary to ideas that reconnection in turbulence would be patchy and unpredictable, highly extended reconnection X lines, on the same order of magnitude as the system size, form at kinetic scales. Extended X lines develop through bidirectional reconnection spreading. They satisfy critical balance characteristic of turbulence, which predicts the X -line extent at a given scale. These results present a picture of fundamentally extended reconnection in kinetic-scale turbulence.},

In DIII-D the excitation of these modes is associated with the presence of high-energy runaway electrons (REs), and a strong mode excitation is often associated with the failure of RE plateau formation. In this work we present results of self-consistent kinetic-MHD simulations of RE-driven compressional Alfvén eigenmodes (CAEs) in DIII-D disruption scenarios, providing an explanation of the CQ modes. Simulation results reveal that high energy trapped REs can have resonance with the Alfvén mode through their toroidal precession motion, and the resonance frequency is proportional to the energy of REs. The mode frequencies and their relationship with the RE energy are consistent with experimental observations. The perturbed magnetic fields from the modes can lead to spatial diffusion of REs including the nonresonant passing ones, thus providing the theoretical basis for a potential approach for RE mitigation.},

The transient nature of this state when created in a laboratory, as well as the difficulties in probing the strongly coupled interactions between the electrons and the ions, make it challenging to develop a complete understanding of matter in this regime. In this work, by exciting isolated ∼ 8 nm copper nanoparticles with a femtosecond laser below the ablation threshold, we create uniformly excited WDM. Using photoelectron spectroscopy, we measure the instantaneous electron temperature and extract the electron-ion coupling of the nanoparticle as it undergoes a solid-to-WDM phase transition. By comparing with state-of-the-art theories, we confirm that the superheated nanoparticles lie at the boundary between hot solids and plasmas, with associated strong electron-ion coupling. This is evidenced both by a fast energy loss of electrons to ions, and a strong modulation of the electron temperature induced by strong acoustic breathing modes that change the nanoparticle volume. This work demonstrates a new route for experimental exploration of the exotic properties of WDM.},

Here we report the observation of orientational melting occurring in a two-dimensional crystal of up to 15 ions. We measure density-density correlations to quantitatively characterize the occurrence of melting, and use a Monte Carlo simulation to extract the angular kinetic energy of the ions. By adding a pinning impurity, we demonstrate the nonuniversality of orientational melting and create novel configurations in which localized and delocalized particles coexist. Our system realizes an experimental testbed for studying changes of configurations in two-dimensional mesoscopic systems, and our results pave the way for the study of quantum phenomena in ensembles of delocalized ions.},

In this Letter, we study the ground state phase diagram of a one-dimensional array of individually trapped neutral atoms interacting strongly via Rydberg states, and demonstrate through extensive numerical simulations that it hosts a variety of symmetry-breaking phases and their transitions including DQC. We show how an enlarged, emergent continuous symmetry arises at the DQCs, which can be experimentally observed in the joint distribution of two distinct order parameters, obtained within measurement snapshots in the standard computational basis. Our findings highlight quantum simulators of Rydberg atoms not only as promising platforms to experimentally realize such exotic phenomena, but also as unique ones allowing access to physical properties not obtainable in traditional experiments.},

In this work, we investigate phonon propagation in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate immersed in a degenerate Fermi gas with interspecies scattering length a B F tuned by a Feshbach resonance. We observe sound mode softening with moderate attractive interactions. For even greater attraction, surprisingly, stable sound propagation reemerges and persists across the resonance.

In contrast to previous work, we estimate the effective temperature of the blackbody radiation that shifts the reference transition directly during operation from the corresponding frequency shift and the well-characterized sensitivity to thermal radiation. We measure the clock output frequency against an independent Yb + 171 ion clock, based on the S 2 1 / 2 ( F = 0 ) → F 2 7 / 2 ( F = 3 ) electric octupole (E3) transition, and determine the frequency ratio with a total fractional uncertainty of 2.3 × 10 − 17 . Relying on a previous measurement of the Yb + 171 (E3) clock frequency, we find the absolute frequency of the Sr + 88 clock transition to be 444 779 044 095 485.277(59) Hz. Our result reduces the uncertainty by a factor of 3 compared with the previously most accurate measurement and may help to resolve so far inconsistent determinations of this value. We also show that for three simultaneously interrogated Sr + 88 ions, the increased number causes the expected improvement of the short-term frequency instability of the optical clock without degrading its systematic uncertainty.},

The total system noise temperature is ∼ 0.6 K . The coupling between the cavity and the strong antenna is maintained at β ≃ 2 to enhance the axion search scanning speed. The scan frequency range is from 4.8077 to 4.8181 GHz. No significant indication of the axion dark matter signature is observed. The results set the best upper bound of the axion-photon-photon coupling ( g a γ γ ) in the mass ranges of 19.883 to 19.926 μ eV at ∼ 0.7 × | g a γ γ KSVZ | or ∼ 1.9 × | g a γ γ DFSZ | with 90\% confidence level. The results demonstrate that a reliable search of the high-mass dark matter axions can be achieved beyond the benchmark models using the technology adopted in CAPP18T.},

  abstract     = {Physicists dating back to Feynman have lamented the difficulties of applying the variational principle to quantum field theories. In nonrelativistic quantum field theories, the challenge is to parametrize and optimize over the infinitely many n -particle wave functions comprising the state’s Fock-space representation. Here we approach this problem by introducing neural-network quantum field states , a deep learning ansatz that enables application of the variational principle to nonrelativistic quantum field theories in the continuum. Our ansatz uses the Deep Sets neural network architecture to simultaneously parametrize all of the n -particle wave functions comprising a quantum field state. We employ our ansatz to approximate ground states of various field theories, including an inhomogeneous system and a system with long-range interactions, thus demonstrating a powerful new tool for probing quantum field theories.},

This implies a novel symmetry algebra in self-dual gravity, notably an AdS 4 version of the so-called kinematic algebra. We also obtain the three-point interaction vertex of self-dual gravity in AdS 4 from that of self-dual Yang-Mills by replacing the structure constants of the Lie group with the structure constants of the new kinematic algebra, implying that self-dual gravity in AdS 4 can be derived from self-dual Yang-Mills in this background via a double copy. This provides a concrete starting point for defining the double copy for Einstein gravity in AdS 4 by expanding around the self-dual sector. Moreover, we show that the new kinematic Lie algebra can be lifted to a deformed version of the w 1 + ∞ algebra, which plays a prominent role in celestial holography.},

  abstract     = {Over 10 years ago, Fermi observed an excess of GeV gamma rays from the Galactic Center whose origin is still under debate. One explanation for this excess involves annihilating dark matter, another requires an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars concentrated at the Galactic Center. In this work, we use the results from LIGO and Virgo’s most recent all-sky search for quasimonochromatic, persistent gravitational-wave signals from isolated neutron stars, which is estimated to be about 20\%–50\% of the population, to determine whether unresolved millisecond pulsars could actually explain this excess. First, we choose a luminosity function that determines the number of millisecond pulsars required to explain the observed excess. Then, we consider two models for deformations on millisecond pulsars to determine their ellipticity distributions, which are directly related to their gravitational-wave radiation. Lastly, based on null results from the O3 frequency-Hough all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves, we find that a large set of the parameter space in the pulsar luminosity function can be excluded. We also evaluate how these exclusion regions may change with respect to various model choices. Our results are the first of their kind and represent a bridge between gamma-ray astrophysics, gravitational-wave astronomy, and dark-matter physics.},

They play an important role in understanding non-Hermitian phase transitions in many-body physics, as well as characterizing the corresponding nonunitary criticality. Even though such partition function zeroes have been measured in dynamical experiments where time acts as the imaginary control field, experimentally demonstrating such YLES criticality with a physical imaginary field has remained elusive due to the difficulty of physically realizing non-Hermitian many-body models. We provide a protocol for observing the YLES by detecting kinked dynamical magnetization responses due to broken P T symmetry, thus enabling the physical probing of nonunitary phase transitions in nonequilibrium settings. In particular, scaling analyses based on our nonunitary time evolution circuit with matrix product states accurately recover the exponents uniquely associated with the corresponding nonunitary CFT. We provide an explicit proposal for observing YLES criticality in Floquet quenched Rydberg atomic arrays with laser-induced loss, which paves the way towards a universal platform for simulating non-Hermitian many-body dynamical phenomena.},

In this connection, our analytical result provides necessary condition for producing quantum Mpemba effect in the density matrix elements of the quantum dot, as a combined effect of the remaining relaxation modes.},

By engineering diagonal Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) models, we experimentally demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum. Using Floquet engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy gap’s closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and bulk states. Our results establish a versatile hybrid quantum simulation approach to exploring quantum topological systems in the NISQ era.},

If the signal is a one-dimensional time series, such a goal becomes challenging. A paradigmatic example is the angular diffusion of a rotator immersed in a vibro-fluidized granular gas. Here, we experimentally observe that the rotator’s angular velocity exhibits significant differences with respect to an equilibrium process. Exploiting the presence of two relevant timescales and non-Gaussian velocity increments, we quantify the breakdown of time-reversal asymmetry, which would vanish in the case of a 1D Gaussian process. We deduce a new model for the massive probe, with two linearly coupled variables, incorporating both Gaussian and Poissonian noise, the latter motivated by the rarefied collisions with the granular bath particles. Our model reproduces the experiment in a range of densities, from dilute to moderately dense, with a meaningful dependence of the parameters on the density. We believe the framework proposed here opens the way to a more consistent and meaningful treatment of out-of-equilibrium and dissipative systems.},

The system temperature is shown to change in a broad range from positive to negative values, and the dependence of system characteristics on the initial injected energy is determined.

Thus, the asymmetry of cross-correlations is a fundamental, measurable, and often-used statistical signature of deviation from equilibrium. Here we find a simple and universal inequality that bounds the magnitude of asymmetry by the cycle affinity, i.e., the strength of thermodynamic driving. Our result applies to a large class of systems and all state observables, and it suggests a fundamental thermodynamic cost for various nonequilibrium functions quantified by the asymmetry. It also provides a powerful tool to infer affinity from measured cross-correlations, in a different and complementary way to the thermodynamic uncertainty relations. As an application, we prove a thermodynamic bound on the coherence of noisy oscillations, which was previously conjectured by Barato and Seifert [ Phys. Rev. E 95 , 062409 (2017) ]. We also derive a thermodynamic bound on directed information flow in a biochemical signal transduction model.},

For nearly a century, this phenomenon has been explained by invoking saturation in the dielectric response of the solvent water molecules. Herein, we employ an advanced deep neural network (DNN), built using data from density functional theory, to study the dielectric permittivity of sodium chloride solutions. Notably, the decrease in the dielectric permittivity as a function of concentration, computed using the DNN approach, agrees well with experiments. Detailed analysis of the computations reveals that the dominant effect, caused by the intrusion of ionic hydration shells into the solvent hydrogen-bond network, is the disruption of dipolar correlations among water molecules. Accordingly, the observed decrease in the dielectric permittivity is mostly due to increasing suppression of the collective response of solvent waters.},

Yet in PT -symmetric antiferromagnetic metals, Hall effects from either intrinsic Berry curvature mediated anomalous velocity or the conventional skew-scattering process individually vanish. Here we reveal an unexpected nonlinear Hall effect that relies on both Berry curvature and skew-scattering working in cooperation. This anomalous skew-scattering nonlinear Hall effect (ASN) is PT even and dominates the low-frequency nonlinear Hall effect for PT -symmetric antiferromagnetic metals. Surprisingly, we find that in addition to its Hall response, ASN produces helicity dependent photocurrents, in contrast to other known PT -even nonlinearities in metals that are helicity blind. This characteristic enables us to isolate ASN and establishes new photocurrent tools to interrogate the antiferromagnetic order of PT -symmetric metals.},

In generic lattices of 2D and beyond, however, we found that non-Hermitian couplings do not merely distort the Brillouin zone (BZ), but can in fact alter its effective dimensionality. This is due to the fundamental noncommutativity of multidimensional non-Hermitian pumping, which obstructs the usual formation of a generalized complex BZ. As such, basis states are forced to assume “entangled” profiles that are orthogonal in a lower dimensional effective BZ, completely divorced from any vestige of lattice Bloch states unlike conventional skin states. Characterizing this reduced dimensionality is an emergent winding number intimately related to the homotopy of noncontractible spectral paths. We illustrate this dimensional transmutation through a 2D model whose topological zero modes are protected by a 1D, not 2D, topological invariant. Our findings can be readily demonstrated via the bulk properties of nonreciprocally coupled platforms such as circuit arrays, and provokes us to rethink the fundamental role of geometric obstruction in the dimensional classification of topological states.},

Moreover, at millikelvin temperatures significant mesoscopic fluctuations are developed as a function of the electron energy. Here we report the results of an experimental study of the transport in a HgTe quantum well with an inverted energy spectrum that reveal a multifractality of the conductance fluctuations in the helical edge state dominated transport regime. We attribute observed multifractality to mesoscopic fluctuations of the electron wave function or local density of states at the spin quantum Hall transition.

We show that despite having no net magnetization and a band structure qualitatively different from ferromagnets and from conventional antiferromagnets without spin-split bands, altermagnets induce 0 − π oscillations. The decay length and oscillation period of the Josephson coupling are qualitatively different from ferromagnetic junctions and depend on the crystallographic orientation of the altermagnet. The Josephson effect in altermagnets thus serves a dual purpose: it acts as a signature that distinguishes altermagnetism from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism and offers a way to control the supercurrent via flow direction anisotropy.},

Using quasiclassical Green’s functions, we study the proximity effect and critical temperature in diffusive superconductor-metallic antiferromagnet bilayers. The nonmagnetic impurities acquire an effective magnetic component in the antiferromagnet.

  abstract     = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices form a competitive candidate for quantum computation owing to the excellent coherence properties, the highly parallel operations over spins, and the ultralow entropy achieved in qubit arrays. For this, a massive number of parallel entangled atom pairs have been realized in superlattices. However, the more formidable challenge is to scale up and detect multipartite entanglement, the basic resource for quantum computation, due to the lack of manipulations over local atomic spins in retroreflected bichromatic superlattices. In this Letter, we realize the functional building blocks in quantum-gate-based architecture by developing a cross-angle spin-dependent optical superlattice for implementing layers of quantum gates over moderately separated atoms incorporated with a quantum gas microscope for single-atom manipulation and detection. Bell states with a fidelity of 95.6(5)\% and a lifetime of 2.20 ± 0.13 s are prepared in parallel, and then connected to multipartite entangled states of one-dimensional ten-atom chains and two-dimensional plaquettes of 2 × 4 atoms. The multipartite entanglement is further verified with full bipartite nonseparability criteria. This offers a new platform toward scalable quantum computation and simulation.},

  abstract     = {Discrimination of entangled states is an important element of quantum-enhanced metrology. This typically requires low-noise detection technology. Such a challenge can be circumvented by introducing nonlinear readout process. Traditionally, this is realized by reversing the very dynamics that generates the entangled state, which requires a full control over the system evolution. In this Letter, we present nonlinear readout of highly entangled states by employing reinforcement learning to manipulate the spin-mixing dynamics in a spin-1 atomic condensate. The reinforcement learning found results in driving the system toward an unstable fixed point, whereby the (to be sensed) phase perturbation is amplified by the subsequent spin-mixing dynamics. Working with a condensate of 10 900 Rb 87 atoms, we achieve a metrological gain of 6.97 − 1.38 + 1.30 dB beyond the classical precision limit. Our work will open up new possibilities in unlocking the full potential of entanglement caused quantum enhancement in experiments.},

  abstract     = {Jet quenching is the process of color-charged partons losing energy via interactions with quark-gluon plasma droplets created in heavy-ion collisions. The collective expansion of such droplets is well described by viscous hydrodynamics. Similar evidence of collectivity is consistently observed in smaller collision systems, including p p and p + Pb collisions. In contrast, while jet quenching is observed in Pb + Pb collisions, no evidence has been found in these small systems to date, raising fundamental questions about the nature of the system created in these collisions. The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider has measured the yield of charged hadrons correlated with reconstructed jets in 0.36 nb − 1 of p + Pb and 3.6 pb − 1 of p p collisions at 5.02 TeV. The yields of charged hadrons with p T ch &gt; 0.5 GeV near and opposite in azimuth to jets with p T jet &gt; 30 or 60 GeV, and the ratios of these yields between p + Pb and p p collisions, I p Pb , are reported. The collision centrality of p + Pb events is categorized by the energy deposited by forward neutrons from the struck nucleus. The I p Pb values are consistent with unity within a few percent for hadrons with p T ch &gt; 4 GeV at all centralities. These data provide new, strong constraints that preclude almost any parton energy loss in central p + Pb collisions.},

A thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy electronic spin ensemble in diamond is utilized as both the solid-state spin quantum sensor and the polarized electron source, and a vibrating lead sphere serves as the moving unpolarized nucleon source. The exotic interaction is searched by detecting the possible effective magnetic field induced by the moving unpolarized nucleon source using the ensemble-NV-diamond magnetometer. Our result establishes new bounds for the coupling parameter f ⊥ within the force range from 5 to 400 μ m . The upper limit of the coupling parameter at 100 μ m is | f ⊥ | ≤ 1.1 × 10 − 11 , which is 3 orders of magnitude more stringent than the previous constraint.

We show that ν SI make neutrinos form a tightly coupled fluid that expands under relativistic hydrodynamics. The outflow becomes either a burst or a steady-state wind; which occurs here is uncertain. Though the diffusive environment where neutrinos are produced may make a wind more likely, further work is needed to determine when each case is realized. In the burst-outflow case, ν SI increase the duration of the neutrino signal, and even a simple analysis of SN 1987A data has powerful sensitivity. For the wind-outflow case, we outline several promising ideas that may lead to new observables.

We find no robust evidence of γ -ray emission, and set upper limits of ∼ 10 − 9 GeV cm − 2 s − 1 on the Jovian γ -ray flux. We point out that Jupiter is an advantageous dark matter (DM) target due to its large surface area (compared with other solar system planets), and cool core temperature (compared with the Sun). These properties allow Jupiter to both capture and retain lighter DM, providing a complementary probe of sub-GeV DM. We therefore identify and perform a new search for DM-sourced γ -rays in Jupiter, where DM annihilates to long-lived particles, which can escape the Jovian surface and decay into γ rays. We consequently constrain DM-proton scattering cross sections as low as about 10 − 40 cm 2 , showing Jupiter is up to 10 orders of magnitude more sensitive than direct detection. This sensitivity is reached under the assumption that the mediator decay length is sufficient to escape Jupiter, and the equilibrium between DM capture and annihilation; sensitivities can be lower depending on the DM model.

Here we bound the energetic cost of transmitting information through these physical channels, in k B T / bit , as a function of the size of the sender and receiver, their spatial separation, and the communication latency. These calculations provide an estimate for the energy costs associated with information processing arising from the physical constraints of the cellular environment, which we find to be many orders of magnitude larger than unity in natural units. From these calculations, we construct a phase diagram indicating where each strategy is most efficient. Our results suggest that intracellular information transfer may constitute a substantial energetic cost. This provides a new tool for understanding tradeoffs in cellular network function.},

As applications of the model, we study the rheological responses of XLCEs in three cases: stress relaxation, strain ramp, and creep compliance, where the materials show interesting rheology as an interplay between the dynamic nematic order of the mesogenic units, the elasticity from the network structure, and the dissipation due to chain exchange reactions.

The iMODE method learns metaknowledge, the functional variations of the force field of dynamical system instances without knowing the physical parameters, by adopting a bilevel optimization framework: an outer level capturing the common force field form among studied dynamical system instances and an inner level adapting to individual system instances. A priori physical knowledge can be conveniently embedded in the neural network architecture as inductive bias, such as conservative force field and Euclidean symmetry. With the learned metaknowledge, iMODE can model an unseen system within seconds, and inversely reveal knowledge on the physical parameters of a system, or as a neural gauge to “measure” the physical parameters of an unseen system with observed trajectories. iMODE can be generally applied to a dynamical system of an arbitrary type or number of physical parameters and is validated on bistable, double pendulum, Van der Pol, Slinky, and reaction-diffusion systems.},

We experimentally realize a cavity-electromechanical device using a superconducting waveguide cavity and a mechanical resonator. In the presence of a strong pump, the mechanical-polaritons splitting can nearly reach 81\% of the mechanical frequency, overwhelming all the dissipation rates. Approaching the USC limit, the steady-state response becomes unstable. We systematically measure the boundary of the unstable response while varying the pump parameters. The unstable dynamics display rich phases, such as self-induced oscillations, period-doubling bifurcation, and period-tripling oscillations, ultimately leading to the chaotic behavior. The experimental results and their theoretical modeling suggest the importance of residual nonlinear interaction terms in the weak-dissipative regime.},

In this Letter, we use spin-lattice dynamics simulation to examine the lattice contribution to the magnetocaloric entropy change in bcc iron (Fe) and hcp gadolinium (Gd) with exchange interaction parameters determined from ab initio calculations. We find that indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interaction in hcp Gd leads to longer-range spin-lattice coupling and more strongly influences the low-frequency long-wavelength phonons. This results in a higher lattice contribution toward the total magnetocaloric entropy change as compared to bcc Fe with short-range direct exchange interactions. Our analysis provides a framework for understanding the magnetocaloric effect in magnetic materials with strong spin-lattice couplings. Our finding suggests that long-range indirect RKKY-type exchange gives rise to a larger lattice contribution to the magnetocaloric entropy change and is, thus, beneficial for magnetocaloric materials.},

In films of finite thickness or in three-dimensional bulk samples the skyrmions extend in the third direction forming a string. We demonstrate that a spin current flowing longitudinally along the skyrmion string instead induces a Goldstone spin wave instability. Our analytical results are confirmed by micromagnetic simulations of both a single string as well as string lattices, suggesting that the instability eventually breaks the strings. A longitudinal current is thus able to melt the skyrmion string lattice via a nonequilibrium phase transition. For films of finite thickness or in the presence of disorder a threshold current will be required, and we estimate the latter assuming weak collective pinning.},

Till now, the reversal of the magnetization of such systems at zero kelvin required making use of quantum tunneling with a significant transverse field or transverse anisotropy term, at resonance. Here, we show that another very simple method exists. It simply consists in the application of a particular sequence of electromagnetic radiations in the ranges of optical or microwave frequencies, depending on the characteristics of the system (spin and anisotropy values for magnetic systems). This produces oscillations of the Rabi type that pass above the barrier, thus extending these oscillations between the two energy wells with mixtures of all the 2 S + 1 states.

Moreover, the chiral symmetry assures that its surface-confining states pin to zero energy, i.e., they reside midgap in the energy dispersion. Symmetry is also an attribute related to artificial media that are subject to parity P and time-reversal T operations. This non-Hermitian family has been thoroughly nourished in a wave-based context, where anti- P T ( A P T ) symmetric systems are the youngest belonging members, permitting refractionless optics, inverse P T -symmetry breaking transition, and asymmetric mode switching. Here, we report the first extension of A P T symmetry in an acoustic setting by endowing a SSH lattice with gain and loss components. We show that the in-gap topological defect state hinges on the non-Hermitian phase, in that the broken symmetry suppresses it, yet when P T or A P T symmetry is intact, it is observed with either damped or evanescent decay, respectively. Our experiments showcase how the non-Hermitian SSH lattice serves as a utile platform to investigate topological properties across various P T symmetric phases using sound.},

Our results reveal efficient chiroptical control of bright excitons’ hidden spin polarization. Following optical photoexcitation, intervalley scattering between nonequivalent K − K ′ valleys leads to a decay of bright excitons’ hidden spin polarization.

We find that the strong coherent lattice vibration along the longitudinal acoustic phonon mode [ L A ( M ) ] can drastically promote K -to- Q transition on a timescale of ∼ 400 fs , comparable with previous experimental observation on thermal-phonon-mediated electron dynamics. Further, this coherent-phonon-driven intervalley scattering occurs in an unconventional steplike manner and further induces an electronic Rabi oscillation. By constructing a two-level model and quantitatively comparing with ab initio dynamic simulations, we uncover the critical role of nonadiabatic coupling effects. Finally, a new strategy is proposed to effectively tune the intervalley scattering rates by varying the coherent phonon amplitude, which could be realized via light-induced nonlinear phononics that we hope will spark experimental investigation.},

This leads to reacting plasmas that reach peak fusion production at later times with increased size, temperature, mass and with lower emission weighted areal densities. Analytic models are consistent with the observations and inferences for how these quantities evolve as the rate of fusion self-heating, fusion yield, and target gain increase. At peak fusion production, it is found that as temperatures and target gains rise, the expansion power loss increases to a near constant ratio of the fusion self-heating power.

  abstract     = {Spontaneous stochasticity is a modern paradigm for turbulent transport at infinite Reynolds numbers. It suggests that tracer particles advected by rough turbulent flows and subject to additional thermal noise, remain nondeterministic in the limit where the random input, namely, the thermal noise, vanishes. Here, we investigate the fate of spontaneous stochasticity in the presence of spatial intermittency, with multifractal scaling of the lognormal type, as usually encountered in turbulence studies. In principle, multifractality enhances the underlying roughness, and should also favor the spontaneous stochasticity. This letter exhibits a case with a less intuitive interplay between spontaneous stochasticity and spatial intermittency. We specifically address Lagrangian transport in unidimensional multifractal random flows, obtained by decorating rough Markovian monofractal Gaussian fields with frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos. Combining systematic Monte Carlo simulations and formal stochastic calculations, we evidence a transition between spontaneously stochastic and deterministic behaviors when increasing the level of intermittency. While its key ingredient in the Gaussian setting, roughness here surprisingly conspires against the spontaneous stochasticity of trajectories.},

  abstract     = {The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) [D. Pierangeli et al. , Large-Scale Photonic Ising Machine by Spatial Light Modulation, Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 , 213902 (2019) .] is a promising optical architecture utilizing spatial light modulation for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems efficiently. The primitive version of the SPIM, however, can accommodate Ising problems with only rank-one interaction matrices. In this Letter, we propose a new computing model for the SPIM that can accommodate any Ising problem without changing its optical implementation. The proposed model is particularly efficient for Ising problems with low-rank interaction matrices, such as knapsack problems. Moreover, it acquires the learning ability of Boltzmann machines. We demonstrate that learning, classification, and sampling of the MNIST handwritten digit images are achieved efficiently using the model with low-rank interactions. Thus, the proposed model exhibits higher practical applicability to various problems of combinatorial optimization and statistical learning, without losing the scalability inherent in the SPIM architecture.},

There is a plethora of techniques that reveal entanglement on the basis of only partial information about the underlying quantum state, including entanglement witnesses. Superradiance refers to the phenomenon of highly synchronized photon emission from an ensemble of quantum emitters that is caused by correlations among the individual particles and has been connected by Dicke himself to the presence of multipartite entangled states. We investigate this connection in a quantitative way and discuss whether or not signatures of superradiance from semiconductor nanolasers, manifesting themselves as a modification of the spontaneous-emission time, can be interpreted as a witness to detect entanglement in the underlying state of the emitters.},

Amplification strategies based on time-reversed coherent spin-squeezing dynamics have been devised to mitigate this issue, but are unfortunately very sensitive to dissipation, requiring a large single-spin cooperativity to be effective. Here, we propose a new dissipative protocol that combines amplification and squeezed fluctuations. It enables the use of entangled spin states for sensing well beyond the SQL even in the presence of significant readout noise. Further, it has a strong resilience against undesired single-spin dissipation, requiring only a large collective cooperativity to be effective.},

Our mappings reveal both commonalities and qualitative differences in correcting coherent and incoherent errors. For both, the error-correcting phase maps, as we explicitly show by linking 2D networks to 1D fermions, to a Z 2 -nontrivial 2D insulator. However, beyond a rotation angle ϕ th , instead of a Z 2 -trivial insulator as for incoherent errors, coherent errors map to a Majorana metal. This ϕ th is the theoretically achievable storage threshold. We numerically find ϕ th ≈ 0.14 π . The corresponding bit-flip rate sin 2 ( ϕ th ) ≈ 0.18 exceeds the known incoherent threshold p th ≈ 0.11 .},

  abstract     = {Adiabatic time evolution can be used to prepare a complicated quantum many-body state from one that is easier to synthesize and Trotterization can be used to implement such an evolution digitally. The complex interplay between nonadiabaticity and digitization influences the infidelity of this process. We prove that the first-order Trotterization of a complete adiabatic evolution has a cumulative infidelity that scales as O ( T − 2 δ t 2 ) instead of O ( T 2 δ t 2 ) expected from general Trotter error bounds, where δ t is the time step and T is the total time. This result suggests a self-healing mechanism and explains why, despite increasing T , infidelities for fixed- δ t digitized evolutions still decrease for a wide variety of Hamiltonians. It also establishes a correspondence between the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and digitized quantum annealing.},

  abstract     = {Recent breakthroughs have opened the possibility of intermediate-scale quantum computing with tens to hundreds of qubits, and shown the potential for solving classical challenging problems, such as in chemistry and condensed matter physics. However, the high accuracy needed to surpass classical computers poses a critical demand on the circuit depth, which is severely limited by the non-negligible gate infidelity, currently around 0.1\%–1\%. The limited circuit depth places restrictions on the performance of variational quantum algorithms (VQA) and prevents VQAs from exploring desired nontrivial quantum states. To resolve this problem, we propose a paradigm of Schrödinger-Heisenberg variational quantum algorithms (SHVQA). Using SHVQA, the expectation values of operators on states that require very deep circuits to prepare can now be efficiently measured by rather shallow circuits. The idea is to incorporate a virtual Heisenberg circuit, which acts effectively on the measurement observables, into a real shallow Schrödinger circuit, which is implemented realistically on the quantum hardware. We choose a Clifford virtual circuit, whose effect on the Hamiltonian can be seen as efficient classical processing. Yet, it greatly enlarges the state’s expressivity, realizing much larger unitary t designs. Our method enables accurate quantum simulation and computation that otherwise are only achievable with much deeper circuits or more accurate operations conventionally. This has been verified in our numerical experiments for a better approximation of random states, higher-fidelity solutions to the X X Z model, and the electronic structure Hamiltonians of small molecules. Thus, together with effective quantum error mitigation, our work paves the way for realizing accurate quantum computing algorithms with near-term quantum devices.},

While measurements in quantum devices provide new hope for scalably preparing such long-range entangled states, existing protocols using the experimentally established ingredients of a finite-depth circuit and a single round of measurement produce only Abelian states. Surprisingly, we show there exists a broad family of non-Abelian states—namely those with a Lagrangian subgroup—which can be created using these same minimal ingredients, bypassing the need for new resources such as feed forward. To illustrate that this provides realistic protocols, we show how D 4 non-Abelian topological order can be realized, e.g., on Google’s quantum processors using a depth-11 circuit and a single layer of measurements. Our work opens the way toward the realization and manipulation of non-Abelian topological orders, and highlights counterintuitive features of the complexity of non-Abelian phases.},

It is particularly important to establish tools for their characterization in time domain. Here, we argue that a scaled survival probability, where time is measured in units of a typical Heisenberg time, exhibits a scale-invariant behavior at eigenstate transitions. We first demonstrate this property in two paradigmatic quadratic models, the one-dimensional Aubry-Andre model and three-dimensional Anderson model. Surprisingly, we then show that similar phenomenology emerges in the interacting avalanche model of ergodicity breaking phase transitions. This establishes an intriguing similarity between localization transition in quadratic systems and ergodicity breaking phase transition in interacting systems.},

We show that such control transitions persist in open quantum systems where control is implemented with local measurements and unitary feedback. Starting from a simple classical model with a known control transition, we define a quantum model that exhibits a diffusive transition between a chaotic volume-law entangled phase and a disentangled controlled phase. Unlike other entanglement transitions in monitored quantum circuits, this transition can also be probed by correlation functions without resolving individual quantum trajectories.},

Using tools from free probability theory we obtain the exact spinodal curve and the nature of instabilities for a mixture with an arbitrary composition, thus lifting an important restriction in previous work. We show that, by controlling the concentration of only a few components, one can systematically change the nature of the spinodal instability and achieve demixing for realistic scenarios by a strong composition imbalance amplification . This results from a nontrivial interplay of interaction complexity and entropic effects due to the nonuniform composition. Our approach can be extended to include additional systematic interactions, leading to a competition between different forms of demixing as density is varied.},

  abstract     = {Determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is a powerful numerical technique to study many-body fermionic systems. In recent years, several classes of sign-free (SF) models have been discovered, where the notorious sign problem can be circumvented. However, it is not clear what the inherent physical characteristics and limitations of SF models are. In particular, which zero-temperature quantum phases of matter are accessible within such models, and which are fundamentally inaccessible? Here, we show that a model belonging to any of the known SF classes within DQMC cannot have a stable Fermi-liquid ground state in spatial dimension d ≥ 2 , unless the antiunitary symmetry that prevents the sign problem is spontaneously broken (for which there are currently no known examples in SF models). For SF models belonging to one of the symmetry classes (where the absence of the sign problem follows from a combination of nonunitary symmetries of the fermionic action), any putative Fermi liquid fixed point generically includes an attractive Cooper-like interaction that destabilizes it. In the recently discovered lower-symmetry classes of SF models, the Fermi surface (FS) is generically unstable even at the level of the quadratic action. Our results suggest a fundamental link between Fermi liquids and the fermion sign problem. Interestingly, our results do not rule out a non-Fermi-liquid ground state with a FS in a sign-free model.},

We assess the impact on efficiency of light emitters in a recombination cycle that may include both TAAM and carrier capture via MPE. We apply the formalism to the technologically relevant case study of a calcium impurity in InGaN, where a Shockley-Read-Hall recombination cycle involving MPE alone cannot explain the experimentally observed nonradiative loss. We find that, for band gaps larger than 2.5 eV, the inclusion of TAAM results in recombination rates that are orders of magnitude larger than recombination rates based on MPE alone, demonstrating that TAAM can be a dominant nonradiative process in wide-band-gap materials. Our computational formalism is general and can be applied to the calculation of TAAM rates in any semiconducting or insulating material.},

However, the detection of the Néel vector in 2D antiferromagnets remains a great challenge because the measured signals usually decrease significantly in the 2D limit. Here we propose that the Néel vector of 2D antiferromagnets can be efficiently detected by the intrinsic nonlinear Hall (INH) effect which exhibits unexpected significant signals. As a specific example, we show that the INH conductivity of the monolayer manganese chalcogenides Mn X ( X = S , Se, Te) can reach the order of nm · mA / V 2 , which is orders of magnitude larger than experimental values of paradigmatic antiferromagnetic spintronic materials. The INH effect can be accurately controlled by shifting the chemical potential around the band edge, which is experimentally feasible via electric gating or charge doping. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate its 2 π -periodic dependence on the Néel vector orientation based on an effective k · p model. Our findings enable flexible design schemes and promising material platforms for spintronic memory device applications based on 2D antiferromagnets.},

Of particular interest is the competition and interplay between the even-denominator FQHSs and other ground states, such as anisotropic phases and composite fermion Fermi seas. Here, we report the observation of an even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state with highly anisotropic in-plane transport coefficients at Landau level filling factor ν = 3 / 2 . We observe this state in an ultra-high-quality GaAs two-dimensional hole system when a large in-plane magnetic field is applied. By increasing the in-plane field, we observe a sharp transition from an isotropic composite fermion Fermi sea to an anisotropic even-denominator FQHS. Our data and calculations suggest that a unique feature of two-dimensional holes, namely the coupling between heavy-hole and light-hole states, combines different orbital components in the wave function of one Landau level, and leads to the emergence of a highly anisotropic even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state. Our results demonstrate that the GaAs two-dimensional hole system is a unique platform for the exploration of exotic, many-body ground states.},

Our extensive numerical study clarifies that the critical exponent of the Anderson transition between the metallic and quasilocalized phases, as well as that between the quasilocalized and localized phases, are different from that with no weak topological index, signaling the new universality classes induced by topology. The quasilocalized phase and concomitant topological Anderson transition manifest themselves in the anisotropic transport phenomena of disordered weak topological insulators and nodal-line semimetals, which exhibit the metallic behavior in one direction but the insulating behavior in the other directions.},

Together with the low moiré carrier densities reachable by gating, this robust attraction enables access to the long-sought p -wave BEC-BCS transition. The topological protection arises from an emergent time reversal symmetry occurring when the magnetic order and long wavelength magnetic fluctuations do not couple different valleys.

By means of fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of turbulent, initially unmagnetized plasmas, we study the genesis of magnetic fields via the Weibel instability and follow their dynamo growth up to near-equipartition levels. In the kinematic stage of the dynamo, we find that the rms magnetic field strength grows exponentially with rate γ B ≃ 0.4 u rms / L , where L / 2 π is the driving scale and u rms is the rms turbulent velocity. In the saturated stage, the magnetic field energy reaches about half of the turbulent kinetic energy. Here, magnetic field growth is balanced by dissipation via reconnection, as revealed by the appearance of plasmoid chains. At saturation, the integral-scale wave number of the magnetic spectrum approaches k int ≃ 12 π / L . Our results show that turbulence—induced by, e.g., the gravitational buildup of galaxies and galaxy clusters—can magnetize collisionless plasmas with large-scale near-equipartition fields.},

Whether particles collide depends on their flow history, in particular on their encounters with highly intermittent small-scale turbulent structures, which despite their rarity can dominate the overall collision rate. Here, we develop a quantitative criterion for sling events based on the velocity gradient history along particle paths. We show by a combination of theory and simulations that the problem reduces to a one-dimensional localization problem as encountered in condensed matter physics. The reduction demonstrates that the creation of slings is controlled by the minimal real eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor. We use fully resolved turbulence simulations to confirm our predictions and study their Stokes and Reynolds number dependence. We also discuss extrapolations to the parameter range relevant for typical cloud droplets, showing that sling events at high Reynolds numbers are enhanced by an order of magnitude for small Stokes numbers. Thus, intermittency could be a significant ingredient in the collisional growth of rain droplets.},

  abstract     = {Inspired from electronic systems, topological photonics aims to engineer new optical devices with robust properties. In many cases, the ideas from topological phases protected by internal symmetries in fermionic systems are extended to those protected by crystalline symmetries. One such popular photonic crystal model was proposed by Wu and Hu in 2015 for realizing a bosonic Z 2 topological crystalline insulator with robust topological edge states, which led to intense theoretical and experimental studies. However, a rigorous relationship between the bulk topology and edge properties for this model, which is central to evaluating its advantage over traditional photonic designs, has never been established. In this Letter, we revisit the expanded and shrunken honeycomb lattice structures proposed by Wu and Hu and show that they are topologically trivial in the sense that symmetric, localized Wannier functions can be constructed. We show that the Z and Z 2 type classifications of the Wu-Hu model are equivalent to the C 2 T protected Euler class and the second Stiefel-Whitney class, respectively, with the latter characterizing the full valence bands of the Wu-Hu model, indicating only a higher order topological insulator. Additionally, we show that the Wu-Hu interface states can be gapped by a uniform topology preserving C 6 and T symmetric perturbation, which demonstrates the trivial nature of the interface. Our result reveals that topology is not a necessary condition for the reported helical edge states in many photonics systems and opens new possibilities for interface engineering that may not be constrained by topological considerations.},

In this long delay limit, we show that the universal evolution of the photon statistics from thermal to Poissonian distribution involves the emergence of power dropouts. While the largest number of these dropouts vanish after a few round-trips, some of them persist and seed coherent structures similar to dark solitons or Nozaki-Bekki holes described by the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. These coherent structures connect stationary laser emission domains having different optical frequencies. Moreover, they emit intensity bursts which travel at a different speed, and, depending on the cavity dispersion sign, they may collide with other coherent structures, thus leading to an overall turbulent dynamics. The dynamics is well-modeled by delay differential equations from which we compute the laser coherence time evolution at each round-trip and quantify the decoherence induced by the collisions between coherent structures.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state single-photon emitters (SPEs) are quantum light sources that combine atomlike optical properties with solid-state integration and fabrication capabilities. SPEs are hindered by spectral diffusion, where the emitter’s surrounding environment induces random energy fluctuations. Timescales of spectral diffusion span nanoseconds to minutes and require probing single emitters to remove ensemble averaging. Photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy (PCFS) can be used to measure time-resolved single emitter line shapes, but is hindered by poor signal-to-noise ratio in the measured correlation functions at early times due to low photon counts. Here, we develop a framework to simulate PCFS correlation functions directly from diffusing spectra that match well with experimental data for single colloidal quantum dots. We use these simulated datasets to train a deep ensemble autoencoder machine learning model that outputs accurate, noiseless, and probabilistic reconstructions of the noisy correlations. Using this model, we obtain reconstructed time-resolved single dot emission line shapes at timescales as low as 10 ns, which are otherwise completely obscured by noise. This enables PCFS to extract optical coherence times on the same timescales as Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference, but with the advantage of providing spectral information in addition to estimates of photon indistinguishability. Our machine learning approach is broadly applicable to different photon correlation spectroscopy techniques and SPE systems, offering an enhanced tool for probing single emitter line shapes on previously inaccessible timescales.},

Within this regime, new quantum phenomena and improved performance may be achieved; however, a corresponding theoretical formalism of cavity quantum optomechanics that captures the nonlinearities of both the radiation-pressure interaction and the cavity response is needed to unlock these capabilities. Here, we develop such a nonlinear cavity quantum optomechanical framework, which we then utilize to propose how position measurement can be performed beyond the breakdown of the linearized approximation. Our proposal utilizes optical general-dyne detection, ranging from single to dual homodyne, to obtain mechanical position information imprinted onto both the optical amplitude and phase quadratures and enables both pulsed and continuous modes of operation. These cavity optomechanical nonlinearities are now being confronted in a growing number of experiments, and our framework will allow a range of advances to be made in, e.g., quantum metrology, explorations of the standard quantum limit, and quantum measurement and control.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the propagation of excitons in a d -dimensional lattice with power-law hopping ∝ 1 / r α in the presence of dephasing, described by a generalized Haken-Strobl-Reineker model. We show that in the strong dephasing (quantum Zeno) regime the dynamics is described by a classical master equation for an exclusion process with long jumps. In this limit, we analytically compute the spatial distribution, whose shape changes at a critical value of the decay exponent α cr = ( d + 2 ) / 2 . The exciton always diffuses anomalously: a superdiffusive motion is associated to a Lévy stable distribution with long-range algebraic tails for α ≤ α cr , while for α &gt; α cr the distribution corresponds to a surprising mixed Gaussian profile with long-range algebraic tails, leading to the coexistence of short-range diffusion and long-range Lévy flights. In the many-exciton case, we demonstrate that, starting from a domain-wall exciton profile, algebraic tails appear in the distributions for any α , which affects thermalization: the longer the hopping range, the faster equilibrium is reached. Our results are directly relevant to experiments with cold trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and supramolecular dye aggregates. They provide a way to realize an exclusion process with long jumps experimentally.},

By collecting fluorescence on one optical transition while using another for laser cooling, we achieve an imaging fidelity of 97.7(2)\% and a nondestructive detection fidelity of 95.5(6)\%. Notably, these fidelities are achieved with a modest photon budget, suggesting that the method could be extended to more complex laser-coolable molecules with less favorable optical cycling properties. We also report on a framework and new methods to characterize various loss mechanisms that occur generally during fluorescent detection of trapped molecules, including two-photon decay and admixtures of higher excited states that are induced by the trapping light. In particular, we develop a novel method to dispersively measure transition matrix elements between electronically excited states. The method could also be used to measure arbitrarily small Franck-Condon factors between electronically excited states, which could significantly aid in ongoing efforts to laser cool complex polyatomic molecules.},

The time-dependent degree of alignment measured, exhibits a periodic, gradually decreasing structure that deviates qualitatively from that expected for gas-phase dimers. Comparison to alignment dynamics calculated from the time-dependent rotational Schrödinger equation shows that the deviation is due to the alignment dependent interaction between the dimer and the droplet surface. This interaction confines the dimer to the tangential plane of the droplet surface at the point where it resides and is the reason that the observed alignment dynamics is also well described by a 2D quantum rotor model.},

In a bilayer configuration we show how to engineer the paradigmatic two-mode squeezing Hamiltonian known from quantum optics, resulting in exponential production of entangled pairs and generation of metrologically useful entanglement from initially prepared product states. In multilayer configurations we engineer a bosonic variant of the Kitaev model displaying chiral propagation along the layer direction. Our study illustrates how the control over interactions, lattice geometry, and state preparation in interacting dipolar systems uniquely afforded by AMO platforms such as Rydberg and magnetic atoms, polar molecules, or trapped ions allows for the control over the temporal and spatial propagation of correlations for applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation.},

  abstract     = {We find that the duality between color and kinematics can be used to inform the high energy behavior of effective field theories. Namely, we demonstrate that the massless gauge theory of Yang-Mills deformed by a higher-derivative F 3 operator cannot be tree level color dual while consistently factorizing without a tower of additional four-point counterterms with rigidly fixed Wilson coefficients that reaches to the ultraviolet (UV). We find through explicit calculation a suggestive resummation, namely that their amplitudes are consistent with the α ′ expansion of those generated by the ( D F ) 2 + YM theory, a known color-dual theory where the F 2 term has been given a mass squared proportional to 1 / α ′ . As a result, considering consistent double-copy construction as a physical principle implies that an F 3 -based color-dual resolution of the UV divergence in N = 4 supergravity comes at the cost of field-theoretic locality. Similarly, when double copying F 3 with itself, double-copy consistency lifts R 3 gravity to a family of gravity theories with an all-order tower of higher-derivative corrections, which includes the closed bosonic string as a standard adjoint-type double copy.},

The flux shows a strong indication of anticorrelation with solar activity. These results extend the bright, hard GeV emission from the disk observed with Fermi-LAT, seemingly due to hadronic Galactic cosmic rays showering on nuclei in the solar atmosphere.

Our scheme allows one to estimate unknown frequencies with a high precision from short, finite signals consisting of only a small number of Ramsey fringes. It avoids several issues related to processing of decaying signals and reduces the experimental overhead related to sampling. High precision is achieved by enhancing the Ramsey sequence to prepare with high fidelity both the sensing and readout state and by using an iterative procedure built to mitigate systematic errors when estimating frequencies from Fourier transforms. A comparison with state-of-the-art dynamical decoupling techniques reveals a significant speedup of the frequency estimation without loss of precision.},

However, the noise-induced decoherence forces its superiority to disappear, which is called no-go theorem of noisy quantum metrology and constrains its application. We propose a scheme to overcome the no-go theorem by Floquet engineering. It is found that, by applying a periodic driving on the atoms of the Ramsey spectroscopy, the ultimate sensitivity to measure their frequency characterized by quantum Fisher information returns to the ideal t 2 scaling with the encoding time whenever a Floquet bound state is formed by the system consisting of each driven atom and its local noise. Combining with the optimal control, this mechanism also allows us to retrieve the ideal Heisenberg-limit scaling with the atom number N . Our result gives an efficient way to avoid the no-go theorem of noisy quantum metrology and to realize high-precision measurements.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) protects logical qubits by engineered dissipation and thus circumvents the necessity of frequent, error-prone measurement-feedback loops. Bosonic code spaces, where single-photon loss represents the dominant source of error, are promising candidates for AQEC due to their flexibility and controllability. While existing proposals have demonstrated the in-principle feasibility of AQEC with bosonic code spaces, these schemes are typically based on the exact implementation of the Knill-Laflamme conditions and thus require the realization of Hamiltonian distances d ≥ 2 . Implementing such Hamiltonian distances requires multiple nonlinear interactions and control fields, rendering these schemes experimentally challenging. Here, we propose a bosonic code for approximate AQEC by relaxing the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Using reinforcement learning (RL), we identify the optimal bosonic set of code words (denoted here by RL code), which, surprisingly, is composed of the Fock states | 2 ⟩ and | 4 ⟩ . As we show, the RL code, despite its approximate nature, successfully suppresses single-photon loss, reducing it to an effective dephasing process that well surpasses the break-even threshold. It may thus provide a valuable building block toward full error protection. The error-correcting Hamiltonian, which includes ancilla systems that emulate the engineered dissipation, is entirely based on the Hamiltonian distance d = 1 , significantly reducing model complexity. Single-qubit gates are implemented in the RL code with a maximum distance d g = 2 .},

More precisely, let H 0 be a Hamiltonian, spatially local in d spatial dimensions, with a gap Δ in the many-body spectrum; let V be a spatially local Hamiltonian consisting of a sum of local terms, each of which is bounded by ε ≪ Δ . Then, the approximation that quantum dynamics is restricted to the low-energy subspace of H 0 is accurate, in the correlation functions of local operators, for stretched exponential timescale τ ∼ exp [ ( Δ / ε ) a ] for any a &lt; 1 / ( 2 d − 1 ) . This result does not depend on whether the perturbation closes the gap. It significantly extends previous rigorous results on prethermalization in models where H 0 was frustration-free. We infer the robustness of quantum simulation in low-energy subspaces, the existence of athermal “scarred” correlation functions in gapped systems subject to generic perturbations, the long lifetime of false vacua in symmetry broken systems, and the robustness of quantum information in non-frustration-free gapped phases with topological order.},

The recently realized atomic quantum simulator for lattice gauge theories provides a unique opportunity for studying thermalization in gauge theory, in which theoretical studies have shown that quantum thermalization can signal the quantum phase transition. Nevertheless, the experimental study remains a challenge to accurately determine the critical point and controllably explore the thermalization dynamics due to the lack of techniques for locally manipulating and detecting matter and gauge fields. We report an experimental investigation of the quantum criticality in the lattice gauge theory from both equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermalization perspectives, with the help of the single-site addressing and atom-number-resolved detection capabilities. We accurately determine the quantum critical point and observe that the Néel state thermalizes only in the critical regime.

  abstract     = {We discover a new type of nonequilibrium phase transition in a model of chromatin dynamics, which accounts for the coherent motions that have been observed in experiment. The coherent motion is due to the long-range cooperation of molecular motors tethered to chromatin. Cooperation occurs if each motor acts simultaneously on the polymer and the surrounding solvent, exerting on them equal and opposite forces. This drives the flow of solvent past the polymer, which in turn affects the orientation of nearby motors and, if the drive is strong enough, an active polar (“ferromagnetic”) phase of motors can spontaneously form. Depending on boundary conditions, either transverse flows or sustained longitudinal oscillations and waves are possible. Predicted length scales are consistent with experiments. We now have in hand a coarse-grained description of chromatin dynamics which reproduces the directed coherent flows of chromatin seen in experiments. This field-theoretic description can be analytically coupled to other features of the nuclear environment such as fluctuating or porous boundaries, local heterogeneities in the distribution of chromatin or its activity, leading to insights on the effects of activity on the cell nucleus and its contents.},

  abstract     = {Polymers confined in corrugated channels, i.e., channels of varying amplitude, display multiple local maxima and minima of the diffusion coefficient upon increasing their degree of polymerization N . We propose a theoretical effective free energy for linear polymers based on a Fick-Jacobs approach. We validate the predictions against numerical data, obtaining quantitative agreement for the effective free energy, the diffusion coefficient, and the mean first passage time. Finally, we employ the effective free energy to compute the polymer lengths N min at which the diffusion coefficient presents a minimum: we find a scaling expression that we rationalize with a blob model. Our results could be useful to design porous adsorbers, that separate polymers of different sizes without the action of an external flow.},

  abstract     = {When driven by nonequilibrium fluctuations, particle systems may display phase transitions and physical behavior with no equilibrium counterpart. We study a two-dimensional particle model initially proposed to describe driven non-Brownian suspensions undergoing nonequilibrium absorbing phase transitions. We show that when the transition occurs at large density, the dynamics produces long-range crystalline order. In the ordered phase, long-range translational order is observed because equipartition of energy is lacking, phonons are suppressed, and density fluctuations are hyperuniform. Our study offers an explicit microscopic model where nonequilibrium violations of the Mermin-Wagner theorem stabilize crystalline order in two dimensions.},

At the harmonic level, such flexoelectric interaction is known to hybridize acoustic and optic phonon modes and lead to phases with modulated lattice structures that precede the state with spontaneously broken inversion symmetry. Here, we use the self-consistent phonon approximation to calculate the effects of thermal and quantum polarization fluctuations on the bare hybridized modes to show that such long-range modulated order is unstable at all temperatures. We discuss the implications for the nearly ferroelectric SrTiO 3 and KTaO 3 , and we propose that these systems are melted versions of an underlying modulated state that is dominated by nonzero momentum thermal fluctuations except at the very lowest temperatures.},

Symmetry considerations in this case predict the appearance of a two-dimensional Weyl semimetal (2D WSM), with a pair of Weyl nodes of opposite chirality at charge neutrality that are protected by space-time inversion ( C 2 T ) symmetry. We show that the 2D WSM phase displays unique transport signatures, including saturated resistivities on the order of h / e 2 that persist over a range of in-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, applying a small out-of-plane magnetic field, while keeping the in-plane field within the stability range of the 2D WSM phase, gives rise to a well-developed odd integer quantum Hall effect, characteristic of degenerate, massive Weyl fermions. A minimal four-band k · p model of Cd 3 As 2 , which incorporates first-principles effective g factors, qualitatively explains our findings.},

However, performing exact numerical calculations for interacting quantum matter has remained a key challenge especially beyond one spatial dimension. In this work, we develop a versatile approach using neural quantum states to obtain spectral properties based on simulations of the dynamics of excitations initially localized in real or momentum space. We apply this approach to compute the dynamical structure factor in the vicinity of quantum critical points (QCPs) of different two-dimensional quantum Ising models, including one that describes the complex density wave orders of Rydberg atom arrays. When combined with deep network architectures we find that our method reliably describes dynamical structure factors of arrays with up to 24 × 24 spins, including the diverging timescales at critical points. Our approach is broadly applicable to interacting quantum lattice models in two dimensions and consequently opens up a route to compute spectral properties of correlated quantum matter in yet inaccessible regimes.},

We find a nematic excitonic insulator phase that breaks the moiré superlattice’s threefold rotational symmetry and preempts the topological phase transition in both A A and A B stacked heterobilayers when the interlayer tunneling is weak, or when the Coulomb interaction is not strongly screened. The nematicity originates from the frustration between the nontrivial spatial structure of the interlayer tunneling, which is crucial to the existence of the topological Chern band, and the interlayer coherence induced by the Coulomb interaction that favors uniformity in layer pseudospin orientations. We construct a unified effective two-band model that captures the physics near the band inversion and applies to both A A and A B stacked heterobilayers. Within the two-band model the competition between the nematic excitonic insulator phase and the Chern insulator phase can be understood as the switching of the energetic order between the s -wave and the p -wave excitons upon increasing the interlayer tunneling.},

Our data reveal a split-off flat band that derives from the monolayer Γ states. Using advanced data analysis, we directly quantify the moiré potential from our data. We further demonstrate that the global valence band maximum in tWSe 2 is close in energy to this flat band but derives from the monolayer K states which show weaker superlattice effects. These results constrain theoretical models and open the perspective that Γ -valley flat bands might be involved in the correlated physics of twisted WSe 2 .},

However, their current performances are still limited by dephasing due to variations of their intrinsic quadrupole and hyperfine interactions. We propose an unbalanced echo to overcome this challenge by using a second spin to refocus variations of these interactions while preserving the quantum information stored in the nuclear spin free evolution. The unbalanced echo can be used to probe the temperature and strain distribution in materials. We develop first-principles methods to predict variations of these interactions and reveal their correlation over large temperature and strain ranges. Experiments performed in an ensemble of ∼ 10 10 nuclear spins in diamond demonstrate a 20-fold dephasing time increase, limited by other noise sources. We further numerically show that our method can refocus even stronger noise variations than present in our experiments.},

After fast inversion, we detune the spins from the cavity and store the inversion for tens of milliseconds, during which the remaining transverse spin components disappear. Switching back on resonance enables us to study the onset of superradiance. A weak trigger pulse of a few hundred photons shifts the superradiant burst to earlier times and imprints its phase onto the emitted radiation. For long hold times, the inversion decreases below the threshold for spontaneous superradiance. There, the energy stored in the ensemble can be used to amplify microwave pulses passing through the cavity.},

De Marco et al. , A degenerate Fermi gas of polar molecules, Science 363 , 853 (2019) .], this work studies the finite-temperature loss rate of single-component Fermi gases with weak interactions. First, we establish a relationship between the two-body loss rate and the p -wave contact. Second, we evaluate the contact of the homogeneous system in the low-temperature regime using p -wave Fermi liquid theory and in the high-temperature regime using the second-order virial expansion. Third, conjecturing that there are no phase transitions between the two temperature regimes, we smoothly interpolate the results to intermediate temperatures. It is found that the contact is constant at temperatures close to zero and increases first quadratically with increasing temperature and finally—in agreement with the Bethe-Wigner threshold law—linearly at high temperatures. Fourth, applying the local-density approximation, we obtain the loss-rate coefficient for the harmonically trapped system, reproducing the experimental KRb loss measurements within a unified theoretical framework over a wide temperature regime without fitting parameters. Our results for the contact are not only applicable to molecular p -wave gases but also to atomic single-component Fermi gases, such as K 40 and Li 6 .},

Here we suggest a scheme where photoionization of a He medium by an intense XUV pump pulse is followed by a strong population inversion and Rabi oscillation at the He + ( 1 s − 3 p ) transition and is accompanied by superfluorescence (SF) of the 7.56 eV pulse at the He + ( 3 p − 2 s ) transition. Our numerical simulations show that the Rabi oscillation at the He + ( 1 s − 3 p ) transition induced by an XUV pulse with photon energy 48.36 eV results in significant signatures in the SF spectra, allowing us to identify and characterize the XUV induced Rabi-oscillatory regime. The proposed scheme provides a sensitive tool to monitor and control ultrafast nonlinear dynamics in atoms and molecules triggered by intense XUV.},

Using the relativistic spin Boltzmann equation for vector mesons derived from Kadanoff-Baym equations with an effective quark-meson model for strong interaction and quark coalescence model for hadronizaton, we calculate the spin density matrix element ρ 00 for ϕ mesons and show that anisotropies of local field correlations with respect to the spin quantization direction lead to ϕ meson’s spin alignment. We propose that the local correlation or fluctuation of ϕ fields is the dominant mechanism for the observed ϕ meson’s spin alignment and its strength can be extracted from experimental data as functions of collision energies. The calculated transverse momentum dependence of ρ 00 agrees with STAR’s data. We further predict the azimuthal angle dependence of ρ 00 which can be tested in future experiments.},

In this measurement, the direction of the leading particle with the highest p T in the event ( p T lead &gt; 5 GeV / c ) is used as an approximation for the jet axis. The event is consequently divided into three azimuthal regions, and the jet signal is obtained as the difference between the toward region, that contains jet fragmentation products in addition to the underlying event (UE), and the transverse region, which is dominated by the UE. The coalescence parameter in the jet is found to be approximately a factor of 10 larger than that in the underlying event. This experimental observation is consistent with the coalescence picture and can be attributed to the smaller average phase-space distance between nucleons in the jet cone as compared with the underlying event. The results presented in this Letter are compared to predictions from a simple nucleon coalescence model, where the phase-space distributions of nucleons are generated using pythia 8 with the Monash 2013 tuning, and to predictions from a deuteron production model based on ordinary nuclear reactions with parametrized energy-dependent cross sections tuned on data. The latter model is implemented in pythia 8.3. Both models reproduce the observed large difference between in-jet and out-of-jet coalescence parameters, although the almost flat trend of the B 2 Jet is not reproduced by the models, which instead give a decreasing trend.},

  abstract     = {Discriminating between Higgs production mechanisms can play a crucial role in determining the couplings of Higgs to gauge bosons, probing the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. We propose a novel method to distinguish the Higgs production mechanisms at the LHC by utilizing the jet charge asymmetry of the two leading forward jets in Higgs plus two jets production. This novel observable provides a way to disentangle the W fusion from the Z fusion and gluon fusion processes for the first time, due to the electric charge correlation of the two leading jets in the events. We show that the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons can be well constrained, and its conclusion does not depend on the other possible new physics effects which modify the Higgs total or partial width. We also discuss the complementary roles between the proposed jet charge asymmetry measurement and the Higgs signal strength measurements at the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) in determining the Higgs couplings.},

Conversely, we show that any theory with a BV ▪ -algebra features a kinematic Lie algebra that controls interaction vertices, both on shell and off shell. We explain that the archetypal example of a theory with a BV ▪ -algebra is Chern-Simons theory, for which the resulting kinematic Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Schouten-Nijenhuis algebra on multivector fields. The BV ▪ -algebra implies the known color-kinematics duality of Chern-Simons theory. Similarly, we show that holomorphic and Cauchy-Riemann Chern-Simons theories come with BV ▪ -algebras and that, on the appropriate twistor spaces, these theories organize and identify kinematic Lie algebras for self-dual and full Yang-Mills theories, as well as the currents of any field theory with a twistorial description. We show that this result extends to the loop level under certain assumptions.},

The frequency-dependent squeezed field is generated by a phase rotation of a frequency-independent squeezed state through a 285 m long, high-finesse, near-detuned optical resonator. With about 8.5 dB of generated squeezing, up to 5.6 dB of quantum noise suppression has been measured at high frequency while close to the filter cavity resonance frequency, the intracavity losses limit this value to about 2 dB. Frequency-dependent squeezing is produced with a rotation frequency stability of about 6 Hz rms, which is maintained over the long term. The achieved results fulfill the frequency dependent squeezed vacuum source requirements for Advanced Virgo Plus. With the current squeezing source, considering also the estimated squeezing degradation induced by the interferometer, we expect a reduction of the quantum shot noise and radiation pressure noise of up to 4.5 dB and 2 dB, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The circular polarization of gravitational waves is a powerful observable to test parity violation in gravity and to distinguish between the primordial or the astrophysical origin of the stochastic background. This property comes from the expected unpolarized nature of the homogeneous and isotropic astrophysical background, contrary to some specific cosmological sources that can produce a polarized background. However, in this work we show that there is also a non-negligible amount of circular polarization in the astrophysical background, generated by Poisson fluctuations in the number of unresolved sources, which is present in the third-generation interferometers with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 2. We also explain in which cases the gravitational wave maps can be cleaned from this extra source of noise, exploiting the frequency and the angular dependence, in order to search for signals from the early Universe. Future studies about the detection of polarized cosmological backgrounds with ground- and space-based interferometers should account for the presence of such a foreground contribution.},

During the ( 1.09 ± 0.03 ) ton yr exposure used for this search, the intrinsic Kr 85 and Rn 222 concentrations in the liquid target are reduced to unprecedentedly low levels, giving an electronic recoil background rate of ( 15.8 ± 1.3 ) events / ton yr keV in the region of interest.

Limits for spin-dependent interactions are also provided.

  abstract     = {Cat qubits provide appealing building blocks for quantum computing. They exhibit a tunable noise bias yielding an exponential suppression of bit flips with the average photon number and a protection against the remaining phase errors can be ensured by a simple repetition code. We here quantify the cost of a repetition code and provide valuable guidance for the choice of a large scale architecture using cat qubits by realizing a performance analysis based on the computation of discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve with Shor’s algorithm. By focusing on a 2D grid of cat qubits with neighboring connectivity, we propose to implement 2-qubit gates via lattice surgery and Toffoli gates with off-line fault-tolerant preparation of magic states through projective measurements and subsequent gate teleportations. All-to-all connectivity between logical qubits is ensured by routing qubits. Assuming a ratio between single- and two-photon losses of 10 − 5 and a cycle time of 500 ns, we show concretely that such an architecture can compute a 256-bit elliptic curve logarithm in 9 h with 126 133 cat qubits and on average 19 photons by cat state. We give the details of the realization of Shor’s algorithm so that the proposed performance analysis can be easily reused to guide the choice of architecture for others platforms.},

This violation is generically related to the absence of time-reversal symmetry for the scattering T matrix, which produces a thermalization mechanism that allows the presence of persistent probability and heat currents at thermal equilibrium. This phenomenon is illustrated by a model of an electron hopping between three quantum dots in an external magnetic field.},

While it has long been believed that the constriction is driven by motor proteins, it has recently been discovered that passive crosslinkers that do not turn over fuel are able to generate enough force to constrict actin filament rings. To study the ring constriction dynamics, we develop a model that includes the driving force of crosslinker condensation and the opposing forces of friction and filament bending. We analyze the constriction force as a function of ring topology and crosslinker concentration, and predict forces that are sufficient to constrict an unadorned plasma membrane. Our model also predicts that actin-filament sliding arises from an interplay between filament rotation and crosslinker hopping, producing frictional forces that are low compared with those of crosslinker-mediated microtubule sliding.},

  abstract     = {Gaining control over the motion of active particles is crucial for applications ranging from targeted cargo delivery to nanomedicine. While much progress has been made recently to control active motion based on external forces, flows, or gradients in concentration or light intensity, which all have a well-defined direction or bias, little is known about how to steer active particles in situations where no permanent bias can be realized. Here, we show that ac fields with a vanishing time average provide an alternative route to steering active particles. We exemplify this route for inertial active particles in a gravitational field, observing that a substantial fraction of them persistently travels in the upward direction upon switching on the ac field, resulting in an inverted sedimentation profile at the top wall of a confining container. Our results offer a generic control principle that could be used in the future to steer active motion, direct collective behaviors, and purify mixtures.},

In this regime, the light emission of the excitons turns out to be homogeneously broadened in energy with a high temporal coherence. At higher temperatures, both the spatial coherence length and the temporal coherence time decrease, most likely because of thermal processes.

Thanks to the well-energetically separated excitonic states, the response of the discrete excitonic states to the electric field could be precisely examined. Here we utilize the photocurrent spectroscopy to probe excitonic states under a static in-plane electric field. We demonstrate that the in-plane electric field leads to a significant orbital hybridization of Rydberg excitonic states with different angular momentum (especially orbital hybridization of 2 s and 2 p ) and, consequently, optically actives 2 p -state exciton. Besides, the electric-field controlled mixing of the high lying exciton state and continuum band enhances the oscillator strength of the discrete excited exciton states. This electric field modulation of the excitonic states in monolayer TMDs provides a paradigm of the manipulation of 2D excitons for potential applications of the electro-optical modulation in 2D semiconductors.},

Besides single ion anisotropy and isotropic Heisenberg terms, this model further includes the Kitaev interaction and a biquadratic term, and can well reproduce striking features of the experimental helical ground state, that are, e.g., a proper screw state, canting of rotation plane, propagation direction, and period. Using this model to build a phase diagram, it is demonstrated that, (i) the in-plane propagation direction of ⟨ 1 1 ¯ 0 ⟩ is determined by the Kitaev interaction, instead of the long-believed exchange frustrations and (ii) the canting of rotation plane is also dominantly determined by Kitaev interaction, rather than interlayer couplings. Furthermore, additional Monte Carlo simulations reveal three equivalent domains and different topological defects. Since the ferroelectricity is induced by spins in type-II multiferroics, our work also implies that Kitaev interaction is closely related to the multiferroicity of NiI 2 .},

Behind such a behavior could be inherent failures of the j eff = 1 / 2 picture, in particular when electrons or holes are introduced in the IrO 2 planes. In view of this, here we reanalyze the j eff = 1 / 2 scenario. By using the local-density approximation plus dynamical mean-field theory approach, we show that the form of the effective j eff = 1 / 2 state is surprisingly stable upon doping. This supports the j eff = 1 / 2 picture. We show that, nevertheless, Sr 2 IrO 4 remains in essence a multiorbital system: The hybridization with the j eff = 3 / 2 orbitals sizably reduces the Mott gap by enhancing orbital degeneracy, and part of the holes go into the j eff = 3 / 2 channels. These effects cannot be reproduced by a simple effective screened Coulomb repulsion. In the optical conductivity spectra, multiorbital processes involving the j eff = 3 / 2 states contribute both to the Drude peak and to relatively low-energy features.},

This demonstrates that sufficiently complicated quantum states, although being physical solutions to relevant models and not pathological cases, can still be difficult to learn to the point of intractability at larger system sizes. Hence, the variational neural network approach offers no benefits over exact diagonalization methods in this case.

An outstanding question still remains as to the existence of a three-dimensional Fermi surface pocket, which is crucial for our understanding of the exotic superconducting and topological properties of UTe 2 . This 3D Fermi surface pocket appears in various theoretical models with different physics origins, but has not been unambiguously detected in experiment. Here for the first time we provide concrete evidence for a relatively isotropic, small Fermi surface pocket of UTe 2 via quantum oscillation measurements. In addition, we observed high frequency quantum oscillations corresponding to electron-hole tunneling between adjacent electron and hole pockets. The coexistence of 2D and 3D Fermi surface pockets, as well as the breakdown orbits, provide a test bed for theoretical models and aid the realization of a unified understanding of the superconducting state of UTe 2 from the first-principles approach.},

Controlling the magnetic properties of such devices with an electric field has the potential to vastly enhance their performance. Nevertheless, experimental methods to study the origin of electric-field-induced effects on buried interfaces remain elusive. By using element selective x-ray resonant magnetic reflectometry we are able to gain access to changes in the electronic structure of interfacial atoms caused by an electric field. With this method it is possible to probe interfacial states at the Fermi energy. In a multilayer stack with a Ni / SiO 2 interface, we find that the electric field slightly shifts the Ni L 3 -edge in energy, which indicates a change of the oxidation state of interfacial Ni atoms. Further analysis of the strength of the effect reveals that only about 30\% of the electrons moved by the electric field end up in interfacial Ni states.},

Substantial Sn displacements with a dipolar character persist in the high-symmetry high-temperature phase, albeit with a symmetry different from that of the ordered displacements below the transition. The analysis implies that the transition is neither order-disorder nor displacive but rather a complex crossover. Robust ferrocoupled SnSe intralayer distortions suggest a ferroelectriclike instability as the driving force. These local symmetry-lowering Sn displacements are likely integral to the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity mechanism in SnSe.},

  abstract     = {We perform high resolution kinetic simulations of interpenetrating plasma beams. This configuration is unstable to both Weibel-type and two-stream instabilities, which are known to linearly induce a growth of the magnetic and electrostatic energy, respectively, at the expenses of the kinetic energy. “Oblique modes” are further beam-plasma instabilities, which linearly combine the features of the former two. Here we show the possibility of a reversal of the energy flow associated to these beam-plasma instabilities, when secondary propagating oblique modes are excited. This rapid conversion from magnetic to kinetic energy (i.e., kinetic heating), differs from the standard magnetic reconnection scenario and is induced by the reinforcement of the filamentation process of the distribution function in the phase space. This phenomenon—likely of general interest to collisionless dissipation processes in plasmas—can be understood in terms of mode synchronization: the coupling of oblique modes at disparate spatial scales leads to the appearance of synchronized “filamented” modes, which act on the global dynamics of the plasma via kinetic heating, collisionless dissipation, and turbulence.},

It is calculated under the same conditions, using the combination of density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory, which describes explicitly electronic correlation effects. The predictive power of this scheme is checked by comparison with measurements; it is then used to evaluate the crystalline anisotropy in ε -Fe under higher density.

Exploiting geometrical properties of transitional channel flow we trace turbulence to far lower Reynolds numbers (Re) than previously possible and identify the complete path that reversibly links fully turbulent motion to an invariant solution. This precursor of turbulence destabilizes rapidly with Re, and the accompanying explosive increase in attractor dimension effectively marks the transition between deterministic and de facto stochastic dynamics.},

However, it is unclear how the distribution behaves if precipitation occurs in a small, confined volume. In this Letter, we conduct microfluidic experiments where sodium carbonate and calcium chloride solutions are continuously injected into a microchannel to precipitate calcium carbonate particles. Results show that, regardless of the variations in reagent concentrations, mixing schemes, flow rates, and precipitation time, sizes of precipitated particles in the channel are power law distributed, with an exponent of 1.4. The data are described by an extended Yule process with the introduction of a ripening term. Since the Yule process is a general mechanism for power law generation, the extended Yule process proposed here provides a general model for systems where growth and ripening simultaneously present.},

Here, we show that semiconductor Rydberg excitons, which are only weakly coupled to a free-space light mode can produce strongly antibunched fields, i.e., quantum light. This effect is fueled by a micron-scale excitation blockade between Rydberg excitons inducing pair-wise polariton scattering events. Photons incident on an exciton resonance are scattered into blue- and red-detuned pairs, which enjoy relative protection from absorption and thus dominate the transmitted light. We demonstrate that this effect persists in the presence of additional phonon coupling, strong nonradiative decay, and across a wide range of experimental parameters. Our results pave the way for the observation of quantum statistics from weakly coupled semiconductor excitons.},

A fundamental challenge is addressing multiple quantum emitters at once, as intrinsic inhomogeneities of solid-state platforms require individual tuning of each emitter. We present the realization of two semiconductor quantum dot emitters that are efficiently coupled to a photonic-crystal waveguide and individually controllable by applying a local electric Stark field. We present resonant transmission and fluorescence spectra in order to probe the coupling of the two emitters to the waveguide. We exploit the single-photon stream from one quantum dot to perform spectroscopy on the second quantum dot positioned 16 μ m away in the waveguide. Furthermore, power-dependent resonant transmission measurements reveal signatures of coherent coupling between the emitters. Our work provides a scalable route to realizing multiemitter collective coupling, which has inherently been missing for solid-state deterministic photon emitters.},

Here, we investigate whether an array of emitters coupled to a one-dimensional bath undergoes Dicke superradiance. This is a process whereby a completely inverted system becomes correlated via dissipation, leading to the release of all the energy in the form of a rapid photon burst. We derive the minimal conditions for the burst to happen as a function of the number of emitters, the chirality of the waveguide, and the single-emitter optical depth, both for ordered and disordered ensembles. Many-body superradiance occurs because the initial fluctuation that triggers the emission is amplified throughout the decay process. In one-dimensional baths, this avalanchelike behavior leads to a spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking, with large shot-to-shot fluctuations in the number of photons emitted to the left and right. Superradiant bursts may thus be a smoking gun for the generation of correlated photon states of exotic quantum statistics.},

When relying on coincidence detection alone, such a quantum LiDAR is limited by the timing jitter of the detector and suffers from jamming noise. Inspired by the Zou-Wang-Mandel experiment, we design, construct, and validate a quantum induced coherence (QuIC) LiDAR which is inherently immune to ambient and jamming noises. In traditional LiDAR the direct detection of the reflected probe photons suffers from deteriorating SNR for increasing background noise. In QuIC LiDAR we circumvent this obstacle by only detecting the entangled reference photons, whose single-photon interference fringes are used to obtain the distance of the object, while the reflected probe photons are used to erase path information of the reference photons. In consequence, the noise accompanying the reflected probe light has no effect on the detected signal. We demonstrate such noise resilience with both LED and laser light to mimic the background and jamming noise. The proposed method paves a new way of battling noise in precise quantum electromagnetic sensing and ranging.},

  abstract     = {We report the first direct observation of neutrino interactions at a particle collider experiment. Neutrino candidate events are identified in a 13.6 TeV center-of-mass energy p p collision dataset of 35.4 fb − 1 using the active electronic components of the FASER detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The candidates are required to have a track propagating through the entire length of the FASER detector and be consistent with a muon neutrino charged-current interaction. We infer 153 − 13 + 12 neutrino interactions with a significance of 16 standard deviations above the background-only hypothesis. These events are consistent with the characteristics expected from neutrino interactions in terms of secondary particle production and spatial distribution, and they imply the observation of both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos with an incident neutrino energy of significantly above 200 GeV.},

  abstract     = {In quantum field theory, the Dyson-Schwinger equations are an infinite set of coupled equations relating n -point Green’s functions in a self-consistent manner. They have found important applications in nonperturbative studies, ranging from quantum chromodynamics and hadron physics to strongly correlated electron systems. However, they are notoriously formidable to solve. One of the main obstacles is that a finite truncation of the infinite system is underdetermined. Recently, Bender et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 , 101602 (2023) ] proposed to make use of the large- n asymptotic behaviors and successfully obtained accurate results in D = 0 spacetime. At higher D , it seems more difficult to deduce the large- n behaviors. In this Letter, we propose another avenue in light of the null bootstrap. The underdetermined system is solved by imposing the null state condition. This approach can be extended to D &gt; 0 more readily. As concrete examples, we show that the cases of D = 0 and D = 1 indeed converge to the exact results for several Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories of the g ϕ n type, including the complex solutions.},

  abstract     = {Conformal field theory (CFT) plays a crucial role in the study of various critical phenomena. While much attention has been paid to the critical exponents of different universalities, which correspond to the conformal dimensions of CFT primary fields, other important and intricate data such as operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients governing the fusion of two primary fields, have remained largely unexplored, especially in dimensions higher than 2D (or equivalently, 1 + 1 D ). Motivated by the recently proposed fuzzy sphere regularization, we investigate the operator content of 3D Ising criticality from a microscopic perspective. We first outline the procedure for extracting OPE coefficients on the fuzzy sphere and then compute 13 OPE coefficients of low-lying CFT primary fields. Our results are highly accurate and in agreement with the numerical conformal bootstrap data of 3D Ising CFT. Moreover, we were able to obtain 4 OPE coefficients, including f T μ ν T ρ η ε , which were previously unknown, thus demonstrating the superior capabilities of our scheme. Expanding the horizon of the fuzzy sphere regularization from the state perspective to the operator perspective opens up new avenues for exploring a wealth of new physics.},

But while the runtime of specific algorithms, notably tensor network algorithms, explicitly depends on the amount of entanglement in the system, it is unknown whether this connection runs deeper and entanglement can also cause inherent, algorithm-independent complexity. In this Letter, we quantitatively connect the entanglement present in certain quantum systems to the computational complexity of simulating those systems. Moreover, we completely characterize the entanglement and complexity as a function of a system parameter. Specifically, we consider the task of simulating single-qubit measurements of k -regular graph states on n qubits. We show that, as the regularity parameter is increased from 1 to n − 1 , there is a sharp transition from an easy regime with low entanglement to a hard regime with high entanglement at k = 3 , and a transition back to easy and low entanglement at k = n − 3 . As a key technical result, we prove a duality for the simulation complexity of regular graph states between low and high regularity.},

We study their interplay in collectively driven degenerate quantum thermal machines and show that these mechanisms either cooperate or compete depending on the working mode of the machine (refrigerator or engine). The entrainment-mutual synchronization interplay persists with an increase in the number of degenerate levels, while in the thermodynamic limit of degeneracy, mutual synchronization dominates. Overall, our work investigates the effect of degeneracy and multilevel scaling of quantum synchronization and shows how different synchronizing mechanisms can cooperate and compete in quantum systems.},

The standard mechanism used to incorporate chemical element information is to create separate densities for each element and form tensor products between them. This leads to a steep scaling in the size of the representation as the number of elements increases. Graph neural networks, which do not explicitly use density representations, escape this scaling by mapping the chemical element information into a fixed dimensional space in a learnable way. By exploiting symmetry, we recast this approach as tensor factorization of the standard neighbour-density-based descriptors and, using a new notation, identify connections to existing compression algorithms. In doing so, we form compact tensor-reduced representation of the local atomic environment whose size does not depend on the number of chemical elements, is systematically convergable, and therefore remains applicable to a wide range of data analysis and regression tasks.},

At the Euler scale, one assumes that each mesoscopic region independently reaches a state of maximal entropy under the constraints given by the available conservation laws. Away from phase transitions, maximal entropy states show exponential correlation decay, and independence of fluid cells might be assumed to subsist during the course of time evolution. We show that this picture is incorrect: under ballistic scaling, regions separated by macroscopic distances “develop long-range correlations as time passes.” These correlations take a universal form that only depends on the Euler hydrodynamics of the model. They are rooted in the large-scale motion of interacting fluid modes and are the dominant long-range correlations developing in time from long-wavelength, entropy-maximized states. They require “the presence of interaction” and “at least two different fluid modes” and are of a fundamentally different nature from well-known long-range correlations occurring from diffusive spreading or from quasiparticle excitations produced in far-from-equilibrium quenches. We provide a universal theoretical framework to exactly evaluate them, an adaptation of the macroscopic fluctuation theory to the Euler scale. We verify our exact predictions in the hard-rod gas, by comparing with numerical simulations and finding excellent agreement.},

We demonstrate the strong SC diode effect in conventional SC thin films, such as niobium and vanadium, employing external magnetic fields as small as 1 Oe. Interfacing the SC layer with a ferromagnetic semiconductor EuS, we further accomplish the nonvolatile SC diode effect reaching a giant efficiency of 65\%. By careful control experiments and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the critical supercurrent nonreciprocity in SC thin films could be easily accomplished with asymmetrical vortex edge and surface barriers and the universal Meissner screening current governing the critical currents. Our engineering of the SC diode effect in simple systems opens the door for novel technologies while revealing the ubiquity of the Meissner screening effect induced SC diode effect in superconducting films, and it should be eliminated with great care in the search for exotic superconducting states harboring finite-momentum Cooper pairing.},

  abstract     = {Floquet moiré materials possess optically-induced flat-electron bands with steady-states sensitive to drive parameters. Within this regime, we show that strong interaction screening and phonon bath coupling can overcome enhanced drive-induced heating. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) irradiated by a terahertz-frequency continuous circularly polarized laser, the extremely slow electronic states enable the drive to control the steady state occupation of high-Berry curvature electronic states. In particular, above a critical field amplitude, high-Berry-curvature states exhibit a slow regime where they decouple from acoustic phonons, allowing the drive to control the anomalous Hall response. Our work shows that the laser-induced control of topological and transport physics in Floquet TBG are measurable using experimentally available probes.},

Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission experiments and first-principles calculations on pristine and Cs-doped CsTi 3 Bi 5 samples. Our results reveal that the van Hove singularity (vHS) in CsTi 3 Bi 5 can be tuned in a large energy range without structural instability, different from that in CsV 3 Sb 5 .

In this work, we predict new interacting electronic orders emerging near higher-order Van Hove singularities present in the Chern bands of the Haldane model. We classify the nature of such singularities and employ unbiased renormalization group methods that unveil a complex landscape of electronic orders, which include ferromagnetism, density waves, and superconductivity. Importantly, we show that repulsive interactions can stabilize the long-sought pair-density-wave state and an exotic Chern supermetal, which is a new class of non-Fermi liquid with anomalous quantum Hall response. This framework opens a new path to explore unconventional electronic phases in two-dimensional chiral bands through the interplay of band topology and higher-order Van Hove singularities.},

Rev. Lett. 129 , 047601 (2022) ], to obtain its Kondo lattice limit. In this limit localized f electrons on a triangular lattice interact with topological conduction c electrons. By solving the exact limit of the THF model, we show that the integer fillings ν = 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 are controlled by the heavy f electrons, while ν = ± 3 is at the border of a phase transition between two f -electron fillings. For ν = 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 , we then calculate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions between the f moments in the full model and analytically prove the SU(4) Hund’s rule for the ground state which maintains that two f electrons fill the same valley-spin flavor. Our (ferromagnetic interactions in the) spin model dramatically differ from the usual Heisenberg antiferromagnetic interactions expected at strong coupling. We show the ground state in some limits can be found exactly by employing a positive semidefinite “bond-operators” method. We then compute the excitation spectrum of the f moments in the ordered ground state, prove the stability of the ground state favored by RKKY interactions, and discuss the properties of the Goldstone modes, the (reason for the accidental) degeneracy of (some of) the excitation modes, and the physics of their phase stiffness. We develop a low-energy effective theory for the f moments and obtain analytic expressions for the dispersion of the collective modes. We discuss the relevance of our results to the spin-entropy experiments in TBG.},

We further investigate the stability of the Dirac Kondo semimetal by constructing a quantum phase diagram showing the interplay between Kondo hybridization and magnetic correlation.

A major obstacle for realizing low κ materials is Rayleigh’s law, which implies that acoustic phonons, which carry most of the heat, are insensitive to scattering by point defects at low energy. We demonstrate, with large scale simulations on tens of millions of atoms, that isotropic long-range spatial correlations in the defect distribution can dramatically reduce phonon lifetimes of important low-frequency heat-carrying modes, leading to a large reduction of κ —potentially an order of magnitude at room temperature. We propose a general and quantitative framework for controlling thermal transport in complex functional materials through structural spatial correlations, and we establish the optimal functional form of spatial correlations that minimize κ .

Different from those that previously relied on target normal sheath acceleration (TNSA), CSA in nature favors not only acceleration of deuterons (instead of hydrogen contaminants) but also increasing of the number of deuterons in the high-energy range, therefore having great advantages for production of high-flux neutron source. The proof-of-principle experiment has observed a typical CSA plateau feature from 2 to 6 MeV in deuteron energy spectrum and measured a forward neutron flux with yield 6.6 × 10 7 n / sr 6.6×107  n/sr from the LiF catcher target, an order of magnitude higher than the compared TNSA case, where the laser intensity is 10 19 W / cm 2 1019  W/cm2 . Self-consistent simulations have reproduced the experimental results and predicted that a high-flux forward neutron source with yield up to 5 × 10 10 n / sr 5×1010  n/sr can be obtained when laser intensity increases to 10 21 W / cm 2 1021  W/cm2 under the same laser energy.},

  abstract     = {In turbulent flows, kinetic energy is transferred from large spatial scales to small ones, where it is converted to heat by viscosity. For strong turbulence, i.e., high Reynolds numbers, Kolmogorov conjectured in 1941 that this energy transfer is dominated by inertial forces at intermediate spatial scales. Since Kolmogorov’s conjecture, the velocity difference statistics in this so-called inertial range have been expected to follow universal power laws for which theoretical predictions have been refined over the years. Here we present experimental results over an unprecedented range of Reynolds numbers in a well-controlled wind tunnel flow produced in the Max Planck Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel. We find that the measured second-order velocity difference statistics become independent of the Reynolds number, suggesting a universal behavior of decaying turbulence. However, we do not observe power laws even at the highest Reynolds number, i.e., at turbulence levels otherwise only attainable in atmospheric flows. Our results point to a Reynolds number-independent logarithmic correction to the classical power law for decaying turbulence that calls for theoretical understanding.},

While bulk-edge correspondence has been extensively studied in Hermitian systems, a non-Hermitian bulk could drastically modify the Hermitian topological band theory due to the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology, and its effect on bulk-edge correspondence is still an ongoing pursuit. Importantly, including non-Hermicity can significantly expand the horizon of topological states of matter and lead to a plethora of unique properties and device applications, an example of which is a topological laser. However, the bulk topology, and thereby the bulk-edge correspondence, in existing topological edge-mode lasers is not well defined. Here, we propose and experimentally probe topological edge-mode lasing with a well-defined non-Hermitian bulk topology in a one-dimensional (1D) array of coupled ring resonators. By modeling the Hamiltonian with an additional degree of freedom (referred to as synthetic dimension), our 1D structure is equivalent to a 2D non-Hermitian Chern insulator with precise mapping.

This type of indirect ICD even becomes the dominant process of electron emission in nearly the entire XUV range in large droplets with radius ≳ 40 nm .

  abstract     = {The β decays from both the ground state and a long-lived isomer of In 133 were studied at the ISOLDE Decay Station (IDS). With a hybrid detection system sensitive to β , γ , and neutron spectroscopy, the comparative partial half-lives ( log f t ) have been measured for all their dominant β -decay channels for the first time, including a low-energy Gamow-Teller transition and several first-forbidden (FF) transitions. Uniquely for such a heavy neutron-rich nucleus, their β decays selectively populate only a few isolated neutron unbound states in Sn 133 . Precise energy and branching-ratio measurements of those resonances allow us to benchmark β -decay theories at an unprecedented level in this region of the nuclear chart. The results show good agreement with the newly developed large-scale shell model (LSSM) calculations. The experimental findings establish an archetype for the β decay of neutron-rich nuclei southeast of Sn 132 and will serve as a guide for future theoretical development aiming to describe accurately the key β decays in the rapid-neutron capture ( r -) process.},

Isobaric collisions offer an easy route to establish explicit connections between the colliding nuclei’s structure and the observable outcomes. Here, we investigate the effects of nuclear skin thickness and nuclear deformations on the elliptic flow ( v 2 ) and its fluctuations in high-energy Ru 96 + Ru 96 and Zr 96 + Zr 96 collisions. Our findings reveal that the difference in skin thickness between these isobars only influences the inherent ellipticity of the collision systems, v 2 rp . In contrast, differences in nuclear deformations solely impact the fluctuations of v 2 around v 2 rp . Hence, we have identified a data-driven method to disentangle the effects of nuclear skin and nuclear deformations, marking a significant step toward assessing the consistency of nuclear phenomena across energy scales.},

Addressing this problem theoretically requires a real-time, nonperturbative method. It is well known that the Schwinger model [QED in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions] shares many common properties with QCD, including confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the existence of vacuum fermion condensate. As a step in developing such an approach, we report here on fully quantum simulations of a massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources representing quark and antiquark jets as produced in e + e − annihilation. We study, for the first time, the modification of the vacuum chiral condensate by the propagating jets and the quantum entanglement between the fragmenting jets. Our results indicate strong entanglement between the fragmentation products of the two jets at rapidity separations Δ η ≤ 2 , which can potentially exist also in QCD and can be studied in experiments.},

The reconstructed energy spectrum is unfolded into antineutrino energy and compared with both the Huber-Mueller model and a spectrum from a commercial reactor burning multiple fuel isotopes. A local excess over the model is observed in the 5–7 MeV energy region. Comparison of the PROSPECT results with those from commercial reactors provides new constraints on the origin of this excess, disfavoring at 2.0 and 3.7 standard deviations the hypotheses that antineutrinos from U 235 are solely responsible and noncontributors to the excess observed at commercial reactors, respectively.},

The mechanism is based on the existence of a heavy m N ∼ ( 0.1 − 1 ) MeV mostly sterile neutrino N which mixes with active neutrinos. N ’s are produced in the gamma-ray burst (GRB) in π and K decays via mixing with ν μ . They undergo the radiative decay N → ν γ on the way to Earth. The usual exponential attenuation of gamma rays is lifted to an attenuation inverse in the optical depth. Various restrictions on this scenario are discussed. We find that the high energy γ events at 18 TeV can be explained if (i) the GRB active neutrino fluence is close to the observed limit, (ii) the branching ratio of N → ν γ is at least of the order 10\%.},

We put forward the quantum counterpart of this fundamental primitive on streams of quantum data. We give a lower bound on the mean minimum delay when the expected time of a false alarm is asymptotically large, under the most general quantum detection strategy, which is given by a sequence of adaptive collective (potentially weak) measurements on the growing string of quantum data. In addition, we give particular strategies based on repeated measurements on independent blocks of samples that asymptotically attain the lower bound and thereby establish the ultimate quantum limit for quickest change-point detection.

  abstract     = {Efficient methods to access the entanglement of a quantum many-body state, where the complexity generally scales exponentially with the system size N , have long been a concern. Here we propose the Schmidt tensor network state (Schmidt TNS) that efficiently represents the Schmidt decomposition of finite- and even infinite-size quantum states with nontrivial bipartition boundary. The key idea is to represent the Schmidt coefficients (i.e., entanglement spectrum) and transformations in the decomposition to tensor networks (TNs) with linearly scaled complexity versus N . Specifically, the transformations are written as the TNs formed by local unitary tensors, and the Schmidt coefficients are encoded in a positive-definite matrix product state (MPS). Translational invariance can be imposed on the TNs and MPS for the infinite-size cases. The validity of Schmidt TNS is demonstrated by simulating the ground state of the quasi-one-dimensional spin model with geometrical frustration. Our results show that the MPS encoding the Schmidt coefficients is weakly entangled even when the entanglement entropy of the decomposed state is strong. This justifies the efficiency of using MPS to encode the Schmidt coefficients, and promises an exponential speedup on the full-state sampling tasks.},

In cases where exact expressions for these special eigenstates are not known, it is computationally demanding to distinguish them from their exponentially many thermal neighbors. We propose a matrix-product-state (MPS) algorithm, dubbed DMRG- S , to extract such states at system sizes far beyond the scope of exact diagonalization. Using this technique, we obtain scarred eigenstates in Rydberg-blockaded chains of up to 80 sites and perform a finite-size scaling study to address the lingering question of the stability for the Néel state revivals in the thermodynamic limit. Our method also provides a systematic way to obtain exact MPS representations for scarred eigenstates near the target energy without a priori knowledge. In particular, we find several new scarred eigenstates with exact MPS representations in kinetically constrained spin and clock models. The combination of numerical and analytical investigations in our work provides a new methodology for future studies of quantum many-body scars.},

  abstract     = {Recently discovered measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits provide a novel example of far-from-equilibrium quantum criticality. Here, we propose a highly efficient strategy for experimentally accessing these transitions through fluctuations. Instead of directly measuring entanglement entropy, which requires an exponential number of measurements in the subsystem size, our method provides a scalable approach to entanglement transitions in the presence of conserved quantities. In analogy to entanglement entropy and mutual information, we illustrate how bipartite and multipartite fluctuations can both be employed to analyze the measurement-induced criticality. Remarkably, the phase transition can be revealed by measuring fluctuations of only a handful of qubits.},

Following the gel formation, we monitor both the structure and dynamics before, during, and after the activation period. Before activity is switched on, the gel is slowly aging. During the activation, the mobility of the passive particles exhibits a characteristic scale-dependent response, while the colloidal network remains connected, and the gel maintains its structural integrity. Once activity is switched off, the gel stops aging and keeps the memory of the structure inherited from the active phase. Remarkably, the motility remains larger than that of the gel, before the active period. The system has turned into a genuinely softer gel, with frozen dynamics, but with more space for thermal fluctuations. The above conclusions remain valid long after the activity period.},

  abstract     = {Polymer nanocomposites have important material applications and are an ongoing focus of many molecular level investigations, however, puzzling experimental results exist. For example, specific volumes for some polymer nanocomposite matrices are 2\% to 4\% higher than for the neat polymer; in a pure polymer melt this would correspond to a pressure change of 40 to 100 MPa, and a decrease in isothermal segmental relaxation times of 3 to 5 orders of magnitude. However, the nanocomposite segmental dynamics do not show any speed up. We can explain this apparent uncoupling of dynamics from specific volume, and the key is to consider the system expansivity, i.e., the temperature dependence of the volumetric data, together with the concept of limiting volume at close liquid packing. Using pressure, volume, temperature data as a path to both, we are able to predict the effect of nanoadditives on the accessible, i.e., free, space in the material, which is critical for facilitating molecular rearrangements in dense systems. Our analysis explains why an increase in specific volume in a material may not always lead to faster segmental dynamics.},

Utilizing two different versions of zero-area loop Sagnac interferometers operating at 1550 nm wavelength, each with the fundamental attribute that without a time-reversal symmetry breaking sample at its path, the interferometer is perfectly reciprocal, we find no observable Kerr effect to within the noise floor limit of the apparatus at 30 nanoradians. Simultaneous coherent reflection ratio measurements confirm the sharpness of the charge-order transition in the same optical volume as the Kerr measurements. At finite magnetic field we observe a sharp onset of a diamagnetic shift in the Kerr signal at T * , which persists down to the lowest temperature without change in trend. Since 1550 nm is an energy that was shown to capture all features of the optical properties of the material that interact with the charge-order transition, we are led to conclude that it is highly unlikely that time-reversal symmetry is broken in the charge ordered state in CsV 3 Sb 5 .},

By combining direct experimental observations and theoretical analyses, we reveal that domain instability and extrinsic degradation processes can both be mitigated during the aging and fatigue processes, and demonstrate that this requires careful strain tuning of the ratio of in-plane and out-of-plane domain variants. Our findings advance the understanding of structural defects that drive domain nucleation and instabilities in ferroic materials and are essential for mitigating device degradation.},

However, there are currently no experimentally feasible protocols to measure TEE in condensed matter systems. Here, we propose a scheme to measure the TEE of chiral topological phases, carrying protected edge states, based on a nontrivial connection with the thermodynamic entropy change occurring in a quantum point contact (QPC) as it pinches off the topological liquid into two. We show how this entropy change can be extracted using Maxwell relations from charge detection of a nearby quantum dot. We demonstrate this explicitly for the Abelian Laughlin states, using an exact solution of the sine-Gordon model describing the universal crossover in the QPC. Our approach might open a new thermodynamic detection scheme of topological states also with non-Abelian statistics.},

Umklapp scattering is identified as the origin of momentum loss due to e − e scattering in dense metals. However, in dilute metals like lightly doped strontium titanate, the origin of T -square electrical resistivity in the absence of umklapp events is yet to be pinned down. Here, by separating electron and phonon contributions to heat transport, we extract the electronic thermal resistivity in niobium-doped strontium titanate and show that it also displays a T -square temperature dependence. Its amplitude correlates with the T -square electrical resistivity. The Wiedemann-Franz law strictly holds in the zero-temperature limit, but not at finite temperature, because the two T -square prefactors are different by a factor of ≈ 3 , like in other Fermi liquids. Recalling the case of He 3 , we argue that T -square thermal resistivity does not require umklapp events. The approximate recovery of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the presence of disorder would account for a T -square electrical resistivity without umklapp.},

Here, we report the discovery of crystal symmetry alternation induced band-gap oscillation in atomically thin PbTe films by scanning tunneling microscopy. As the thickness of PbTe films is reduced from an 18- to 2-atomic layer, the band-gap size not only expands from 0.19 eV to 1.06 eV by 5.6 fold, but also exhibits an even-odd-layer oscillation, which is attributed to the alternating crystal symmetries between P 4 / m m m and P 4 / n m m .

Here, we study the twist-angle-dependent coupling effects of h − BN / graphene heterostructures using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy. We find that the moiré potentials alter the band structure of graphene, resulting in a redshift of the intralayer transition at the M point, which becomes more pronounced up to 0.22 eV with increasing twist angle. Furthermore, the twisting of the Brillouin zone of h − BN relative to the graphene M point leads to tunable vertical transition energies in the range of 5.1–5.6 eV. Our findings indicate that twist-coupling effects of van der Waals heterostructures should be carefully considered in device fabrications, and the continuously tunable interband transitions through the twist angle can serve as a new degree of freedom to design optoelectrical devices.},

We call such noncentrosymmetric superconductors, moiré Ising superconductors. Because of the large Ising SOC, the depairing effect caused by the Zeeman field is negligible and the in-plane upper critical field ( B c 2 ) is determined by the orbital effects. This allows us to study the effect of large orbital fields. Interestingly, when the applied in-plane field is larger than the conventional orbital B c 2 , a finite-momentum pairing phase would appear which we call the orbital Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state. In this state, the Cooper pairs acquire a net momentum of 2 q B , where 2 q B = e B d is the momentum shift caused by the magnetic field B and d denotes the layer separation. This orbital field-driven FF state is different from the conventional FF state driven by Zeeman effects in Rashba superconductors. Remarkably, we predict that the FF pairing would result in a giant superconducting diode effect under electric gating when layer asymmetry is induced. An upturn of the B c 2 as the temperature is lowered, coupled with the giant superconducting diode effect, would allow the detection of the orbital FF state.},

This Letter reports on a scaled-down, proof-of-principle experiment on the OMEGA laser demonstrating, for the first time, the feasibility of DS formation. A shell is formed by convergent shocks launched by laser pulses at the edge of a plasma sphere, with the plasma itself formed as a result of laser-driven compression and relaxation of a surrogate plastic-foam ball target. Three x-ray diagnostics, namely, 1D spatially resolved self-emission streaked imaging, 2D self-emission framed imaging, and backlighting radiography, have shown good agreement with the predicted evolution of the DS and its stability to low Legendre mode perturbations introduced by laser irradiation and target asymmetries.},

Using a laser to heat a column of gas within an applied magnetic field, we isolate Nernst advection and show how it changes the field over a nanosecond timescale. Reconstruction of the magnetic field map from proton radiographs demonstrates that the field is advected by heat flow in advance of the plasma expansion with a velocity v N = ( 6 ± 2 ) × 10 5 m / s . Kinetic and extended magnetohydrodynamic simulations agree well in this regime due to the buildup of a magnetic transport barrier.},

The ST vortex beams are also applicable to other physical fields that involve wave phenomena, and here we develop the ST vortex concept in the field of acoustics and report the generation of Bessel-type ST acoustic vortex beams. The ST vortex beams are fully characterized using the scalar approach for the pressure field and the vector approach for the velocity field. We further investigate the transverse spreading effect and construct ST vortex beams with an ellipse-shaped spectrum to reduce the spreading effect. We also experimentally demonstrated the orthogonality relations between ST vortex beams with different charges. Our study successfully demonstrates the versatility of the acoustic system for exploring and discovering spatiotemporally structured waves, inspiring further investigation of exotic wave physics.},

Here, we propose and demonstrate a distinctive twig-shaped edge, thereby observing new edge states using a photonic platform. Our main findings are (i) the twig edge is a generic type of HCL edge complementary to the armchair edge, formed by choosing the right primitive cell rather than simple lattice cutting or Klein edge modification; (ii) the twig edge states form a complete flat band across the Brillouin zone with zero-energy degeneracy, characterized by nontrivial topological winding of the lattice Hamiltonian; (iii) the twig edge states can be elongated or compactly localized at the boundary, manifesting both flat band and topological features. Although realized here in a photonic graphene, such twig edge states should exist in other synthetic HCL structures. Moreover, our results may broaden the understanding of graphene edge states, as well as new avenues for realization of robust edge localization and nontrivial topological phases based on Dirac-like materials.},

This phenomenon leads to a Floquet band structure in the Bogoliubov spectrum of the fluid, and to characteristic oscillations of its intensity correlations. We characterize these oscillations in detail and point out their exponential growth at large propagation distances, revealing the presence of parametric resonances.},

Here, we demonstrate the localization of light in an instantaneously reconfigurable non-Hermitian honeycomb photonic lattice that is established in a coherently prepared atomic system. One set of the sublattices is optically modulated to introduce the absorptive difference between neighboring lattice sites, where the Dirac points in reciprocal space are extended into dispersionless local flat bands, with two shared eigenstates: low-loss (high-loss) one with fields confined at sublattice B ( A ). When these local flat bands are broad enough due to larger loss difference, the incident beam with its tangential wave vector being at the K point in reciprocal space is effectively localized at sublattice B with weaker absorption, namely, the commonly seen power exchange between adjacent channels in photonic lattices is effectively prohibited. The current work unlocks a new capability from non-Hermitian two-dimensional photonic lattices and provides an alternative route for engineering tunable local flat bands in photonic structures.},

Here, we propose an approach based on graph theory to study these polarization singularities in momentum space, especially in the region off the high-symmetry lines. With a polarization graph, it is demonstrated for the first time that BICs can stably exist off the high-symmetry lines of momentum space for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs. Furthermore, two kinds of interesting processes, including the merging involved with this newly found BICs both on and off the high-symmetry lines, are observed by changing the geometrical parameters of photonic crystal slabs while keeping their symmetry. Our findings provide a new perspective to explore polarization singularities in momentum space and render their further applications in light-matter interaction and light manipulation.},

To do so we consider two simplified, but otherwise rather generic cavity QED setups, which allow us to derive analytic expressions for the total ground-state energy and to distinguish explicitly between purely electrostatic and genuine vacuum-induced contributions. Importantly, this derivation takes the full electromagnetic spectrum into account while avoiding any ambiguities arising from an ad hoc mode truncation. Our findings show that while the effect of confinement per se is not enough to result in substantial vacuum-induced corrections, the presence of high-impedance modes, such as plasmons or engineered L C resonances, can drastically increase these effects. Therefore, we conclude that with appropriately designed experiments it is at least in principle possible to access a regime where light-matter interactions become nonperturbative.},

  abstract     = {The hadrochemistry of bottom quarks ( b ) produced in hadronic collisions encodes valuable information on the mechanism of color neutralization in these reactions. Since the b -quark mass is much larger than the typical hadronic scale of ∼ 1 GeV , b b ¯ pair production is expected to be well separated from subsequent hadronization processes. A significantly larger fraction of b baryons has been observed in proton-proton ( p p ) and proton-antiproton ( p p ¯ ) reactions relative to e + e − collisions, challenging theoretical descriptions. We address this problem by employing a statistical hadronization approach with an augmented set of b -hadron states beyond currently measured ones, guided by the relativistic quark model and lattice-QCD computations. Assuming relative chemical equilibrium between different b -hadron yields, thermal densities are used as fragmentation weights of b quarks into various hadron species. With quark model estimates of the decay patterns of excited states, the fragmentation fractions of weakly decaying b hadrons are computed and found to agree with measurements in p p ¯ collisions at the Tevatron. By combining transverse-momentum ( p T ) distributions of b quarks from perturbative QCD with thermal weights and independent fragmentation toward high p T , a fair description of the p T -dependent B ¯ s 0 / B − and Λ b 0 / B − ratios measured in p p collisions at the LHC is obtained. The observed enhancement of Λ b 0 production is attributed to the feeddown from thus far unobserved excited b baryons. Finally, we implement the hadrochemistry into a strongly coupled transport approach for b quarks in heavy-ion collisions, utilizing previously determined b -quark transport coefficients in the quark-gluon plasma, to highlight the modifications of hadrochemistry and collective behavior of b hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.},

The same results severely restrict the h -funnel region for positive μ ; however, the allowed points can be probed easily with few more days of data from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment. In the μ &lt; 0 scenario, we find that very light higgsinos in both the Z and h funnels might survive the present constraints from the electroweakino searches at the LHC, and dedicated efforts from experimental collaborations are necessary to make conclusive statements about their present status.},

We calculate the former by harnessing powerful collider-physics techniques such as reverse unitarity, thereby reducing them to cut two-loop integrals, and cross check the result by performing an independent calculation in the post-Newtonian limit.

Here, we point out a more sophisticated algebraic structure when solitons of different dimensions coexist in the spectrum. We uncover this phenomenon in a concrete quantum field theory, the 4D C P 1 model. This model has two kinds of solitonic excitations—vortices and hopfions—which would follow two U ( 1 ) solitonic symmetries according to homotopy groups. Nevertheless, we demonstrate the nonexistence of the hopfion U ( 1 ) symmetry by evaluating the hopfion charge of vortex operators. We clarify that what conserves hopfion numbers is a noninvertible symmetry generated by 3D spin topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). Its invertible part is just Z 2 , which we recognize as a spin bordism invariant. Compared with the 3D C P 1 model, our work suggests a unified description of solitonic symmetries and couplings to topological phases.},

It results in a short-lived remnant with the lifetime of ≈ 0.017 s , and subsequent massive torus formation with the mass of ≈ 0.05 M ⊙ after the remnant collapses to a black hole. For the first time, we find that after the dynamical mass ejection, which drives the fast tail and mildly relativistic components, the postmerger mass ejection from the massive torus takes place due to the magnetorotational instability-driven turbulent viscosity in a single simulation and the two ejecta components are seen in the distributions of the electron fraction and velocity with distinct features.},

In this work we point out that their annihilation to visible matter inside large-volume neutrino telescopes can provide a new way to constrain or discover such particles. The signal is the most pronounced for relic masses in the GeV range, and can be efficiently constrained by existing Super-Kamiokande searches for dinucleon annihilation. We also provide an explicit realization of this scenario in the form of secluded dark matter coupled to a dark photon, and we show that the present method implies novel and stringent bounds on the model that are complementary to direct constraints from beam dumps, colliders, and direct detection experiments.},

Here, we show that Stark systems can be used as a probe for the precise measurement of gradient fields, particularly in the weak-field regime where most sensors do not operate optimally. In the extended phase, Stark probes achieve super-Heisenberg precision, which is well beyond most of the known quantum sensing schemes. In the localized phase, the precision drops in a universal way showing fast convergence to the thermodynamic limit. For single-particle probes, we show that quantum-enhanced sensitivity, with super-Heisenberg precision, can be achieved through a simple position measurement for all the eigenstates across the entire spectrum. For such probes, we have identified several critical exponents of the Stark localization transition and established their relationship. Thermal fluctuations, whose universal behavior is identified, reduce the precision from super-Heisenberg to Heisenberg, still outperforming classical sensors. Multiparticle interacting probes also achieve super-Heisenberg scaling in their extended phase, which shows even further enhancement near the transition point. Quantum-enhanced sensitivity is still achievable even when state preparation time is included in resource analysis.},

We present a heuristic classical algorithm that attains a better XE than the current BS experiments in a verifiable regime and is likely to attain a better XE score than the near-future BS experiments in a reasonable running time. The key idea behind the algorithm is that there exist distributions that correlate with the ideal BS probability distribution and that can be efficiently computed. The correlation and the computability of the distribution enable us to postselect heavy outcomes of the ideal probability distribution without computing the ideal probability, which essentially leads to a large XE. Our method scores a better XE than the recent Gaussian BS experiments when implemented at intermediate, verifiable system sizes. Much like current state-of-the-art experiments, we cannot verify that our spoofer works for quantum-advantage-size systems. However, we demonstrate that our approach works for much larger system sizes in fermion sampling, where we can efficiently compute output probabilities. Finally, we provide analytic evidence that the classical algorithm is likely to spoof noisy BS efficiently.},

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions to certify the entanglement dimension in a steering scenario. These conditions are stated in terms of a hierarchy of semidefinite programs, which can also be used to quantify the phenomenon using the steering dimension robustness. To demonstrate the practical viability of our method, we characterize the dimensionality of entanglement in steering scenarios prepared with maximally entangled states measured in mutually unbiased bases.

These channels hence have a memory and are promising elements in brain-inspired (iontronic) circuits. We show here that the memory of such channels stems from transient concentration polarization over the ionic diffusion time. We derive an analytic approximation for these dynamics which shows good agreement with full finite-element calculations. Using our analytic approximation, we propose an experimentally realizable Hodgkin-Huxley iontronic circuit where micrometer cones take on the role of sodium and potassium channels. Our proposed circuit exhibits key features of neuronal communication such as all-or-none action potentials upon a pulse stimulus and a spike train upon a sustained stimulus.},

As a second-order phase transition it exhibits a scale invariant critical point, at which the rigid clusters are random fractals. We show, using numerical analysis, that these clusters are also conformally invariant, and we use conformal field theory to predict the form of universal finite-size effects. Furthermore, although connectivity and rigidity percolation are usually thought to be of fundamentally different natures, we provide evidence of unexpected similarities between the statistical properties of their random clusters at criticality. Our work opens a new research avenue through the application of the powerful 2D conformal field theory tools to understand the critical behavior of a wide range of physical and biological materials exhibiting such a mechanical transition.},

The network dynamics results from the interplay between a nonlinear function of the flow, dissipation, and Gaussian, additive noise. For a given set of parameters and finite noise amplitudes, the network self-organizes into one of several metastable configurations, according to a probability distribution that depends on the noise amplitude α . At a finite value α , we find a resonantlike behavior for which one network topology is the most probable stationary state. This specific topology maximizes the robustness and transport efficiency, it is reached with the maximal convergence rate, and it is not found by the noiseless dynamics. We argue that this behavior is a manifestation of noise-induced resonances in network self-organization. Our findings show that stochastic dynamics can boost transport on a nonlinear network and, further, suggest a change of paradigm about the role of noise in optimization algorithms.},

The OLED overpotential, which does not reduce the power conversion efficiency, is minimized by having a small exciton binding energy, a long exciton lifetime, and a large Langevin coefficient for electron-hole recombination. Based on these results, it seems likely that the best phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs reported to date approach their thermodynamic limit. The framework developed here is broadly applicable to other excitonic materials, and should therefore help guide the development of low voltage LEDs for display and solid-state lighting applications.},

  abstract     = {Exceptional points (EPs) are special spectral singularities at which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become identical. In conventional wisdom, the coalescence of eigenvectors inevitably leads to the loss of completeness of the eigenbasis. Here, we show that this scenario breaks down in general at nonlinear EPs (NEPs). As an example, we realize a fifth-order NEP ( NEP 5 ) within only three coupled resonators with both a theoretical model and simulations in circuits. One stable and another four auxiliary steady eigenstates of the nonlinear Hamiltonian coalesce at the NEP 5 , and the response of eigenfrequency to perturbations demonstrates a fifth-order root law. Intriguingly, the biorthogonal eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian governing the system dynamics is still complete, and this fact is corroborated by a finite Petermann factor instead of a divergent one at conventional EPs. Consequently, the amplification of noise, which diverges at other EPs, converges at our NEP 5 . Our finding transforms the understanding of EPs and shows potential for miniaturizing various key applications operating near EPs.},

So far, the transverse magnetization (TM) has been attributed to either the spin canting effect or the presence of cluster magnetic multipolar ordering. However, a general theory of TM based on microscopic understanding is still missing. Here, we construct a general microscopic theory of TM in antiferromagnets with cluster magnetic multipolar ordering by considering classical spin Hamiltonians with spin anisotropy that arises from the spin-orbit coupling. First, from general symmetry analysis, we show that TM can appear only when all crystalline symmetries are broken other than the antiunitary mirror, antiunitary twofold rotation, and inversion symmetries. Moreover, by analyzing spin Hamiltonians, we show that TM always appears when the degenerate ground state manifold of the spin Hamiltonian is discrete, as long as it is not prohibited by symmetry. On the other hand, when the degenerate ground state manifold is continuous, TM generally does not appear except when the magnetic field direction and the spin configuration satisfy specific geometric conditions under single-ion anisotropy. Finally, we show that TM can induce the anomalous planar Hall effect, a unique transport phenomenon that can be used to probe multipolar antiferromagnetic structures. We believe that our theory provides a useful guideline for understanding the anomalous magnetic responses of the antiferromagnets with complex magnetic structures.},

The detection and characterization of ObD in real materials currently lacks clear, qualitative signatures that distinguish ObD from conventional energetic selection. We show that for order by thermal disorder (ObTD) such a signature exists: a characteristic temperature dependence of the fluctuation-induced pseudo-Goldstone gap. We demonstrate this in a minimal two-dimensional model that exhibits ObTD, the ferromagnetic Heisenberg-compass model on a square lattice. Using spin-dynamics simulations and self-consistent mean-field calculations, we determine the pseudo-Goldstone gap, Δ , and show that at low temperatures it scales as the square root of temperature, T . We establish that a power-law temperature dependence of the gap is a general consequence of ObTD, showing that all key features of this physics can be captured in a simple model of a particle moving in an effective potential generated by the fluctuation-induced free energy.},

While the current from Bloch oscillations can be localized by increasing field strength, the current from the geometric orbits saturates to a nonzero plateau in the strong-field limit. In nonmagnetic materials, the geometric oscillations are even under inversion of the applied field, whereas the Bloch oscillations are odd, a property that can be used to distinguish these two coexisting effects.},

Jiang et al. , arXiv:2209.07103 ]. Here we study, by means of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, the scaling behavior of the disorder operator in correlated Dirac systems. We first demonstrate the logarithmic scaling behavior of the disorder operator at the Gross-Neveu (GN) chiral Ising and Heisenberg QCPs, where consistent conformal field theory (CFT) content of the GN-QCP in its coefficient is found. Then we study a 2D monopole-free deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) realized between a quantum-spin Hall insulator and a superconductor. Our data point to negative values of the logarithmic coefficients such that the DQCP does not correspond to a unitary CFT. Density matrix renormalization group calculations of the disorder operator on a 1D DQCP model also detect emergent continuous symmetries.},

  abstract     = {Kagome materials are emerging platforms for studying charge and spin orders. In this Letter, we have revealed a rich lattice instability in a Z 2 kagome metal ScV 6 Sn 6 by first-principles calculations. Beyond verifying the 3 × 3 × 3 charge density wave (CDW) order observed by the recent experiment, we further identified three more possible CDW structures, i.e., 3 × 3 × 2 CDW with P 6 / m m m symmetry, 2 × 2 × 2 CDW with I m m m symmetry, and 2 × 2 × 2 CDW with P 6 / m m m symmetry. The former two are more energetically favored than the 3 × 3 × 3 phase, while the third one is comparable in energy. These CDW distortions involve mainly out-of-plane motions of Sc and Sn atoms, while V atoms constituting the kagome net are almost unchanged. We attribute the lattice instability to the smallness of Sc atomic radius. In contrast, such instability disappears in its sister compounds R V 6 Sn 6 ( R is Y, or a rare-earth element), which exhibit quite similar electronic band structures to the Sc compound, because R has a larger atomic radius. Our work indicates that ScV 6 Sn 6 might exhibit varied CDW phases in different experimental conditions and provides insights to explore rich charge orders in kagome materials.},

  abstract     = {Time-dependent driving of quantum systems has emerged as a powerful tool to engineer exotic phases far from thermal equilibrium, but in the presence of many-body interactions it also leads to runaway heating, so that generic systems are believed to heat up until they reach a featureless infinite-temperature state. Understanding the mechanisms by which such a heat death can be slowed down or even avoided is a major goal—one such mechanism is to drive toward an even distribution of electrons in momentum space. Here we show how such a mechanism avoids runaway heating for an interacting charge-density-wave chain with a macroscopic number of conserved quantities when driven by a strong dc electric field; minibands with nontrivial distribution functions develop as the current is prematurely driven to zero. Moreover, when approaching a zero-temperature resonance, the field strength can tune between positive, negative, or close-to-infinite effective temperatures for each miniband. Our results suggest that nontrivial metastable distribution functions should be realized in the prethermal regime of quantum systems coupled to slow bosonic modes.},

  abstract     = {Chiral anomaly as the hallmark feature lies in the heart of the researches for Weyl semimetal. It is rooted in the zeroth Landau level of the system with an applied magnetic field. Chirality or antichirality characterizes the propagation property of the one-way zeroth Landau level mode, and antichirality means an opposite group velocity compared to the case of chirality. Chirality is commonly observed for Weyl semimetals. Interestingly, the type-II Weyl point, with the overtilted dispersion, may flip the chirality to the antichirality, which, however, is yet to be evidenced despite numerous previous experimental efforts. Here, we implement the type-II Weyl point in sonic crystals, and by creating the pseudomagnetic fields with geometric deformation, the chirality flip of zeroth Landau levels is unambiguously demonstrated. Our Letter unveils the novel antichiral transport in the presence of time-reversal symmetry, and paves the way toward the state-of-the-art manipulation of sound waves.},

Despite recent progress in non-Hermitian thermal diffusion, all state-of-the-art approaches fail to exhibit chiral states or directional robustness in heat transport. Here we report the first discovery of chiral heat transport, which is manifested only in the vicinity of EP but suppressed at the EP of a thermal system. The chiral heat transport demonstrates significant robustness against drastically varying advections and thermal perturbations imposed. Our results reveal the chirality in heat transport process and provide a novel strategy for manipulating mass, charge, and diffusive light.},

We show that, while the system exhibits a negative parabolic magnetoresistance at low temperatures ( ≲ 0.4 K ) characteristic of an interacting Fermi liquid, a positive magnetoresistance emerges unexpectedly at higher temperatures, and grows with increasing temperature even in the regime T ∼ E F , close to the Fermi energy. This unusual positive magnetoresistance at high temperatures can be attributed to the viscous transport of 2D hole fluid in the hydrodynamic regime where holes scatter frequently with each other. These findings give insight into the collective transport of strongly interacting carriers in the r s ≫ 1 regime and new routes toward magnetoresistance at high temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the Josephson diode effect (JDE), in which the superconducting critical current magnitudes differ when the currents flow in opposite directions, has attracted great interest. In particular, it was demonstrated that gate-defined Josephson junctions based on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene showed a strong nonreciprocal effect when the weak-link region is gated to a correlated insulating state at half filling (two holes per moiré cell). However, the mechanism behind such a phenomenon is not yet understood. In this Letter, we show that the interaction-driven valley polarization, together with the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface, induce the JDE. The valley polarization, which lifts the degeneracy of the states in the two valleys, induces a relative phase difference between the first and the second harmonics of the supercurrent and results in the JDE. We further show that the nontrivial current phase relation, which is responsible for the JDE, also generates the asymmetric Shapiro steps.},

Theoretical and experimental works have revealed promising ternary compounds that superconduct at or above room temperature, but it remains a pressing challenge to synthesize stoichiometric ternary compounds with a well-resolved crystal structure that can host high-temperature superconductivity at submegabar pressures. Here, we report on the successful synthesis of ternary LaBeH 8 obtained via compression in a diamond anvil cell under 110–130 GPa. X-ray diffraction unveils a rocksalt-like structure composing La and BeH 8 units in the lattice. Transport measurements determined superconductivity with critical temperature T c up to 110 K at 80 GPa, as evidenced by a sharp drop of resistivity to zero and a characteristic shift of T c driven by a magnetic field. Our experiment establishes the first superconductive ternary compound with a resolved crystal structure. These findings raise the prospects of rational development of the class of high- T c superhydrides among ternary compounds, opening greatly expanded and more diverse structural space for exploration and discovery of superhydrides with enhanced high- T c superconductivity.},

Pore-scale solute transport limitations can reduce reaction rates, with marked consequences for a wide spectrum of natural and engineered processes. Recent advances show that chaotic mixing occurs spontaneously in porous media, but its impact on surface reactions is unknown. We show that pore-scale chaotic mixing significantly increases reaction efficiency compared to nonchaotic flows. We find that reaction rates are well described in terms of diffusive first-passage times of reactants to the solid interface subjected to a stochastic restart process resulting from Lagrangian chaos. Under chaotic mixing, the shear layer at no-slip interfaces sets the restart rate and leads to a characteristic scaling of reaction efficiency with Péclet number, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Reaction rates are insensitive to the flow topology as long as flow is chaotic, suggesting the relevance of this process to a broad range of porous materials.},

  abstract     = {Topological effects in photonic non-Hermitian systems have recently led to extraordinary discoveries including nonreciprocal lasing, topological insulator lasers, and topological metamaterials, to mention a few. These effects, although realized in non-Hermitian systems, are all stemming from their Hermitian components. Here we experimentally demonstrate the topological skin effect and boundary sensitivity, induced by the imaginary gauge field in a two-dimensional laser array, which are fundamentally different from any Hermitian topological effects and intrinsic to open systems. By selectively and asymmetrically injecting gain into the system, we have synthesized an imaginary gauge field on chip, which can be flexibly reconfigured on demand. We show not only that the non-Hermitian topological features remain intact in a nonlinear nonequilibrium system, but also that they can be harnessed to enable persistent phase locking with intensity morphing. Our work lays the foundation for a dynamically reconfigurable on-chip coherent system with robust scalability, attractive for building high-brightness sources with arbitrary intensity profiles.},

However, existing continuous state transfer protocols operate in the resolved sideband regime, necessitating a high-quality optical cavity and a high mechanical resonance frequency. Here, we propose a continuous protocol that operates in the unresolved sideband regime. The protocol is based on feedback cooling, can be implemented with current technology, and is able to transfer non-Gaussian quantum states with high fidelity. Our protocol significantly expands the kinds of optomechanical devices for which continuous optical-to-mechanical state transfer is possible, paving the way toward quantum technological applications and the preparation of macroscopic superpositions to test the fundamentals of quantum science.},

  abstract     = {Quantum models based on few-mode master equations have been a central tool in the study of resonator quantum electrodynamics, extending the seminal single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model to include loss and multiple modes. Despite their broad application range, previous approaches within this framework have either relied on a Markov approximation or a fitting procedure. By combining ideas from pseudomode and quasinormal mode theory, we develop a certification criterion for multi-mode effects in lossy resonators. It is based on a witness observable, and neither requires a fitting procedure nor a Markov approximation. Using the resulting criterion, we demonstrate that such multi-mode effects are important for understanding previous experiments in x-ray cavity QED with Mössbauer nuclei and that they allow one to tune the nuclear ensemble properties.},

  abstract     = {Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems have recently attracted wide interest and spawned intriguing prospects for enhanced sensing. However, EPs have not yet been realized in thermal atomic ensembles, which is one of the most important platforms for quantum sensing. Here we experimentally observe EPs in multilevel thermal atomic ensembles and realize enhanced sensing of the magnetic field for 1 order of magnitude. We take advantage of the rich energy levels of atoms and construct effective decays for selected energy levels by employing laser coupling with the excited state, yielding unbalanced decay rates for different energy levels, which finally results in the existence of EPs. Furthermore, we propose the optical polarization rotation measurement scheme to detect the splitting of the resonance peaks, which makes use of both the absorption and dispersion properties and shows an advantage with enhanced splitting compared with the conventional transmission measurement scheme. Additionally, in our system both the effective coupling strength and decay rates are flexibly adjustable, and thus the position of the EPs are tunable, which expands the measurement range. Our Letter not only provides a new controllable platform for studying EPs and non-Hermitian physics, but also provide new ideas for the design of EP-enhanced sensors and opens up realistic opportunities for practical applications in the high-precision sensing of magnetic field and other physical quantities.},

In the static case it shows no presence of the horizon while it has a wormhole structure mimicking the black hole. In the dynamical case, perturbed by a pulse of classical matter, there appears an apparent horizon while the spacetime remains to be a regular causal diamond. We compute the asymptotic radiation both in the static and dynamical case.

  abstract     = {Multiple viable theoretical models predict heavy dark matter particles with a mass close to the Planck mass, a range relatively unexplored by current experimental measurements. We use 219.4 days of data collected with the XENON1T experiment to conduct a blind search for signals from multiply interacting massive particles (MIMPs). Their unique track signature allows a targeted analysis with only 0.05 expected background events from muons. Following unblinding, we observe no signal candidate events. This Letter places strong constraints on spin-independent interactions of dark matter particles with a mass between 1 × 10 12 and 2 × 10 17 GeV / c 2 . In addition, we present the first exclusion limits on spin-dependent MIMP-neutron and MIMP-proton cross sections for dark matter particles with masses close to the Planck scale.},

  abstract     = {The Trotter-Suzuki decomposition is a promising avenue for digital quantum simulation (DQS), approximating continuous-time dynamics by discrete Trotter steps of duration τ . Recent work suggested that DQS is typically characterized by a sharp Trotter transition: when τ is increased beyond a threshold value, approximation errors become uncontrolled at large times due to the onset of quantum chaos. Here, we contrast this picture with the case of integrable DQS. We focus on a simple quench from a spin-wave state in the prototypical XXZ Heisenberg spin chain, and study its integrable Trotterized evolution as a function of τ . Because of its exact local conservation laws, the system does not heat up to infinite temperature and the late-time properties of the dynamics are captured by a discrete generalized Gibbs ensemble (dGGE). By means of exact calculations we find that, for small τ , the dGGE depends analytically on the Trotter step, implying that discretization errors remain bounded even at infinite times. Conversely, the dGGE changes abruptly at a threshold value τ th , signaling a novel type of Trotter transition. We show that the latter can be detected locally, as it is associated with the appearance of a nonzero staggered magnetization with a subtle dependence on τ . We highlight the differences between continuous and discrete GGEs, suggesting the latter as novel interesting nonequilibrium states exclusive to digital platforms.},

Here, we show that mode-based linear models inferred from experimental live-imaging data can provide an accurate low-dimensional description of undulatory locomotion in worms, centipedes, robots, and snakes. By incorporating physical symmetries and known biological constraints into the dynamical model, we find that the shape dynamics are generically governed by Schrödinger equations in mode space. The eigenstates of the effective biophysical Hamiltonians and their adiabatic variations enable the efficient classification and differentiation of locomotion behaviors in natural, simulated, and robotic organisms using Grassmann distances and Berry phases. While our analysis focuses on a widely studied class of biophysical locomotion phenomena, the underlying approach generalizes to other physical or living systems that permit a mode representation subject to geometric shape constraints.},

Yet, there is no comprehensive understanding of how crowding affects reactions, particularly multivalent binding. Herein, we use scaled particle theory and develop a molecular simulation method to investigate the binding of monovalent to divalent biomolecules. We find that crowding can increase or reduce cooperativity—the extent to which the binding of a second molecule is enhanced after binding a first molecule—by orders of magnitude, depending on the sizes of the involved molecular complexes. Cooperativity generally increases when a divalent molecule swells and then shrinks upon binding two ligands. Our calculations also reveal that, in some cases, crowding enables binding that does not occur otherwise. As an immunological example, we consider immunoglobulin G-antigen binding and show that crowding enhances its cooperativity in bulk but reduces it when an immunoglobulin G binds antigens on a surface.},

While strong linear optical transition around the nodal loop may potentially generate giant shift current, an E ext can effectively control the radius of the nodal loop, which can continuously modulate the shift-vector components inside and outside the nodal loop holding opposite signs. This concept has been demonstrated in the HNL HSnN / MoS 2 system using first-principles calculations. The HSnN / MoS 2 heterobilayer can not only produce a shift-current conductivity with magnitude that is one to two orders larger than other reported systems, but it can also realize a giant bulk electrophotovoltaic effect.

  abstract     = {In solid state physics, any phase transition is commonly observed as a change in the microscopic distribution of charge, spin, or current. However, there is an exotic order parameter inherent in the localized electron orbitals that cannot be primarily captured by these three fundamental quantities. This order parameter is described as the electric toroidal multipoles connecting different total angular momenta under the spin-orbit coupling. The corresponding microscopic physical quantity is the spin current tensor on an atomic scale, which induces spin-derived electric polarization aligned circularly and the chirality density of the Dirac equation. Here, elucidating the nature of this exotic order parameter, we obtain the following general consequences that are not restricted to localized electron systems; chirality density is indispensable to unambiguously describe electronic states and it is a species of electric toroidal multipoles, just as the charge density is a species of electric multipoles. Furthermore, we derive the equation of continuity for chirality and discuss its relation to chiral anomaly and optical chirality. These findings link microscopic spin currents and chirality in the Dirac theory to the concept of multipoles and provide a new perspective for quantum states of matter.},

What was previously thought of as a broad excitation continuum [L. Facheris et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 129 , 087201 (2022) ] is shown to be a series of dispersive bound states reminiscent of “Zeeman ladders” in quasi-one-dimensional Ising systems. At wave vectors where interchain interactions cancel at the mean field level, they can indeed be interpreted as bound finite-width kinks in individual chains. Elsewhere in the Brillouin zone their true two-dimensional structure and propagation are revealed.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between acoustic wave and magnetization in ferromagnetic thin films has attracted great attention due to its interesting physics and potential applications. However, up to now, the magneto-acoustic interaction has mainly been studied on the basis of magnetostriction. In this Letter, we develop a phase field model of magneto-acoustic interaction based on the Einstein–de Haas effect, and predict the acoustic wave during the ultrafast core reversal of magnetic vortex in a ferromagnetic disk. Because of the Einstein–de Haas effect, the ultrafast change of magnetization at the vortex core leads to a large mechanical angular momentum, which induces a body couple at the vortex core and excites a high-frequency acoustic wave. Moreover, the displacement amplitude of the acoustic wave is highly dependent on the gyromagnetic ratio. The smaller the gyromagnetic ratio is, the larger the displacement amplitude is. The present work not only provides a new mechanism for dynamic magnetoelastic coupling but also sheds new insights on the magneto-acoustic interaction.},

  abstract     = {As a fundamental concept of all crystals, space groups are partitioned into symmorphic groups and nonsymmorphic groups. Each nonsymmorphic group contains glide reflections or screw rotations with fractional lattice translations, which are absent in symmorphic groups. Although nonsymmorphic groups ubiquitously exist on real-space lattices, on the reciprocal lattices in momentum space, the ordinary theory only allows symmorphic groups. In this work, we develop a novel theory for momentum-space nonsymmorphic space groups ( k -NSGs), utilizing the projective representations of space groups. The theory is quite general: Given any k -NSGs in any dimensions, it can identify the real-space symmorphic space groups ( r -SSGs) and construct the corresponding projective representation of the r -SSG that leads to the k -NSG. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our theory, we show these projective representations and therefore all k -NSGs can be realized by gauge fluxes over real-space lattices. Our work fundamentally extends the framework of crystal symmetry, and therefore can accordingly extend any theory based on crystal symmetry, for instance, the classification crystalline topological phases.},

  abstract     = {A resistor at finite temperature produces white noise fluctuations of the current called Johnson-Nyquist noise. Measuring the amplitude of this noise provides a powerful primary thermometry technique to access the electron temperature. In practical situations, however, one needs to generalize the Johnson-Nyquist theorem to handle spatially inhomogeneous temperature profiles. Recent work provided such a generalization for Ohmic devices obeying the Wiedemann-Franz law, but there is a need to provide a similar generalization for hydrodynamic electron systems, since hydrodynamic electrons provide unusual sensitivity for Johnson noise thermometry but they do not admit a local conductivity nor obey the Wiedemann-Franz law. Here we address this need by considering low-frequency Johnson noise in the hydrodynamic setting for a rectangular geometry. Unlike in the Ohmic setting, we find that the Johnson noise is geometry dependent due to nonlocal viscous gradients. Nonetheless, ignoring the geometric correction only leads to an error of at most 40\% as compared to naively using the Ohmic result.},

However, the highest superconducting critical temperature ( T c ) yet observed in elements has not exceeded 30 K. Discovering elemental superconductors with a higher T c is one of the most fundamental and challenging tasks in condensed matter physics. In this study, by applying high pressure up to approximately 260 GPa, we demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature of elemental scandium (Sc) can be increased to 36 K from the transport measurement, which is a record-high T c for superconducting elements. The pressure dependence of T c implies the occurrence of multiple phase transitions in Sc, which is in agreement with previous x-ray diffraction results. Optimization of T c is achieved in the Sc-V phase, which can be attributed to the strong coupling between d electrons and moderate-frequency phonons, as suggested by our first-principles calculations. This study provides insights for exploring new high- T c elemental metals.},

For a multipocket scenario, a sign-changing order parameter such as an s ± wave likewise yields a HF signature.

The only assumption made is that the emitter excitation and photon number are stochastic variables with integer values. This extends the validity of rate equations beyond the mean-field limit and avoids using the standard Langevin approach, which is shown to fail for few emitters. The model is validated by comparison to full quantum simulations of the relative intensity noise and second-order intensity correlation function, g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) . Surprisingly, even when the full quantum model displays vacuum Rabi oscillations, which are not accounted for by rate equations, the intensity quantum noise is correctly predicted by the stochastic approach. Adopting a simple discretization of the emitter and photon populations, thus, goes a long way in describing quantum noise in lasers. Besides providing a versatile and easy-to-use tool for modeling emerging nanolasers, these results provide insight into the fundamental nature of quantum noise in lasers.},

By constraining oscillations of the fine-structure constant α with these measurement results, we improve existing bounds on the scalar coupling d e of ultralight dark matter to photons for dark matter masses in the range of about ( 10 − 24 – 10 − 17 ) eV / c 2 . These results constitute an improvement by more than an order of magnitude over previous investigations for most of this range. We also use the repeated measurements of ν E 3 / ν E 2 to improve existing limits on a linear temporal drift of α and its coupling to gravity.},

However, previous demonstrations on TF-QKD require the phase locking technique to coherently control the twin light fields, inevitably complicating the system with extra fiber channels and peripheral hardware. Here, we propose and demonstrate an approach to recover the single-photon interference pattern and realize TF-QKD without phase locking. Our approach separates the communication time into reference frames and quantum frames, where the reference frames serve as a flexible scheme for establishing the global phase reference. To do so, we develop a tailored algorithm based on fast Fourier transform to efficiently reconcile the phase reference via data postprocessing. We demonstrate no-phase-locking TF-QKD from short to long distances over standard optical fibers. At 50-km standard fiber, we produce a high secret key rate (SKR) of 1.27 Mbit / s , while at 504-km standard fiber, we obtain the repeaterlike key rate scaling with a SKR of 34 times higher than the repeaterless secret key capacity. Our work provides a scalable and practical solution to TF-QKD, thus representing an important step towards its wide applications.},

Recent breakthrough of twin-field (TF) QKD can overcome this limit and enables long distance quantum communication, but its implementation necessitates complex global phase tracking and requires strong phase references that not only add to noise but also reduce the duty cycle for quantum transmission. Here, we resolve these shortcomings, and importantly achieve even higher SKRs than TF-QKD, via implementing an innovative but simpler measurement-device-independent QKD that realizes repeaterlike communication through asynchronous coincidence pairing. Over 413 and 508 km optical fibers, we achieve finite-size SKRs of 590.61 and 42.64 bit / s , which are respectively 1.80 and 4.08 times of their corresponding absolute rate limits. Significantly, the SKR at 306 km exceeds 5 kbit / s and meets the bitrate requirement for live one-time-pad encryption of voice communication.

Thus, we achieve a noise-resilient phase estimation without any quantum resource overhead. The simulated experiments show that our method can significantly reduce the estimation error of the phases by up to 2 orders of magnitude.

One instability toward thermalization of MBL systems is the so-called “avalanche,” where a locally thermalizing rare region is able to spread thermalization through the full system. The spreading of the avalanche may be modeled and numerically studied in finite one-dimensional MBL systems by weakly coupling an infinite-temperature bath to one end of the system. We find that the avalanche spreads primarily via strong many-body resonances between rare near-resonant eigenstates of the closed system. Thus we find and explore a detailed connection between many-body resonances and avalanches in MBL systems.},

Renyi entropies exhibit volume law scaling with a subleading constant governed by a “ g function” in conformal field theory, allowing us to define a notion of renormalization group (RG) flow (or “phase transitions”) between quantum channels. We also find that the entropy of a subsystem in the decohered state has a subleading logarithmic scaling with subsystem size, and we relate it to correlation functions of boundary condition changing operators in the conformal field theory. Finally, we find that the subsystem entanglement negativity, a measure of quantum correlations within mixed states, can exhibit log scaling or area law based on the RG flow. When the channel corresponds to a marginal perturbation, the coefficient of the log scaling can change continuously with decoherence strength. We illustrate all these possibilities for the critical ground state of the transverse-field Ising model, in which we identify four RG fixed points of dephasing channels and verify the RG flow numerically. Our results are relevant to quantum critical states realized on noisy quantum simulators, in which our predicted entanglement scaling can be probed via shadow tomography methods.},

Here we extend these studies to many-body systems possessing a true classical limit characterized by a high-dimensional chaotic phase space, which are not subject to any particular dynamical constraint. We demonstrate genuine quantum scarring of wave functions concentrated in the vicinity of unstable classical periodic mean-field modes in the paradigmatic Bose-Hubbard model. These peculiar quantum many-body states exhibit distinct phase-space localization about those classical modes. Their existence is consistent with Heller’s scar criterion and appears to persist in the thermodynamic long-lattice limit. Launching quantum wave packets along such scars leads to observable long-lasting oscillations, featuring periods that scale asymptotically with classical Lyapunov exponents, and displaying intrinsic irregularities that reflect the underlying chaotic dynamics, as opposed to regular tunnel oscillations.},

  abstract     = {In closed generic many-body systems, unitary evolution disperses local quantum information into highly nonlocal objects, resulting in thermalization. Such a process is called information scrambling, whose swiftness is quantified by the operator size growth. However, the impact of couplings to the environment on the process of information scrambling remains unexplored for quantum systems embedded within an environment. Here we predict a dynamical transition in quantum systems with all-to-all interactions accompanied by an environment, which separates two phases. In the dissipative phase, information scrambling halts as the operator size decays with time, while in the scrambling phase, dispersion of information persists, and the operator size grows and saturates to an O ( N ) value in the long-time limit with N the number of degrees of freedom of the systems. The transition is driven by the competition between the system’s intrinsic and environment propelled scramblings and the environment-induced dissipation. Our prediction is derived from a general argument based on epidemiological models and demonstrated analytically via solvable Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. We provide further evidence which suggests that the transition is generic to quantum chaotic systems when coupled to an environment. Our study sheds light on the fundamental behavior of quantum systems in the presence of an environment.},

  abstract     = {According to recent new definitions, a multiparty behavior is genuinely multipartite nonlocal (GMNL) if it cannot be modeled by measurements on an underlying network of bipartite-only nonlocal resources, possibly supplemented with local (classical) resources shared by all parties. The new definitions differ on whether to allow entangled measurements upon, and/or superquantum behaviors among, the underlying bipartite resources. Here, we categorize the full hierarchy of these new candidate definitions of GMNL in three-party quantum networks, highlighting the intimate link to device-independent witnesses of network effects. A key finding is the existence of a behavior in the simplest nontrivial multipartite measurement scenario (three parties, two measurement settings, and two outcomes) that cannot be simulated in a bipartite network prohibiting entangled measurements and superquantum resources—thus witnessing the most general form of GMNL—but can be simulated with bipartite-only quantum states with an entangled measurement, indicating an approach to device-independent certification of entangled measurements with fewer settings than in previous protocols. Surprisingly, we also find that this (3,2,2) behavior, as well as the others previously studied as device-independent witnesses of entangled measurements, can all be simulated at a higher echelon of the GMNL hierarchy that allows superquantum bipartite resources while still prohibiting entangled measurements. This poses a challenge to a theory-independent understanding of entangled measurements as an observable phenomenon distinct from bipartite nonlocality.},

  abstract     = {The female reproductive tract (FRT) continuously modulates mammalian sperm motion by releasing various clues as sperm migrate toward the fertilization site. An existing gap in our understanding of sperm migration within the FRT is a quantitative picture of how sperm respond to and navigate the biochemical clues within the FRT. In this experimental study, we have found that in response to biochemical clues, mammalian sperm display two distinct chemokinetic behaviors which are dependent upon the rheological properties of the media: chiral, characterized by swimming in circles; and hyperactive, characterized by random reorientation events. We used minimal theoretical modeling, along with statistical characterization of the chiral and hyperactive trajectories, to show that the effective diffusivity of these motion phases decreases with increasing concentration of chemical stimulant. In the context of navigation this concentration dependent chemokinesis suggests that the chiral or hyperactive motion refines the sperm search area within different FRT functional regions. Further, the ability to switch between phases indicates that sperm may use various stochastic navigational strategies, such as run and tumble or intermittent search, within the fluctuating and spatially heterogeneous environment of the FRT.},

Cells also need to control where and when droplets appear, so they need to control droplet nucleation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that reactions generally suppress nucleation if they stabilize the homogeneous state. An equilibrium surrogate model reveals that reactions increase the effective energy barrier of nucleation, enabling quantitative predictions of the increased nucleation times. Moreover, the surrogate model allows us to construct a phase diagram, which summarizes how reactions affect the stability of the homogeneous phase and the droplet state. This simple picture provides accurate predictions of how driven reactions delay nucleation, which is relevant for understanding droplets in biological cells and chemical engineering.},

Conventional simulations have been limited to the order-disorder transition (ODT), whereas FTSs allow us to evaluate complete phase diagrams for a series of invariant polymerization indices. The fluctuations stabilize the disordered phase, which shifts the ODT to higher segregation. Furthermore, they stabilize the network phases at the expense of the lamellar phase, which accounts for the presence of the F d d d phase in experiments.

Empirical data on spreading processes, however, even when available, do not easily allow us to uncover which of these underlying contagion mechanisms is at work. We propose a strategy to discriminate between these mechanisms upon the observation of a single instance of a spreading process. The strategy is based on the observation of the order in which network nodes are infected, and on its correlations with their local topology: these correlations differ between processes of simple contagion, processes involving threshold mechanisms, and processes driven by group interactions (i.e., by “higher-order” mechanisms). Our results improve our understanding of contagion processes and provide a method using only limited information to distinguish between several possible contagion mechanisms.},

Here, we show that the coherent superposition of parallel light-electron interactions in transversally separate zones allows for a simultaneous spatial and temporal compression of a convergent electron wave function, enabling the formation of sub-Ångström focal spots of attosecond duration. Specifically, spots spanning just ∼ 3\% of the light optical cycle are shown to be formed, accompanied by an increase by only a factor of 2 in spatial extension relative to an unperturbed beam. The proposed approach will facilitate the exploration of previously inaccessible ultrafast atomic-scale phenomena, in particular enabling attosecond scanning transmission electron microscopy.},

Hence, the development of materials beyond perovskite is a potential means of achieving lead-free and high piezoelectricity in next-generation piezoelectrics. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of developing high piezoelectricity in the nonperovskite carbon-boron clathrate with the composition of ScB 3 C 3 using first-principles calculations. The robust and highly symmetric B-C cage with mobilizable Sc atom constructs a flat potential valley to connect the ferroelectric orthorhombic and rhombohedral structures, which allows an easy, continuous, and strong polarization rotation. By manipulating the cell parameter b , the potential energy surface can be further flattened to produce an extra-high shear piezoelectric constant d 1 5 of 9 4 2 4 pC / N . Our calculations also confirm the effectiveness of the partial chemical replacement of Sc by Y to form a morphotropic phase boundary in the clathrate. The significance of large polarization and high symmetric polyhedron structure is demonstrated for realizing strong polarization rotation, offering the universal physical principles to aid the search for new high-performance piezoelectrics. This work takes ScB 3 C 3 as an example to exhibit the great potential for realizing high piezoelectricity in clathrate structure, which opens the door to developing next-generation lead-free piezoelectric applications.},

  abstract     = {While it is often assumed that the orbital response is suppressed and short ranged due to strong crystal field potential and orbital quenching, we show that the orbital response can be remarkably long ranged in ferromagnets. In a bilayer consisting of a nonmagnet and a ferromagnet, spin injection from the interface results in spin accumulation and torque in the ferromagnet, which rapidly oscillate and decay by spin dephasing. In contrast, even when an external electric field is applied only on the nonmagnet, we find substantially long-ranged induced orbital angular momentum in the ferromagnet, which can go far beyond the spin dephasing length. This unusual feature is attributed to nearly degenerate orbital characters imposed by the crystal symmetry, which form hotspots for the intrinsic orbital response. Because only the states near the hotspots contribute dominantly, the induced orbital angular momentum does not exhibit destructive interference among states with different momentum as in the case of the spin dephasing. This gives rise to a distinct type of orbital torque on the magnetization, increasing with the thickness of the ferromagnet. Such behavior may serve as critical long-sought evidence of orbital transport to be directly tested in experiments. Our findings open the possibility of using long-range orbital response in orbitronic device applications.},

We introduce a technique for solving gapped, translationally invariant models in the 1D BDI and AIII symmetry classes with α &gt; 1 , linking together the quantized winding invariant, bulk topological string-order parameters, and a complete solution of the edge modes. The physics of these chains is elucidated by studying a complex function determined by the couplings of the Hamiltonian: in contrast to the short-range case where edge modes are associated to roots of this function, we find that they are now associated to singularities. A remarkable consequence is that the finite-size splitting of the edge modes depends on the topological winding number, which can be used as a probe of the latter. We furthermore generalize these results by (i) identifying a family of BDI chains with α &lt; 1 where our results still hold and (ii) showing that gapless symmetry-protected topological chains can have topological invariants and edge modes when α − 1 exceeds the dynamical critical exponent.},

  abstract     = {We present a time-linear scaling method to simulate open and correlated quantum systems out of equilibrium. The method inherits from many-body perturbation theory the possibility to choose selectively the most relevant scattering processes in the dynamics, thereby paving the way to the real-time characterization of correlated ultrafast phenomena in quantum transport. The open system dynamics is described in terms of an “embedding correlator” from which the time-dependent current can be calculated using the Meir-Wingreen formula. We show how to efficiently implement our approach through a simple grafting into recently proposed time-linear Green’s function methods for closed systems. Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions can be treated on equal footing while preserving all fundamental conservation laws.},

This technique has been used to discover emergent length scales in the fractional quantum Hall regime of traditional, semiconductor-based heterostructures. SAWs would appear to be an ideal match for van der Waals heterostructures, but the right combination of substrate and experimental geometry to allow access to the quantum transport regime has not yet been found. We demonstrate that SAW resonant cavities fabricated on LiNbO 3 substrates can be used to access the quantum Hall regime of high-mobility, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated, graphene heterostructures. Our work establishes SAW resonant cavities as a viable platform for performing contactless conductivity measurements in the quantum transport regime of van der Waals materials.},

The breaking of symmetry occurs at the microscopic level manifested in nonlinear negative optical torque due to the excitation of resonant states at the harmonic frequency with higher projection of angular momentum. The proposed physical mechanism can be verified with resonant dielectric nanostructures, and we suggest some specific realizations.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes characterized by the first Chern number, a Weyl system supports one-way chiral zero modes under a magnetic field, which underlies the celebrated chiral anomaly. As a generalization of Weyl nodes from three-dimensional to five-dimensional physical systems, Yang monopoles are topological singularities carrying nonzero second-order Chern numbers c 2 = ± 1 . Here, we couple a Yang monopole with an external gauge field using an inhomogeneous Yang monopole metamaterial and experimentally demonstrate the existence of a gapless chiral zero mode, where the judiciously designed metallic helical structures and the corresponding effective antisymmetric bianisotropic terms provide the means for controlling gauge fields in a synthetic five-dimensional space. This zeroth mode is found to originate from the coupling between the second Chern singularity and a generalized 4-form gauge field—the wedge product of the magnetic field with itself. This generalization reveals intrinsic connections between physical systems of different dimensions, while a higher-dimensional system exhibits much richer supersymmetric structures in Landau level degeneracy due to the internal degrees of freedom. Our study offers the possibility of controlling electromagnetic waves by leveraging the concept of higher-order and higher-dimensional topological phenomena.},

We identify a novel mechanism for single-photon emission through non-Hermitian anharmonicity, i.e., anharmonicity in the losses instead of in the energy levels. We demonstrate the mechanism in two types of systems, including a feasible setup consisting of a hybrid metallodielectric cavity weakly coupled to a two-level emitter, and show that it induces high-purity single-photon emission at high repetition rates.},

A 24 ( 2 ) − μ s isomer was observed with the FRIB Decay Station initiator (FDSi) through a cascade of 224- and 401-keV γ rays in coincidence with Na 32 nuclei. This is the only known microsecond isomer ( 1 μ s ≤ T 1 / 2 &lt; 1 ms ) in the region. This nucleus is at the heart of the N = 20 island of shape inversion and is at the crossroads of the spherical shell-model, deformed shell-model, and ab initio theories. It can be represented as the coupling of a proton hole and neutron particle to Mg 32 , Mg 32 + π − 1 + ν + 1 . This odd-odd coupling and isomer formation provides a sensitive measure of the underlying shape degrees of freedom of Mg 32 , where the onset of spherical-to-deformed shape inversion begins with a low-lying deformed 2 + state at 885 keV and a low-lying shape-coexisting 0 2 + state at 1058 keV. We suggest two possible explanations for the 625-keV isomer in Na 32 : a 6 − spherical shape isomer that decays by E 2 or a 0 + deformed spin isomer that decays by M 2 . The present results and calculations are most consistent with the latter, indicating that the low-lying states are dominated by deformation.},

Our theoretical results are compared with the corresponding quantities obtained by smearing the KNT19 compilation [2] of R -ratio experimental measurements with the same kernels and, by centering the Gaussians in the region around the ρ -resonance peak, a tension of about 3 standard deviations is observed. From the phenomenological perspective, we have not included yet in our calculation QED and strong isospin-breaking corrections, and this might affect the observed tension.

  abstract     = {We theoretically propose an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate as an analog model of backreaction effects during the preheating stage of the early Universe. In particular, we address the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where the initially excited inflaton field decays by parametrically exciting the matter fields. We consider a two-dimensional, ring-shaped BEC under a tight transverse confinement whose transverse breathing mode and the Goldstone and dipole excitation branches simulate the inflaton and quantum matter fields, respectively. A strong excitation of the breathing mode leads to an exponentially growing emission of dipole and Goldstone excitations via parametric pair creation: Our numerical simulations of the BEC dynamics show how the associated backreaction effect results not only in an effective friction of the breathing mode, but also in a quick loss of longitudinal spatial coherence of the initially in-phase excitations. Implications of this result on the validity of the usual semiclassical description of backreaction are finally discussed.},

We point out that contrary to the standard criterion, the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry could remain unbroken during inflation, even when the axion decay constant, f a , is (much) above the inflationary Hubble scale, H I . This is achieved through the heavy lifting of the PQ scalar field due to its leading nonrenormalizable interaction with the inflaton, encoded in a high-dimensional operator which respects the approximate shift symmetry of the inflaton. The mechanism opens up a new window for the post-inflationary QCD axion and significantly enlarges the parameter space, in which the QCD axion dark matter with f a &gt; H I could be compatible with high-scale inflation and free from constraints on axion isocurvature perturbations. There also exist nonderivative couplings, which still keep the inflaton shift symmetry breaking under control, to achieve the heavy lifting of the PQ field during inflation. Additionally, by introducing an early matter domination era, more parameter space of high f a could yield the observed DM abundance.},

Processing of optical signals in their time-frequency degree of freedom bypasses the digitization step and presents an opportunity to enhance many protocols in quantum and classical communication, sensing, and computing. In this Letter, we present the experimental realization of the fractional Fourier transform in the time-frequency domain using an atomic quantum-optical memory system with processing capabilities. Our scheme performs the operation by imposing programmable interleaved spectral and temporal phases. We have verified the FrFT by analyses of chroncyclic Wigner functions measured via a shot-noise limited homodyne detector. Our results hold prospects for achieving temporal-mode sorting, processing, and superresolved parameter estimation.},

The output distributions of local quantum circuits are of central importance in both quantum advantage proposals and a variety of quantum machine learning algorithms. In this work, we extensively characterize the learnability of output distributions of local quantum circuits. Firstly, we contrast learnability with simulatability by showing that Clifford circuit output distributions are efficiently learnable, while the injection of a single T gate renders the density modeling task hard for any depth d = n Ω ( 1 ) . We further show that the task of generative modeling universal quantum circuits at any depth d = n Ω ( 1 ) is hard for any learning algorithm, classical or quantum, and that for statistical query algorithms, even depth d = ω [ log ( n ) ] Clifford circuits are hard to learn. Our results show that one cannot use the output distributions of local quantum circuits to provide a separation between the power of quantum and classical generative modeling algorithms, and therefore provide evidence against quantum advantages for practically relevant probabilistic modeling tasks.},

For any quantum resource theory which contains resource-free pure states, we show that there does not exist a finite set of resource monotones which completely determines all state transformations. We discuss how these limitations can be surpassed, if discontinuous or infinite sets of monotones are considered, or by using quantum catalysis. We also discuss the structure of theories which are described by a single resource monotone and show equivalence with totally ordered resource theories. These are theories where a free transformation exists for any pair of quantum states. We show that totally ordered theories allow for free transformations between all pure states.

  abstract     = {Contextuality is a distinctive feature of quantum theory and a fundamental resource for quantum computation. However, existing examples of contextuality in high-dimensional systems lack the necessary robustness required in experiments. Here, we address this problem by identifying a family of noncontextuality inequalities whose maximum quantum violation grows with the dimension of the system. At first glance, this contextuality is the single-system version of multipartite Bell nonlocality taken to an extreme form. What is interesting is that the single-system version achieves the same degree of contextuality but uses a Hilbert space of lower dimension. That is, contextuality “concentrates” as the degree of contextuality per dimension increases. We show the practicality of this result by presenting an experimental test of contextuality in a seven-dimensional system. By simulating sequences of quantum ideal measurements with destructive measurements and repreparation in an all-optical setup, we report a violation of 68.7 standard deviations of the simplest case of the noncontextuality inequalities identified. Our results advance the investigation of high-dimensional contextuality, its connection to the Clifford algebra, and its role in quantum computation.},

The interplay between the inclusion shape, boundary-induced nematic order, and autonomous flows powers the inclusion motion. Disks and achiral gears exhibit unbiased rotational motion, but with distinct dynamics. In comparison, chiral gear-shaped inclusions exhibit long-term rectified rotation, which is correlated with dynamics and polarization of nearby + 1 / 2 topological defects. The chirality of defect polarities and the active nematic texture around the inclusion correlate with the inclusion’s instantaneous rotation rate. Inclusions provide a promising tool for probing the rheological properties of active nematics and extracting ordered motion from their inherently chaotic motion.},

  abstract     = {Generalization is one of the most important problems in deep learning, where there exist many low-loss solutions due to overparametrization. Previous empirical studies showed a strong correlation between flatness of the loss landscape at a solution and its generalizability, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is crucial in finding the flat solutions. To understand the effects of SGD, we construct a simple model whose overall loss landscape has a continuous set of degenerate (or near-degenerate) minima and the loss landscape for a minibatch is approximated by a random shift of the overall loss function. By direct simulations of the stochastic learning dynamics and solving the underlying Fokker-Planck equation, we show that due to its strong anisotropy the SGD noise introduces an additional effective loss term that decreases with flatness and has an overall strength that increases with the learning rate and batch-to-batch variation. We find that the additional landscape-dependent SGD loss breaks the degeneracy and serves as an effective regularization for finding flat solutions. As a result, the flatness of the overall loss landscape increases during learning and reaches a higher value (flatter minimum) for a larger SGD noise strength before the noise strength reaches a critical value when the system fails to converge. These results, which are verified in realistic neural network models, elucidate the role of SGD for generalization, and they may also have important implications for hyperparameter selection for learning efficiently without divergence.},

Moreover, there exists one-to-one correspondence between the quantized conductance, entropy change and spin pumping in long topologically nontrivial nanowires but these observables are uncorrelated in the case of accidental zero-energy Andreev bound states in the trivial phase. Thus, we conclude that observation of correlated and quantized peaks in the conductance, entropy change and spin pumping would provide strong evidence of Majorana zero modes, and we elaborate how topological Majorana zero modes can be distinguished from quasi-Majorana modes potentially created by a smooth tunnel barrier at the lead-nanowire interface. Finally, we discuss peculiar interference effects affecting the spin pumping in short nanowires at very low energies.},

The resulting Hofstadter spectrum encodes the nonperturbative response of the bands to flux. Depending on their topology, adding flux can enforce a bulk gap closing (a Hofstadter semimetal) or boundary state pumping (a Hofstadter topological insulator). In this Letter, we present a real space classification of these Hofstadter phases. We give topological indices in terms of symmetry-protected real space invariants, which reveal the bulk and boundary responses of fragile topological states to flux. In fact, we find that the flux periodicity in tight-binding models causes the symmetries which are broken by the magnetic field to reenter at strong flux where they form projective point group representations. We completely classify the reentrant projective point groups and find that the Schur multipliers which define them are Arahanov-Bohm phases calculated along the bonds of the crystal. We find that a nontrivial Schur multiplier is enough to predict and protect the Hofstadter response with only zero-flux topology.},

Here, by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we investigate the electronic structure of Au 2 Pb across a wide temperature range. Our experimental studies on the (111)-cleaved surface unambiguously demonstrate that Au 2 Pb is a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal characterized by the presence of a bulk Dirac cone projected off-center of the bulk Brillouin zone (BZ), in agreement with our theoretical calculations. Unusually, we observe that the bulk Dirac cone is significantly shifted by more than 0.4 eV to higher binding energies with reducing temperature, eventually going through a Lifshitz transition. The pronounced downward shift is qualitatively reproduced by our calculations indicating that an enhanced orbital overlap upon compression of the lattice, which preserves C 4 rotational symmetry, is the main driving mechanism for the Lifshitz transition. These findings not only broaden the range of currently known materials exhibiting three-dimensional Dirac phases, but also show a viable mechanism by which it could be possible to switch on and off the contribution of the degeneracy point to electron transport without external doping.},

The key feature is the ability to describe long-range correlations among the elements of the input sequences, through the so-called self-attention mechanism. Here, we propose an adaptation of the ViT architecture with complex parameters to define a new class of variational neural-network states for quantum many-body systems, the ViT wave function. We apply this idea to the one-dimensional J 1 − J 2 Heisenberg model, demonstrating that a relatively simple parametrization gets excellent results for both gapped and gapless phases. In this case, excellent accuracies are obtained by a relatively shallow architecture, with a single layer of self-attention, thus largely simplifying the original architecture. Still, the optimization of a deeper structure is possible and can be used for more challenging models, most notably highly frustrated systems in two dimensions. The success of the ViT wave function relies on mixing both local and global operations, thus enabling the study of large systems with high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Many elastic structures exhibit rapid shape transitions between two possible equilibrium states: umbrellas become inverted in strong wind and hopper popper toys jump when turned inside out. This snap through is a general motif for the storage and rapid release of elastic energy, and it is exploited by many biological and engineered systems from the Venus flytrap to mechanical metamaterials. Shape transitions are known to be related to the type of bifurcation the system undergoes, however, to date, there is no general understanding of the mechanisms that select these bifurcations. Here we analyze numerically and analytically two systems proposed in recent literature in which an elastic strip, initially in a buckled state, is driven through shape transitions by either rotating or translating its boundaries. We show that the two systems are mathematically equivalent, and identify three cases that illustrate the entire range of transitions described by previous authors. Importantly, using reduction order methods, we establish the nature of the underlying bifurcations and explain how these bifurcations can be predicted from geometric symmetries and symmetry-breaking mechanisms, thus providing universal design rules for elastic shape transitions.},

In accordance with earlier findings [T. S. Grigera et al. J. Stat. Mech. ( 2011 ) P02015 .], we take nonplanar diagrams into account to correctly address multiple local scattering events. By doing so, we end up with a first principles theory that can predict the main anomalies of athermal disordered materials, including the boson peak, sound softening, and Rayleigh damping of sound. In the vibrational density of states, the sound modes lead to Debye’s law for small frequencies. Additionally, an excess appears in the density of states starting as ω 4 in the low frequency limit, which is attributed to (quasi-) localized modes.},

In particular, we theoretically demonstrate that optical levitation and center-of-mass ground-state cooling of silicon nanoparticles in vacuum is not only experimentally feasible but it offers enhanced performance over widely used silica particles in terms of trap frequency, trap depth, and optomechanical coupling rates. Moreover, we show that, by adjusting the detuning of the trapping laser with respect to the particle’s resonance, the sign of the polarizability becomes negative, enabling levitation in the minimum of laser intensity, e.g., at the nodes of a standing wave. The latter opens the door to trapping nanoparticles in the optical near-field combining red and blue-detuned frequencies, in analogy to two-level atoms, which is of interest for generating strong coupling to photonic nanostructures and short-distance force sensing.},

However, the transfer of a part of this decay amplitude to the continuum of a second conjugated cluster may offer control and efficacy in sharing the energy nonlocally to instigate remote collective events. With the example of a spherically nested dimer Na 20 @ C 240 of two plasmonic systems we find that such a transfer is possible through the resonant intercluster Coulombic decay (RICD) as a fundamental process.

This process causes the breaking of two hydrogen bonds and subsequently the cleavage of C ─ H and C ─ O covalent bonds in the dimers, which is expected to be a general phenomenon occurring in molecular complexes and can have important implications for radiation damage to biological matter.},

In this Letter, the nucleus studied was O 14 , and the Gamow-Teller transition strength to N 14 was extracted up to an excitation energy of 22 MeV. The data were compared to shell-model and state-of-the-art coupled-cluster calculations. Shell-model calculations reproduce the measured Gamow-Teller strength distribution up to about 15 MeV reasonably well, after the application of a phenomenological quenching factor. In a significant step forward to better understand this quenching, the coupled-cluster calculation reproduces the full strength distribution well without such quenching, owing to the large model space, the inclusion of strong correlations, and the coupling of the weak interaction to two nucleons through two-body currents.},

A metallic dish sources conversion photons, from hidden photon kinetic mixing, onto a horn antenna which is coupled to a C band kinetic inductance traveling wave parametric amplifier, providing for near quantum-limited noise performance. We demonstrate a first probing of the kinetic mixing parameter χ to the 10 − 12 level for the majority of hidden photon masses in this region.

  abstract     = {Classical shadows are a powerful method for learning many properties of quantum states in a sample-efficient manner, by making use of randomized measurements. Here we study the sample complexity of learning the expectation value of Pauli operators via “shallow shadows,” a recently proposed version of classical shadows in which the randomization step is effected by a local unitary circuit of variable depth t . We show that the shadow norm (the quantity controlling the sample complexity) is expressed in terms of properties of the Heisenberg time evolution of operators under the randomizing (“twirling”) circuit—namely the evolution of the weight distribution characterizing the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially. For spatially contiguous Pauli operators of weight k , this entails a competition between two processes: operator spreading (whereby the support of an operator grows over time, increasing its weight) and operator relaxation (whereby the bulk of the operator develops an equilibrium density of identity operators, decreasing its weight). From this simple picture we derive (i) an upper bound on the shadow norm which, for depth t ∼ log ( k ) , guarantees an exponential gain in sample complexity over the t = 0 protocol in any spatial dimension, and (ii) quantitative results in one dimension within a mean-field approximation, including a universal subleading correction to the optimal depth, found to be in excellent agreement with infinite matrix product state numerical simulations. Our Letter connects fundamental ideas in quantum many-body dynamics to applications in quantum information science, and paves the way to highly optimized protocols for learning different properties of quantum states.},

These experiments are grounded on the fact that, according to these models, the dynamics is driven by noise that, besides collapsing the wave function in space, generates a diffusive motion with characteristic signatures, which, though small, can be tested. The noninterferometric approach might seem applicable only to those models that implement the collapse through noisy dynamics, not to any model, that collapses the wave function in space. Here, we show that this is not the case: under reasonable assumptions, any collapse dynamics (in space) is diffusive . Specifically, we prove that any space-translation covariant dynamics that complies with the no-signaling constraint, if collapsing the wave function in space, must change the average momentum of the system and/or its spread.},

To prove the failure of classicality in the sense of Kochen-Specker noncontextuality, one does indeed require sets of incompatible measurements. However, a more broadly applicable notion of classicality is the existence of a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. In particular, this notion can imply constraints on the representation of outcomes even within a single nonprojective measurement. We leverage this fact to demonstrate that measurement incompatibility is neither necessary nor sufficient for proofs of the failure of generalized noncontextuality. Furthermore, we show that every proof of the failure of generalized noncontextuality in a quantum prepare-measure scenario can be converted into a proof of the failure of generalized noncontextuality in a corresponding scenario with no incompatible measurements.},

This poroelastic coupling becomes particularly intricate in wetting, adhesion, and creasing, for which sharp folds appear that can even lead to phase separation. Here, we resolve the singular nature of poroelastic surface folds and determine the solvent distribution in the vicinity of the fold tip. Surprisingly, two opposite scenarios emerge depending on the angle of the fold. In obtuse folds such as creases, it is found that the solvent is completely expelled near the crease tip, according to a nontrivial spatial distribution. For wetting ridges with acute fold angles, the solvent migration is reversed as compared to creasing, and the degree of swelling is maximal at the fold tip. We discuss how our poroelastic fold analysis offers an explanation for phase separation, fracture, and contact angle hysteresis.},

For more than 30 years, the understanding has been that reversible associations change the shape of linear viscoelastic spectra by adding a rubbery plateau in the intermediate frequency range, at which associations have not yet relaxed and thus effectively act as crosslinks. Here, we design and synthesize new classes of unentangled associative polymers carrying unprecedentedly high fractions of stickers, up to eight per Kuhn segment, that can form strong pairwise hydrogen bonding of ∼ 2 0 k B T without microphase separation. We experimentally show that reversible bonds significantly slow down the polymer dynamics but nearly do not change the shape of linear viscoelastic spectra. This behavior can be explained by a renormalized Rouse model that highlights an unexpected influence of reversible bonds on the structural relaxation of associative polymers.},

Demonstrations using a wearable wireless sensor show that the stochastic exceptional points lead to more accurate tracking of a person’s vital signs during exercise.

Here, using phase-field simulations, the evolution of polar topology and the emergence of a phase transition to a hexagonal close-packed skyrmion lattice is explored through the construction of a temperature-electric field phase diagram for ultrathin ferroelectric PbTiO 3 films. The hexagonal-lattice skyrmion crystal can be stabilized under application of an external, out-of-plane electric field which carefully adjusts the delicate interplay of elastic, electrostatic, and gradient energies. In addition, the lattice constants of the polar skyrmion crystals are found to increase with film thickness, consistent with expectation from Kittel’s law.

  abstract     = {Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating nonequilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized quasiparticles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and Z 2 flux excitations. We uncover a distinct two-step heating profile—dubbed fractionalized prethermalization—and a quasistationary state with vastly different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this peculiar prethermalization behavior is a consequence of fractionalization. Furthermore, we discuss an experimentally feasible protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state of the Kiteav honeycomb model with a low energy density, which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum information processing platforms.},

  abstract     = {Disorder and electron-electron interaction play essential roles in the physics of electron systems in condensed matter. In two-dimensional, quantum Hall systems, extensive studies of disorder-induced localization have led to the emergence of a scaling picture with a single extended state, characterized by a power-law divergence of the localization length in the zero-temperature limit. Experimentally, scaling has been investigated via measuring the temperature dependence of plateau-to-plateau transitions between the integer quantum Hall states (IQHSs), yielding a critical exponent κ ≃ 0.42 . Here we report scaling measurements in the fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) regime where interaction plays a dominant role. Our Letter is partly motivated by recent calculations, based on the composite fermion theory, that suggest identical critical exponents in both IQHS and FQHS cases to the extent that the interaction between composite fermions is negligible. The samples used in our experiments are two-dimensional electron systems confined to GaAs quantum wells of exceptionally high quality. We find that κ varies for transitions between different FQHSs observed on the flanks of Landau level filling factor ν = 1 / 2 and has a value close to that reported for the IQHS transitions only for a limited number of transitions between high-order FQHSs with intermediate strength. We discuss possible origins of the nonuniversal κ observed in our experiments.},

  abstract     = {Accurate simulations of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model constitute one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter and quantum physics. Here we develop a tangent space tensor renormalization group (tanTRG) approach for the calculations of the 2D Hubbard model at finite temperature. An optimal evolution of the density operator is achieved in tanTRG with a mild O ( D 3 ) complexity, where the bond dimension D controls the accuracy. With the tanTRG approach we boost the low-temperature calculations of large-scale 2D Hubbard systems on up to a width-8 cylinder and 10 × 10 square lattice. For the half-filled Hubbard model, the obtained results are in excellent agreement with those of determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). Moreover, tanTRG can be used to explore the low-temperature, finite-doping regime inaccessible for DQMC. The calculated charge compressibility and Matsubara Green’s function are found to reflect the strange metal and pseudogap behaviors, respectively. The superconductive pairing susceptibility is computed down to a low temperature of approximately 1 / 24 of the hopping energy, where we find d -wave pairing responses are most significant near the optimal doping. Equipped with the tangent-space technique, tanTRG constitutes a well-controlled, highly efficient and accurate tensor network method for strongly correlated 2D lattice models at finite temperature.},

We found that the quasiparticle populations drove ultrafast electronic phase transitions in 1 T − TiSe 2 within 100 fs after photoexcitation, and a metastable metallic state, which was significantly different from the equilibrium normal phase, was evidenced far below the charge density wave transition temperature. Detailed time- and pump-fluence-dependent experiments revealed that the photoinduced metastable metallic state was a result of the halted motion of the atoms through the coherent electron-phonon coupling process, and the lifetime of this state was prolonged to picoseconds with the highest pump fluence used in this study. Ultrafast electronic dynamics were well captured by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model. Our work demonstrates a mechanism for realizing novel electronic states by photoinducing coherent motion of atoms in the lattice.},

These surface patterns emerge from symmetry-breaking dynamical processes that occur in Rayleigh-Bénard-like instabilities. In this study, we demonstrate that the coexistence and competition between surface patterns of different symmetries in two dimensions can be numerically unraveled using the stochastic generalized Swift-Hohenberg model. We originally propose a deep convolutional network to identify and learn the dominant modes that stabilize for a given bifurcation and quadratic model coefficients. The model is scale-invariant and has been calibrated on microscopy measurements using a physics-guided machine learning strategy. Our approach enables the identification of experimental irradiation conditions for a desired self-organization pattern. It can be generally applied to predict structure formation in situations where the underlying physics can be approximately described by a self-organization process and data is sparse and nontime series.

In this work, we study an electronic model of topologically trivial flat bands with a continuously tunable Fubini-Study metric in the presence of on-site attraction and nearest-neighbor repulsion, using numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations. By varying the electron filling and the minimal spatial extent of the localized flat-band Wannier wave functions, we obtain a number of intertwined orders. These include a phase with coexisting charge density wave order and superconductivity, i.e., a supersolid. In spite of the nonperturbative nature of the problem, we identify an analytically tractable limit associated with a “small” spatial extent of the Wannier functions and derive a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that can well describe our numerical results. We also provide unambiguous evidence for the violation of any putative lower bound on the zero-temperature superfluid stiffness in geometrically nontrivial flat bands.},

  abstract     = {Usually, when coupling in a background gauge field, topological zero modes would yield an anomalous current at the interface, culminating in the zero-mode anomaly inflow, which is ultimately conserved by extra contributions from the topological bulk. However, the anomaly inflow mechanism for guiding Floquet steady states is rarely explored in periodically driven systems. Here we synthesize a driven topological-normal insulator heterostructure and propose a Floquet gauge anomaly inflow, associated with the occurrence of arbitrary fractional charge. Through our photonic modeling, we experimentally observed a Floquet gauge anomaly as the system was driven into anomalous topological phases. Prospectively, we believe our findings could pave a novel avenue on exploring Floquet gauge anomalies in driven systems of condensed matter, photonics, and ultracold atoms.},

  abstract     = {Superradiant lasers operate in the bad-cavity regime, where the phase coherence is stored in the spin state of an atomic medium rather than in the intracavity electric field. Such lasers use collective effects to sustain lasing and could potentially reach considerably lower linewidths than a conventional laser. Here, we investigate the properties of superradiant lasing in an ensemble of ultracold Sr 88 atoms inside an optical cavity. We extend the superradiant emission on the 7.5 kHz wide P 3 1 → S 1 0 intercombination line to several milliseconds, and observe steady parameters suitable for emulating the performance of a continuous superradiant laser by fine tuning the repumping rates. We reach a lasing linewidth of 820 Hz for 1.1 ms of lasing, nearly an order of magnitude lower than the natural linewidth.},

The current lines of research mostly discuss topics such as entanglement, Bell nonlocality or quantum tomography. Here, we provide the full picture of quantum correlations in top quarks by studying also quantum discord and steering. We find that both phenomena are present at the LHC. In particular, quantum discord in a separable quantum state is expected to be detected with high-statistical significance. Interestingly, due to the singular nature of the measurement process, quantum discord can be measured following its original definition, and the steering ellipsoid can be experimentally reconstructed, both highly demanding measurements in conventional setups. In contrast to entanglement, the asymmetric nature of quantum discord and steering can provide witnesses of C P -violating physics beyond the standard model.},

Comparing the particle number and energy flux to the Hawking case, we find both effects to be of similar order.

  abstract     = {Beyond-Standard-Model extensions of QCD could result in quark and gluon confinement occurring well above at temperature around the GeV scale. These models can also alter the order of the QCD phase transition. Therefore, the enhanced production of primordial black holes (PBHs) that can accompany the change in relativistic degrees of freedom at the QCD transition could favor the production of PBHs with mass scales smaller than the Standard Model QCD horizon scale. Consequently, and unlike PBHs associated with a standard GeV-scale QCD transition, such PBHs can account for all the dark matter abundance in the unconstrained asteroid-mass window. This links beyond-Standard-Model modifications of QCD physics over a broad range of unexplored temperature regimes (around 10 − 10 3 TeV ) with microlensing surveys searching for PBHs. Additionally, we discuss implications of these models for gravitational wave experiments. We show that a first-order QCD phase transition at around 7 TeV is consistent with the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam candidate event, while a transition of around 70 GeV is consistent with OGLE candidate events and could also account for the claimed NANOGrav gravitational wave signal.},

We initiate the training sequence with the fixed-point wave functions of the quantum phase and add translation-invariant noise that respects the symmetries of the system to mask the fixed-point structure on short length scales. We illustrate this approach by training the QCNN on phases protected by time-reversal symmetry in one dimension, and test it on several time-reversal symmetric models exhibiting trivial, symmetry-breaking, and symmetry-protected topological order. The QCNN discovers a set of order parameters that identifies all three phases and accurately predicts the location of the phase boundary. The proposed protocol paves the way toward hardware-efficient training of quantum phase classifiers on a programmable quantum processor.},

  abstract     = {The microscopic description of 1 / f magnetic flux noise in superconducting circuits has remained an open question for several decades despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigation. Recent progress in superconducting devices for quantum information has highlighted the need to mitigate sources of qubit decoherence, driving a renewed interest in understanding the underlying noise mechanism(s). Though a consensus has emerged attributing flux noise to surface spins, their identity and interaction mechanisms remain unclear, prompting further study. Here, we apply weak in-plane magnetic fields to a capacitively shunted flux qubit (where the Zeeman splitting of surface spins lies below the device temperature) and study the flux-noise-limited qubit dephasing, revealing previously unexplored trends that may shed light on the dynamics behind the emergent 1 / f noise. Notably, we observe an enhancement (suppression) of the spin-echo (Ramsey) pure-dephasing time in fields up to B = 100 G . With direct noise spectroscopy, we further observe a transition from a 1 / f to approximately Lorentzian frequency dependence below 10 Hz and a reduction of the noise above 1 MHz with increasing magnetic field. We suggest that these trends are qualitatively consistent with an increase of spin cluster sizes with magnetic field. These results should help to inform a complete microscopic theory of 1 / f flux noise in superconducting circuits.},

For two random circuits that are identical in the bulk but with different initial states, the linear cross entropy χ between the bulk measurement outcome distributions in the two circuits acts as an order parameter, and can be used to distinguish the volume law from area law phases. In the volume law phase (and in the thermodynamic limit) the bulk measurements cannot distinguish between the two different initial states, and χ = 1 . In the area law phase χ &lt; 1 . For circuits with Clifford gates, we provide numerical evidence that χ can be sampled to accuracy ϵ from O ( 1 / ϵ 2 ) trajectories, by running the first circuit on a quantum simulator without postselection , aided by a classical simulation of the second. We also find that for weak depolarizing noise the signature of the measurement-induced phase transitions is still present for intermediate system sizes. In our protocol we have the freedom of choosing initial states such that the “classical” side can be simulated efficiently, while simulating the “quantum” side is still classically hard.},

It can be challenging to directly design non-Hermitian many-body models that exhibit unique features not found in Hermitian systems. In this Letter, we propose a new method for constructing non-Hermitian many-body systems by generalizing the parent Hamiltonian method into non-Hermitian regimes. This allows us to build a local Hamiltonian using given matrix product states as its left and right ground states. We demonstrate this method by constructing a non-Hermitian spin-1 model from the asymmetric Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state, which preserves both chiral order and symmetry-protected topological order. Our approach opens up a new paradigm for systematically constructing and studying non-Hermitian many-body systems, providing guiding principles for exploring new properties and phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.},

  abstract     = {Nonlocality, as established by the seminal Bell’s theorem, is considered to be the most striking feature of correlations present in spacelike separated events. Its practical application in device independent protocols, such as secure key distribution, randomness certification, etc., demands identification and amplification of such correlations observed in the quantum world. In this Letter we study the prospect of nonlocality distillation, wherein, by applying a natural set of free operations (called wirings) on many copies of weakly nonlocal systems, one aims to generate correlations of higher nonlocal strength. In the simplest Bell scenario, we identify a protocol, namely, logical OR-AND wiring, that can distill nonlocality to a significantly high degree starting from arbitrarily weak quantum nonlocal correlations. As it turns out, our protocol has several interesting facets: (i) it demonstrates that a set of distillable quantum correlations has nonzero measure in the full eight-dimensional correlation space, (ii) it can distill quantum Hardy correlations by preserving its structure, (iii) it shows that (nonlocal) quantum correlations sufficiently close to the local deterministic points can be distilled by a significant amount. Finally, we also demonstrate efficacy of the considered distillation protocol in detecting postquantum correlations.},

  abstract     = {Fusion occurs when light nuclei combine to form heavier nuclei. The energy released in this process powers the stars and can provide humankind with a safe, sustainable, and clean source of baseload electricity, a valuable tool in the fight against climate change. To overcome the Coulomb repulsion of like-charged nuclei, fusion reactions necessitate temperatures of tens of millions of degrees or thermal energies of tens of keV, at which matter exists only in the form of plasma. Plasma is an ionized state of matter that is rare on Earth but characterizes most of the visible universe. The quest for fusion energy is thus intrinsically associated with plasma physics. In this Essay, I lay out my view of the challenges on the path to fusion power plants. As these need to be sizable and inevitably complex, large-scale collaborative enterprises are required, involving not only international cooperation but also private-public industrial partnerships. We focus on magnetic fusion, in particular on the tokamak configuration, relevant to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the largest fusion device to be built in the world.},

Here, we use atomic force microscopy to probe the mechanics of these droplets throughout their formation. Using a combination of time- and frequency-domain rheological experiments, we characterize and develop a simple model of the linear viscoelasticity of these aggregates. We then use this model to quantify how cellular behaviors predominant at different developmental times—motility during the dewetting phase and cellular sporulation during later development—manifest as decreased droplet viscosity and increased elasticity, respectively.},

Specifically, computer models cannot simultaneously reproduce the rapid wave speeds and small spatial scales of discordant alternans patterns measured experimentally in the same simulation. The discrepancy is important, because discordant alternans can be a key precursor to the development of abnormal and dangerous rapid rhythms in the heart. In this Letter, we show that this paradox can be resolved by allowing so-called ephaptic coupling to play a primary role in wave front propagation in place of conventional gap-junction coupling. With this modification, physiological wave speeds and small discordant alternans spatial scales both occur with gap-junction resistance values that are more in line with those observed in experiments. Our theory thus also provides support to the hypothesis that ephaptic coupling plays an important role in normal wave propagation.},

We show that it emerges in the model of an active tracer particle submitted to an external force and which evolves on a discrete lattice populated with mobile passive crowders. Resorting to a decoupling approximation, we compute analytically the velocity of the tracer particle as a function of the different parameters of the system and confront our results to numerical simulations.

  abstract     = {The ground-state properties and excitation energies of a quantum emitter can be modified in the ultrastrong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) where the light-matter interaction strength becomes comparable to the cavity resonance frequency. Recent studies have started to explore the possibility of controlling an electronic material by embedding it in a cavity that confines electromagnetic fields in deep subwavelength scales. Currently, there is a strong interest in realizing ultrastrong-coupling cavity QED in the terahertz (THz) part of the spectrum, since most of the elementary excitations of quantum materials are in this frequency range. We propose and discuss a promising platform to achieve this goal based on a two-dimensional electronic material encapsulated by a planar cavity consisting of ultrathin polar van der Waals crystals. As a concrete setup, we show that nanometer-thick hexagonal boron nitride layers should allow one to reach the ultrastrong coupling regime for single-electron cyclotron resonance in a bilayer graphene. The proposed cavity platform can be realized by a wide variety of thin dielectric materials with hyperbolic dispersions. Consequently, van der Waals heterostructures hold the promise of becoming a versatile playground for exploring the ultrastrong-coupling physics of cavity QED materials.},

  abstract     = {In the archetypal antiferroelectric PbZrO 3 , antiparallel electric dipoles cancel each other, resulting in zero spontaneous polarization at the macroscopic level. Yet in actual hysteresis loops, the cancellation is rarely perfect and some remnant polarization is often observed, suggesting the metastability of polar phases in this material. In this work, using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy methods on a PbZrO 3 single crystal, we uncover the coexistence of the common antiferroelectric phase and a ferrielectric phase featuring an electric dipole pattern of ↓ ↑ ↓ . This dipole arrangement, predicted by Aramberri et al. to be the ground state of PbZrO 3 at 0 K, appears at room temperature in the form of translational boundaries. The dual nature of the ferrielectric phase, both a distinct phase and a translational boundary structure, places important symmetry constraints on its growth. These are overcome by sideways motion of the boundaries, which aggregate to form arbitrarily wide stripe domains of the polar phase embedded within the antiferroelectric matrix.},

However, their analytical or numerical description beyond exactly solvable models remains a formidable challenge. Here we employ an exact 3D quantum tensor-network approach that allows us to study a Z N generalization of the prototypical X cube fracton model and its quantum phase transitions between distinct topological states via fully tractable wave function deformations. We map the (deformed) quantum states exactly to a combination of a classical lattice gauge theory and a plaquette clock model, and employ numerical techniques to calculate various entanglement order parameters. For the Z N model we find a family of (weakly) first-order fracton confinement transitions that in the limit of N → ∞ converge to a continuous phase transition beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. We also discover a line of 3D conformal quantum critical points (with critical magnetic flux loop fluctuations) which, in the N → ∞ limit, appears to coexist with a gapless deconfined fracton state.},

Its realization via electrically injected and detected spin transport in an antiferromagnetic insulator demonstrates its high potential for devices and as a convenient probe for magnon eigenmodes and the underlying spin interactions in the antiferromagnet. Here, we observe a nonreciprocity in the Hanle signal measured in hematite using two spatially separated platinum electrodes as spin injector or detector. Interchanging their roles was found to alter the detected magnon spin signal. The recorded difference depends on the applied magnetic field and reverses sign when the signal passes its nominal maximum at the so-called compensation field. We explain these observations in terms of a spin transport direction-dependent pseudofield. The latter leads to a nonreciprocity, which is found to be controllable via the applied magnetic field. The observed nonreciprocal response in the readily available hematite films opens interesting opportunities for realizing exotic physics predicted so far only for antiferromagnets with special crystal structures.},

Here, we demonstrate that these globally spin-neutral currents can represent the Néel spin currents, i.e., staggered spin currents flowing through different magnetic sublattices. The Néel spin currents emerge in antiferromagnets with strong intrasublattice coupling (hopping) and drive the spin-dependent transport phenomena such as tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and spin-transfer torque (STT) in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs). Using RuO 2 and Fe 4 GeTe 2 as representative antiferromagnets, we predict that the Néel spin currents with a strong staggered spin polarization produce a sizable fieldlike STT capable of the deterministic switching of the Néel vector in the associated AFMTJs. Our work uncovers the previously unexplored potential of fully compensated antiferromagnets and paves a new route to realize the efficient writing and reading of information for antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

Recently, a nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has been theoretically and experimentally reported to generate time-reversal-odd spin current with controllable spin polarization in antiferromagnet RuO 2 . The inverse effect, electrical detection of spin current via ASSE, still remains elusive. Here we show the spin-to-charge conversion stemming from ASSE in RuO 2 by the spin Seebeck effect measurements. Unconventionally, the spin Seebeck voltage can be detected even when the injected spin current is polarized along the directions of either the voltage channel or the thermal gradient, indicating the successful conversion of x - and z -spin polarizations into the charge current. The crystal axes-dependent conversion efficiency further demonstrates that the nontrivial spin-to-charge conversion in RuO 2 is ascribed to ASSE, which is distinct from the magnetic or antiferromagnetic inverse spin Hall effects. Our finding not only advances the emerging research landscape of altermagnetism, but also provides a promising pathway for the spin detection.},

These flat bands have ideal quantum geometry for the realization of fractional Chern insulators, and they are always fragile topological. The number of flat bands can be doubled for certain point group, and the interacting Hamiltonian is exactly solvable at integer fillings.

In this Letter, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we systematically investigate the electronic structures of superconducting K 3 C 60 thin films. We observe a dispersive energy band crossing the Fermi level with the occupied bandwidth of about 130 meV. The measured band structure shows prominent quasiparticle kinks and a replica band involving the Jahn-Teller active phonon modes, which reflects strong electron-phonon coupling in the system. The electron-phonon coupling constant is estimated to be about 1.2, which dominates the quasiparticle mass renormalization. Moreover, we observe an isotropic nodeless superconducting gap beyond the mean-field estimation ( 2 Δ / k B T c ≈ 5 ). Both the large electron-phonon coupling constant and large reduced superconducting gap suggest a strong-coupling superconductivity in K 3 C 60 , while the electronic correlation effect is suggested by the observation of a waterfall-like band dispersion and the small bandwidth compared with the effective Coulomb interaction. Our results not only directly visualize the crucial band structure but also provide important insights into the mechanism of the unusual superconductivity of fulleride compounds.},

Both experiments and simulations indicate that when the channel curvature radius is gradually increased and the laser incidence offset is optimized, the transverse oscillation of the laser beam can be mitigated, and the stably guided laser pulse excites wakefields and accelerates electrons along the curved plasma channel to a maximum energy of 0.7 GeV. Our results also show that such a channel exhibits good potential for seamless multistage laser wakefield acceleration.},

While the passing of a freezing front over a solid particle is reasonably understood, this is not so for soft particles. Here, using an oil-in-water emulsion as a model system, we show that when engulfed into a growing ice front, a soft particle severely deforms. This deformation strongly depends on the engulfment velocity V , even forming pointy-tip shapes for low values of V . We find such singular deformations are mediated by interfacial flows in nanometric thin liquid films separating the nonsolidifying dispersed droplets and the solidifying bulk. We model the fluid flow in these intervening thin films using a lubrication approximation and then relate it to the deformation sustained by the dispersed droplet.},

We show that the area rule of circulation around simple loops holds in both the forward cascade enstrophy inertial range ( Ω IR ) and the inverse cascade energy inertial range ( E IR ): When the side lengths of a loop are all within the same inertial range, the circulation statistics depend on the loop area alone. It is also found that, for circulation around figure-eight loops, the area rule still holds in E IR but is not applicable in Ω IR . In Ω IR , the circulation is nonintermittent; whereas in E IR , the circulation is bifractal: space filling for moments of the order of 3 and below and a monofractal with a dimension of 1.42 for higher orders. Our results demonstrate, as in a numerical study of 3D turbulence [K. P. Iyer et al. , Circulation in High Reynolds Number Isotropic Turbulence is a Bifractal, Phys. Rev.

  abstract     = {Photon-mediated interactions within an excited ensemble of emitters can result in Dicke superradiance, where the emission rate is greatly enhanced, manifesting as a high-intensity burst at short times. The superradiant burst is most commonly observed in systems with long-range interactions between the emitters, although the minimal interaction range remains unknown. Here, we put forward a new theoretical method to bound the maximum emission rate by upper bounding the spectral radius of an auxiliary Hamiltonian. We harness this tool to prove that for an arbitrary ordered array with only nearest-neighbor interactions in all dimensions, a superradiant burst is not physically observable. We show that Dicke superradiance requires minimally the inclusion of next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For exponentially decaying interactions, the critical coupling is found to be asymptotically independent of the number of emitters in all dimensions, thereby defining the threshold interaction range where the collective enhancement balances out the decoherence effects. Our findings provide key physical insights to the understanding of collective decay in many-body quantum systems, and the designing of superradiant emission in physical systems for applications such as energy harvesting and quantum sensing.},

Here, we propose a technique to generate cat states of motion using the intrinsic nonlinearity of a dispersive optomechanical interaction. By applying a bichromatic drive to an optomechanical cavity, our protocol enhances the inherent second-order processes of the system, inducing the requisite two-phonon dissipation. We show that this nonlinear sideband cooling technique can dissipatively engineer a mechanical resonator into a cat state, which we verify using the full Hamiltonian and an adiabatically reduced model. While the fidelity of the cat state is maximized in the single-photon, strong-coupling regime, we demonstrate that Wigner negativity persists even for weak coupling. Finally, we show that our cat state generation protocol is robust to significant thermal decoherence of the mechanical mode, indicating that such a procedure may be feasible for near-term experimental systems.},

  abstract     = {Photonic topological states, providing light-manipulation approaches in robust manners, have attracted intense attention. Connecting photonic topological states with far-field degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) has given rise to fruitful phenomena. Recently emerged higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), hosting boundary states two or more dimensions lower than those of bulk, offer new paradigms to localize or transport light topologically in extended dimensionalities. However, photonic HOTIs have not been related to d.o.f. of radiation fields yet. Here, we report the observation of polarization-orthogonal second-order topological corner states at different frequencies on a designer-plasmonic kagome metasurface in the far field. Such phenomenon stands on two mechanisms, i.e., projecting the far-field polarizations to the intrinsic parity d.o.f. of lattice modes and the parity splitting of the plasmonic corner states in spectra. We theoretically and numerically show that the parity splitting originates from the underlying interorbital coupling. Both near-field and far-field experiments verify the polarization-orthogonal nondegenerate second-order topological corner states. These results promise applications in robust optical single photon emitters and multiplexed photonic devices.},

Motivated by these experiments, we have solved the disordered multimode Tavis-Cummings model in the thermodynamic limit and used this solution to analyze its dispersion and localization properties. The solution implies that wave-vector-resolved spectroscopic quantities can be described by single-mode models, but spatially resolved quantities require the multimode solution. Nondiagonal elements of the Green’s function decay exponentially with distance, which defines the coherence length. The coherent length is strongly correlated with the photon weight and exhibits inverse scaling with respect to the Rabi frequency and an unusual dependence on disorder. For energies away from the average molecular energy E M and above the confinement energy E C , the coherence length rapidly diverges such that it exceeds the photon resonance wavelength λ 0 . The rapid divergence allows us to differentiate the localized and delocalized regimes and identify the transition from diffusive to ballistic transport.},

The combined cross section for the Ar 34 , Cl ( α , p ) K 37 , Ar reaction is found to agree well with Hauser-Feshbach predictions. The Ar 34 ( α , 2 p ) Ar 36 cross section, which can be exclusively attributed to the Ar 34 beam component, also agrees to within the typical uncertainties quoted for statistical models. This indicates the applicability of the statistical model for predicting astrophysical ( α , p ) reaction rates in this part of the α p process, in contrast to earlier findings from indirect reaction studies indicating orders-of-magnitude discrepancies.

We further show that this extended hydrodynamic regime (EHR) indeed exists for both the weakly coupled kinetic equation in the relaxation time approximation (RTA) and the strongly coupled N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. We construct a simple but nontrivial extension of Müller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory—namely MIS*—and demonstrate that it describes the EHR response for both the RTA and SYM theory. This indicates that MIS* equations can potentially be employed to search for QGP EHR via heavy-ion collisions.},

We show that this is due to an inappropriate treatment of well-deformed nuclei in the modeling of the initial conditions of the quark-gluon plasma. Past studies have identified the deformation of the nuclear surface with that of the nuclear volume, though these are different concepts. In particular, a volume quadrupole moment can be generated by both a surface hexadecapole and a surface quadrupole moment. This feature was so far neglected in the modeling of heavy-ion collisions, and is particularly relevant for nuclei like U 238 , which is both quadrupole deformed and hexadecapole deformed. With rigorous input from Skyrme density functional calculations, we show that correcting for such effects in the implementation of nuclear deformations in hydrodynamic simulations restores agreement with BNL RHIC data. This brings consistency to the results of nuclear experiments across energy scales, and demonstrates the impact of the hexadecapole deformation of U 238 on high-energy collisions.},

  abstract     = {Reactor neutrino experiments play a crucial role in advancing our knowledge of neutrinos. In this Letter, the evolution of the flux and spectrum as a function of the reactor isotopic content is reported in terms of the inverse-beta-decay yield at Daya Bay with 1958 days of data and improved systematic uncertainties. These measurements are compared with two signature model predictions: the Huber-Mueller model based on the conversion method and the SM2018 model based on the summation method. The measured average flux and spectrum, as well as the flux evolution with the Pu 239 isotopic fraction, are inconsistent with the predictions of the Huber-Mueller model. In contrast, the SM2018 model is shown to agree with the average flux and its evolution but fails to describe the energy spectrum. Altering the predicted inverse-beta-decay spectrum from Pu 239 fission does not improve the agreement with the measurement for either model. The models can be brought into better agreement with the measurements if either the predicted spectrum due to U 235 fission is changed or the predicted U 235 , U 238 , Pu 239 , and Pu 241 spectra are changed in equal measure.},

Our result suggests that the neutrino heating in the gain region is reduced by ∼ 40\% due to fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC). We also find that the total luminosity of neutrinos is enhanced by ∼ 30\% , for which the substantial increase of heavy-leptonic neutrinos by FFCs are mainly responsible.

We observed that above 90 GV the rigidity dependence of the S flux is identical to the rigidity dependence of Ne-Mg-Si fluxes, which is different from the rigidity dependence of the He-C-O-Fe fluxes. We found that, similar to N, Na, and Al cosmic rays, over the entire rigidity range, the traditional primary cosmic rays S, Ne, Mg, and C all have sizeable secondary components, and the S, Ne, and Mg fluxes are well described by the weighted sum of the primary silicon flux and the secondary fluorine flux, and the C flux is well described by the weighted sum of the primary oxygen flux and the secondary boron flux. The primary and secondary contributions of the traditional primary cosmic-ray fluxes of C, Ne, Mg, and S (even Z elements) are distinctly different from the primary and secondary contributions of the N, Na, and Al (odd Z elements) fluxes. The abundance ratio at the source for S / Si is 0.167 ± 0.006 , for Ne / Si is 0.833 ± 0.025 , for Mg / Si is 0.994 ± 0.029 , and for C / O is 0.836 ± 0.025 .

The observed variation of proton count rate is consistent with the neutron monitor count rate, validating our methods for determining the proton count rate. It is observed by the Calorimetric Electron Telescope that both GCR electron and proton count rates at the same average rigidity vary in anticorrelation with the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet, while the amplitude of the variation is significantly larger in the electron count rate than in the proton count rate. We show that this observed charge-sign dependence is reproduced by a numerical “drift model” of the GCR transport in the heliosphere. This is a clear signature of the drift effect on the long-term solar modulation observed with a single detector.},

With its security being protected by principles of quantum mechanics, some technology challenges remain towards practical application of QKD. The major one is the distance limit, which is caused by the fact that a quantum signal cannot be amplified while the channel loss is exponential with the distance for photon transmission in optical fiber. Here using the 3-intensity sending-or-not-sending protocol with the actively-odd-parity-pairing method, we demonstrate a fiber-based twin-field QKD over 1002 km. In our experiment, we developed a dual-band phase estimation and ultra-low noise superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to suppress the system noise to around 0.02 Hz. The secure key rate is 9.53 × 10 − 12 per pulse through 1002 km fiber in the asymptotic regime, and 8.75 × 10 − 12 per pulse at 952 km considering the finite size effect.

We implement the single-shot Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which solves the problem of identifying a hidden bitstring that changes after every oracle query, using two different 27-qubit IBM Quantum superconducting processors. The speedup is observed on only one of the two processors when the quantum computation is protected by dynamical decoupling but not without it.

The algorithm works on non-Gaussian quantum states for which similarity testing could not be achieved with previous techniques. Our approach is based on a convolutional neural network that assesses the similarity of quantum states based on a lower-dimensional state representation built from measurement data. The network can be trained off-line with classically simulated data from a fiducial set of states sharing structural similarities with the states to be tested, with experimental data generated by measurements on the fiducial states, or with a combination of simulated and experimental data. We test the performance of the model on noisy cat states and states generated by arbitrary selective number-dependent phase gates. Our network can also be applied to the problem of comparing continuous variable states across different experimental platforms, with different sets of achievable measurements, and to the problem of experimentally testing whether two states are equivalent up to Gaussian unitary transformations.},

We show that, in the Ohmic regime, a Beretzinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition occurs by varying the coupling strength between the two level system and the oscillator. This is a nonperturbative result, occurring even for extremely low dissipation magnitude. By using state-of-the-art theoretical methods, we unveil the features of the relaxation towards the thermodynamic equilibrium, pointing out the signatures of quantum phase transition both in the time and frequency domains. We prove that, for low and moderate values of the dissipation, the quantum phase transition occurs in the deep strong coupling regime.

Utilizing advanced Hamiltonian engineering techniques to explore a range of spin Hamiltonians, we observe a striking change in the characteristic shape and timescale of local correlation decay as we vary the engineered exchange anisotropy. We show that these observations originate from the system’s intrinsic many-body dynamics and reveal the signatures of conservation laws within localized clusters of spins, which do not readily manifest using global probes.

Particles can either annihilate in pairs, A + A → 0 , or coagulate upon contact, A + A → A , and possibly also branch, A → A + A . In classical settings, the interplay between these processes and particle diffusion leads to critical dynamics as well as to absorbing-state phase transitions. Here, we analyze the impact of coherent hopping and of quantum superposition, focusing on the so-called reaction-limited regime. Here, spatial density fluctuations are quickly smoothed out due to fast hopping, which for classical systems is described by a mean-field approach. By exploiting the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble method, we demonstrate that quantum coherence and destructive interference play a crucial role in these systems and are responsible for the emergence of locally protected dark states and collective behavior beyond mean field. This can manifest both at stationarity and during the relaxation dynamics. Our analytical results highlight fundamental differences between classical nonequilibrium dynamics and their quantum counterpart and show that quantum effects indeed change collective universal behavior.},

As its full extraction requires perfect knowledge of the initial state, however, it does not characterize the work value of unknown or untrusted quantum sources. Fully characterizing such sources would require quantum tomography, which is prohibitively costly in experiments due to the exponential growth of required measurements and operational limitations. Here, we therefore derive a new notion of ergotropy applicable when nothing is known about the quantum states produced by the source, apart from what can be learned by performing only a single type of coarse-grained measurement. We find that in this case the extracted work is defined by the Boltzmann and observational entropy in cases where the measurement outcomes are, or are not, used in the work extraction, respectively. This notion of ergotropy represents a realistic measure of extractable work, which can be used as the relevant figure of merit to characterize a quantum battery.},

We propose an opinion dynamics model, which we name the social compass model, for interdependent topics represented in a polar space, where zealots holding extreme opinions are less prone to change their minds. We analytically show that the phase transition from polarization to consensus, as a function of increasing social influence, is explosive if topics are not correlated. We validate our theoretical framework through extensive numerical simulations and recover explosive depolarization also by using initial opinions from the American National Election Studies, including polarized and interdependent topics.},

Here, we describe a third path: structures that accommodate a finite number of delocalized zero-energy modes, leading to anomalous dispersion cones that nucleate from extreme spatial dispersion at 0 Hz. We explain how to design such zero-energy modes in the context of elasticity and show that many of the landmark wave properties of metamaterials can also be induced at an extremely subwavelength scale by the associated anomalous cones, without suffering from the same bandwidth limitations. We then validate our theory through a combination of simulations and experiments. Finally, we present an inverse design method to produce anomalous cones at desired locations in k space.},

Here, we construct a double split-gate structure to explore the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference effect in individual single-wall CNT p − n junction devices. For the first time, we achieve the AB modulation of conductance with coaxial magnetic fields as low as 3 T, where the flux through the tube is much smaller than the flux quantum. We further demonstrate direct electric-field control of the nonmonotonic magnetoconductance through a gate-tunable built-in electric field, which can be quantitatively understood in combination with the AB phase effect and Landau-Zener tunneling in a CNT p − n junction. Moreover, the nonmonotonic magnetoconductance behavior can be strongly enhanced in the presence of Fabry-Pérot resonances.

The simultaneous occurrence of a trivial bulk reopening signature and zero-bias peaks mimics the basic features required to pass the so-called “topological gap protocol.” Our results therefore provide a topologically trivial minimal model by which the applicability of this protocol can be benchmarked.},

We do this by adapting the topological quantum chemistry approach that has used constraints imposed by time reversal and crystalline symmetries to enumerate a large class of topological electronic bands. We show how to identify physically relevant models of gapped magnon band topology by using so-called decomposable elementary band representations, and in turn discuss how to use symmetry data to infer the presence of exotic symmetry enforced nodal topology.},

The chiral edge behavior originates from the interplay between the momentum-space Berry curvature in Dirac bands and the geometric phase of a spin texture in position space. The edge modes are weakly confined to the edge, featuring dispersion that is robust and insensitive to the detailed profile of magnetization at the edge. This unique character of edge modes reduces their overlap with edge disorder and enhances the mode lifetime. The mode propagation direction reverses upon reversing valley polarization, an effect that provides a clear testable signature of geometric interactions in isospin-polarized Dirac bands.},

Although the system has no intrinsic disorder, intriguingly, our analyses of static and dynamic properties on large system sizes reveal emergent glassy behavior in a region of parameter space located between two valence bond solid phases. The extent of this glassy region is demarcated using the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, and its phase transitions to the two proximate valence bond solids—as well as the crossover towards a trivial paramagnetic phase—are identified. We demonstrate the intrinsically slow (imaginary) time dynamics deep inside the glassy phase and discuss experimental considerations for detecting such a quantum disordered phase with numerous nearly degenerate local minima. Our proposal paves a new route to the study of real-time glassy phenomena and highlights the potential for quantum simulation of a distinct phase of quantum matter beyond solids and liquids in current-generation Rydberg platforms.},

Such an exotic phenomenon induced by the interplay between non-Abelian gauge fields and disorder has no Abelian analogy. Furthermore, we theoretically design and experimentally fabricate non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm topolectrical circuits to observe the non-Abelian inverse Anderson transition. Through the direct measurements of frequency-dependent impedance responses and voltage dynamics, the pseudospin-dependent non-Abelian inverse Anderson transitions are observed.

We detect two pairs of strong in-gap states on the “dumbbell-shaped” defects. They display damped oscillations with different phase shifts and a direct phase—energy correlation. These features have long been predicted for the classical Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state and are demonstrated here with unprecedented resolution for the first time. Moreover, upon applying magnetic field, all in-gap state peaks remarkably split into two rather than shift, and the splitting strength is field orientation dependent.

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we propose a novel strategy for significantly enhancing the heat transfer in convection turbulence. By introducing a boundary deformation of the standing-wave type, flow modulation can be realized when the amplitude is comparable or larger than the boundary-layer thickness. For a fixed moderate frequency, the entire fluid layer follows the boundary motion at small wave numbers, while only the near-wall regions are affected by the boundary deformation at large wave numbers. The heat-flux enhancement happens for the latter. For a fixed wave number and gradually increasing frequency, the vortical flows inside the wave valleys exhibit nonlinear transition and alter the distribution of boundary heat flux, and the global heat flux increases significantly at large enough frequencies. The current findings suggest that oscillating deformations of boundary can efficiently break the boundary layers, which serves as the bottleneck of global heat transfer, and open a new venue for modulating the convection turbulence.},

  abstract     = {In periodic systems, band degeneracies are typically protected and classified by spatial symmetries. However, in photonic systems, the Γ point at zero frequency is an intrinsic degeneracy due to the polarization degree of freedom of electromagnetic waves. For chiral photonic crystals, such an intrinsic degeneracy carries ± 2 chiral topological charge while having linear band dispersions, different from the general perception of charge-2 nodes being associated with quadratic dispersions. Here, we show that these topological characters originate from the spin-1 Weyl point at zero frequency node of triple degeneracy, due to the existence of an electrostatic flat band. Such a topological charge at zero frequency is usually buried in bulk band projections and has never been experimentally observed. To address this challenge, we introduce space-group screw symmetries in the design of chiral photonic crystal, which makes the Brillouin zone boundary an oppositely charged nodal surface enclosing the Γ point. As a result, the emergent Fermi arcs are forced to connect the projections of these topological singularities, enabling their experimental observation. The number of Fermi arcs then directly reveals the embedded topological charge at zero frequency.},

In this Letter, we examine this problem by introducing generalized electromagnetic continua consisting structured points, which carry extra degrees of freedom over coordinate transformation. We show that general nonreciprocal media have a unique time-varying Riemannian metric structure with local spinning components. It is demonstrated that the nonreciprocity can be alternatively identified as the torsion tensor of a Riemann-Cartan space, which could provide analytic expressions for the magneto-optical effect and the axionic magnetoelectric coupling. Our theory not only gives a deeper insight into the fundamental understanding of electromagnetic nonreciprocity but also provides a practical principle to geometrically design nonreciprocal devices through frame transformation.},

Focusing on zero energy, the parameter regime of this skin effect in the phase diagram just corresponds to a “real- and point-gap coexisting topological phase.” Moreover, this phase associated with the symmetry-protected Z 2 skin effect is experimentally observable by detecting the steady-state power spectral density. Our Letter is of fundamental interest in enriching non-Bloch topological physics by introducing quantum squeezing and has potential applications for the engineering of symmetry-protected sensors based on the Z 2 skin effect.},

However, given that it is an inherently weak process, the detection of multiphoton absorption signals typically requires large field intensities, hindering its applicability in many practical situations. In this Letter, we show that placing a multiphoton absorbent inside an imbalanced nonlinear interferometer can enhance the precision of multiphoton cross section estimation with respect to strategies based on photon-number measurements using coherent or even squeezed light directly transmitted through the medium. In particular, the power scaling of the sensitivity with photon flux can be increased by 1 order compared with transmission measurements of the sample with coherent light, such that the measurement precision at any given intensity can be greatly enhanced. Furthermore, we show that this enhanced measurement precision is robust against experimental imperfections leading to photon losses, which usually tend to degrade the detection sensitivity. We trace the origin of this enhancement to an optimal degree of squeezing which has to be generated in a nonlinear SU(1,1) interferometer.},

The solenoidal-spectrometer technique, commonly used to study nucleon-transfer reactions in inverse kinematics, has been applied to the case of transfer-induced fission as a means to deduce the fission-barrier height, among other variables.

The nuclear compound yield ratio ( N t × N p / N d 2 ), which is predicted to be sensitive to the fluctuation of local neutron density, is observed to decrease monotonically with increasing charged-particle multiplicity ( d N c h / d η ) and follows a scaling behavior. The d N c h / d η dependence of the yield ratio is compared to calculations from coalescence and thermal models. Enhancements in the yield ratios relative to the coalescence baseline are observed in the 0\%-10\% most central collisions at 19.6 and 27 GeV, with a significance of 2.3 σ and 3.4 σ , respectively, giving a combined significance of 4.1 σ .

  abstract     = {The Wilson loop operator in the U ( N ) k × U ( N ) − k Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory at large N and fixed level k has a dual description in terms of a wrapped M2-brane in the M -theory given by the product of four-dimensional anti de Sitter space ( AdS 4 ) and S 7 / Z k . We consider the localization result for the 1 2 -Bogomol’nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield circular Wilson loop expectation value W in this regime and compare it to the prediction of the M2-brane theory. The leading large N exponential factor is matched as expected by the classical action of the M2-brane solution with AdS 2 × S 1 geometry. We show that the subleading k -dependent prefactor in W is also exactly reproduced by the one-loop term in the partition function of the wrapped M2-brane (with all Kaluza-Klein modes included). This appears to be the first case of an exact matching of the overall numerical prefactor in the Wilson loop expectation value against the dual holographic result. It provides an example of a consistent quantum M2-brane computation, suggesting various generalizations.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational wave (GW) detections of binary neutron star inspirals will be crucial for constraining the dense matter equation of state (EOS). We demonstrate a new degeneracy in the mapping from tidal deformability data to the EOS, which occurs for models with strong phase transitions. We find that there exists a new family of EOS with phase transitions that set in at different densities and that predict neutron star radii that differ by up to ∼ 500 m but that produce nearly identical tidal deformabilities for all neutron star masses. Next-generation GW detectors and advances in nuclear theory may be needed to resolve this degeneracy.},

By construction this formalism bypasses difficulties with unphysical singularities or higher-time derivatives. This framework has been previously used to obtain the exact velocity dependence of the O ( G 2 ) quadratic-in-spin two-body Hamiltonian. We first evaluate the S 3 scattering angle and two-body Hamiltonian at this order in G , including not only all operators corresponding to the usual worldline operators, but also an additional set due to an interesting subtlety. We then evaluate S 4 and S 5 contributions at O ( G 2 ) which we confirm by comparing against aligned-spin results. We conjecture that a certain shift symmetry together with a constraint on the high-energy growth of the scattering amplitude specify the Wilson coefficients for the Kerr black hole to all orders in the spin and confirm that they reproduce the previously obtained results through S 4 .},

The null results of this search set an upper limit on the coupling energy between the neutron spin and the gravity on the ground at 5.3 × 10 − 22 eV (95\% confidence level), resulting in a 17-fold improvement over the previous limit. The results can also be used to constrain several other anomalous interactions. In particular, the limit on the coupling strength of axion-mediated monopole-dipole interactions at the range of Earth’s radius is improved by a factor of 17.},

Higgsinos may naturally be the lightest superpartners in split-supersymmetry models that decouple the scalar superpartners while keeping Higgsinos and gauginos close to the TeV scale. Higgsino DM may annihilate today to give continuum γ -ray emission at energies less than a TeV in addition to a linelike signature at energies equal to the mass. Previous searches for Higgsino DM, for example with the H.E.S.S. γ -ray telescope, have not reached the necessary sensitivity to probe the Higgsino annihilation cross section. In this work we make use of 14 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope at energies above ∼ 10 GeV to search for the continuum emission near the Galactic Center from Higgsino annihilation. We interpret our results using DM profiles from Milky Way analog galaxies in the FIRE-2 hydrodynamic cosmological simulations. We set the strongest constraints to date on Higgsino-like DM. Our results show a mild, ∼ 2 σ preference for Higgsino DM with a mass near the thermal Higgsino mass and, depending on the DM density profile, the expected cross section.},

  abstract     = {Determining capacities of quantum channels is a fundamental question in quantum information theory. Despite having rigorous coding theorems quantifying the flow of information across quantum channels, their capacities are poorly understood due to superadditivity effects. Studying these phenomena is important for deepening our understanding of quantum information, yet simple and clean examples of superadditive channels are scarce. Here we study a family of channels called platypus channels. Its simplest member, a qutrit channel, is shown to display superadditivity of coherent information when used jointly with a variety of qubit channels. Higher-dimensional family members display superadditivity of quantum capacity together with an erasure channel. Subject to the “spin-alignment conjecture” introduced in our companion paper [F. Leditzky, D. Leung, V. Siddhu, G. Smith, and J. A. Smolin, The platypus of the quantum channel zoo, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (IEEE, 2023), 10.1109/TIT.2023.3245985 ], our results on superadditivity of quantum capacity extend to lower-dimensional channels as well as larger parameter ranges. In particular, superadditivity occurs between two weakly additive channels each with large capacity on their own, in stark contrast to previous results. Remarkably, a single, novel transmission strategy achieves superadditivity in all examples. Our results show that superadditivity is much more prevalent than previously thought. It can occur across a wide variety of channels, even when both participating channels have large quantum capacity.},

Our algorithm uses ideas from quantum simulation to decouple the unknown N -qubit Hamiltonian H into noninteracting patches and learns H using a quantum-enhanced divide-and-conquer approach. The proposed algorithm is robust against state preparation and measurement error, does not require eigenstates or thermal states, and only uses polylog ( ε − 1 ) experiments. In contrast, the best existing algorithms require O ( ε − 2 ) experiments and total evolution time. We prove a matching lower bound to establish the asymptotic optimality of our algorithm.},

We combine these maps with a unitary evolution acting during random Poissonian times between collisions and causing dephasing. We find that, at a low collision rate, the nontrivial combination of these two effects causes thermalization in the system. This scenario is suitable for modeling collisional reservoirs at equilibrium. We justify this claim by identifying the conditions for such maps to arise within a scattering theory approach and provide a thorough characterization of the resulting thermalization process.},

Here, we experimentally observe the non-Markovian evolution of EPR steering including its sudden death and revival processes, during which the degree of memory effect plays a key role in the recovery of steering. Additionally, a strict unsteerable feature is sufficiently verified during the non-Markovian evolution within multisetting measurements.

While this feature has been associated with the preservation of causality, a consistent causal nonlinear theory was recently developed. Interestingly, this theory is unavoidably sensitive to the full physical spread of the wave function, rendering existing experimental tests for nonlinearities inapplicable. Here, using well-controlled motional superpositions of a trapped ion, we set a stringent limit of 5.4 × 10 − 12 on the magnitude of the unitless scaling factor ε ˜ γ for the predicted causal nonlinear perturbation.},

Changing the timescale of the forcing allows the system to transition between a situation where its fate is determined by following the local energy minimum to one where it is trapped in a shallow well determined by the path taken through configuration space. Oscillatory forcing can lead to transients lasting many cycles, a behavior not possible for a single quasistatic hysteron.},

This force is the result of both plasmonic and photonic modes. For very thin films, field penetration through the films will modify the allowed modes. Here, we theoretically investigate the Casimir interaction between ultrathin films from the perspective of force distribution over real frequencies for the first time. Pronounced repulsive contributions to the force are found due to the highly confined and nearly dispersion-free epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) modes that only exist in ultrathin films. These contributions persistently occur around the ENZ frequency of the film irrespective of the interfilm separation. We further associate the ENZ modes with a striking thickness dependence of a proposed figure of merit (FOM) for conductive thin films, suggesting that the motion of objects induced by Casimir interactions is boosted for deeply nanoscale sizes. Our results shed light on the correlation between special electromagnetic modes and the vacuum fluctuation-induced force as well as the resulting mechanical properties of ultrathin ENZ materials, which may create new opportunities for engineering the motion of ultrasmall objects in nanomechanical systems.},

In another polar system of p − n junction, there exists the electric polarization at the interface due to the Fermi level misalignment. However, the resultant built-in electric field is unavailable to manipulate, thus attracting less attention for memory devices. Here, we report the interfacial polarization hysteresis (IPH) in the vertical sidewall van der Waals heterojunctions of black phosphorus and quasi-two-dimensional electron gas on SrTiO 3 . A nonvolatile switching of electric polarization can be achieved by reconstructing the space charge region (SCR) with long-lifetime nonequilibrium carriers. The resulting electric-field controllable IPH is experimentally verified by electric hysteresis, polarization oscillation, and pyroelectric effect. Further studies confirm the transition temperature of 340 K, beyond which the IPH vanishes. The second transition is revealed with the temperature dropping below 230 K, corresponding to the sharp improvement of IPH and the freezing of SCR reconstruction. This work offers new possibilities for exploring the memory phenomena in nonferroelectric p − n heterojunctions.},

  abstract     = {Fracton phases are a particularly exotic type of quantum spin liquids where the elementary quasiparticles are intrinsically immobile. These phases may be described by unconventional gauge theories known as tensor or multipolar gauge theories, characteristic for so-called type-I or type-II fracton phases, respectively. Both variants have been associated with distinctive singular patterns in the spin structure factor, such as multifold pinch points for type-I and quadratic pinch points for type-II fracton phases. Here, we assess the impact of quantum fluctuations on these patterns by numerically investigating the spin S = 1 / 2 quantum version of a classical spin model on the octahedral lattice featuring exact realizations of multifold and quadratic pinch points, as well as an unusual pinch line singularity. Based on large scale pseudofermion and pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations, we take the intactness of these spectroscopic signatures as a measure for the stability of the corresponding fracton phases. We find that in all three cases, quantum fluctuations significantly modify the shape of pinch points or lines by smearing them out and shifting signal away from the singularities in contrast to effects of pure thermal fluctuations. This indicates possible fragility of these phases and allows us to identify characteristic fingerprints of their remnants.},

Here we microscopically observe a homogeneous superfluid density n s on the surface of UTe 2 and an enhanced superconducting transition temperature near the edges. We also detect vortex-antivortex pairs even at zero magnetic field, indicating the existence of a hidden internal field. The temperature dependence of n s , determined independent of sample geometry, does not support point nodes along the b axis for a quasi-2D Fermi surface and provides no evidence for multiple phase transitions in UTe 2 .},

Here, we show that, due to the nearly perfect spin rotation symmetry of graphene, the fluctuations of the spin orientation of the triplet order parameter suppress the superconducting transition to nearly zero temperature. Our analysis shows that both an Ising spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane magnetic field can eliminate these low-lying fluctuations and can greatly enhance the transition temperature, consistent with the recent experiment. Our model also suggests the possible existence of a phase at small anisotropy and magnetic field which exhibits quasilong-range ordered spin-singlet charge 4 e superconductivity, even while the triplet 2 e superconducting order only exhibits short-ranged correlations. Finally, we discuss relevant experimental signatures.},

Here we experimentally demonstrate the quantum control of a single magnon in a macroscopic spin system (i.e., 1 mm-diameter yttrium-iron-garnet sphere) coupled to a superconducting qubit via a microwave cavity. By tuning the qubit frequency in situ via the Autler-Townes effect, we manipulate this single magnon to generate its nonclassical quantum states, including the single-magnon state and the superposition of single-magnon state and vacuum (zero magnon) state. Moreover, we confirm the deterministic generation of these nonclassical states by Wigner tomography. Our experiment offers the first reported deterministic generation of the nonclassical quantum states in a macroscopic spin system and paves a way to explore its promising applications in quantum engineering.},

We propose a parity-time symmetric ( P T -symmetric) feedback method to narrow the linewidths of resonance systems. By using a quadrature measurement-feedback loop, we transform a dissipative resonance system into a P T -symmetric system. Unlike the conventional P T -symmetric systems that typically require two or more modes, here the P T -symmetric feedback system contains only a single resonance mode, which greatly extends the scope of applications. The method enables remarkable linewidth narrowing and enhancement of measurement sensitivity. We illustrate the concept in a thermal ensemble of atoms, achieving a 48-fold narrowing of the magnetic resonance linewidth. By applying the method in magnetometry, we realize a 22-times improvement of the measurement sensitivity. This work opens the avenue for studying non-Hermitian physics and high-precision measurements in resonance systems with feedback.},

Here we present a species-agnostic method for dark-state enhanced loading (DSEL) based on real-time feedback, long-lived shelving states, and iterated array reloading. We demonstrate this technique with a 95-tweezer array of Sr 88 atoms, achieving a maximum loading probability of 84.02(4)\% and a maximum array size of 91 atoms in one dimension. Our protocol is complementary to, and compatible with, existing schemes for enhanced loading based on direct control over light-assisted collisions, and we predict it can enable close-to-unity filling for arrays of atoms or molecules.},

While a liquid-gas transition is expected when such a balance is broken, it remains elusive whether liquid-gas critical points exist in the quantum regime. Here, we study the quantum criticality in a binary Bose mixture undergoing the liquid-gas transition. We show that, beyond a narrow stability window of the self-bound liquid, a liquid-gas coexistence persists, which eventually transits into a homogeneous mixture. Importantly, we identify two distinct critical points where the liquid-gas coexistence terminates. These critical points are characterized by rich critical behaviors in their vicinity, including divergent susceptibility, unique phonon-mode softening, and enhanced density correlations. The liquid-gas transition and the critical points can be readily explored in ultracold atoms confined to a box potential. Our work highlights the thermodynamic approach as a powerful tool in revealing the quantum liquid-gas criticality, and paves the way for further studies of critical phenomena in quantum liquids.},

QFT in AdS thus provides an alternative route to fundamental QFT results that normally rely on the LSZ axioms.},

Using a nucleosynthesis prior, we measure the Hubble constant to be H 0 = 63.2 ± 2.5 km / s / Mpc .

However, they are typically not Gaussian and also generate a bispectrum. These models can help to mitigate the large-scale anomalies of the CMB by considering substantial non-Gaussianities on very large scales, which decay exponentially on subhorizon scales. It was therefore thought that this non-Gaussianity would not be visible in observations, which can only probe subhorizon scales. We show that bouncing models with parameters such that they can significantly mitigate the large-scale anomalies of the CMB are excluded by the Planck data with high significance of, depending on the specific model, 5.4, 6.4, or 14 standard deviations.},

We propose a realization of associative memory with a single driven-dissipative quantum oscillator exploiting its infinite degrees of freedom in phase space. The model can improve the storage capacity of discrete neuron-based systems in a large regime and we prove successful state discrimination between n coherent states, which represent the stored patterns of the system. These can be tuned continuously by modifying the driving strength, constituting a modified learning rule. We show that the associative-memory capability is inherently related to the existence of a spectral separation in the Liouvillian superoperator, which results in a long timescale separation in the dynamics corresponding to a metastable phase.},

Here, we use Jiǔzhāng , a noisy intermediate-scale quantum computer, to solve graph problems. The samples are generated from a 144-mode fully connected photonic processor, with photon click up to 80 in the quantum computational advantage regime. We investigate the open question of whether the GBS enhancement over the classical stochastic algorithms persists—and how it scales—with an increasing system size on noisy quantum devices in the computationally interesting regime. We experimentally observe the presence of GBS enhancement with a large photon-click number and a robustness of the enhancement under certain noise. Our work is a step toward testing real-world problems using the existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers and hopes to stimulate the development of more efficient classical and quantum-inspired algorithms.},

In this quench-probe setting, the region undergoing a quantum quench is tunnel coupled to a static region, the probe. Subsequently, the time-dependent entanglement signatures of a tunable subset of excitations propagating to the probe are monitored by energy selectivity. We exemplify the power of this generic approach by identifying a unique dynamical signature associated with the presence of an isolated Majorana zero mode in the postquench Hamiltonian. In this case excitations emitted from the topological part of the system give rise to a fractionalized jump of log ( 2 ) / 2 in the entanglement entropy of the probe. This dynamical effect is highly sensitive to the localized nature of the Majorana zero mode, but does not require the preparation of a topological initial state.},

Over the years, the phenomenon of network nonlocality in the entanglement-swapping scenario has been well investigated and demonstrated. However, it is known that violations of the so-called bilocality inequality used in previous experimental demonstrations cannot be used to certify the nonclassicality of their sources. This has put forward a stronger concept for nonlocality in networks, called full network nonlocality. Here, we experimentally observe full network nonlocal correlations in a network where the source-independence, locality, and measurement-independence loopholes are closed. This is ensured by employing two independent sources, rapid setting generation, and spacelike separations of relevant events. Our experiment violates known inequalities characterizing nonfull network nonlocal correlations by over 5 standard deviations, certifying the absence of classical sources in the realization.},

Thus far, self-organized criticality has typically been depicted as a one-dimensional process, where one parameter is tuned to a critical value. However, the number of adjustable parameters in the brain is vast, and hence critical states can be expected to occupy a high-dimensional manifold inside a high-dimensional parameter space. Here, we show that adaptation rules inspired by homeostatic plasticity drive a neuro-inspired network to drift on a critical manifold, where the system is poised between inactivity and persistent activity. During the drift, global network parameters continue to change while the system remains at criticality.},

The particle void region corresponds to a fluid vortex, and it is driven by a surrounding spinner edge current. We show that the instability originates from a hydrodynamic lift force between the particle and fluid flows. The cavitation can be tuned by the strength of the collective flows. It is suppressed when the spinners are confined by a no-slip surface, and multiple cavity and oscillating cavity states are observed when the particle concentration is reduced.},

  abstract     = {Interfaces of phase-separated systems roughen in time due to capillary waves. Because of fluxes in the bulk, their dynamics is nonlocal in real space and is not described by the Edwards-Wilkinson or Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equations, nor their conserved counterparts. We show that, in the absence of detailed balance, the phase-separated interface is described by a new universality class that we term | q | KPZ . We compute the associated scaling exponents via one-loop renormalization group and corroborate the results by numerical integration of the | q | KPZ equation. Deriving the effective interface dynamics from a minimal field theory of active phase separation, we finally argue that the | q | KPZ universality class generically describes liquid-vapor interfaces in two- and three-dimensional active systems.},

  abstract     = {We discover a deep connection between parity-time symmetric optical systems and quantum transport in one-dimensional fermionic chains in a two-terminal open system setting. The spectrum of one dimensional tight-binding chain with periodic on-site potential can be obtained by casting the problem in terms of 2 × 2 transfer matrices. We find that these non-Hermitian matrices have a symmetry exactly analogous to the parity-time symmetry of balanced-gain-loss optical systems, and hence show analogous transitions across exceptional points. We show that the exceptional points of the transfer matrix of a unit cell correspond to the band edges of the spectrum. When connected to two zero temperature baths at two ends, this consequently leads to subdiffusive scaling of conductance with system size, with an exponent 2, if the chemical potential of the baths are equal to the band edges. We further demonstrate the existence of a dissipative quantum phase transition as the chemical potential is tuned across any band edge. Remarkably, this feature is analogous to transition across a mobility edge in quasiperiodic systems. This behavior is universal, irrespective of the details of the periodic potential and the number of bands of the underlying lattice. It, however, has no analog in absence of the baths.},

  abstract     = {Upon intense femtosecond photoexcitation, a many-body system can undergo a phase transition through a nonequilibrium route, but understanding these pathways remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we use time-resolved second harmonic generation to investigate a photoinduced phase transition in Ca 3 Ru 2 O 7 and show that mesoscale inhomogeneity profoundly influences the transition dynamics. We observe a marked slowing down of the characteristic time τ that quantifies the transition between two structures. τ evolves nonmonotonically as a function of photoexcitation fluence, rising from below 200 fs to ∼ 1.4 ps , then falling again to below 200 fs. To account for the observed behavior, we perform a bootstrap percolation simulation that demonstrates how local structural interactions govern the transition kinetics. Our work highlights the importance of percolating mesoscale inhomogeneity in the dynamics of photoinduced phase transitions and provides a model that may be useful for understanding such transitions more broadly.},

  abstract     = {Polarizing electron beams using light is highly desirable but exceedingly challenging, as the approaches proposed in previous studies using free-space light usually require enormous laser intensities. Here, we propose the use of a transverse electric optical near field, extended on nanostructures, to efficiently polarize an adjacent electron beam by exploiting the strong inelastic electron scattering in phase-matched optical near fields. Intriguingly, the two spin components of an unpolarized incident electron beam—parallel and antiparallel to the electric field—are spin-flipped and inelastically scattered to different energy states, providing an analog of the Stern-Gerlach experiment in the energy dimension. Our calculations show that when a dramatically reduced laser intensity of ∼ 10 12 W / cm 2 and a short interaction length of 16 μ m are used, an unpolarized incident electron beam interacting with the excited optical near field can produce two spin-polarized electron beams, both exhibiting near unity spin purity and a 6\% brightness relative to the input beam. Our findings are important for optical control of free-electron spins, preparation of spin-polarized electron beams, and applications in material science and high-energy physics.},

Through symmetry consideration based on the Landau theory, we discover that the antiferromagnetic transitions on the two nonequivalent Ni sublattices occur separately at different Néel temperatures induced by the O breathing mode. It is manifested by two kinks on the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities with the secondary kink being continuous in the collinear magnetic structure but discontinuous in the noncollinear one. The prediction on the secondary discontinuous kink is corroborated by an existing magnetic susceptibility measurement on bulk single-crystalline nickelates, thus strongly supporting the noncollinear nature of the magnetic structure in bulk nickelates, thereby shedding new light on the long-standing debate.},

In these systems, time-reversal symmetry is broken spontaneously due to a nonzero density of plaquettes with an odd number of edges n odd . This mechanism opens a sizable gap, at small n odd compatible with that of typical amorphous materials and polycrystals, and which can alternatively be induced by ion irradiation. We find that the gap is proportional to n odd , saturating at n odd ∼ 40\% . Using exact diagonalization, we find that the chiral spin liquid is approximately as stable to Heisenberg interactions as Kitaev’s honeycomb spin-liquid model.

We study the model with a power-law bath spectrum ∝ ω s where, in addition to a critical phase predicted by perturbative RG, a stable strong-coupling phase is present. Using a detailed scaling analysis, we provide direct numerical evidence for the collision and annihilation of two RG fixed points at s * = 0.6540 ( 2 ) , causing the critical phase to disappear for s &lt; s * . In particular, we uncover a surprising duality between the two fixed points, corresponding to a reflection symmetry of the RG beta function, which we utilize to make analytical predictions at strong coupling which are in excellent agreement with numerics. Our work makes phenomena of fixed-point annihilation accessible to large-scale simulations, and we comment on the consequences for impurity moments in critical magnets.},

This intriguing interplay between non-Hermitian (NH) topology and spontaneous symmetry breaking is exemplified by a magnetic NH Weyl phase spontaneously emerging at the surface of a strongly correlated three-dimensional topological insulator, when entering the ferromagnetic regime from a high-temperature paramagnetic phase. Here, electronic excitations with opposite spin acquire significantly different lifetimes, thus giving rise to an anti-Hermitian structure in spin that is incompatible with the chiral spin texture of the nodal surface states, and hence facilitate the spontaneous formation of EPs. We present numerical evidence of this phenomenon by solving a microscopic multiband Hubbard model nonperturbatively in the framework of dynamical mean-field theory.},

Here, using exact diagonalization of a multiexciton Hamiltonian modeled in a diatomic kagome lattice, we demonstrate that the negative exciton formation energies are only a prerequisite but insufficient condition for realizing an EI. By a comparative study between the cases of both conduction and valence flat bands (FBs) versus that of a parabolic conduction band, we further show that the presence and increased FB contribution to exciton formation provide an attractive avenue to stabilize the excitonic condensate, as confirmed by calculations and analyses of multiexciton energies, wave functions, and reduced density matrices. Our results warrant a similar many-exciton analysis for other known and/or new candidates of EIs and demonstrate the FBs of opposite parity as a unique platform for studying exciton physics, paving the way to material realization of spinor BEC and spin superfluidity.},

We show here that Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferences between excitations created by narrow voltage pulses on the edge states of a FQHE system at low temperature show a direct signature of anyonic statistics. The width of the HOM dip is universally fixed by the thermal time scale, independently of the intrinsic width of the excited fractional wave packets. This universal width can be related to the anyonic braiding of the incoming excitations with thermal fluctuations created at the quantum point contact. We show that this effect could be realistically observed with periodic trains of narrow voltage pulses using current experimental techniques.},

  abstract     = {Topological insulator-based methods underpin the topological classification of gapped bands, including those surrounding semimetallic nodal defects. However, multiple bands with gap-closing points can also possess nontrivial topology. We construct a general wave-function-based “punctured-Chern” invariant to capture such topology. To show its general applicability, we analyze two systems with disparate gapless topology: (1) a recent two-dimensional fragile topological model to capture the various band-topological transitions and (2) a three-dimensional model with a triple-point nodal defect to characterize its semimetallic topology with half integers that govern physical observables such as anomalous transport. This invariant also gives the classification for Nexus triple points ( Z × Z ) with certain symmetry restrictions, which is reconfirmed by abstract algebra.},

The perpendicular coercive field, zero Hall plateau width, and peak resistance value can all be systematically controlled by the in-plane magnetic field. The traces taken at various fields almost collapse into a single curve when the field vector is renormalized to an angle as a geometric parameter. These results can be explained consistently by the competition between magnetic anisotropy and in-plane Zeeman field, and the close relationship between quantum transport and magnetic domain structure. The accurate control of zero Hall plateau facilitates the search for chiral Majorana modes based on the quantum anomalous Hall system in proximity to a superconductor.},

Here, we report a new regime of beam-plasma interaction arising from REB propagation in medium with fine structures. In this regime, the REB cascades into thin branches with local density a hundred times the initial value and deposits its energy 2 orders of magnitude more efficiently than that in homogeneous plasma, where REB branching does not occur, of similar average density. Such beam branching can be attributed to successive weak scatterings of the beam electrons by the unevenly distributed magnetic fields induced by the local return currents in the skeletons of the porous medium. Results from a model for the excitation conditions and location of the first branching point with respect to the medium and beam parameters agree well with that from pore-resolved particle-in-cell simulations.},

  abstract     = {Spin-orbit interactions in evanescent fields have recently attracted significant interest. In particular, the transfer of the Belinfante spin momentum perpendicular to the propagation direction generates polarization-dependent lateral forces on particles. However, it is still elusive as to how the polarization-dependent resonances of large particles synergize with the incident light’s helicity and resultant lateral forces. Here, we investigate these polarization-dependent phenomena in a microfiber-microcavity system where whispering-gallery-mode resonances exist. This system allows for an intuitive understanding and unification of the polarization-dependent forces. Contrary to previous studies, the induced lateral forces at resonance are not proportional to the helicity of incident light. Instead, polarization-dependent coupling phases and resonance phases generate extra helicity contributions. We propose a generalized law for optical lateral forces and find the existence of optical lateral forces even when the helicity of incident light is zero. Our work provides new insights into these polarization-dependent phenomena and an opportunity to engineer polarization-controlled resonant optomechanical systems.},

It is shown that a scattering resonance can be induced under microwave fields reachable in current experiments. With the effective potential, we further study the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing in the microwave-shielded NaK gas. We show that the superfluid critical temperature is drastically enhanced near the resonance.

These oscillon-induced GWs, sourced by second-order perturbations, are distinct and could be orders of magnitude lower in frequency than the previously considered GWs associated with oscillon formation. We show that detectable oscillon-induced GW signatures establish direct tests independent from cosmic microwave background radiation for regions of parameter space of monodromy, and logarithmic and pure natural (plateau) potential classes of inflationary models, among others. We demonstrate that oscillon-induced GWs in a model based on pure natural inflation could be directly observable with the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and DECIGO.

  abstract     = {Dark photons can be the ultralight dark matter candidate, interacting with Standard Model particles via kinetic mixing. We propose to search for ultralight dark photon dark matter (DPDM) through the local absorption at different radio telescopes. The local DPDM can induce harmonic oscillations of electrons inside the antenna of radio telescopes. It leads to a monochromatic radio signal and can be recorded by telescope receivers. Using the observation data from the FAST telescope, the upper limit on the kinetic mixing can already reach 10 − 12 for DPDM oscillation frequencies at 1–1.5 GHz, which is stronger than the cosmic microwave background constraint by about one order of magnitude. Furthermore, large-scale interferometric arrays like LOFAR and SKA1 telescopes can achieve extraordinary sensitivities for direct DPDM search from 10 MHz to 10 GHz.},

We demonstrate the trapping and imaging of rubidium atoms in integer and fractional Talbot planes and the assembly of defect-free atom arrays in different layers. The Talbot self-imaging effect for microlens arrays constitutes a structurally robust and wavelength-universal method for the realization of 3D atom arrays with beneficial scaling properties. With more than 750 qubit sites per 2D layer, these scaling properties imply that 10 000 qubit sites are already accessible in 3D in our current implementation. The trap topology and functionality are configurable in the micrometer regime. We use this to generate interleaved lattices with dynamic position control and parallelized sublattice addressing of spin states for immediate application in quantum science and technology.},

The condition relates a nonzero macroscopic cumulant correlation in the steady state to the presence of gapless modes in the Lindbladian. In phases arising from competing coherent and dissipative Lindbladian terms, we argue that such gapless modes, concomitant with angular momentum conservation, can lead to persistent dynamics in the spin observables with the possible formation of dissipative time crystals. We study different models within this perspective, from Lindbladians with Hermitian jump operators, to non-Hermitian ones composed by collective spins and Floquet spin-boson systems. We also provide a simple analytical proof for the exactness of the mean-field semiclassical approach in such systems based on a cumulant expansion.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a model of friction between two contacting (stationary or cosliding) rough surfaces, each comprising a random ensemble of polydisperse hemispherical bumps. In the simplest version of the model, the bumps experience on contact with each other only pairwise elastic repulsion and dissipative drag. These minimal ingredients are sufficient to capture a static state of jammed, interlocking contacting bumps, below a critical frictional force that is proportional to the normal load and independent of the apparent contact area, consistent with the Amontons-Coulomb laws of friction. However, they fail to capture two widespread observations: (i) that the dynamic friction coefficient (ratio of frictional to normal force in steady sliding) is a roughly constant or slightly weakening function of the sliding velocity U , at low U , with a nonzero quasistatic limit as U → 0 and (ii) that the static friction coefficient (ratio of frictional to normal force needed to initiate sliding) increases (“ages”) as a function of the time that surfaces are pressed together in stationary contact, before sliding commences. To remedy these shortcomings, we incorporate a single additional model ingredient: that contacting bumps plastically nudge one another slightly sideways, above a critical contact-contact load. With this additional insight, the model also captures observations (i) and (ii).},

Among these, spontaneous self-oscillations of mechanical structures is perhaps the simplest and most widespread type of nonequilibrium phenomenon. Yet, we lack experimental model systems to investigate the various dynamical phenomena that may appear. Here, we introduce a centimeter-sized model system for one-dimensional elastoactive structures. We show that such structures exhibit flagellar motion when pinned at one end, self-snapping when pinned at two ends, and synchronization when coupled together with a sufficiently stiff link. We further demonstrate that these transitions can be described quantitatively by simple models of coupled pendula with follower forces. Beyond the canonical case considered here, we anticipate our work to open avenues for the understanding and design of the self-organization and response of active biological and synthetic solids, e.g., in higher dimensions and for more intricate geometries.},

At T d , the ratio of the precursor and geometrically frustrated particles reaches the maximum. When T g &lt; T &lt; T d , nucleation kinetics is characterized by the subdiffusive slow particle motion, the high degrees of geometric frustration, and the saturation of precursors. In this regime, nucleation can proceed through the diffusionless-like ordering of precursors. Near T g , there is a crossover regime, where geometrically frustrated particles percolate and the glass formation strongly slows down the nucleation. When T &lt; T g , diffusionless nucleation is obstructed due to the weak vibrational motion and the mechanical stability of the glassy state.},

We find that while the diodelike behavior of switching currents is rooted in asymmetric current-phase relations, nonreciprocal retrapping currents originate in asymmetric quasiparticle currents. These different origins also imply distinctly different symmetry requirements. We illustrate our results by a microscopic model for junctions involving a single magnetic atom. Our theory provides significant guidance in identifying the microscopic origin of nonreciprocities in Josephson junctions.},

The possible mediation of percolation threshold p c by controlling the samples’ dimensionality unveiled the collective effect in growth of percolation paths driven by electric field, enabling us to draw a smooth connection between two typically observed nonlinear phenomena, dissipative tunnelinglike and threshold-limited transport, which have been controversial for years. The possible microscopic origins of the collective transport are discussed within the Coulomb blockade theory.},

These results portray a modification of the electronic properties of the material and align with the layer-dependent magnetism in CrI 3 , shedding light on the long-standing structural conundrum in this material.

Such a photoinduced phase transition is entirely driven by switchable covalent bonds with breaking and reformation, enabling the reversible light-controllable ferroelectric polarization switching, dielectric and nonlinear optical bistability. Moreover, light as quantized energy can achieve contactless, nondestructive, and remote-control operations.

  abstract     = {The Moore-Read state, one of the leading candidates for describing the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling factor ν = 5 / 2 , is a paradigmatic p -wave superconductor with non-Abelian topological order. Among its many exotic properties, the state hosts two collective modes: a bosonic density wave and a neutral fermion mode that arises from an unpaired electron in the condensate. It has recently been proposed that the descriptions of the two modes can be unified by postulating supersymmetry (SUSY) that relates them in the long-wavelength limit. Here we extend the SUSY description to construct wave functions of the two modes on closed surfaces, such as the sphere and torus, and we test the resulting states in large-scale numerical simulations. We demonstrate the equivalence in the long-wavelength limit between SUSY wave functions and previous descriptions of collective modes based on the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman ansatz, Jack polynomials, and bipartite composite fermions. Leveraging the first-quantized form of the SUSY wave functions, we study their energies using the Monte Carlo method and show that realistic ν = 5 / 2 systems are close to the putative SUSY point, where the two collective modes become degenerate in energy.},

  abstract     = {The electrical conductivity of a macroscopic assembly of nanomaterials is determined through a complex interplay of electronic transport within and between constituent nano-objects. Phonons play dual roles in this situation: their increased populations tend to reduce the conductivity via electron scattering, while they can boost the conductivity by assisting electrons to propagate through the potential-energy landscape. We identified a phonon-assisted coherent electron transport process between neighboring nanotubes in temperature-dependent conductivity measurements on a macroscopic film of armchair single-wall carbon nanotubes. Through atomistic modeling of electronic states and calculations of both electronic and phonon-assisted junction conductances, we conclude that phonon-assisted conductance is the dominant mechanism for observed high-temperature transport in armchair carbon nanotubes. The unambiguous manifestation of coherent intertube dynamics proves a single-chirality armchair nanotube film to be a unique macroscopic solid-state ensemble of nano-objects promising for the development of room-temperature coherent electronic devices.},

Further, for a 100-nm-thick Ti film on a glass substrate, a significant enhancement of in-plane thermal conductivity compared to bulk value ( ∼ 25\% ) is experimentally shown. This Letter will provide a new avenue to employ SPPs for heat dissipation along a supported thin film, which can be readily applied to mitigate hot-spot issues in microelectronics.},

  abstract     = {The phonon magnetochiral effect (MChE) is the nonreciprocal acoustic and thermal transports of phonons caused by the simultaneous breaking of the mirror and time-reversal symmetries. So far, the phonon MChE has been observed only in a ferrimagnetic insulator Cu 2 OSeO 3 , where the nonreciprocal response disappears above the Curie temperature of 58 K. Here, we study the nonreciprocal acoustic properties of a room-temperature ferromagnet Co 9 Zn 9 Mn 2 for unveiling the phonon MChE close to room temperature. Surprisingly, the nonreciprocity in this metallic compound is enhanced at higher temperatures and observed up to 250 K. This clear contrast between insulating Cu 2 OSeO 3 and metallic Co 9 Zn 9 Mn 2 suggests that metallic magnets have a mechanism to enhance the nonreciprocity at higher temperatures. From the ultrasound and microwave-spectroscopy experiments, we conclude that the magnitude of the phonon MChE of Co 9 Zn 9 Mn 2 mostly depends on the Gilbert damping, which increases at low temperatures and hinders the magnon-phonon hybridization. Our results suggest that the phonon nonreciprocity could be further enhanced by engineering the magnon band of materials.},

Working with Mn atoms on Au(111) covered by a monolayer of MoS 2 , we tune the interadatom exchange via the adatom distance and the adatom-substrate exchange via the location relative to a moiré structure of the substrate. Differential-conductance measurements on isolated adatoms exhibit Kondo peaks with heights depending on the adatom location relative to the moiré structure. Mn dimers spaced by a few atomic lattice sites exhibit split Kondo resonances. In contrast, adatoms in closely spaced dimers couple antiferromagnetically, resulting in a molecular-singlet ground state. Exciting the singlet-triplet transition by tunneling electrons, we find that the singlet-triplet splitting is surprisingly sensitive to the moiré structure. We interpret our results theoretically by relating the variations in the singlet-triplet splitting to the heights of the Kondo peaks of single adatoms, finding evidence for coupling of the adatom spin to multiple conduction electron channels.},

Here, we demonstrate the amplifying diode using an active metamaterial with nonreciprocal Willis coupling. We also discuss the situation with the presence of both reciprocal and nonreciprocal Willis couplings for more flexibility in implementation. The coexistence of both amplifier and perfect absorber in opposite incident directions extends the regime of sound isolation and further enables applications in sensing and communication, in which nonreciprocity can play an important role.},

Our results provide the first quantitative contributions of multiple reaction mechanisms including the quasifree knockout, inelastic scattering, and nucleon transfer processes. It is shown that the inelastic scattering and nucleon transfer, usually neglected at such energy regime, contribute about 50\% and 30\% to the loosely bound proton and deeply bound neutron removal, respectively.

We propose new diagrammatic rules for this theory, involving both Fronsdal fields and Didenko-Vasiliev particles—linearized versions of HS gravity’s “BPS black hole.” The vertices include a standard minimal coupling between particle and gauge field, the Sleight-Taronna cubic vertex for HS fields, and a recently introduced vertex coupling two HS fields to a Didenko-Vasiliev particle. We show how these ingredients can be combined to reproduce all n -point functions of the theory’s holographic dual—the free O ( N ) vector model. Our diagrammatic rules interpolate between the usual diagrammatic rules of field theory and those of string theory. Our construction can be viewed as a bulk realization of HS algebra.},

This provides (1) a corrected posterior free from network inaccuracies, (2) a performance diagnostic (the sample efficiency) for assessing the proposal and identifying failure cases, and (3) an unbiased estimate of the Bayesian evidence. By establishing this independent verification and correction mechanism we address some of the most frequent criticisms against deep learning for scientific inference. We carry out a large study analyzing 42 binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO and Virgo with the SEOBNRv4PHM and IMRPhenomXPHM waveform models. This shows a median sample efficiency of ≈ 10\% (2 orders of magnitude better than standard samplers) as well as a tenfold reduction in the statistical uncertainty in the log evidence. Given these advantages, we expect a significant impact on gravitational-wave inference, and for this approach to serve as a paradigm for harnessing deep learning methods in scientific applications.},

The observation period covered by this analysis spans from October 13, 2015, to April 30, 2022 (2392 days). The very wide dynamic range of CALET allowed for the collection of helium data over a large energy interval, from ∼ 40 GeV to ∼ 250 TeV , for the first time with a single instrument in low Earth orbit. The measured spectrum shows evidence of a deviation of the flux from a single power law by more than 8 σ with a progressive spectral hardening from a few hundred GeV to a few tens of TeV. This result is consistent with the data reported by space instruments including PAMELA, AMS-02, and DAMPE and balloon instruments including CREAM. At higher energy we report the onset of a softening of the helium spectrum around 30 TeV (total kinetic energy). Though affected by large uncertainties in the highest energy bins, the observation of a flux reduction turns out to be consistent with the most recent results of DAMPE. A double broken power law is found to fit simultaneously both spectral features: the hardening (at lower energy) and the softening (at higher energy). A measurement of the proton to helium flux ratio in the energy range from 60 GeV / n to about 60 TeV / n is also presented, using the CALET proton flux recently updated with higher statistics.},

This is used to generalize the relationship between the dark matter mass and coupling that matches the observed abundance. The result encompasses well-studied particular examples, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), strongly interacting massive particles, coannihilation, coscattering, inverse decays, and forbidden channels, and generalizes beyond them. In turn, this gives an approximate perturbative unitarity bound on the dark matter mass for an arbitrary thermal freeze-out process. We show that going beyond the maximal masses allowed for freeze-out via dark matter self-annihilations [WIMP-like, m DM ≫ O ( 100 TeV ) ] predicts that there are nearly degenerate states with the dark matter and that the dark matter is generically metastable.},

However, quantum entanglement is a valuable resource that does not come without a price. The exceptional time overhead for the preparation of large-scale entangled states raises disconcerting concerns about whether the Heisenberg limit is fundamentally achievable. Here, we find a universal speed limit set by the Lieb-Robinson light cone for the quantum Fisher information growth to characterize the metrological potential of quantum resource states during their preparation. Our main result establishes a strong precision limit of quantum metrology accounting for the complexity of many-body quantum resource state preparation and reveals a fundamental constraint for reaching the Heisenberg limit in a generic many-body lattice system with bounded one-site energy. It enables us to identify the essential features of quantum many-body systems that are crucial for achieving the quantum advantage of quantum metrology, and brings an interesting connection between many-body quantum dynamics and quantum metrology.},

Here we introduce a measure of incompatibility, called the mutual eigenspace disturbance (MED), which quantifies the amount of disturbance induced by the measurement of a sharp observable on the eigenspaces of another. The MED provides a metric on the space of von Neumann measurements, and can be efficiently estimated by letting the measurement processes act in an indefinite order, using a setup known as the quantum switch, which also allows one to quantify the noncommutativity of arbitrary quantum processes. Thanks to these features, the MED can be used in quantum machine learning tasks. We demonstrate this application by providing an unsupervised algorithm that clusters unknown von Neumann measurements. Our algorithm is robust to noise and can be used to identify groups of observers that share approximately the same measurement context.},

The transition to the nonlinear behavior is marked by a drastic slowing down of thermophoretic motion and is characterized by a Péclet number of order unity as corroborated for different particle sizes and salt concentrations. The data follow a single master curve covering the entire nonlinear regime for all system parameters upon proper rescaling of the temperature gradients with the Péclet number. For low thermal gradients, the thermal drift velocity follows a theoretical linear model relying on the local-equilibrium assumption, while linear theoretical approaches based on hydrodynamic stresses, ignoring fluctuations, predict significantly slower thermophoretic motion for steeper thermal gradients. Our findings suggest that thermophoresis is fluctuation dominated for small gradients and crosses over to a drift-dominated regime for larger Péclet numbers in striking contrast to electrophoresis.},

We discuss several simple examples that illustrate the potential functionality of this coupling. Furthermore, using our phenomenological framework, we propose a practical means to extract the coupling strength through impedance measurements on a nematic cell.

  abstract     = {Anomalous high-harmonic generation (HHG) arises in certain solids when irradiated by an intense laser field, originating from a Berry-curvature-induced perpendicular anomalous current. The observation of pure anomalous harmonics is, however, often prohibited by contamination from harmonics stemming from interband coherences. Here, we fully characterize the anomalous HHG mechanism, via development of an ab initio methodology for strong-field laser-solid interaction that allows a rigorous decomposition of the total current. We identify two unique properties of the anomalous harmonic yields: an overall yield increase with laser wavelength; and pronounced minima at certain laser wavelengths and laser intensities around which the spectral phases drastically change. Such signatures can be exploited to disentangle the anomalous harmonics from competing HHG mechanisms, and thus pave the way for the experimental identification and time-domain control of pure anomalous harmonics, as well as reconstruction of Berry curvatures.},

We use low-damage chemical processing and annealing in a hydrogen environment to realize reversible and highly stable charge state tuning in undoped diamond. The resulting SiV 0 centers display optically detected magnetic resonance and bulklike optical properties. Controlling the charge state tuning via surface termination offers a route for scalable technologies based on SiV 0 centers, as well as charge state engineering of other defects.},

  abstract     = {Spiral spin liquids are an exotic class of correlated paramagnets with an enigmatic magnetic ground state composed of a degenerate manifold of fluctuating spin spirals. Experimental realizations of the spiral spin liquid are scarce, mainly due to the prominence of structural distortions in candidate materials that can trigger order-by-disorder transitions to more conventionally ordered magnetic ground states. Expanding the pool of candidate materials that may host a spiral spin liquid is therefore crucial to realizing this novel magnetic ground state and understanding its robustness against perturbations that arise in real materials. Here, we show that the material LiYbO 2 is the first experimental realization of a spiral spin liquid predicted to emerge from the J 1 − J 2 Heisenberg model on an elongated diamond lattice. Through a complementary combination of high-resolution and diffuse neutron magnetic scattering studies on a polycrystalline sample, we demonstrate that LiYbO 2 fulfills the requirements for the experimental realization of the spiral spin liquid and reconstruct single-crystal diffuse neutron magnetic scattering maps that reveal continuous spiral spin contours—a characteristic experimental hallmark of this exotic magnetic phase.},

Here, based on the symmetry analysis, we find an unconventional AHE induced by the in-plane magnetic field (IPAHE) via the spin-canting effect in PT -symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems, featuring a linear dependence of magnetic field and 2 π angle periodicity with a comparable magnitude to conventional AHE.

In this Letter, we use large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to study these phenomena in a class of frustrated Ising spin models in two spatial dimensions. We find that the melting of the magnetic long-range order into an isotropic gaslike paramagnet proceeds via an intermediate stage where the classical spins remain anisotropically correlated. This correlated paramagnet exists in a temperature range T N &lt; T &lt; T * , whose width increases as magnetic frustrations grow. This intermediate phase is typically characterized by short-range correlations; however, the two-dimensional nature of the model allows for an additional exotic feature—formation of an incommensurate liquidlike phase with algebraically decaying spin correlations. The two-stage melting of magnetic order is generic and pertinent to many frustrated quasi-2D magnets with large (essentially classical) spins.},

Built upon the isomorphic ring polymer Hamiltonian, time-dependent multistate electronic Schrödinger equations are solved self-consistently with approximate equation of motions for nuclei. Each bead bears a distinct electronic configuration and thus moves on a specific effective potential. This independent-bead approach provides an accurate description of the real-time electronic population and quantum nuclear trajectory, maintaining a good agreement with the exact quantum solution. Implementation of first-principles calculations enables us to simulate photoinduced proton transfer in H 2 O − H 2 O + where we find a good agreement with experiment.},

We show that the nonanalytic behavior of the electron-phonon matrix elements depends on the Wannier gauge, but that a missing Berry connection restores invariance to quadrupolar order. We showcase these contributions in a MoS 2 monolayer, calculating intrinsic drift and Hall mobilities with precise Wannier interpolations. We also find that the contributions of dynamical quadrupoles to the scattering potential are essential, and that their neglect leads to errors of 23\% and 76\% in the room-temperature electron and hole Hall mobilities, respectively.},

It has been theoretically noted that the existence of two Ce sites in the unit cell, the so-called sublattice degrees of freedom owing to the local inversion symmetry breaking at the Ce sites, can lead to the appearance of multiple SC phases even under an interaction inducing spin-singlet superconductivity. CeRh 2 As 2 is considered as the first example of multiple SC phases owing to this sublattice degree of freedom. However, microscopic information about the SC states has not yet been reported. In this study, we measured the SC spin susceptibility at two crystallographically inequivalent As sites using nuclear magnetic resonance for various magnetic fields. Our experimental results strongly indicate a spin-singlet state in both SC phases. In addition, the antiferromagnetic phase, which appears within the SC phase, only coexists with the LF SC phase; there is no sign of magnetic ordering in the HF SC phase. The present Letter reveals unique SC properties originating from the locally noncentrosymmetric characteristics.},

This is a general property of collisionless plasmas when the radiation reaction force is taken into account. We study the case of a plasma in a strong magnetic field and demonstrate the development of ring momentum distributions. The timescales for ring formation are derived for this configuration. The analytical results for the ring properties and the timescales for ring formation are confirmed with particle-in-cell simulations. The resulting momentum distributions are kinetically unstable and are known to lead to coherent radiation emission in astrophysical plasmas and laboratory setups.},

The system consists of an ultracold quantum gas in a high-finesse cavity, which is pumped transversely by a phase-modulated laser. This phase-modulated pumping couples the atomic ground state to a superposition of excited momentum states, which decouples from the cavity field. We demonstrate how to achieve condensation in this state, supported by time-of-flight and photon emission measurements.

  abstract     = {The collective absorption and emission of light by an ensemble of atoms is at the heart of many fundamental quantum optical effects and the basis for numerous applications. However, beyond weak excitation, both experiment and theory become increasingly challenging. Here, we explore the regimes from weak excitation to inversion with ensembles of up to 1000 atoms that are trapped and optically interfaced using the evanescent field surrounding an optical nanofiber. We realize full inversion, with about 80\% of the atoms being excited, and study their subsequent radiative decay into the guided modes. The data are very well-described by a simple model that assumes a cascaded interaction of the guided light with the atoms. Our results contribute to the fundamental understanding of the collective interaction of light and matter and are relevant for applications ranging from quantum memories to sources of nonclassical light to optical frequency standards.},

We theoretically analyze the steady state of a van der Waals interacting Rydberg gas in an optical lattice based on a variational treatment that also includes long-range correlations necessary to describe the physics of the Rydberg blockade, i.e., the inhibition of neighboring Rydberg excitations by strong interactions. In contrast to the ground state phase diagram, we find that the steady state undergoes a single first order phase transition from a blockaded Rydberg gas to a facilitation phase where the blockade is lifted. The first order line terminates in a critical point when including sufficiently strong dephasing, enabling a highly promising route to study dissipative criticality in these systems. In some regimes, we also find good quantitative agreement of the phase boundaries with previously employed short-range models, however, with the actual steady states exhibiting strikingly different behavior.},

This phenomenon, called dynamical fermionization, has been experimentally confirmed in the case of the Lieb-Liniger model and theoretically predicted in the case of multicomponent systems at zero temperature. We prove analytically that for all spinor gases with strong repulsive contact interactions at finite temperature the momentum distribution after release from the trap asymptotically approaches that of a system of spinless fermions at the same temperature but with a renormalized chemical potential which depends on the number of components of the spinor system.

While there has been great progress in experimentally engineering non-Hermitian models in quantum simulators, it remains a significant challenge to experimentally probe complex energies in these systems, thereby making it difficult to directly diagnose complex-energy topology. Here, we experimentally realize a two-band non-Hermitian model with a single trapped ion whose complex eigenenergies exhibit the unlink, unknot, or Hopf link topological structures. Based on non-Hermitian absorption spectroscopy, we couple one system level to an auxiliary level through a laser beam and then experimentally measure the population of the ion on the auxiliary level after a long period of time. Complex eigenenergies are then extracted, illustrating the unlink, unknot, or Hopf link topological structure. Our work demonstrates that complex energies can be experimentally measured in quantum simulators via non-Hermitian absorption spectroscopy, thereby opening the door for exploring various complex-energy properties in non-Hermitian quantum systems, such as trapped ions, cold atoms, superconducting circuits, or solid-state spin systems.},

The ratio is constant versus longitudinal momentum within uncertainties above a longitudinal momentum of 4.5 GeV / c . The cross section ratios to CH for C, water, and Fe remain roughly constant with increasing longitudinal momentum, and the ratios between water or C to CH do not have any significant deviation from unity. Both the overall cross section level and the shape for Pb and Fe as a function of transverse muon momentum are not reproduced by current neutrino event generators.

Turbulence is now understood to also play a key role in these astrophysical transients. Here, we demonstrate that turbulent nuclear burning may lead to large enhancements above the uniform background burning rate, since turbulent dissipation gives rise to temperature fluctuations, and in general the nuclear burning rates are highly sensitive to temperature. We derive results for the turbulent enhancement of the nuclear burning rate under the influence of strong turbulence in the distributed burning regime in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, using probability distribution function methods. We demonstrate that the turbulent enhancement obeys a universal scaling law in the limit of weak turbulence. We further demonstrate that, for a wide range of key nuclear reactions, such as C 12 ( O 16 , α ) Mg 24 and 3 − α , even relatively modest temperature fluctuations, of the order of 10\%, can lead to enhancements of 1–3 orders of magnitude in the turbulent nuclear burning rate. We verify the predicted turbulent enhancement directly against numerical simulations, and find very good agreement. We also present an estimation for the onset of turbulent detonation initiation, and discuss implications of our results for stellar transients.},

  abstract     = {Cold gas forms a significant mass fraction of the Milky Way disk, but is its most uncertain baryonic component. The density and distribution of cold gas is of critical importance for Milky Way dynamics, as well as models of stellar and galactic evolution. Previous studies have used correlations between gas and dust to obtain high-resolution measurements of cold gas, but with large normalization uncertainties. We present a novel approach that uses Fermi-LAT γ -ray data to measure the total gas density, achieving a similar precision as previous works, but with independent systematic uncertainties. Notably, our results have sufficient precision to probe the range of results obtained by current world-leading experiments.},

The electron fluxes exhibit variations on multiple timescales. Recurrent electron flux variations with periods of 27 days, 13.5 days, and 9 days are observed. We find that the electron fluxes show distinctly different time variations from the proton fluxes. Remarkably, a hysteresis between the electron flux and the proton flux is observed with a significance of greater than 6 σ at rigidities below 8.5 GV. Furthermore, significant structures in the electron-proton hysteresis are observed corresponding to sharp structures in both fluxes. This continuous daily electron data provide unique input to the understanding of the charge sign dependence of cosmic rays over an 11-year solar cycle.},

The quantum interferometer is based on single-photon sources, linear optical circuits, and efficient photon number counters. Surprisingly, with thermal (stellar) sources of low photon number per mode and high transmission losses across the baseline, the detected photon probability distribution still retains a large amount of Fisher information about the source position, allowing for a significant improvement in the resolution of positioning point sources, on the order of 10 μ as .

  abstract     = {From an open system perspective non-Markovian effects due to a nearby bath or neighboring qubits are dynamically equivalent. However, there is a conceptual distinction to account for: neighboring qubits may be controlled. We combine recent advances in non-Markovian quantum process tomography with the framework of classical shadows to characterize spatiotemporal quantum correlations. Observables here constitute operations applied to the system, where the free operation is the maximally depolarizing channel. Using this as a causal break, we systematically erase causal pathways to narrow down the progenitors of temporal correlations. We show that one application of this is to filter out the effects of crosstalk and probe only non-Markovianity from an inaccessible bath. It also provides a lens on spatiotemporally spreading correlated noise throughout a lattice from common environments. We demonstrate both examples on synthetic data. Owing to the scaling of classical shadows, we can erase arbitrarily many neighboring qubits at no extra cost. Our procedure is thus efficient and amenable to systems even with all-to-all interactions.},

Here, we develop a molecular theory by systematically incorporating the self-consistent field theory for charged macromolecules into the dilute solution thermodynamics. The kinetic pathway is tracked without any restriction on the morphology of the aggregates. We find that protein aggregation at low salt concentrations is via a two-step nucleated process involving a conformational transition from metastable spherical oligomer to elongated fibril. The scaling analysis elucidates the electrostatic origin of the conformational transition: the fibril enters the screening region much earlier than the spherical aggregate. As salt concentration increases, the classical mode of one-step nucleation corresponding to macroscopic liquid-liquid phase separation is recovered. Our results reveal that the screened electrostatic interaction is essential for the existence of the metastable oligomer and its subsequent conformational transition to fibril. The theoretical predictions of the kinetic pathway and the morphology of the aggregates are in good agreement with the experimental observations of real proteins.},

The classical Husimi evolution is composed of two factors: (i) the initial Husimi distribution evaluated along phase-space trajectories and (ii) the final value of the norm corresponding to each phase-space point. Both factors conspire to lead to intriguing dynamical behaviors. We demonstrate how the full quantum dynamics unfolds on top of the classical Husimi dynamics for two instructive examples.},

Here we put forward a universal non-Abelian conservation rule governing these collective behaviors in generic multiband non-Hermitian systems and uncover several counterintuitive phenomena. We demonstrate that two EPs with opposite charges (even the pairwise created) do not necessarily annihilate, depending on how they approach each other. Furthermore, we unveil that the conservation rule imposes strict constraints on the permissible exceptional-line configurations. It excludes structures like Hopf link yet permits novel staggered rings composed of noncommutative exceptional lines. These intriguing phenomena are illustrated by concrete models which could be readily implemented in platforms like coupled acoustic cavities, optical waveguides, and ring resonators. Our findings lay the cornerstone for a comprehensive understanding of the exceptional non-Abelian topology and shed light on the versatile manipulations and applications based on exceptional degeneracies in nonconservative systems.},

After benchmarking the framework for classical random walks on the 1D lattice, we derive a universal criterion underpinning the impact of restart on the age of the n th record for generic time series with nearest-neighbor transitions. Crucially, the criterion contains a penalty of order n that puts strong constraints on restart expediting the creation of records, as compared to the simple first-passage completion. The applicability of our approach is further demonstrated on an aggregation-shattering process where we compute the typical growth rates of aggregate sizes.

  abstract     = {The determination of depth profiles across interfaces is of primary importance in many scientific and technological areas. Photoemission spectroscopy is in principle well suited for this purpose, yet a quantitative implementation for investigations of liquid-vapor interfaces is hindered by the lack of understanding of electron-scattering processes in liquids. Previous studies have shown, however, that core-level photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) are altered by depth-dependent elastic electron scattering and can, thus, reveal information on the depth distribution of species across the interface. Here, we explore this concept further and show that the experimental anisotropy parameter characterizing the PAD scales linearly with the average distance of atoms along the surface normal obtained by molecular dynamics simulations. This behavior can be accounted for in the low-collision-number regime. We also show that results for different atomic species can be compared on the same length scale. We demonstrate that atoms separated by about 1 Å along the surface normal can be clearly distinguished with this method, achieving excellent depth resolution.},

It remains an open question regarding the physical meaning of these conserved quantities in the higher spin model. In this Letter, by introducing a Majorana parton construction for a general spin- S we uncover that these conserved quantities are exactly the Z 2 gauge fluxes in the general spin- S model, including the case of spin- 1 / 2 . Particularly, we find an even-odd effect that the Z 2 gauge charges are fermions in the half integer spin model, but are bosons in the integer spin model. We further prove that the fermionic Z 2 gauge charges are always deconfined; hence, the half integer spin Kitaev model would have nontrivial spin liquid ground states regardless of interaction strengths in the Hamiltonian. The bosonic Z 2 gauge charges of the integer spin model, on the other hand, could condense, leading to a trivial product state, and this is indeed the case at the anisotropic limit of the model.},

Previous investigations inferred that the occurrence of the Mott phase is limited to the surface only of bulk specimens, but recent analysis on thin samples revealed that the Mott-like behavior, observed in the monolayer, is rapidly suppressed with increasing thickness. Here, we report combined time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of 1 T − TaSe 2 . Our experimental results confirm the existence of a state above E F , previously ascribed to the upper Hubbard band, and an overall band gap of ∼ 0.7 eV at Γ ¯ . However, supported by density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the origin of this state and the gap rests on band structure modifications induced by the CDW phase alone, without the need for Mott correlation effects.},

However, in most instances, these resonances are driven by a single scattering mechanism. Here, we show the appearance of resonances due to the combination of two simultaneous scattering mechanisms, one from superconductivity and the other from graphene p − n junctions. These resonances stem from Andreev reflection and Klein tunneling that occur at two different interfaces of a hole-doped region of graphene formed at the boundary with superconducting graphene due to proximity effects from Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 1 Cu 2 O 8 + δ . The resonances persist with gating from p + − p and p − n configurations. The suppression of the oscillation amplitude above the bias energy which is comparable to the induced superconducting gap indicates the contribution from Andreev reflection. Our experimental measurements are supported by quantum transport calculations in such interfaces, leading to analogous resonances. Our results put forward a hybrid scattering mechanism in graphene–high-temperature superconductor heterojunctions of potential impact for graphene-based Josephson junctions.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen the discovery of systems featuring fragile topological states. These states of matter lack certain protection attributes typically associated with topology and are therefore characterized by weaker signatures that make them elusive to observe. Moreover, they are typically confined to special symmetry classes and, in general, rarely studied in the context of phononic media. In this Letter, we theoretically predict the emergence of fragile topological bands in the spectrum of a twisted kagome elastic lattice with threefold rotational symmetry, in the so-called self-dual configuration. A necessary requirement is that the lattice is a structural metamaterial, in which the role of the hinges is played by elastic finite-thickness ligaments. The interplay between the edge modes appearing in the band gaps bounding the fragile topological states is also responsible for the emergence of corner modes at selected corners of a finite hexagonal domain, which qualifies the lattice as a second-order topological insulator. We demonstrate our findings through a series of experiments via 3D scanning laser doppler vibrometry conducted on a physical prototype. The selected configuration stands out for its remarkable geometric simplicity and ease of physical implementation in the panorama of dynamical systems exhibiting fragile topology.},

We show both analytically in infinite systems and numerically in the presence of a harmonic trap how spin waves affect the supersolid’s density profile in the form of crystal waves, inducing oscillations of the periodicity as well as the orientation of the fringes. Both these features are well within reach of present-day experiments.

  abstract     = {Strong laser-driven magnetic fields are crucial for high-energy-density physics and laboratory astrophysics research, but generation of axial multikilotesla fields remains a challenge. The difficulty comes from the inability of a conventional linearly polarized laser beam to induce the required azimuthal current or, equivalently, angular momentum (AM). We show that several laser beams can overcome this difficulty. Our three-dimensional kinetic simulations demonstrate that a twist in their pointing directions enables them to carry orbital AM and transfer it to the plasma, thus generating a hot electron population carrying AM needed to sustain the magnetic field. The resulting multikilotesla field occupies a volume that is tens of thousands of cubic microns and it persists on a picosecond timescale. The mechanism can be realized for a wide range of laser intensities and pulse durations. Our scheme is well suited for implementation using multikilojoule petawatt-class lasers, because, by design, they have multiple beamlets and because the scheme requires only linear polarization.},

Results from direct numerical simulation (DNS) show that the curvature growth exhibits two regimes: first, a linear stage dominated by folding fluid elements through a persistent velocity Hessian that then transition to an exponential-growth stage driven by the stretching of already strongly bent fluid elements. This transition leads to strong curvature intermittency at later stages, which can be explained by a proposed curvature-evolution model. The link between velocity Hessian to folding provides a new way to understand the crucial steps in energy cascade and mixing in turbulence beyond the classical linear description of stretching dynamics.},

Here, we report anomalous OAM transfer in parametric upconversion, in which a Hermite-Gauss mode signal interacts with a specially engineered pump capable of astigmatic transformation, resulting in Laguerre-Gaussian mode sum-frequency generation (SFG). The anomaly here refers to the fact that the pump and signal both carry no net OAM, while their SFG does. We reveal experimentally that there is also an OAM inflow to the residual pump, having the same amount of that to the SFG but with the opposite sign, and thus holds system OAM conservation. This unexpected OAM selection rule improves our understanding of OAM transfer among interacting waves and may inspire new ideas for controlling OAM states via nonlinear optics.},

Soliton interactions are generally related to breathing dynamics in nonlinear dissipative systems, and maintain potential applications in spectroscopy. In the present work, dichromatic breather molecules (DBMs) are created in a synchronized mode-locked fiber laser. Real-time delay-shifting interference spectra are measured to display the temporal evolution of the DBMs, that cannot be observed by means of the usual real-time spectroscopy. As a result, robust out-of-phase vibrations are found as a typical intrinsic mode of DBMs. The same bound states are produced numerically in the framework of a model combining equations for the population inversion in the mode-locked laser and cross-phase-modulation–coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau equations for amplitudes of the optical fields in the fiber segments of the laser cavity. The results demonstrate that the Q -switching instability induces the onset of breathing oscillations.

  abstract     = {Recent experimental advances in creating dissipative couplings provide a new route for engineering exotic lattice systems and exploring topological dissipation. Using the spatial lattice of atomic spin waves in a vacuum vapor cell, where purely dissipative couplings arise from diffusion of atoms, we experimentally realize a dissipative version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We construct the dissipation spectrum of the topological or trivial lattices via electromagnetically induced-transparency spectroscopy. The topological dissipation spectrum is found to exhibit edge modes within a dissipative gap. We validate chiral symmetry of the dissipative SSH couplings and also probe topological features of the generalized dissipative SSH model. This work paves the way for realizing non-Hermitian topological quantum optics via dissipative couplings.},

These algebraic tails originate from the impurity-BEC interaction, but their amplitudes greatly exceed those expected from two-body contact interactions at equilibrium in the trap. Furthermore, in the absence of impurities, such algebraic tails are not found in the BEC density measured after the interaction-driven expansion. These results highlight the key role played by impurities when present, a possibility that had not been considered in our previous work [Chang et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 117 , 235303 (2016) ].

  abstract     = {We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the effect of autoionizing resonances in time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The coherent excitation of N 2 by ∼ 14.15 eV extreme-ultraviolet photons prepares a superposition of three dominant adjacent vibrational levels ( v ′ = 14 – 16 ) in the valence b ′ Σ u + 1 state, which are probed by the absorption of two or three near-infrared photons (800 nm). The superposition manifests itself as coherent oscillations in the measured photoelectron spectra. A quantum-mechanical simulation confirms that two autoionizing Rydberg states converging to the excited A Π 2 u and B Σ u + 2 N 2 + cores are accessed by the resonant absorption of near-infrared photons. We show that these resonances apply different filters to the observation of the vibrational wave packet, which results in different phases and amplitudes of the oscillating photoelectron signal depending on the nature of the autoionizing resonance. This work clarifies the importance of resonances in time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and particularly reveals the phase of vibrational quantum beats as a powerful observable for characterizing the properties of such resonances.},

We derive an equation that re-expresses physical constraints on higher-order RDMs to generate direct constraints on the 2-RDM, which are required for its derivation from an N -particle density matrix, known as N -representability conditions. The approach produces a complete hierarchy of 2-RDM constraints that do not depend explicitly upon the higher RDMs or the wave function. By using the two-particle part of a unitary decomposition of higher-order constraint matrices, we can solve the energy minimization by semidefinite programming in a form where the low-rank structure of these matrices can be potentially exploited. We illustrate by computing the ground-state electronic energy and properties of the H 8 ring.},

The precision of the new data dramatically supersedes that of older sets of data, each covering only a portion of the Q 2 range. The new data allow the determination of two coefficients in a low-momentum expansion, leading to a new puzzle. By confronting experiment to state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, we observe that modern nuclear forces, including those derived within chiral effective field theory that are well tested on a variety of observables, fail to reproduce the excitation of the α particle.},

The lepton-jet correlation in deep inelastic scattering provides us with a new gateway to the parton saturation at the EIC. In particular, we demonstrate that azimuthal angle anisotropies of the lepton-jet correlation are sensitive to the strength of the saturation momentum in the EIC kinematic region. In contrast to the predictions based on the collinear framework calculation, significant nuclear modification of the anisotropies is observed when we compare the saturation physics results in e + p and e + Au scatterings.

In this Letter, we propose an approach to understanding the jet charge by establishing simple, robust assumptions that hold to good approximation nonperturbatively, such as isospin conservation and large particle multiplicity in the jets, forgoing any attempt at a perturbative analysis. From these assumptions, the jet charge distribution with fixed particle multiplicity takes the form of a Gaussian by the central limit theorem and whose mean and variance are related to fractional-power moments of single particle energy distributions. These results make several concrete predictions for the scaling of the jet charge with the multiplicity, explaining many of the results already in the literature, and new results we validate in Monte Carlo simulation.},

  abstract     = {We study the low-energy limit of Wilson lines (charged impurities) in conformal gauge theories in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions. As a function of the representation of the Wilson line, certain defect operators can become marginal, leading to interesting renormalization group flows and for sufficiently large representations to complete or partial screening by charged fields. This result is universal: in large enough representations, Wilson lines are screened by the charged matter fields. We observe that the onset of the screening instability is associated with fixed-point mergers. We study this phenomenon in a variety of applications. In some cases, the screening of the Wilson lines takes place by dimensional transmutation and the generation of an exponentially large scale. We identify the space of infrared conformal Wilson lines in weakly coupled gauge theories in 3 + 1 dimensions and determine the screening cloud due to bosons or fermions. We also study QED in 2 + 1 dimensions in the large N f limit and identify the nontrivial conformal Wilson lines. We briefly discuss ‘t Hooft lines in 3 + 1 -dimensional gauge theories and find that they are screened in weakly coupled gauge theories with simply connected gauge groups. In non-Abelian gauge theories with S duality, this together with our analysis of the Wilson lines gives a compelling picture for the screening of the line operators as a function of the coupling.},

So far, it requires not only a full tomography in experiments, but also huge calculational labor. A leading proposal was made by Gühne, Reimpell, and Werner [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 , 110502 (2007) ], who used expectation values of entanglement witnesses to describe a lower bound estimation of entanglement. We provide here an extension that also gives genuine upper bounds of entanglement. This advance requires only the expectation value of any Hermitian operator. Moreover, we identify a class of operators A 1 that not only give good estimates, but also require a remarkably small number of experimental measurements. In this Letter, we define our approach and illustrate it by estimating entanglement measures for a number of pure and mixed states prepared in our recent experiments.},

Our quantum algorithm finds the model parameters with a communication complexity of O ( log 2 ( N ) / ε ) , where N is the number of data points and ε is the bound on parameter errors. Compared to classical and other quantum methods that achieve the same goal, our methods provide a communication advantage in the scaling with data volume.

In particular, the convergence rate for the training of quantum neural networks is not fully understood. Here, we analyze the dynamics of gradient descent for the training error of a class of variational quantum machine learning models. We define wide quantum neural networks as parametrized quantum circuits in the limit of a large number of qubits and variational parameters. Then, we find a simple analytic formula that captures the average behavior of their loss function and discuss the consequences of our findings. For example, for random quantum circuits, we predict and characterize an exponential decay of the residual training error as a function of the parameters of the system. Finally, we validate our analytic results with numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {We perform quantum process tomography (QPT) for both discrete- and continuous-variable quantum systems by learning a process representation using Kraus operators. The Kraus form ensures that the reconstructed process is completely positive. To make the process trace preserving, we use a constrained gradient-descent (GD) approach on the so-called Stiefel manifold during optimization to obtain the Kraus operators. Our ansatz uses a few Kraus operators to avoid direct estimation of large process matrices, e.g., the Choi matrix, for low-rank quantum processes. The GD-QPT matches the performance of both compressed-sensing (CS) and projected least-squares (PLS) QPT in benchmarks with two-qubit random processes, but shines by combining the best features of these two methods. Similar to CS (but unlike PLS), GD-QPT can reconstruct a process from just a small number of random measurements, and similar to PLS (but unlike CS) it also works for larger system sizes, up to at least five qubits. We envisage that the data-driven approach of GD-QPT can become a practical tool that greatly reduces the cost and computational effort for QPT in intermediate-scale quantum systems.},

This has been questioned on the basis that such an entanglement cannot be accessed by local operations on individual modes due to the parity superselection rule which constrains the set of physical observables. In other words, one cannot observe violations of Bell’s inequality. Here, we show, however, that entanglement of a two-mode fermionic state can be used as a genuine quantum resource in open-system thermodynamic processes, enabling one to perform tasks forbidden for separable states. We thus demonstrate that quantum thermodynamics can shed light on the nature of fermionic entanglement and the operational meaning of the different notions used to define it.},

We find that triple (Y) junctions can be created and stabilized by applying mechanical forces, if the angle between branches is 120°. The same holds for tetrahedral junctions with tetraeder angles. If the wrong angles are enforced, the branches coalesce to a linear structure, a pure tube. After releasing the mechanical force, Y-branched structures remain metastable if one constrains the enclosed volume and the average curvature (the area difference) to a fixed value; tetrahedral junctions however split up into two Y junctions. Somewhat counterintuitively, the energy cost of adding a Y branch is negative in structures with fixed surface area and tube diameter, even if one accounts for the positive contribution of the additional branch end. For fixed average curvature, however, adding a branch also enforces a thinning of tubes, therefore the overall curvature energy cost is positive. Possible implications for the stability of branched networks structures in cells are discussed.},

Monitoring the velocity polarization as the order parameter, we reveal the onset of a first-order transition from a disordered phase, characterized by several small clusters, to a flocking phase, where a single flocking cluster is emerging. The scenario is confirmed by studying the spatial connected correlation function of particle velocities, which reveals scale-free behavior in flocking states and exponential-like decay for nonflocking configurations. Our predictions can be tested in microscopic and macroscopic experiments showing flocking, such as animals, migrating cells, and active colloids.},

This pattern formation changes how densely the structures can pack, as well as the mechanical properties of the system. How and when these patterns form, as well as the force required to pack these structures is not currently understood. Here we study the emergence of order in a canonical example of packing in slender structures, i.e., a system of parallel confined elastic beams. Using tabletop experiments, simulations, and standard theory from statistical mechanics, we predict the amount of confinement (growth or compression) of the beams that will guarantee a global system order, which depends only on the initial geometry of the system. Furthermore, we find that the compressive stiffness and stored bending energy of this metamaterial are directly proportional to the number of beams that are geometrically frustrated at any given point. We expect these results to elucidate the mechanisms leading to pattern formation in these kinds of systems and to provide a new mechanical metamaterial, with a tunable resistance to compressive force.},

However, the microscopic origin of negative energetic elasticity has not yet been clarified. Here, we consider the n -step interacting self-avoiding walk on a cubic lattice as a model of a single polymer chain (a subchain of a network in a polymer gel) in a solvent. We theoretically demonstrate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity based on an exact enumeration up to n = 20 and analytic expressions for arbitrary n in special cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the negative energetic elasticity of this model originates from the attractive polymer–solvent interaction, which locally stiffens the chain and conversely softens the stiffness of the entire chain. This model qualitatively reproduces the temperature dependence of negative energetic elasticity observed in the polymer-gel experiments, indicating that the analysis of a single chain can explain the properties of negative energetic elasticity in polymer gels.},

A solid capable of simultaneously controlling both rigid-body displacement and deformation remains unknown. Here, we exploit gauge transformations to show how the total displacement field in elastostatic polar Willis solids can be harnessed at will and how those solids can be realized in the form of lattice metamaterials. The transformation method we develop leverages a displacement gauge in linear transformation elasticity, giving rise to polarity and Willis coupling such that the resulting solids not only break minor symmetries of the stiffness tensor, but display cross coupling between stress and displacement. We realize those solids using a combination of tailored geometries, grounded springs, and a set of coupled gears and numerically demonstrate a range of satisfactory, and peculiar, displacement control functions. Our work provides an analytical framework for the inverse design of grounded polar Willis metamaterials to achieve arbitrary displacement control functions by design.},

  abstract     = {Explosive percolation in the Achlioptas process, which has attracted much research attention, is known to exhibit a rich variety of critical phenomena that are anomalous from the perspective of continuous phase transitions. Hereby, we show that, in an event-based ensemble, the critical behaviors in explosive percolation are rather clean and obey the standard finite-size scaling theory, except for the large fluctuation of pseudo-critical points. In the fluctuation window, multiple fractal structures emerge and the values can be derived from a crossover scaling theory. Further, their mixing effects account well for the previously observed anomalous phenomena. Making use of the clean scaling in the event-based ensemble, we determine with a high precision the critical points and exponents for a number of bond-insertion rules and clarify ambiguities about their universalities. Our findings hold true for any spatial dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits extremely low Fermi velocities for electrons, with the speed of sound surpassing the Fermi velocity. This regime enables the use of TBG for amplifying vibrational waves of the lattice through stimulated emission, following the same principles of operation of free-electron lasers. Our Letter proposes a lasing mechanism relying on the slow-electron bands to produce a coherent beam of acoustic phonons. We propose a device based on undulated electrons in TBG, which we dub the phaser. The device generates phonon beams in a terahertz (THz) frequency range, which can then be used to produce THz electromagnetic radiation. The ability to generate coherent phonons in solids breaks new ground in controlling quantum memories, probing quantum states, realizing nonequilibrium phases of matter, and designing new types of THz optical devices.},

  abstract     = {In stark contrast to the conventional charge density wave (CDW) materials, the one-dimensional CDW on the In / Si ( 111 ) surface exhibits immediate damping of the CDW oscillation during the photoinduced phase transition. Here, we successfully reproduce the experimental observation of the photoinduced CDW transition on the In / Si ( 111 ) surface by performing real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) simulations. We show that photoexcitation promotes valence electrons from the Si substrate to the empty surface bands composed primarily of the covalent p − p bonding states of the long In-In bonds. Such photoexcitation generates interatomic forces to shorten the long In-In bonds and thus drives the structural transition. After the structural transition, these surface bands undergo a switch among different In-In bonds, causing a rotation of the interatomic forces by about π / 6 and thus quickly damping the oscillations in feature CDW modes. These findings provide a deeper understanding of photoinduced phase transitions.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, which are rare in nature, enable high-density nonvolatile memory with low energy consumption. Here, we propose a theory of bilayer stacking ferroelectricity (BSF), in which two stacked layers of the same 2D material, with different rotation and translation, exhibit ferroelectricity. By performing systematic group theory analysis, we find all the possible BSF in all 80 layer groups (LGs) and discover the rules about the creation and annihilation of symmetries in the bilayer. Our general theory can not only explain all the previous findings (including sliding ferroelectricity), but also provide a new perspective. Interestingly, the direction of the electric polarization of the bilayer could be totally different from that of the single layer. In particular, the bilayer could become ferroelectric after properly stacking two centrosymmetric nonpolar monolayers. By means of first-principles simulations, we predict that the ferroelectricity and thus multiferroicity can be introduced to the prototypical 2D ferromagnetic centrosymmetric material CrI 3 by stacking. Furthermore, we find that the out-of-plane electric polarization in bilayer CrI 3 is interlocked with the in-plane electric polarization, suggesting that the out-of-plane polarization can be manipulated in a deterministic way through the application of an in-plane electric field. The present BSF theory lays a solid foundation for designing a large number of bilayer ferroelectrics and thus colorful platforms for fundamental studies and applications.},

Such antiferromagnets, lacking both inversion and time-reversal symmetries, are required by symmetry to possess an uncompensated magnetization density on particular surface terminations. Here, we first show that the uppermost layer of magnetic moments on the ideal (001) surface remains paramagnetic at the bulk Néel temperature, bringing the theoretical estimate of surface magnetization density in line with experiment. We demonstrate that the lower surface ordering temperature compared to bulk is a generic feature of surface magnetization when the termination reduces the effective Heisenberg coupling. We then propose two methods by which the surface magnetization in C r 2 O 3 could be stabilized at higher temperatures. Specifically, we show that the effective coupling of surface magnetic ions can be drastically increased either by a different choice of surface Miller plane, or by Fe doping. Our findings provide an improved understanding of surface magnetization properties in AFMs.},

Through the laser-driven spin-polarized angle-resolved photoemission Fermi surface mapping, we showcase highly asymmetric spin textures of electrons photoemitted from the surface states of WTe 2 . Such asymmetries are not present in the initial state spin textures, which are bound by the time-reversal and crystal lattice mirror plane symmetries. The findings are reproduced qualitatively by theoretical modeling within the one-step model photoemission formalism. The effect could be understood within the free-electron final state model as an interference due to emission from different atomic sites. The observed effect is a manifestation of time-reversal symmetry breaking of the initial state in the photoemission process, and as such it cannot be eliminated, but only its magnitude influenced, by special experimental geometries.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel concept to tackle the power exhaust challenge of a magnetically confined fusion plasma. It relies on the prior establishment of an X -point radiator that dissipates a large fraction of the exhaust power before it reaches the divertor targets. Despite the spatial proximity of the magnetic X point to the confinement region, this singularity is far away from the hot fusion plasma in magnetic coordinates and therefore allows the coexistence of a cold and dense plasma with a high potential to radiate. In the compact radiative divertor (CRD) the target plates are placed close to this magnetic X point. We here report on high performance experiments in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak that indicate the feasibility of this concept. Despite the shallow (projected) field line incidence angles of the order of θ ⊥ = 0.2 ° , no hot spots were observed on the target surface monitored by an IR camera, even at a maximum heating power of P heat = 15 MW . And even with the X point located exactly on the target surface and without density or impurity feedback control, the discharge remains stable, the confinement good ( H 98 , y 2 = 1 ), hot spots absent, and the divertor in a detached state. In addition to its technical simplicity, the CRD scales beneficially to reactor-scale plasmas that would benefit from an increased volume of the confined plasma, more space for breeding blankets, smaller poloidal field coil currents, and—potentially—an increased vertical stability.},

  abstract     = {Collisional plasma shocks generated from supersonic flows are an important feature in many astrophysical and laboratory high-energy-density plasmas. Compared to single-ion-species plasma shocks, plasma shock fronts with multiple ion species contain additional structure, including interspecies ion separation driven by gradients in species concentration, temperature, pressure, and electric potential. We present time-resolved density and temperature measurements of two ion species in collisional plasma shocks produced by head-on merging of supersonic plasma jets, allowing determination of the ion diffusion coefficients. Our results provide the first experimental validation of the fundamental inter-ion-species transport theory. The temperature separation, a higher-order effect reported here, is valuable for advancements in modeling HED and ICF experiments.},

  abstract     = {Characterizing the phase space distribution of particle beams in accelerators is a central part of understanding beam dynamics and improving accelerator performance. However, conventional analysis methods either use simplifying assumptions or require specialized diagnostics to infer high-dimensional ( &gt; 2 D ) beam properties. In this Letter, we introduce a general-purpose algorithm that combines neural networks with differentiable particle tracking to efficiently reconstruct high-dimensional phase space distributions without using specialized beam diagnostics or beam manipulations. We demonstrate that our algorithm accurately reconstructs detailed 4D phase space distributions with corresponding confidence intervals in both simulation and experiment using a limited number of measurements from a single focusing quadrupole and diagnostic screen. This technique allows for the measurement of multiple correlated phase spaces simultaneously, which will enable simplified 6D phase space distribution reconstructions in the future.},

In this work, we study the one-dimensional (1D) analogs of “moiré” lattices in a synthetic frequency dimension constructed by coupling two resonantly modulated ring resonators with different lengths. Unique features associated with the flatband manipulation as well as the flexible control of localization position inside each unit cell in the frequency dimension have been found, which can be controlled via the choice of flatband. Our work therefore provides insight into simulating moiré physics in 1D synthetic frequency space, which holds important promise for potential applications toward optical information processing.},

Here, we realize simultaneous and efficient sorting of nonorthogonal, overlapping states of light, encoded in the transverse spatial degree of freedom. We use a specifically designed multiplane light converter to sort states encoded in dimensions ranging from d = 3 to d = 7 . Through the use of an auxiliary output mode, the multiplane light converter simultaneously performs the unitary operation required for unambiguous discrimination and the basis change for the outcomes to be spatially separated. Our results lay the groundwork for optimal image identification and classification via optical networks, with potential applications ranging from self-driving cars to quantum communication systems.},

  abstract     = {The single-exciton strong coupling with the localized plasmon mode (LPM) at room temperature is highly desirable for exploiting quantum technology. However, its realization has been a very low probability event due to the harsh critical conditions, severely compromising its application. Here, we present a highly efficient approach for achieving such a strong coupling by reducing the critical interaction strength at the exceptional point based upon the damping inhibition and matching of the coupled system, instead of enhancing the coupling strength to overcome the system’s large damping. Experimentally, we compress the LPM’s damping linewidth from about 45 nm to about 14 nm using a leaky Fabry–Perot cavity, a good match to the excitonic linewidth of about 10 nm. This method dramatically relaxes the harsh requirement in mode volume by more than an order of magnitude and allows a maximum direction angle of the exciton dipole relative to the mode field of up to around 71.9°, significantly improving the success rate of achieving the single-exciton strong coupling with LPMs from about 1\% to about 80\%.},

Our method sets the most stringent laboratory experiment constraints on the coupling strength between electrons and nucleons for the force range λ &gt; 0.7 mm at 1 σ confidence.

The time-dependent potential of the Paul trap facilitates the formation of temporary complexes by reducing the energy of the atom, which gets temporarily stuck in the atom-ion potential. As a result, those complexes significantly impact termolecular reactions leading to molecular ion formation via three-body recombination. We find that complex formation is more pronounced in systems with heavy atoms, but the mass has no influence on the lifetime of the transient state. Instead, the complex formation rate strongly depends on the amplitude of the ion’s micromotion. We also show that complex formation persists even in the case of a time-independent harmonic trap. In this case, we find higher formation rates and longer lifetimes than in Paul traps, indicating that the atom-ion complex plays an essential role in atom-ion mixtures in optical traps.},

The multiplicity ratio exhibits a strong suppression at high z and an enhancement at low z . The measured transverse momentum broadening is an order of magnitude greater than that seen for light mesons. This indicates that the propagating entity interacts very strongly with the nuclear medium, which suggests that propagation of diquark configurations in the nuclear medium takes place at least part of the time, even at high z . The trends of these results are qualitatively described by the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, particularly for the multiplicity ratios.

  abstract     = {Controlling the continuum limit and extracting effective gravitational physics are shared challenges for quantum gravity approaches based on quantum discrete structures. The description of quantum gravity in terms of tensorial group field theory (TGFT) has recently led to much progress in its application to phenomenology, in particular, cosmology. This application relies on the assumption of a phase transition to a nontrivial vacuum (condensate) state describable by mean-field theory, an assumption that is difficult to corroborate by a full RG flow analysis due to the complexity of the relevant TGFT models. Here, we demonstrate that this assumption is justified due to the specific ingredients of realistic quantum geometric TGFT models: combinatorially nonlocal interactions, matter degrees of freedom, and Lorentz group data, together with the encoding of microcausality. This greatly strengthens the evidence for the existence of a meaningful continuum gravitational regime in group-field and spin-foam quantum gravity, the phenomenology of which is amenable to explicit computations in a mean-field approximation.},

  abstract     = {We formulate a Bayesian framework to analyze ringdown gravitational waves from colliding binary black holes and test the no-hair theorem. The idea hinges on mode cleaning—revealing subdominant oscillation modes by removing dominant ones using newly proposed “rational filters.” By incorporating the filter into Bayesian inference, we construct a likelihood function that depends only on the mass and spin of the remnant black hole (no dependence on mode amplitudes and phases) and implement an efficient pipeline to constrain the remnant mass and spin without Markov chain Monte Carlo. We test ringdown models by cleaning combinations of different modes and evaluating the consistency between the residual data and pure noise. The model evidence and Bayes factor are used to demonstrate the presence of a particular mode and to infer the mode starting time. In addition, we design a hybrid approach to estimate the remnant black hole properties exclusively from a single mode using Markov chain Monte Carlo after mode cleaning. We apply the framework to GW150914 and demonstrate more definitive evidence of the first overtone by cleaning the fundamental mode. This new framework provides a powerful tool for black hole spectroscopy in future gravitational-wave events.},

While it is possible to prepare a target state much faster with more general quantum annealing protocols, rigorous results beyond the adiabatic regime are rare. Here, we provide such a result, deriving lower bounds on the time needed to successfully perform quantum annealing. The bounds are asymptotically saturated by three toy models where fast annealing schedules are known: the Roland and Cerf unstructured search model, the Hamming spike problem, and the ferromagnetic p -spin model. Our bounds demonstrate that these schedules have optimal scaling. Our results also show that rapid annealing requires coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates, singling out quantum coherence as a computational resource.},

Starting with translational invariant models, which can be associated with dual transfer matrices with complex-valued spectra, we show that the linear ramp of the spectral form factor necessitates that the dual spectra have nontrivial correlations, which in fact fall under the universality class of the Ginibre ensemble, demonstrated by computing the level spacing distribution and the dissipative spectral form factor. As a result of this connection, the exact spectral form factor for the Ginibre ensemble can be used to universally describe the spectral form factor for translational invariant many-body quantum chaotic systems in the scaling limit where t and L are large, while the ratio between L and L Th , the many-body Thouless length is fixed. With appropriate variations of Ginibre models, we analytically demonstrate that our claim generalizes to models without translational invariance as well. The emergence of the Ginibre ensemble is a genuine consequence of the strongly interacting and spatially extended nature of the quantum chaotic systems we consider, unlike the traditional emergence of Hermitian random matrix ensembles.},

  abstract     = {The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) explains why nonintegrable quantum many-body systems thermalize internally if the Hamiltonian lacks symmetries. If the Hamiltonian conserves one quantity (“charge”), the ETH implies thermalization within a charge sector—in a microcanonical subspace. But quantum systems can have charges that fail to commute with each other and so share no eigenbasis; microcanonical subspaces may not exist. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian will have degeneracies, so the ETH need not imply thermalization. We adapt the ETH to noncommuting charges by positing a non-Abelian ETH and invoking the approximate microcanonical subspace introduced in quantum thermodynamics. Illustrating with SU(2) symmetry, we apply the non-Abelian ETH in calculating local operators’ time-averaged and thermal expectation values. In many cases, we prove, the time average thermalizes. However, we find cases in which, under a physically reasonable assumption, the time average converges to the thermal average unusually slowly as a function of the global-system size. This work extends the ETH, a cornerstone of many-body physics, to noncommuting charges, recently a subject of intense activity in quantum thermodynamics.},

Because the phonons are not exact eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, the gas relaxes to a stationary state at very long times whose phonon population is a priori different from the initial one. Thanks to integrability, that stationary state needs not be a thermal state. Using the Bethe-ansatz mapping between the exact eigenstates of the Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian and those of a noninteracting Fermi gas and bosonization techniques we completely characterize the stationary state of the gas after relaxation and compute its phonon population distribution. We apply our results to the case where the initial state is an excited coherent state for a single phonon mode, and we compare them to exact results obtained in the hard-core limit.},

  abstract     = {The bacterial hook, as a universal joint coupling rotation of the flagellar motor and the filament, is an important component of the flagellum that propels the bacteria to swim. The mechanical properties of the hook are essential for the flagellum to achieve normal functions. In multiflagellated bacteria such as Escherichia coli , the hook must be compliant so that it can bend for the filaments to form a coherently rotating bundle to generate the thrust when the motor rotates counterclockwise (CCW), yet it also must be rigid so that the bundle can disrupt for the bacteria to tumble to change swimming direction when the motor rotates clockwise (CW). Here, by combining an elastic rod model with high-resolution bead assay to accurately measure the bending stiffness of the hook under CCW or CW rotation in vivo , we elucidate how the hook accomplishes this dual functionality: the hook stiffens under CW rotation, with bending stiffness under CW rotation twice as large as that under CCW rotation. This enables a robust run-and-tumble swimming motility for multiflagellated bacteria.},

In this Letter, we offer a pertinent counterexample in the context of the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Using dynamic mean-field theory, we derive the statistics of the interactions between species in an evolved ecological community. We then show that the full statistics of these interactions, beyond those of a Gaussian ensemble, are required to correctly predict the eigenvalue spectrum and therefore stability. Consequently, the universality principle fails in this system. We thus show that the eigenvalue spectra of random matrices can be used to deduce the stability of “feasible” ecological communities, but only if the emergent non-Gaussian statistics of the interactions between species are taken into account.},

  abstract     = {It is desirable to relate entanglement of many-body systems to measurable observables. In systems with a conserved charge, it was recently shown that the number entanglement entropy (NEE)—i.e., the entropy change due to an unselective subsystem charge measurement—is an entanglement monotone. Here we derive finite-temperature equilibrium relations between Rényi moments of the NEE, and multipoint charge correlations. These relations are exemplified in quantum dot systems where the desired charge correlations can be measured via a nearby quantum point contact. In quantum dots recently realizing the multichannel Kondo effect we show that the NEE has a nontrivial universal temperature dependence which is now accessible using the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Breaking a correlated pair in a superconductor requires an even number of fermions providing at least twice the pairing energy Δ . Here, we show that a single tunneling electron can also excite a pair breaking excitation in a proximitized gold film in the presence of magnetic impurities. Combining scanning tunneling spectroscopy with theoretical modeling, we map the excitation spectrum of an Fe-porphyrin molecule on the Au / V ( 100 ) proximitized surface into a manifold of entangled Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and spin excitations. Pair excitations emerge in the tunneling spectra as peaks outside the spectral gap only in the strong coupling regime, where the presence of a bound quasiparticle in the ground state ensures the even fermion parity of the excitation. Our results unravel the quantum nature of magnetic impurities on superconductors and demonstrate that pair excitations unequivocally reveal the parity of the ground state.},

In this Letter, we explore the mechanism to realize the topological superconductivity (TSC) in the doped Mott insulators with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Through large-scale density matrix renormalization group study of an extended triangular-lattice t − J model on the six- and eight-leg cylinders, we identify a d + i d -wave chiral TSC with spontaneous TRS breaking, which is characterized by a Chern number C = 2 and quasi-long-range superconducting order. We map out the quantum phase diagram with by tuning the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) electron hopping and spin interaction. In the weaker NNN-coupling regime, we identify a pseudogaplike phase with a charge stripe order coexisting with fluctuating superconductivity, which can be tuned into d -wave superconductivity by increasing the doping level and system width. The TSC emerges in the intermediate-coupling regime, which has a transition to a d -wave superconducting phase with larger NNN couplings. The emergence of the TSC is driven by geometrical frustrations and hole dynamics which suppress spin correlation and charge order, leading to a topological quantum phase transition.},

In the presence of Hund’s interactions, valence fluctuations generate a triplet superexchange between electrons and local moments. The offset from the center of symmetry allows spin-triplet pairs formed by the resulting Kondo effect to delocalize onto the Fermi surface, precipitating superconductivity. We demonstrate this mechanism within a minimal two-channel Kondo lattice model and present support for this pairing mechanism from existing experiments.},

We show that all four components share the same BKT critical point, and algebraic decay of spatial coherence with the same critical exponent. However, while the collective excitations in different components are strongly locked, both close to and far from criticality, the spontaneous creation of topological defects in the vicinity of the phase transition is found to be largely independent of the intercomponent mode locking, and instead strongly dependent on the density within a given mode. This peculiar characteristic allows us to reveal a novel state of matter, characterized by configurations of topological defects proliferating on top of a superfluid with algebraic decay of coherence, observation of which is demonstrated to be within reach of current experiments.},

Here, we perform the most macroscopic quantum test in a mechanical resonator to date, which probes the validity of quantum mechanics by ruling out a classical description at the microgram mass scale. This is done by a direct measurement of the Wigner function of a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator mode, monitoring the gradual decay of negativities over tens of microseconds. While the obtained macroscopicity of μ = 11.3 is on par with state-of-the-art atom interferometers, future improvements of mode geometry and coherence times could test the quantum superposition principle at unprecedented scales and also place more stringent bounds on spontaneous collapse models.},

  abstract     = {Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are used as sensors to detect nuclear magnetic resonance signals from micron-sized samples at room temperature. In this scenario, the regime of large magnetic fields is especially interesting as it leads to a large nuclear thermal polarization—thus, to a strong sensor response even in low concentration samples—while chemical shifts and J couplings become more accessible. Nevertheless, this regime remains largely unexplored owing to the difficulties of coupling NV-based sensors with high-frequency nuclear signals. In this Letter, we circumvent this problem with a method that maps the relevant energy shifts in the amplitude of an induced nuclear spin signal that is subsequently transferred to the sensor. This stage is interspersed with free-precession periods of the sample nuclear spins where the sensor does not participate. Thus, our method leads to high spectral resolutions ultimately limited by the coherence of the nuclear spin signal.},

However, in effective field theory such decays proceed via axial-vector, pseudoscalar, or gluonic operators, which are, at the same time, probed in spin-dependent μ → e conversion in nuclei. We derive master formulas that connect both processes in a model-independent way in terms of Wilson coefficients and study the implications of current μ → e limits in titanium for the P → μ e decays. We find that these indirect limits surpass direct ones by many orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {The Mu2e and COMET μ → e conversion experiments are expected to significantly advance limits on new sources of charged lepton flavor violation. Almost all theoretical work in the field has focused on just two operators. However, general symmetry arguments lead to a μ → e conversion rate with six response functions, each of which, in principle, is observable by varying nuclear properties of targets. We construct a nucleon-level nonrelativistic effective theory (NRET) to clarify the microscopic origin of these response functions and to relate rate measurements in different targets. This exercise identifies three operators and their small parameters that control the NRET operator expansion. We note inconsistencies in past treatments of these parameters. The NRET is technically challenging, involving 16 operators, several distorted electron partial waves, bound muon upper and lower components, and an exclusive nuclear matrix element. We introduce a trick for treating the electron Coulomb effects accurately, which enables us to include all of these effects while producing transition densities whose one-body matrix elements can be evaluated analytically, greatly simplifying the nuclear physics. We derive bounds on operator coefficients from existing and anticipated μ → e conversion experiments. We discuss how similar NRET formulations have impacted dark matter phenomenology, noting that the tools this community has developed could be adapted for charged lepton flavor violation studies.},

In this Letter, we point out that in both the free Maxwell theory and massive QED, there is a noninvertible time-reversal symmetry at every rational θ angle, i.e., θ = π p / N . The noninvertible time-reversal symmetry is implemented by a conserved, antilinear operator without an inverse. It is a composition of the naive time-reversal transformation and a fractional quantum Hall state. We also find similar noninvertible time-reversal symmetries in non-Abelian gauge theories, including the N = 4 SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory along the locus | τ | = 1 on the conformal manifold.},

Unlike negativity or mutual information, we show that E has a universal expression even for two disjoint intervals, which depends only on the geometry, the central charge c , and the thermal partition function of the CFT. We prove this universal expression in the replica approach, where the Riemann surface for calculating E at each order n is always a torus topologically. By analytic continuation, the result of n = 1 2 gives the value of E . Furthermore, the results of other values of n also yield meaningful conclusions: The n = 1 result gives a general formula for the two-interval purity, which enables us to calculate the Rényi-2 N -partite information for N ≤ 4 intervals; while the n = ∞ result bounds the correlation function of the two intervals. We verify our findings numerically in the spin- 1 / 2 XXZ chain, whose ground state is described by the Luttinger liquid.},

Motivated by the enormous successes of tensor networks for 1D and 2D systems, we develop an efficient tensor network approach based on infinite projected entangled-pair states for layered 2D systems. Starting from an anisotropic 3D infinite projected entangled-pair state ansatz, we propose a contraction scheme in which the weakly interacting layers are effectively decoupled away from the center of the layers, such that they can be efficiently contracted using 2D contraction methods while keeping the center of the layers connected in order to capture the most relevant interlayer correlations. We present benchmark data for the anisotropic 3D Heisenberg model on a cubic lattice, which shows close agreement with quantum Monte Carlo and full 3D contraction results. Finally, we study the dimer to Néel phase transition in the Shastry-Sutherland model with interlayer coupling, a frustrated spin model that is out of reach of quantum Monte Carlo due to the negative sign problem.},

By investigating the effect of weakly broken dual unitarity on the spreading of local operators, we study whether, and how, small deviations from dual unitarity recover fully generic many-body dynamics. We present a discrete path-integral formula for the out-of-time-order correlator and recover a butterfly velocity smaller than the light-cone velocity, v B &lt; v LC , and a diffusively broadening operator front, two generic features of ergodic quantum spin chains absent in dual-unitary circuit dynamics. The butterfly velocity and diffusion constant are determined by a small set of microscopic quantities, and the operator entanglement of the gates has a crucial role.},

  abstract     = {An ergodic system subjected to an external periodic drive will be generically heated to infinite temperature. However, if the applied frequency is larger than the typical energy scale of the local Hamiltonian, this heating stops during a prethermal period that extends exponentially with the frequency. During this prethermal period, the system may manifest an emergent symmetry that, if spontaneously broken, will produce subharmonic oscillation of the discrete time crystal (DTC). We study the role of dissipation on the survival time of the prethermal DTC. On one hand, a bath coupling increases the prethermal period by slowing down the accumulation of errors that eventually destroy prethermalization. On the other hand, the spontaneous symmetry breaking is destabilized by interaction with environment. The result of this competition is a nonmonotonic variation, i.e., the survival time of the prethermal DTC first increases and then decreases as the environment coupling gets stronger.},

The fields of biological physics and the physics of living systems have similarly emerged as bona fide independent areas of physics in part because tools from molecular and cell biology and optical physics allow scientists to make new quantitative measurements to test physical principles in living systems. This Essay will highlight two exciting future challenges I see at the intersection of these two fields: characterizing emergent behavior and harnessing actuation in highly deformable active objects. I will attempt to show how this topic is a natural extension of older and more recent discoveries and why I think it is likely to unfurl into a wide range of projects that can transform both fields. Progress in this area will enable new platforms for creating adaptive smart materials that can execute large-scale changes in shape in response to stimuli and improve our understanding of biological function, potentially allowing us to identify new targets for fighting disease.},

We develop a mathematical model and use agent-based simulations to capture these essential qualitative features observed in experiments. We explore the deposition profile over a two-dimensional phase diagram defined in terms of the pressure and shear stress threshold, and show that two distinct phases exist.

Despite qualitative similarities between liquid-liquid phase separation in these systems, the extent to which the phase-separation kinetics differ remains unclear. Here we show that inhomogeneous chemical reactions can alter the nucleation kinetics of liquid-liquid phase separation in a manner that is consistent with classical nucleation theory, but can only be rationalized by introducing a nonequilibrium interfacial tension. We identify conditions under which nucleation can be accelerated without changing the energetics or supersaturation, thus breaking the correlation between fast nucleation and strong driving forces that is typical of phase separation and self-assembly at thermal equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Many active particles, such as swimming micro-organisms or motor proteins, do work on their environment by going though a periodic sequence of shapes. Interactions between particles can lead to synchronization of their duty cycles. Here, we study the collective dynamics of a suspension of active particles coupled through hydrodynamics. We find that at high enough density the system transitions to a state of collective motion by a mechanism that is distinct from other instabilities in active matter systems. Second, we demonstrate that the emergent nonequilibrium states feature stationary chimera patterns in which synchronized and phase-isotropic regions coexist. Third, we show that in confinement, oscillatory flows and robust unidirectional pumping states exist, and can be selected by choice of alignment boundary conditions. These results point toward a new route to collective motion and pattern formation and could guide the design of new active materials.},

  abstract     = {Deployable structures capable of significant geometric reconfigurations are ubiquitous in nature. While engineering contraptions typically comprise articulated rigid elements, soft structures that experience material growth for deployment mostly remain the handiwork of biology, e.g., when winged insects deploy their wings during metamorphosis. Here we perform experiments and develop formal models to rationalize the previously unexplored physics of soft deployable structures using core-shell inflatables. We first derive a Maxwell construction to model the expansion of a hyperelastic cylindrical core constrained by a rigid shell. Based on these results, we identify a strategy to obtain synchronized deployment in soft networks. We then show that a single actuated element behaves as an elastic beam with a pressure-dependent bending stiffness which allows us to model complex deployed networks and demonstrate the ability to reconfigure their final shape. Finally, we generalize our results to obtain three-dimensional elastic gridshells, demonstrating our approach’s applicability to assemble complex structures using core-shell inflatables as building blocks. Our results leverage material and geometric nonlinearities to create a low-energy pathway to growth and reconfiguration for soft deployable structures.},

  abstract     = {Active matter is naturally out of equilibrium which results in the emergence of diverse dynamic steady states, including the omnipresent chaotic state known as the active turbulence. However, much less is known how active systems dynamically depart out of these configurations, such as get excited or damped to a different dynamic steady state. In this Letter, we demonstrate the coarsening and refinement dynamics of topological defect lines in three-dimensional active nematic turbulence. Specifically, using theory and numerical modeling, we are able to predict the evolution of the active defect density away from the steady state due to time-dependent activity or viscoelastic material properties, establishing a single length scale phenomenological description of defect line coarsening and refinement in a three-dimensional active nematic. The approach is first applied to growth dynamics of a single active defect loop, and then to a full three-dimensional active defect network. More generally, this Letter provides insight into the general coarsening phenomena between dynamical regimes in 3D active matter, with a possible analogy in other physical systems.},

We show that when the domain is a disk and the soliton density is an analytic function, then the corresponding deterministic soliton gas surprisingly yields the one-soliton solution with the point spectrum the center of the disk. We call this effect soliton shielding . We show that this behavior is robust and survives also for a stochastic soliton gas: indeed, when the N -soliton spectrum is chosen as random variables either uniformly distributed on the circle, or chosen according to the statistics of the eigenvalues of the Ginibre random matrix the phenomenon of soliton shielding persists in the limit N → ∞ . When the domain is an ellipse, the soliton shielding reduces the spectral data to the soliton density concentrating between the foci of the ellipse. The physical solution is asymptotically steplike oscillatory, namely, the initial profile is a periodic elliptic function in the negative x direction while it vanishes exponentially fast in the opposite direction.},

In this Letter, we explore the possibility of driving a transient ferroelectric phase in the quantum paraelectric KTaO 3 via intense terahertz excitation of the soft mode. We observe a long-lived relaxation in the terahertz-driven second harmonic generation (SHG) signal that lasts up to 20 ps at 10 K, which may be attributed to light-induced ferroelectricity. Through analyzing the terahertz-induced coherent soft-mode oscillation and finding its hardening with fluence well described by a single-well potential, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses up to 500 kV / cm cannot drive a global ferroelectric phase in KTaO 3 . Instead, we find the unusual long-lived relaxation of the SHG signal comes from a terahertz-driven moderate dipolar correlation between the defect-induced local polar structures. We discuss the impact of our findings on current investigations of the terahertz-induced ferroelectric phase in quantum paraelectrics.},

We observe an enhancement of X 0 -induced Raman scattering and a suppression for X − -induced, and explain our findings as arising from the tripartite exciton-phonon-phonon coupling. The cavity vibrational phonons provide intermediate replica states of X 0 for resonance conditions in the scattering of lattice phonons, thus enhancing the Raman intensity. In contrast, the tripartite coupling involving X − is found to be much weaker, an observation explained by the geometry-dependent polarity of the electron and hole deformation potentials. Our results indicate that phononic hybridization between lattice and nanomechanical modes plays a key role in the excitonic photophysics and light-matter interaction in 2D-material nanophotonic systems.},

Many studies have shown that there is a ferroelectric size limit in oxides, below which the ferroelectricity will be strongly suppressed due to the depolarization field, and whether such a limit still exists in the absence of the depolarization field remains unclear. Here, by applying uniaxial strain, we obtain pure in-plane polarized ferroelectricity in ultrathin SrTiO 3 membranes, providing a clean system with high tunability to explore ferroelectric size effects especially the thickness-dependent ferroelectric instability with no depolarization field. Surprisingly, the domain size, ferroelectric transition temperature, and critical strain for room-temperature ferroelectricity all exhibit significant thickness dependence. These results indicate that the stability of ferroelectricity is suppressed (enhanced) by increasing the surface or bulk ratio (strain), which can be explained by considering the thickness-dependent dipole-dipole interactions within the transverse Ising model. Our study provides new insights into ferroelectric size effects and sheds light on the applications of ferroelectric thin films in nanoelectronics.},

It is found that the Damon-Eshbach modes exhibit a significant frequency shift due to interfacial anisotropy generated by thin metallic overlayers. In addition, an unexpectedly large shift in the perpendicular standing spin wave mode frequencies is also observed, which cannot be explained by anisotropy-induced mode stiffening or surface pinning. Rather, it is suggested that additional confinement may result from spin pumping at the insulator-metal interface, which results in a locally overdamped interface region.

Thus, the zero-field surface magnetism was once speculated to be different from the bulk AFM phase. However, recent magnetic force microscopy refutes this assumption by detecting persistent AFM order on the surface. In this Letter, we propose a mechanism related to surface defects that can rationalize these contradicting observations in different experiments. We find that co-antisites (exchanging Mn and Bi atoms in the surface van der Waals layer) can strongly suppress the magnetic gap down to several meV in the AFM phase without violating the magnetic order but preserve the magnetic gap in the FM phase. The different gap sizes between AFM and FM phases are caused by the exchange interaction cancellation or collaboration of the top two van der Waals layers manifested by defect-induced surface charge redistribution among the top two van der Waals layers. This theory can be validated by the position- and field-dependent gap in future surface spectroscopy measurements. Our work suggests suppressing related defects in samples to realize the quantum anomalous Hall insulator or axion insulator at zero fields.},

  abstract     = {Fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) at even-denominator Landau level filling factors ( ν ) are of prime interest as they are predicted to host exotic, topological states of matter. We report here the observation of a FQHS at ν = 1 / 2 in a two-dimensional electron system of exceptionally high quality, confined to a wide AlAs quantum well, where the electrons can occupy multiple conduction-band valleys with an anisotropic effective mass. The anisotropy and multivalley degree of freedom offer an unprecedented tunability of the ν = 1 / 2 FQHS as we can control both the valley occupancy via the application of in-plane strain, and the ratio between the strengths of the short- and long-range Coulomb interaction by tilting the sample in the magnetic field to change the electron charge distribution. Thanks to this tunability, we observe phase transitions from a compressible Fermi liquid to an incompressible FQHS and then to an insulating phase as a function of tilt angle. We find that this evolution and the energy gap of the ν = 1 / 2 FQHS depend strongly on valley occupancy.},

  abstract     = {Structural superlubricity describes the state of greatly reduced friction between incommensurate atomically flat surfaces. Theory predicts that, in the superlubric state, the remaining friction sensitively depends on the exact structural configuration. In particular the friction of amorphous and crystalline structures for, otherwise, identical interfaces should be markedly different. Here, we measure friction of antimony nanoparticles on graphite as a function of temperature between 300 and 750 K. We observe a characteristic change of friction when passing the amorphous-crystalline phase transition above 420 K, which shows irreversibility upon cooling. The friction data is modeled with a combination of an area scaling law and a Prandtl-Tomlinson type temperature activation. We find that the characteristic scaling factor γ , which is a fingerprint of the structural state of the interface, is reduced by 20\% when passing the phase transition. This validates the concept that structural superlubricity is determined by the effectiveness of atomic force canceling processes.},

We find that topological chiral superconducting states with Chern number N = 1 , 2, 4 (namely, p + i p , d + i d , and g + i g ) appear over a large parameter region with a moiré filling factor around n = 1 . At some special values of applied electric field and in the presence of a weak out-of-plane Zeeman field, spin-polarized pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductivity can emerge. This spin-polarized PDW state can be probed by experiments such as spin-polarized STM measuring spin-resolved pairing gap and quasiparticle interference. Moreover, the spin-polarized PDW could lead to a spin-polarized superconducting diode effect.},

Here, we propose metasurface-based polarizers that can filter unpolarized incident light to light with any prescribed SOP and DOP, corresponding to arbitrary points located both at the surface and within the solid Poincaré sphere. The Jones matrix elements of the metasurface are inverse-designed via the adjoint method. As prototypes, we experimentally demonstrated metasurface-based polarizers in near-infrared frequencies that can convert unpolarized light into linear, elliptical, or circular polarizations with varying DOPs of 1, 0.7, and 0.4, respectively. Our Letter unlocks a new degree of freedom for metasurface polarization optics and may break new ground for a variety of DOP-related applications, such as polarization calibration and quantum state tomography.},

  abstract     = {The modern scientific method is critically dependent on precision measurements of physical parameters. A classic example is the measurement of the optical phase enabled by optical interferometry, where the error on the measured phase is conventionally bounded by the so-called Heisenberg limit. To achieve phase estimation at the Heisenberg limit, it has been common to consider protocols based on highly complex N00N states of light. However, despite decades of research and several experimental explorations, there has been no demonstration of deterministic phase estimation with N00N states reaching the Heisenberg limit or even surpassing the shot noise limit. Here we use a deterministic phase estimation scheme based on a source of Gaussian squeezed vacuum states and high-efficiency homodyne detection to obtain phase estimates with an extreme sensitivity that significantly surpasses the shot noise limit and even beats the conventional Heisenberg limit as well as the performance of a pure N00N state protocol. Using a high-efficiency setup with a total loss of about 11\%, we achieve a Fisher information of 15.8 ( 6 ) rad − 2 per photon—a significant increase in performance compared to state of the art and beyond an ideal six photon N00N state scheme. This work represents an important achievement in quantum metrology, and it opens the door to future quantum sensing technologies for the interrogation of light-sensitive biological systems.},

Further, we find that the dissipative steady state in such a situation remains completely pure up until the instability threshold (in clear distinction from standard parametric instabilities). These pairing-induced instabilities also exhibit an extremely pronounced sensitivity to wave function localization. This provides a simple yet powerful method for selectively populating and entangling edge modes of photonic (or more general bosonic) lattices having a topological band structure. The underlying dissipative pairing interaction is experimentally resource friendly, requiring the addition of a single additional localized interaction to an existing lattice, and is compatible with a number of existing platforms, including superconducting circuits.},

Here we investigate how pure dephasing of one of the components of a hybrid quantum system affects the dephasing rate of the system transitions. We find that, in turn, the interaction, in the case of a light-matter system, can significantly affect the form of the stochastic perturbation describing the dephasing of a subsystem, depending on the adopted gauge. Neglecting this issue can lead to wrong and unphysical results when the interaction becomes comparable to the bare resonance frequencies of subsystems, which correspond to the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes.

Using a hybrid trapping architecture combining an atom chip with a printed circuit board, we continuously adjust the system’s dimensionality over a wide range while measuring the phase fluctuations through the power spectrum of density ripples in time-of-flight expansion. Our measurements confirm that the chemical potential μ controls the departure of the system from 3D and that the fluctuations are dependent on both μ and the temperature T . Through a rigorous study we quantitatively observe how inside the crossover the dependence on T gradually disappears as the system becomes 3D. Throughout the entire crossover the fluctuations are shown to be determined by the relative occupation of 1D axial collective excitations.},

However, there are conflicting claims concerning its γ -decay branching ratio, and a rigorous interrogation of γ -ray sum contributions is lacking. Experiments performed at the Australian Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility were used to study the decay of Fe 53 m . For the first time, sum-coincidence contributions to the weak E 6 and M 5 decay branches have been firmly quantified using complementary experimental and computational methods. Agreement across the different approaches confirms the existence of the real E 6 transition; the M 5 branching ratio and transition rate have also been revised. Shell model calculations performed in the full f p model space suggest that the effective proton charge for high-multipole, E 4 and E 6 , transitions is quenched to approximately two-thirds of the collective E 2 value. Correlations between nucleons may offer an explanation of this unexpected phenomenon, which is in stark contrast to the collective nature of lower-multipole, electric transitions observed in atomic nuclei.},

  abstract     = {The excited states of N = 44 Zn 74 were investigated via γ -ray spectroscopy following Cu 74 β decay. By exploiting γ − γ angular correlation analysis, the 2 2 + , 3 1 + , 0 2 + , and 2 3 + states in Zn 74 were firmly established. The γ -ray branching and E 2 / M 1 mixing ratios for transitions deexciting the 2 2 + , 3 1 + , and 2 3 + states were measured, allowing for the extraction of relative B ( E 2 ) values. In particular, the 2 3 + → 0 2 + and 2 3 + → 4 1 + transitions were observed for the first time. The results show excellent agreement with new microscopic large-scale shell-model calculations, and are discussed in terms of underlying shapes, as well as the role of neutron excitations across the N = 40 gap. Enhanced axial shape asymmetry (triaxiality) is suggested to characterize Zn 74 in its ground state. Furthermore, an excited K = 0 band with a significantly larger softness in its shape is identified. A shore of the N = 40 “island of inversion” appears to manifest above Z = 26 , previously thought as its northern limit in the chart of the nuclides.},

This is usually done under the assumption of the standard model (SM) of particle physics. Allowing for light new physics (NP) beyond the SM modifies the extraction of fundamental physical constants. Consequently, setting NP bounds using these data, and at the same time assuming the Committee on Data of the International Science Council recommended values for the fundamental physical constants, is not reliable. As we show in this Letter, both SM and NP parameters can be simultaneously determined in a consistent way from a global fit. For light vectors with QED-like couplings, such as the dark photon, we provide a prescription that recovers the degeneracy with the photon in the massless limit and requires calculations only at leading order in the small new physics couplings. At present, the data show tensions partially related to the proton charge radius determination. We show that these can be alleviated by including contributions from a light scalar with flavor nonuniversal couplings.},

Our main focus is on noninvertible symmetries, which have emerged in the past year as a new type of symmetry in d ≥ 4 QFTs. We exemplify our proposal in the holographic confinement setup, dual to 4D N = 1 Super-Yang Mills. In the brane picture, the fusion of noninvertible symmetries naturally arises from the Myers effect on D-branes. In turn, their action on line defects is modeled by the Hanany-Witten effect.},

We produce exclusion plots on scalar couplings violating the inequality, and we find no violations for potentials from string theory. In the special case where the dominant energy condition holds, we use general relativity techniques to prove the anti–de Sitter (AdS) Penrose inequality in all dimensions, assuming spherical, planar, or hyperbolic symmetry. However, our violations show that this result cannot be generically true with only the null energy condition, and we give an analytic sufficient condition for violation of the Penrose inequality, constraining couplings of scalar potentials. Like the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, this gives a necessary condition for the stability of asymptotically AdS (AAdS) spacetimes.},

With the same data acquired for PTAs, we propose to develop pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs), to explore astrophysics and fundamental physics. As in the case of PTAs, PPAs are best suited to reveal temporal and spatial correlations at large scales that are hard to mimic by local noise. To demonstrate the physical potential of PPAs, we consider detection of ultralight axionlike dark matter (ALDM), through cosmic birefringence induced by its Chern-Simons coupling. Because of its tiny mass, the ultralight ALDM can be generated as a Bose-Einstein condensate, characterized by a strong wave nature. Incorporating both temporal and spatial correlations of the signal, we show that PPAs have a potential to probe the Chern-Simons coupling up to ∼ 10 − 14 − 10 − 17 GeV − 1 , with a mass range ∼ 10 − 27 – 10 − 21 eV .},

However, primordial quantum diffusion unavoidably generates non-Gaussian, exponential tails in the distribution of inflationary perturbations. These exponential tails have direct consequences for the formation of collapsed structures in the Universe, as has been studied in the context of primordial black holes. We show that these tails also affect the very-large-scale structures, making heavy clusters like “El Gordo,” or large voids like the one associated with the cosmic microwave background cold spot, more probable. We compute the halo mass function and cluster abundance as a function of redshift in the presence of exponential tails. We find that quantum diffusion generically enlarges the number of heavy clusters and depletes subhalos, an effect that cannot be captured by the famed f NL corrections. These late-Universe signatures could, thus, be fingerprints of quantum dynamics during inflation that should be incorporated in N -body simulations and checked against astrophysical data.},

Here, we propose and demonstrate a full-period quantum phase estimation approach by adopting the Kitaev’s phase estimation algorithm to eliminate the phase ambiguity and using the GHZ states to obtain phase value, simultaneously. For an N -party entangled state, our approach can achieve an upper bound of sensitivity of δ θ = 3 / ( N 2 + 2 N ) , which beats the limit of adaptive Bayesian estimation. By performing an eight-photon experiment, we demonstrate the estimation of unknown phases in a full period, and observe the phase superresolution and sensitivity beyond the shot-noise limit.

We demonstrate the existence of the DTC phase by analytical analysis from perturbation theory and convincing numerical evidence from observable dynamics. The new DTC model paves a new promising way for further experiments and deepens our understanding of DTCs. Since the DTC order does not require special quantum state preparation and the strong disorder average, it can be naturally realized on the noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware with much fewer resources and repetitions. Moreover, in addition to the robust subharmonic response, there are other novel robust beating oscillations in the Stark-MBL DTC phase that are absent in random or quasiperiodic MBL DTCs.},

  abstract     = {Many-body unitary dynamics interspersed with repeated measurements display a rich phenomenology hallmarked by measurement-induced phase transitions. Employing feedback-control operations that steer the dynamics toward an absorbing state, we study the entanglement entropy behavior at the absorbing state phase transition. For short-range control operations, we observe a transition between phases with distinct subextensive scalings of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the system undergoes a transition between volume-law and area-law phases for long-range feedback operations. The fluctuations of entanglement entropy and of the order parameter of the absorbing state transition are fully coupled for sufficiently strongly entangling feedback operations. In that case, entanglement entropy inherits the universal dynamics of the absorbing state transition. This is, however, not the case for arbitrary control operations, and the two transitions are generally distinct. We quantitatively support our results by introducing a framework based on stabilizer circuits with classical flag labels. Our results shed new light on the problem of observability of measurement-induced phase transitions.},

We show that such a driven chain exhibits prethermal strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in the high drive amplitude regime at specific drive frequencies ω m * . This constitutes the first realization of HSF for out-of-equilibrium systems. We obtain analytic expressions of ω m * using a Floquet perturbation theory and provide exact numerical computation of entanglement entropy, equal-time correlation functions, and the density autocorrelation of fermions for finite chains.

In particular, the dependence of different types of DNA damage on high-energy protons represents a significant knowledge void. Here we employ first-principles real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulation, using a massively parallel supercomputer, to unravel the quantum-mechanical details of the energy transfer from high-energy protons to DNA in water. The calculations reveal that protons deposit significantly more energy onto the DNA sugar-phosphate side chains than onto the nucleobases, and greater energy transfer is expected onto the DNA side chains than onto water. As a result of this electronic stopping process, highly energetic holes are generated on the DNA side chains as a source of oxidative damage.},

  abstract     = {While most chemical bonds weaken under the action of mechanical force (called slip bond behavior), nature has developed bonds that do the opposite: their lifetime increases as force is applied. While such catch bonds have been studied quite extensively at the single molecule level and in adhesive contacts, recent work has shown that they are also abundantly present as crosslinkers in the actin cytoskeleton. However, their role and the mechanism by which they operate in these networks have remained unclear. Here, we present computer simulations that show how polymer networks crosslinked with either slip or catch bonds respond to mechanical stress. Our results reveal that catch bonding may be required to protect dynamic networks against fracture, in particular for mobile linkers that can diffuse freely after unbinding. While mobile slip bonds lead to networks that are very weak at high stresses, mobile catch bonds accumulate in high stress regions and thereby stabilize cracks, leading to a more ductile fracture behavior. This allows cells to combine structural adaptivity at low stresses with mechanical stability at high stresses.},

Here, we introduce an experimental setup to systematically explore their response to shear rotations, where one suddenly rotates the principal axes of shear by an angle θ , and measure the shear stresses with a biaxial force sensor. Our measurements confirm the genericness of the transient decrease of the resistance to shear under unsteady conditions. Moreover, the orthogonal shear stress, which vanishes in steady state, takes non-negligible values with a rich θ dependence, changing qualitatively with solid volume fraction ϕ and resulting in a force that tends to reduce or enhance the direction of flow for small or large ϕ . These experimental findings are confirmed and rationalized by particle-based numerical simulations and a recently proposed constitutive model. We show that the rotation angle dependence of the orthogonal stress results from a ϕ -dependent interplay between hydrodynamic and contact stresses.},

Based on a dimensional analysis and DEM simulations, we show that, in addition to a previously proposed criterion for peak acceleration that leads to breaking of contacts, weakening requires the absolute amplitude squared of the displacement to be sufficiently large relative to the confining pressure. The analysis provides a basis for predicting flows subjected to arbitrary external vibration and demonstrates that a previously unrecognized second process that is dependent on dissipation contributes to shear weakening under vibrations.},

We found that the interaction strengths linearly depend on the cation concentrations, following the order of Li + &lt; NH 4 + &lt; Na + &lt; K + . The binding energies are 0.03 – 0.23 kJ mol − 1 M − 1 . This order is distinct from the strength of cation- π interactions in gas phase and may be caused by the different dehydration ability of the cations. Taken together, our method provides a unique perspective to investigate cation- π interactions under physiologically relevant conditions.},

We find high anisotropy between the different crystal orientations with values ranging from 100 to 150 mJ m − 2 , and the average value of the distinct planes being γ ¯ s = 137 ( 20 ) mJ m − 2 . This value for the coexistence interfacial free energy is in reasonable agreement with previous extrapolations from nucleation studies.

In addition, theoretical calculations show an orbital Hall plateau in the insulating gap of TMDs, characterized by an orbital Chern number. We explore the correlation between these two phenomena in TMD monolayers in two structural phases: the noncentrosymmetric 2 H and the centrosymmetric 1 T . Using density functional theory, we confirm the characteristics of 2 H TMDs and reveal that 1 T TMDs are identified by a Z 4 topological invariant. As a result, when cut along appropriate directions, they host conducting edge states, which cross their bulk energy-band gaps and can transport orbital angular momentum. Our linear response calculations thus indicate that the HOTI phase is accompanied by an orbital Hall effect. Using general symmetry arguments, we establish a connection between the two phenomena with potential implications for orbitronics and spin orbitronics.},

  abstract     = {Dislocation glide, deformation twinning, and phase transition are critical mechanisms resulting in irreversible plastic deformations of materials. Because of the lack of dislocation movement, superhard ceramics generally exhibit brittle failure at room temperature. Here, by employing molecular dynamics simulations using a machine-learning force field, we reveal several plastic deformation mechanisms in superhard boron carbide as a small amount of aluminum (Al) is doped. Under shear deformation, dislocation nucleation and glide occur in Al-doped boron carbide ( B 12 -CAlC) due to the breakage of weakened chain bonds rather than the disintegration of icosahedral clusters. The dislocation activities then cause twin boundaries to migrate, thereby mitigating amorphization and enhancing ductility. Furthermore, the mobile dislocation with the Burgers vector of b = ⟨ 1 1 ¯ 0 ⟩ { 1 1 1 } is observed in the tensile nanopillar, which is well consistent with the experiment. This Letter demonstrates that mobile dislocation could be activated in superstrong covalent materials through a simple doping strategy.},

  abstract     = {Higher-order topological phases have raised widespread interest in recent years with the occurrence of the topological boundary states of dimension two or more less than that of the system bulk. The higher-order topological states have been verified in gapped phases, in a wide variety of systems, such as photonic and acoustic systems, and recently also observed in gapless semimetal phase, such as Weyl and Dirac phases, in systems alike. The higher-order topology is signaled by the hinge states emerging in the common band gaps of the bulk states and the surface states. In this Letter, we report our first prediction and observation of a new type of hinge states, the bound hinge states in the continuum (BHICs) bulk band, in a higher-order Weyl semimetal implemented in phononic crystal. In contrast to the hinge state in gap, which is characterized by the bulk polarization, the BHIC is identified by the nontrivial surface polarization. The finding of the topological BHICs broadens our insight to the topological states, and may stimulate similar researches in other systems such as electronic, photonic, and cold atoms systems. Our Letter may pave the way toward high- Q acoustic devices in application.},

  abstract     = {Ceramics, often exhibiting important functional properties like piezoelectricity, superconductivity, and magnetism, are usually mechanically brittle at room temperature and even more brittle at low temperature due to their ionic or covalent bonding nature. The brittleness in their working temperature range (mostly from room down to cryogenic temperatures) has been a limiting factor for the usefulness of these ceramics. In this Letter, we report a surprising “low-temperature toughening” phenomenon in a La-doped CaTiO 3 perovskite ceramic, where a 2.5 × increase of fracture toughness K IC from 1.9 to 4.8 MPa m 1 / 2 occurs when cooling from above room temperature (323 K) down to a cryogenic temperature of 123 K, the lowest temperature our experiment can reach. In situ microscopic observations in combination with macroscopic characterizations show that this desired but counterintuitive phenomenon stems from a reentrant strain-glass transition, during which nanosized orthorhombic ferroelastic domains gradually emerge from the existing tetragonal ferroelastic matrix. The temperature stability of this unique microstructure and its stress-induced transition into the macroscopic orthorhombic phase provide a low-temperature toughening mechanism over a wide temperature range and explain the observed phenomenon. Our finding may open a way to design tough ceramics with a wide temperature range and shed light on the nature of reentrant transitions in other ferroic systems.},

  abstract     = {Chirality is one of the fundamentals of nature with strong ties to asymmetry. In wave physics, it is conventionally characterized by asymmetric scattering of circularly polarized waves but suffers from two-state polarization. To overcome the limitation, here we demonstrate the concept of extreme chirality regarding orbital angular momentum (OAM) helicity, originating from a chiral quasibound state in the continuum held by a mirror-symmetry-broken metasurface. Empowered by the intrinsic OAM-selective coupling nature of the metasurface, the system arrives at a peculiar state where the left-handed incident vortex is completely absorbed while the right-handed counterpart is totally reflected, namely, a perfectly-chiral exceptional point. The realization of asymmetric OAM modulation creates the possibility to explore chirality with unlimited states. Our work raises a new paradigm for the study of extreme OAM chirality and enriches the physics of chiral wave-matter interaction.},

Magnetic reconnection is more efficient, and rapidly accelerates a nonthermal particle population, in our kinetic approach. In addition, the plasma in the kinetic simulations develops significant departures from thermal equilibrium, including pressure anisotropy that excites kinetic-scale instabilities, and a large field-aligned heat flux near the horizon that approaches the free-streaming value. We discuss the implications of our results for modeling event-horizon scale observations of Sgr A* and M87 by GRAVITY and the Event Horizon Telescope.},

Only when the viscous forces are sufficiently strong to plastically deform the material to a finite distance away from the swimmer will net locomotion occur. Once locomotion is underway in the third stage, the yield stress retards swimming at small pitch angles. Conversely, at large pitch angles, yield stress dominates the flow by enhancing swimming speed. Flow visualizations reveal a highly localized flow near the swimmer in yield stress fluids.},

Via intensity- and time-resolved reconstructions of such phase-space functions from homodyne detection data, we probe the systems’ resourcefulness for quantum information processing up to the nanosecond regime. Our experimental findings are confirmed through numerical simulations, for which we develop an approach that renders established algorithms compatible with our methodology. In contrast to commonly applied phase-space functions, our distributions can be directly sampled from measured data, including uncertainties, and yield a simple operational measure of quantum coherence via the distribution’s variance in phase.

Such ionization reduction consistently occurs regardless of the relative phase between the two pulses. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulation results indicate that with the assisted 800 nm photons the electron can be launched to Rydberg states with large angular quantum numbers, which stand off the nuclei and thus are hard to be freed in the multiphoton regime.

This unanticipated polarization is shown to be due to quantum interference with radiative recombination. The interference effect has been studied on an asymmetric resonance profile but has never been studied on polarization. In this Letter, we show that the effect on polarization can arise from a different cross term than that responsible for asymmetry, resulting in unexpectedly large polarization even for a nearly symmetric resonance suggesting a small interference.},

  abstract     = {Much effort is devoted to measuring the nuclear symmetry energy through neutron star (NS) and nuclear observables. Since matter in the NS core may be nonhadronic, observables like radii and tidal deformability may not provide reliable constraints on properties of nucleonic matter. By performing the first consistent inference using ensembles of core and crust equations of state from astrophysical and nuclear data, we demonstrate that coincident timing of a resonant shattering flare (RSF) and gravitational wave signal during binary NS inspiral probes the crust-core transition region and provides constraints on the symmetry energy comparable to terrestrial nuclear experiments. We show that nuclear masses, RSFs, and measurements of NS radii and tidal deformabilities constrain different density ranges of the equation of state, providing complementary probes.},

This occurs at extremely large internal momenta, which can be achieved in a high energy transfer electrodisintegration of the deuteron. Investigating the deuteron on the light front, where the vacuum fluctuations are suppressed, we found that this new structure, together with the conventional S and D states, is leading order in transferred energy of the reaction and thus not suppressed on the light front. The incompleteness of the observed P state results in a violation of the angular condition that can happen only if the deuteron contains non-nucleonic structures, such as Δ Δ , N * N or hidden color components. We demonstrate that experimentally verifiable signatures of incomplete P states are angular anisotropy of the light front momentum distribution of the nucleon in the deuteron, as well as an enhancement of the tensor polarization strength beyond the S - and D -wave predictions at large internal momenta in the deuteron.},

A Th 229 cluster is first radiated by an intense femtosecond laser pulse, causing ionization of the constituting atoms. The cluster will then survive for a time on the order of 1 ps, during which the electrons collide with the nuclei repeatedly and excite them to the isomeric state. Two mechanisms are responsible for the isomeric excitation: nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) and nuclear excitation by inelastic electron scattering (NEIES). By changing the laser intensity, one can tune between NEEC and NEIES continuously. This laser-heated-cluster scheme not only provides a highly efficient means for isomeric excitation, but also provides an approach for the confirmation of the NEEC process, which has been predicted for over forty years without conclusive experimental verifications.},

In the 0\%–60\% centrality class, the nuclear modification factors ( R A A ), which quantify the level of yield suppression in heavy-ion collisions compared to p + p collisions, for ϒ ( 1 S ) and ϒ ( 2 S ) are 0.40 ± 0.03 ( stat ) ± 0.03 ( sys ) ± 0.09 ( norm ) and 0.26 ± 0.08 ( stat ) ± 0.02 ( sys ) ± 0.06 ( norm ) , respectively, while the upper limit of the ϒ ( 3 S ) R A A is 0.17 at a 95\% confidence level. This provides experimental evidence that the ϒ ( 3 S ) is significantly more suppressed than the ϒ ( 1 S ) at RHIC. The level of suppression for ϒ ( 1 S ) is comparable to that observed at the much higher collision energy at the Large Hadron Collider. These results point to the creation of a medium at RHIC whose temperature is sufficiently high to strongly suppress excited ϒ states.},

This is the very first computation for a 2 → 3 process with massive colored particles at this perturbative order. We develop a soft Higgs boson approximation for loop amplitudes, which enables us to reliably quantify the impact of the yet unknown two-loop contribution. At the center-of-mass energy s = 13 TeV , the NNLO corrections increase the next-to-leading order result for the total cross section by about 4\% and lead to a significant reduction of perturbative uncertainties.},

With such a deep binding, Coulomb repulsion serves only as a perturbation on the ground state wave function of the parametrized strong potential and may shift the strong binding only by a few percent.

This motivates one to quantify the breaking of the shift invariance that characterizes the flavorful effective couplings of an axionlike particle to standard model fermions. We identify a minimal set of Jarlskog-like flavor invariants that vanish if and only if the axion is shift symmetric. Therefore, they represent order parameters for the breaking of the axion shift symmetry. We illustrate properties of the invariants by matching to a UV model, studying the C P transformation of the invariants, calculating their renormalization group evolution, and investigating similar conditions in the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale. Finally, we discuss the order parameter associated to the nonperturbative shift-breaking induced by the axion-gluons coupling, which is also flavorful.},

Above the first crossover, we observe the appearance of large, inhomogeneous structures consistent with a classical picture of the formation of W and Z condensates pierced by vortices. The presence of the W and Z condensates supports the emergence of the exotic superconducting and superfluid properties induced by a strong magnetic field in the vacuum. We find evidence that the vortices form a disordered solid or a liquid rather than a crystal. The second transition restores the electroweak symmetry. Such conditions can be realized in the near-horizon region of the magnetized black holes.},

  abstract     = {A novel analysis is performed, incorporating time-of-flight (TOF) information to study the interactions of dark matter (DM) with standard model particles. After supernova (SN) explosions, DM with mass m χ ≲ O ( MeV ) in the halo can be boosted by SN neutrinos ( SN ν ) to relativistic speed. The SN ν boosted DM (BDM) arrives on Earth with TOF which depends only on m χ and is independent of the cross section. These BDMs can interact with detector targets in low-background experiments and manifest as afterglow events after the arrival of SN ν . The characteristic TOF spectra of the BDM events can lead to large background suppression and unique determination of m χ . New cross section constraints on σ χ e σ χ ν are derived from SN1987a in the Large Magellanic Cloud with data from the Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments. Potential sensitivities for the next galactic SN with Hyper-Kamiokande are projected. This analysis extends the existing bounds on σ χ e σ χ ν over a broad range of r χ = σ χ ν / σ χ e . In particular, the improvement is by 1–3 orders of magnitude for m χ &lt; O ( 100 keV ) for σ χ e ∼ σ χ ν . Prospects of exploiting TOF information in other astrophysical systems to probe exotic physics with other DM candidates are discussed.},

A damped oscillation in the first Hubble flow function—or equivalently a feature in the potential—and the corresponding localized oscillations in the primordial power spectrum partially mimic the improvement in the fit of Planck data due to A L or Ω K . Compared to the baseline model, this model can lead simultaneously to a larger value of H 0 and a smaller value of S 8 , a trend that can be enhanced when the most recent SH0ES measurement for H 0 is combined with Planck and BICEP-Keck 2018 data. Large scale structure data and more precise cosmic microwave background polarization measurements will further provide critical tests of this intermediate fast-roll phase.},

Such quantitative characteristics are not only useful for reporting the progress and comparing different quantum platforms but also essential for identifying the bottlenecks and designing a technology road map. Most metrics such as randomized benchmarking and quantum volume were originally introduced for circuit-based quantum computers and were not immediately applicable to measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) processors such as in photonic devices. In this Letter, we close this long-standing gap by presenting a framework to map physical noises and imperfections in MBQC processes to logical errors in equivalent quantum circuits, whereby enabling the well-known metrics to characterize MBQC. To showcase our framework, we study a continuous-variable cluster state based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding as a near-term candidate for photonic quantum computing, and derive the effective logical gate error channels and calculate the quantum volume in terms of the GKP squeezing and photon transmission rate.},

  abstract     = {Although near-term quantum computing devices are still limited by the quantity and quality of qubits in the so-called NISQ era, quantum computational advantage has been experimentally demonstrated. Moreover, hybrid architectures of quantum and classical computing have become the main paradigm for exhibiting NISQ applications, where low-depth quantum circuits are repeatedly applied. In order to further scale up the problem size solvable by the NISQ devices, it is also possible to reduce the number of physical qubits by “cutting” the quantum circuit into different pieces. In this work, we experimentally demonstrated a circuit-cutting method for simulating quantum circuits involving many logical qubits, using only a few physical superconducting qubits. By exploiting the symmetry of linear-cluster states, we can estimate the effectiveness of circuit-cutting for simulating up to 33-qubit linear-cluster states, using at most 4 physical qubits for each subcircuit. Specifically, for the 12-qubit linear-cluster state, we found that the experimental fidelity bound can reach as much as 0.734, which is about 19\% higher than a direct implementation on the same 12-qubit superconducting processor. Our results indicate that circuit-cutting represents a feasible approach of simulating quantum circuits using much fewer qubits, while achieving a much higher circuit fidelity.},

In addition to the topological effects related to LEPs, we focus on thermodynamic effects, which can be understood by the Landau-Zener-Stückelberg process under decoherence. We witness a positive net work from the quantum heat engine if the heat engine cycle dynamically encircles a LEP. Further investigation reveals that a larger net work is done when the system is operated closer to the LEP. We attribute the enhanced performance of the quantum heat engine to the Landau-Zener-Stückelberg process, enabled by the eigenenergy landscape in the vicinity of the LEP, and the exceptional point-induced topological transition. Therefore, our results open new possibilities toward LEP-enabled control of quantum heat engines and of thermodynamic processes in open quantum systems.},

A much simpler approach with considerable flexibility would be to consider heat transfer in synthetic electric and magnetic fields that are easily applied. We demonstrate the breakdown of detailed balance for the heat transfer function T ( ω ) , i.e., the spectrum of heat transfer between two objects due to the presence of synthetic electric and magnetic fields. The spectral measurements carry much more physical information and are the reason for the quantum theory of radiation. We demonstrate explicitly the synthetic field induced nonreciprocity in the heat transfer transmission function between two graphene flakes and for the Casimir coupling between two objects. Unlike many other cases of heat transfer, the latter case has interesting features of the strong coupling. Further the presence of synthetic fields affects the mean occupation numbers of two membranes and we propose this system for the experimental verification of the breakdown of detailed balance.},

In this Letter, we show that this principle, when utilized properly, can provide physical rationale toward structural derivation of multipartite quantum systems. In accordance with the no signaling condition, the state and effect spaces of a composite system can allow different possible mathematical descriptions, even when descriptions for the individual systems are assumed to be quantum. While in one extreme, namely, the maximal tensor product composition, the state space becomes quite exotic and permits composite states that are not allowed in quantum theory, the other extreme—minimal tensor product composition—contains only separable states, and the resulting theory allows only Bell local correlation. As we show, none of these compositions is commensurate with information causality, and hence cannot be the bona-fide description of nature. Information causality therefore promises an information-theoretical derivation of self duality of the state and effect cones for composite quantum systems.},

Here, we propose a general framework for cell packing in curved environments and explain the formation of AB-T1s from the perspective of strain anisotropy. We find that steep curvature gradients can lead to cell tilting and induce AB-T1s. Alternatively, pressure differences across the epithelial tissue can drive AB-T1s in regions of large curvature anisotropy.

By combining our observation of transient oxygen O 1 s core level peak shifts at submonolayer water coverages with Ehrenfest molecular dynamics simulations we find that ultrafast interfacial hole transfer from TiO 2 to molecularly adsorbed water is completed within the 285 fs time resolution of the experiment. This is facilitated by the formation of a new hydrogen bond between an O 2 c site at the surface and a physisorbed water molecule. The calculations fully corroborate our experimental observations and further suggest that this process is preceded by the efficient trapping of the hole at the surface of TiO 2 by hydroxyl species (-OH), that form following the dissociative adsorption of water. At a water coverage exceeding a monolayer, interfacial charge transfer is suppressed. Our findings are directly applicable to a wide range of photocatalytic systems in which water plays a critical role.},

In the limit of weak coupling, our model reduces to the D -dimensional Kuramoto phase model, akin to a similar classic construction of the well-known Kuramoto phase model from weakly coupled two-dimensional limit-cycle oscillators. For the practically important case of D = 3 , the incoherence of the model is rigorously proved to be stable for negative coupling ( K 0 ); the locked states are shown to exist if K &gt; 0 ; in particular, the onset of amplitude death is theoretically predicted. For D ≥ 2 , the discrete and continuous spectra for both locked states and amplitude death are governed by two general formulas. Our proposed D -dimensional model is physically more reasonable, because it is no longer constrained by fixed amplitude dynamics, which puts the recent studies of the D -dimensional Kuramoto phase model on a stronger footing by providing a more general framework for D -dimensional limit-cycle oscillators.},

  abstract     = {Repulsive oscillator networks can exhibit multiple cooperative rhythms, including chimera and cluster splay states. Yet, understanding which rhythm prevails remains challenging. Here, we address this fundamental question in the context of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi networks of rotators with higher-order Fourier modes in the coupling. Through analysis and numerics, we show that three-cluster splay states with two distinct coherent clusters and a solitary oscillator are the prevalent rhythms in networks with an odd number of units. We denote such tripod patterns cyclops states with the solitary oscillator reminiscent of the Cyclops’ eye. As their mythological counterparts, the cyclops states are giants that dominate the system’s phase space in weakly repulsive networks with first-order coupling. Astonishingly, the addition of the second or third harmonics to the Kuramoto coupling function makes the cyclops states global attractors practically across the full range of coupling’s repulsion. Beyond the Kuramoto oscillators, we show that this effect is robustly present in networks of canonical theta neurons with adaptive coupling. At a more general level, our results suggest clues for finding dominant rhythms in repulsive physical and biological networks.},

  abstract     = {Controlling thermodynamic cycles to minimize the dissipated heat is a long-standing goal in thermodynamics, and more recently, a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics for nanoscale systems. Here, we introduce a theoretical and computational framework for optimizing nonequilibrium control protocols that can transform a system between two distributions in a minimally dissipative fashion. These protocols optimally transport a system along paths through the space of probability distributions that minimize the dissipative cost of a transformation. Furthermore, we show that the thermodynamic metric—determined via a linear response approach—can be directly derived from the same objective function that is optimized in the optimal transport problem, thus providing a unified perspective on thermodynamic geometries. We investigate this unified geometric framework in two model systems and observe that our procedure for optimizing control protocols is robust beyond linear response.},

Starting from the Anderson impurity model, we predict that an additional p-wave conduction band channel opens up if a bosonic mode is coupled to the tunneling between impurity and host, which implies an additional pair of odd-parity Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. The bosonic mode can be a vibrational mode or the electromagnetic field in a cavity. The exchange couplings in the two channels depend sensitively on the state of the bosonic mode (ground state, few quanta, or classically driven Floquet state), which opens possibilities for phononics or photonics control of such systems, with a rich variety of ground and excited states.},

However, since a structural transition accompanies the SI transition, deciphering the role of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in driving the SI transition has remained controversial. Here, we investigate the photoexcited nonequilibrium state in Ta 2 NiSe 5 using pump-probe Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The combined nonequilibrium spectroscopic measurements of the lattice and electronic states reveal the presence of a photoexcited metastable state where the insulating gap is suppressed, but the low-temperature structural distortion is preserved.

  abstract     = {Nanophononics has the potential for information transfer, in an analogous manner to its photonic and electronic counterparts. The adoption of phononic systems has been limited, due to difficulties associated with the generation, manipulation, and detection of phonons, especially at GHz frequencies. Existing techniques often require piezoelectric materials with an external radiofrequency excitation that are not readily integrated into existing CMOS infrastructures, while nonpiezoelectric demonstrations have been inefficient. In this Letter, we explore the optomechanical generation of coherent phonons in a suspended 2D silicon phononic crystal cavity with a guided mode around 6.8 GHz. By incorporating an air-slot into this cavity, we turn the phononic waveguide into an optomechanical platform that exploits localized photonic modes resulting from inherent fabrication imperfections for the transduction of mechanics. Such a platform exhibits very fine control of phonons using light, and is capable of coherent self-sustained phonon generation around 6.8 GHz, operating at room temperature. The ability to generate high frequency coherent mechanical vibrations within such a simple 2D CMOS-compatible system could be a first step towards the development of sources in phononic circuitry and the coherent manipulation of other solid-state properties.},

To explain their origin, it is necessary to study how electromagnetic fields interact with these systems. We address this problem here by studying two classical quantities: Faraday rotation and the complex refractive index in a paradigmatic perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 in a broad wavelength range. We find that the minimal coupling of electromagnetic fields to the k · p Hamiltonian is insufficient to describe the observed data even on the qualitative level. To amend this, we demonstrate that there exists a relevant atomic-level coupling between electromagnetic fields and the spin degree of freedom. This spin-electric coupling allows for quantitative description of a number of previous as well as present experimental data. In particular, we use it here to show that the Faraday effect in lead halide perovskites is dominated by the Zeeman splitting of the energy levels and has a substantial beyond-Becquerel contribution. Finally, we present general symmetry-based phenomenological arguments that in the low-energy limit our effective model includes all basis coupling terms to the electromagnetic field in the linear order.},

Here we study the competition between skyrmions and a chiral spin liquid, using the latter as an entropic buffer to impose a quasivacuum of skyrmions. As a result, the temperature becomes a knob to tune the skyrmion density from a dense liquid to a diluted gas, protecting the integrity of each skyrmion from paramagnetic disintegration. With this additional knob in hand, we find at high field a topological spin glass made of zero- and one-dimensional topological defects (respectively skyrmions and bimerons).},

Here, the η -spin represents the type of photo-generated pseudoparticles (doublon or holon). | Ψ charge ⟩ is determined by spinless free fermions, | Ψ spin ⟩ by the isotropic Heisenberg model in the squeezed spin space, and | Ψ η − spin ⟩ by the XXZ model in the squeezed η -spin space. In particular, the metastable η -pairing and charge-density-wave (CDW) states correspond to the gapless and gapful states of the XXZ model. The specific form of the wave function allows us to accurately determine the exponents of correlation functions. The form also suggests that the central charge of the η -pairing state is 3 and that of the CDW phase is 2, which we numerically confirm.

We thus address important paradigmatic cases of all electronic systems in strongly (low-density) and weakly (high-density) correlated regimes. We show that the high-density limit connects to recent, exactly solvable EDFT results. The low-density limit reveals an unnoticed and most unexpected result—density functionals for strictly correlated ground states can be reused directly for excited states. Nontrivial dependence on excitation structure only shows up at third leading order. Overall, our results provide foundations for effective models of excited states that interpolate between exact low- and high-density limits, which we illustrate on the cases of singlet-singlet excitations in H 2 and a ring of quantum wells.},

Physically, the mirror-stacked bilayer Hamiltonian can be decoupled into two independent subspaces of opposite mirror parities, each of which directly inherits the energy spectrum information and band topology of the original monolayer. By tuning the interlayer couplings, the topological bound state of one subspace can move into and out of the continuum of the other subspace continuously without hybridization. As representative examples, we construct one-dimensional first-order and two-dimensional higher-order TBICs, and demonstrate them unambiguously by acoustic experiments. Our findings will expand the research implications of both topological materials and BICs.},

  abstract     = {We propose and study a two-dimensional phase of shifted charge density waves (CDW), which is constructed from an array of weakly coupled 1D CDW wires whose phases shift from one wire to the next. We show that the fully gapped bulk CDW has topological properties, characterized by a nonzero Chern number, that imply edge modes within the bulk gap. Remarkably, these edge modes exhibit spectral pseudoflow as a function of position along the edge, and are thus dual to the chiral edge modes of Chern insulators with their spectral flow in momentum space. Furthermore, we show that the CDW edge modes are stable against interwire coupling. Our predictions can be tested experimentally in quasi-1D CDW compounds such as Ta 2 Se 8 I .},

Here, we tackle this challenge by exploring the initial stages of Cs + hydration on a Cu(111) surface by combining experiment and theory. Remarkably, we observe “inside-out” solvation of Cs + ions, i.e., their preferential location at the perimeter of the water clusters on the metal surface. In addition, water-Cs complexes containing multiple Cs + ions are observed to form at these surfaces. Established models based on maximum ion-water coordination and conventional solvation models cannot account for this situation, and the complex interplay of microscopic interactions is the key to a fundamental understanding.},

We report here on the demonstration of the squeezing of bosonic edge magnetoplasmon modes in a quantum Hall conductor whose characteristic impedance is set by the quantum of resistance ( R K ≈ 25 k Ω ), offering the possibility of an enhanced coupling to low-dimensional quantum conductors. By applying a combination of dc and ac drives to a quantum point contact, we demonstrate squeezing and observe a noise reduction 18\% below the vacuum fluctuations. This level of squeezing can be improved by using more complex conductors, such as ac driven quantum dots or mesoscopic capacitors.},

  abstract     = {A quasilinear plasma transport theory that incorporates Fokker-Planck dynamical friction (drag) and pitch angle scattering is self-consistently derived from first principles for an isolated, marginally unstable mode resonating with an energetic minority species. It is found that drag fundamentally changes the structure of the wave-particle resonance, breaking its symmetry and leading to the shifting and splitting of resonance lines. In contrast, scattering broadens the resonance in a symmetric fashion. Comparison with fully nonlinear simulations shows that the proposed quasilinear system preserves the exact instability saturation amplitude and the corresponding particle redistribution of the fully nonlinear theory. Even in situations in which drag leads to a relatively small resonance shift, it still underpins major changes in the redistribution of resonant particles. This novel influence of drag is equally important in plasmas and gravitational systems. In fusion plasmas, the effects are especially pronounced for fast-ion-driven instabilities in tokamaks with low aspect ratio or negative triangularity, as evidenced by past observations. The same theory directly maps to the resonant dynamics of the rotating galactic bar and massive bodies in its orbit, providing new techniques for analyzing galactic dynamics.},

This is achieved by using two laser pulses decoupling the wakefield generation from the electron trapping via ionization injection. The injection duration, which affects the beam charge and energy spread, is found to be tunable by adjusting the relative pulse delay. By changing the polarization of the injector pulse, reducing the ionization volume, the electron spectra of the accelerated electron bunches are improved.},

As a result, a spherical cavity devoid of electrons (called a “bubble”) and surrounded by a thin sheath made of expelled electrons is formed behind the driver. In contrast to the previous theoretical model [W. Lu et al. , Phys. Rev.

  abstract     = {Frequent observations to a quantum system modify its coherent evolution through the Zeno effect and Zeno dynamics. Generally, the measurement process destroys the evolution environment of the monitored system, making repeated observations remain a challenge. Here, using the quantum analogy experiments, we realize and engineer the Zeno effect and Zeno dynamics in optical waveguide arrays, where the optical modes correspond to distinct quantum states, and the temporal evolution is mapped into the spatial propagation. We propose a new, extensible experimental strategy for realizing an optical analog of stroboscopic measurements, which are performed by the build-in, on-demand segmented waveguide portions. The weak-to-strong stroboscopic measurements are realized, where the monitored system undergoes a transition from free evolution to optical Zeno freezing. Setting the measurements in the strong regime, the optical Zeno effect and optical Zeno dynamics are successfully generated, and their relationship is demonstrated in optics. We then propose a novel quantum Zeno slicing approach, which allows us to dynamically engineer the Hilbert space of the monitored system. This generic approach is verified by generating a series of Zeno subspaces with different measurement projectors, based on the quantum-optical analogy. The complexity of light dynamics is largely increased, providing full control of the propagation via steering Zeno dynamics. Our results pave the way for manipulation of quantum states by harnessing Zeno dynamics in integrated photonics.},

We demonstrate how this principle fails for non-Hermitian systems, by analyzing non-Hermitian continuous Hamiltonians with an imaginary momentum and Landau-type vector potential. The eigenstates, which we call “continuum Landau modes” (CLMs), have Gaussian spatial envelopes and form a continuum filling the complex energy plane. We present experimentally realizable 1D and 2D lattice models that host CLMs; the lattice eigenstates are localized and have other features matching the continuous model. One of these lattices can serve as a rainbow trap, whereby the response to an excitation is concentrated at a position proportional to the frequency. Another lattice can act a wave funnel, concentrating an input excitation onto a boundary over a wide frequency bandwidth. Unlike recent funneling schemes based on the non-Hermitian skin effect, this requires a simple lattice design with reciprocal couplings.},

A periodically kicked molecular rotor can be mapped onto a “crystalline” lattice in angular momentum space. This allows us to define quasimomenta and the band structure in the Floquet representation, by analogy with the Bloch waves of solid-state physics. Applying laser pulses spaced by 1 / 3 of the molecular rotational period creates a lattice with three atoms per unit cell with staggered hopping. Within the synthetic dimension of the laser strength, we discover Dirac cones with topological charges. These Dirac cones, topologically protected by reflection and time-reversal symmetry, are reminiscent of (although not equivalent to) that seen in graphene. They—and the corresponding edge states—are broadly tunable by adjusting the laser strength and can be observed in present-day experiments by measuring molecular alignment and populations of rotational levels. This paves the way to study controllable topological physics in gas-phase experiments with small molecules as well as to classify dynamical molecular states by their topological invariants.},

  abstract     = {This Letter examines the effectiveness of the Dyson-Schwinger (DS) equations as a calculational tool in quantum field theory. The DS equations are an infinite sequence of coupled equations that are satisfied exactly by the connected Green’s functions G n of the field theory. These equations link lower to higher Green’s functions and, if they are truncated, the resulting finite system of equations is underdetermined. The simplest way to solve the underdetermined system is to set all higher Green’s function(s) to zero and then to solve the resulting determined system for the first few Green’s functions. The G 1 or G 2 so obtained can be compared with exact results in solvable models to see if the accuracy improves for high-order truncations. Five D = 0 models are studied: Hermitian ϕ 4 and ϕ 6 and non-Hermitian i ϕ 3 , − ϕ 4 , and i ϕ 5 theories. The truncated DS equations give a sequence of approximants that converge slowly to a limiting value but this limiting value always differs from the exact value by a few percent. More sophisticated truncation schemes based on mean-field-like approximations do not fix this formidable calculational problem.},

  abstract     = {The study of the gravitational field produced by a spatially nonlocal, superposed quantum state of a massive particle is an interesting and active area of research. One outstanding issue is whether the gravitational field behaves like the classical superposition of the gravitational field of two particles separated by a spatial distance with half the mass at each position. Alternatively, does the gravitational field behave as a quantum superposition with a far more interesting and subtle behavior than a simple classical superposition? Quantum field theory is ideally suited to probe exactly this kind of question. We study the scattering of a massless scalar on a spatially nonlocal quantum superposition of a massive particle. We compute the differential scattering cross section corresponding to one-graviton exchange. We find that the scattering cross section disagrees with the Newton-Schrödinger picture of potential scattering from two localized sources with half the mass at each source. This suggests that experimental observation of gravitational scattering could inform the viability of the semiclassical treatment of the gravitational field, as in the Newton-Schrödinger description, vs the fully quantum mechanical treatment adopted here. We comment on the experimental feasibility of observing such effects in systems with many particles such as Bose-Einstein condensates.},

In this Letter, we introduce a method for this purpose based on performing a single joint measurement that can be implemented locally and whose marginals yield noisy (unsharp) versions of the target set of noncommuting Pauli observables. We derive bounds on the number of experimental repetitions required to estimate energies up to a certain precision. We compare this strategy to the classical shadow formalism and show that our method yields the same performance as the locally biased classical shadow protocol. We also highlight some general connections between the two approaches by showing that classical shadows can be used to construct joint measurements and vice versa. Finally, we adapt the joint measurement strategy to minimise the sample complexity when the implementation of measurements is assumed noisy. This can provide significant efficiency improvements compared to known generalizations of classical shadows to noisy scenarios.},

In the special case of collective systems with infinite-range interactions, both are triggered by excited-state quantum phase transitions. For quenches below the critical energy, the existence of an additional conserved charge, identifying the corresponding phase, allows for a nonzero value of the dynamical order parameter characterizing DPTs-I, and precludes the main mechanism giving rise to nonanalyticities in the return probability, trademark of DPTs-II. We propose a statistical ensemble describing the long-time averages of order parameters in DPTs-I, and provide a theoretical proof for the incompatibility of the main mechanism for DPTs-II with the presence of this additional conserved charge. Our results are numerically illustrated in the fully connected transverse-field Ising model, which exhibits both kinds of dynamical phase transitions. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our theory to systems with finite-range interactions, where the phenomenology of excited-state quantum phase transitions is absent.

In this framework, entanglement is clearly mediated by a quantum feature of the field.

Since nonlocality also has technological applications, e.g., for device-independent cryptography, it is useful to understand it as a resource and, in particular, whether and how different types of nonlocality can be interconverted. Here we focus on nonlocality distillation which involves using several copies of a nonlocal resource to generate one with more nonlocality. We introduce several distillation schemes which distill an extended part of the set of nonlocal correlations including quantum correlations. Our schemes are based on a natural set of operational procedures known as wirings that can be applied regardless of the underlying theory. Some are sequential algorithms that repeatedly use a two-copy protocol, while others are genuine three-copy distillation protocols. In some regions we prove that genuine three-copy protocols are strictly better than two-copy protocols. By applying our new protocols we also increase the region in which nonlocal correlations are known to give rise to trivial communication complexity. This brings us closer to an understanding of the sets of nonlocal correlations that can be recovered from information-theoretic principles, which, in turn, enhances our understanding of what is special about quantum theory.},

  abstract     = {Models of many-species ecosystems, such as the Lotka-Volterra and replicator equations, suggest that these systems generically exhibit near-extinction processes, where population sizes go very close to zero for some time before rebounding, accompanied by a slowdown of the dynamics (aging). Here, we investigate the connection between near-extinction and aging by introducing an exactly solvable many-variable model, where the time derivative of each population size vanishes at both zero and some finite maximal size. We show that aging emerges generically when random interactions are taken between populations. Population sizes remain exponentially close (in time) to the absorbing values for extended periods of time, with rapid transitions between these two values. The mechanism for aging is different from the one at play in usual glassy systems: At long times, the system evolves in the vicinity of unstable fixed points rather than marginal ones.},

Nucleation in nonequilibrium systems is much harder to describe because there is no free energy, but instead a dynamics-dependent quasipotential that typically must be found numerically. Here we extend CNT to a class of active phase-separating systems governed by a minimal field-theoretic model (Active Model B + ). In the small noise and supersaturation limits that CNT assumes, we compute analytically the quasipotential, and hence, nucleation barrier, for liquid-vapor phase separation. Crucial to our results, detailed balance, although broken microscopically by activity, is restored along the instanton trajectory, which in CNT involves the nuclear radius as the sole reaction coordinate.},

Cleaning and baking samples fully resets charging magnitude and direction, which indicates the underlying global parameter is not intrinsic to the material, but acquired from its history. Charging behavior is randomly and irreversibly affected by changes in relative humidity, hinting at a mechanism where adsorbates, in particular, water, are fundamental to the charge-transfer process.},

Shear deformation leads to strong acceleration in the structural relaxation, the Debye relaxation, and the terminal relaxation of 2E1H. Moreover, the shear-induced reduction in structural relaxation time, τ α , scales quadratically with that of Debye time, τ D , and the terminal flow time, τ f , suggesting a relationship of τ D 2 ∼ τ α . Further analyses reveal τ D 2 / τ α of 2E1H follows Arrhenius temperature dependence that applies remarkably well to many other monohydroxy alcohols with different molecular sizes, architectures, and alcohol types. These results cannot be understood by the prevailing transient chain model, and suggest a H-bonding breakage facilitated sub-supramolecular reorientation as the origin of Debye relaxation of monohydroxy alcohols, akin to the molecular mechanism for the terminal relaxation of unentangled “living” polymers.},

Although deterministic chaos due to the quenched disorder of the synaptic couplings underlies this seemingly stochastic dynamics, an effective theory for the network dynamics of a finite assembly of spiking neurons is lacking. Here, we fill this gap by extending the so-called population density approach including an activity- and size-dependent stochastic source in the Fokker-Planck equation for the membrane potential density. The finite-size noise embedded in this stochastic partial derivative equation is analytically characterized leading to a self-consistent and nonperturbative description of ν ( t ) valid for a wide class of spiking neuron networks. Power spectra of ν ( t ) are found in excellent agreement with those from detailed simulations both in the linear regime and across a synchronization phase transition, when a size-dependent smearing of the critical dynamics emerges.},

However, the application of the Casimir effect to spintronics has not yet been investigated enough, particularly to ferrimagnetic thin films, although yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is one of the best platforms for spintronics. Here we fill this gap. Using the lattice field theory, we investigate the Casimir effect induced by quantum fields for magnons in insulating magnets and find that the magnonic Casimir effect can arise not only in antiferromagnets but also in ferrimagnets including YIG thin films. Our result suggests that YIG, the key ingredient of magnon-based spintronics, can serve also as a promising platform for manipulating and utilizing Casimir effects, called Casimir engineering. Microfabrication technology can control the thickness of thin films and realize the manipulation of the magnonic Casimir effect. Thus, we pave the way for magnonic Casimir engineering.},

From comparison to tight-binding modeling, we find that the strain is accommodated predominantly by bond-length changes rather than modifications of octahedral tilt and rotation angles. Our study sheds new light on the nature of structural distortions at oxide surfaces, and how targeted control of these can be used to tune density of state singularities to the Fermi level, in turn paving the way to the possible realization of rich collective states at the Sr 2 RuO 4 surface.},

  abstract     = {We show that the topology of the Fermi sea of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is reflected in the ballistic Landauer transport along a long and narrow Josephson π junction that proximitizes the 2DEG. The low-energy Andreev states bound to the junction are shown to exhibit a dispersion that is sensitive to the Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea ( χ F ). We highlight two important relations: one connects the electron or hole nature of Andreev states to the convex or concave nature of Fermi surface critical points, and one relates these critical points to χ F . We then argue that the transport of Andreev states leads to a quantized conductance that probes χ F . An experiment is proposed to measure this effect, from which we predict an I − V characteristic that not only captures the topology of the Fermi sea in metals, but also resembles the rectification effect in diodes. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of measuring this quantized response in graphene, InAs and HgTe 2DEGs.},

A closing and reopening of a gap was observed in both the local and nonlocal tunneling spectra as a function of magnetic field. For particular tunings of junction density, gap reopenings were accompanied by zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in local conductances. End-to-end correlation of gap reopening was strong, while correlation of local ZBCPs was weak. A model of the device, with disorder treated phenomenologically, shows comparable conductance matrix behavior associated with a topological phase transition.

  abstract     = {We report on charge state measurements of laser-accelerated carbon ions in the energy range of several MeV penetrating a dense partially ionized plasma. The plasma was generated by irradiation of a foam target with laser-induced hohlraum radiation in the soft x-ray regime. We use the tricellulose acetate ( C 9 H 16 O 8 ) foam of 2 mg / cm 3 density and 1 mm interaction length as target material. This kind of plasma is advantageous for high-precision measurements, due to good uniformity and long lifetime compared to the ion pulse length and the interaction duration. We diagnose the plasma parameters to be T e = 17 eV and n e = 4 × 10 20 cm − 3 . We observe the average charge states passing through the plasma to be higher than those predicted by the commonly used semiempirical formula. Through solving the rate equations, we attribute the enhancement to the target density effects, which will increase the ionization rates on one hand and reduce the electron capture rates on the other hand. The underlying physics is actually the balancing of the lifetime of excited states versus the collisional frequency. In previous measurement with partially ionized plasma from gas discharge and z pinch to laser direct irradiation, no target density effects were ever demonstrated. For the first time, we are able to experimentally prove that target density effects start to play a significant role in plasma near the critical density of Nd-glass laser radiation. The finding is important for heavy ion beam driven high-energy-density physics and fast ignitions. The method provides a new approach to precisely address the beam-plasma interaction issues with high-intensity short-pulse lasers in dense plasma regimes.},

Advances in dispersion-engineered high- Q microresonators allow for generating signal waves far from the pump and decrease the oscillation power threshold to submilliwatt levels. However, the pump-to-signal conversion efficiency and absolute signal power are low, fundamentally limited by parasitic mode competition and attainable cavity intrinsic Q to coupling Q ratio, i.e., Q i / Q c . Here, we use Friedrich-Wintgen bound states in the continuum (BICs) to overcome the physical challenges in an integrated microresonator-waveguide system. As a result, on-chip coherent hyperparametric oscillation is generated in BICs with unprecedented conversion efficiency and absolute signal power. This work not only opens a path to generate high-power and efficient continuous-wave electromagnetic radiation in Kerr nonlinear media but also enhances the understanding of a microresonator-waveguide system—an elementary unit of modern photonics.},

This is achieved by using a surface that is transparent to the trapping light but reflective to infrared radiation, with a reflectivity that can be time modulated. This dipole-dipole interaction relies on the thermal radiation emitted by a silica nanoparticle having sufficient temporal coherence to correlate the reflected radiation with the thermal fluctuations of the dipole. The resulting force is orders of magnitude stronger than the thermal gradient force, and it strongly depends on the internal temperature of the nanoparticle for a particle-to-surface distance greater than two micrometers. We argue that it is experimentally feasible to use displacement sensing of a levitated nanoparticle in front of a surface as an internal thermometer in ultrahigh vacuum. Experimental access to the internal physics of a levitated nanoparticle in vacuum is crucial to understanding the limitations that decoherence poses to current efforts devoted to preparing a nanoparticle in a macroscopic quantum superposition state.},

We have measured the resonance energies and strengths of the low-energy resonances in O 18 ( α , γ ) Ne 22 at the Jinping Underground Nuclear Astrophysics experimental facility (JUNA) with improved precision. The key 470 keV resonance energy has been measured to be E α = 474.0 ± 1.1 keV , with such high precision achieved for the first time. The spin-parity of this resonance state is determined to be 1 − , removing discrepancies in the resonance strengths in earlier studies. The results significantly improve the precision of the O 18 ( α , γ ) Ne 22 reaction rates by up to about 10 times compared with the previous data at typical AGB temperatures of 0.1–0.3 GK.

The nucleon energy correlators complement the conventional nucleon or nucleus tomography, but without introducing the nonperturbative fragmentation functions or the jet clustering algorithms. We demonstrate how the nucleon energy correlators can be measured in the lepton-nucleon deep inelastic scattering. The predicted distributions display a fascinating phase transition between the perturbative and nonperturbative regime. In the perturbative phase, a polar angle version of the Bjorken scaling behavior is predicted. We discuss its possible applications and expect it to aggrandize the physics content at the electron ion colliders with a far-forward detector.},

This behavior is in stark contrast to previous conjectural accounts in the literature. Together with the finite terms we observe that for up to three loops the logarithm of the Sudakov form factor is identical to twice the logarithm of the null octagon O 0 , which was recently introduced within the context of integrability-based approaches to four point correlation functions with infinitely large R charges. The null octagon O 0 is known in a closed form for all values of the ’t Hooft coupling constant and kinematical parameters. We conjecture that the relation between O 0 and the off shell Sudakov form factor will hold to all loop orders.},

For the continuum, the BF bound states that on Anti–de Sitter spaces, fluctuation modes remain stable for small negative mass squared m 2 . This follows from a real and positive total energy of the gravitational system. For finite cutoff ϵ , we solve the Klein-Gordon equation numerically on regular hyperbolic tilings. When ϵ → 0 , we find that the continuum BF bound is approached in a manner independent of the tiling. We confirm these results via simulations of a hyperbolic electric circuit. Moreover, we propose a novel circuit including active elements that allows us to further scan values of m 2 above the BF bound.},

These defects are unique in their softness and origin; as they appear at a very low energy scale, they only require standard model particle content, and they differ fundamentally depending on the Majorana or Dirac nature of the neutrinos. One of the observational signatures is the time dependence and space dependence of the neutrino mass matrix, which could be observable in future neutrino experiments. Already existing data rule out parts of the parameter space in the Majorana case. The detection of this effect could shed light onto the open question of the Dirac versus Majorana neutrino nature.},

  abstract     = {During the final stages of black hole evaporation, ultraviolet deviations from general relativity eventually become dramatic, potentially affecting the end state. We explore this problem by performing nonlinear simulations of wave packets in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, the only gravity theory with quadratic curvature terms which can be studied at a fully nonperturbative level. Black holes in this theory have a minimum mass but also a nonvanishing temperature. This poses a puzzle concerning the final fate of Hawking evaporation in the presence of high-curvature nonperturbative effects. By simulating the mass loss induced by evaporation at the classical level using an auxiliary phantom field, we study the nonlinear evolution of black holes past the minimum mass. We observe a runaway shrink of the horizon (a nonperturbative effect forbidden in general relativity) which eventually unveils a high-curvature elliptic region. While this might hint to the formation of a naked singularity (and hence to a violation of the weak cosmic censorship) or of a pathological spacetime region, a different numerical formulation of the initial-value problem in this theory might be required to rule out other possibilities, including the transition from the critical black hole to a stable horizonless remnant. Our Letter is relevant in the context of the information-loss paradox, dark-matter remnants, and for constraints on microscopic primordial black holes.},

Here, we present the first results of gravitational wave simulation with the realistic EOS that is consistent with ab initio approaches of χ EFT and pQCD and is assumed to go through smooth crossover. We compare them to results obtained with another EOS with a first-order hadron-quark phase transition. Our results suggest that early collapse to a black hole in the post-merger stage after NS merger robustly signifies softening of the EOS associated with the QM onset in the crossover scenario. The nature of the hadron-quark phase transition can be further constrained by the condition that electromagnetic counterparts should be energized by the material left outside the remnant black hole.},

We point out that the general relativity amplitudes due to tidal effects originate entirely from the BH potential region. Thus, they can be separated from gravitational nonlinearities in the wave region, whose proper treatment requires higher order effective field theory loop calculations. In particular, the elastic scattering in the near field approximation is produced exclusively by tidal effects. We find this contribution to vanish identically, which implies that the static Love numbers of Kerr BHs are zero for all types of perturbations. We also reproduce the known behavior of scalar Love numbers for higher-dimensional BHs. Our results are manifestly gauge invariant and coordinate independent, thereby providing a valuable consistency check for the commonly used off-shell methods.},

Based on predictions derived from analytic calculations of the corresponding quantum Fisher information, we then introduce a protocol which overcomes the Heisenberg scaling (and limit) with the help of a tailored excited and entangled many-body state of a noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate.

  abstract     = {Quantum state tomography is the procedure for reconstructing unknown quantum states from a series of measurements of different observables. Depending on the physical system, different sets of observables have been used for this procedure. In the case of spin qubits, the most common procedure is to measure the transverse magnetization of the system as a function of time. Here, we present a different scheme that relies on time-independent observables and therefore does not require measurements at different evolution times, thereby greatly reducing the overall measurement time. To recover the full density matrix, we use a set of unitary operations that transform the density operator elements into the directly measurable observable. We demonstrate the performance of this scheme in the electron-nuclear spin system of the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computers promise to dramatically outperform their classical counterparts. However, the nonclassical resources enabling such computational advantages are challenging to pinpoint, as it is not a single resource but the subtle interplay of many that can be held responsible for these potential advantages. In this Letter, we show that every bosonic quantum computation can be recast into a continuous-variable sampling computation where all computational resources are contained in the input state. Using this reduction, we derive a general classical algorithm for the strong simulation of bosonic computations, whose complexity scales with the non-Gaussian stellar rank of both the input state and the measurement setup. We further study the conditions for an efficient classical simulation of the associated continuous-variable sampling computations and identify an operational notion of non-Gaussian entanglement based on the lack of passive separability, thus clarifying the interplay of bosonic quantum computational resources such as squeezing, non-Gaussianity, and entanglement.},

When a two-particle quantum state is not pure, standard methods to measure the entanglement require detection of both particles. We realize a conceptually new method for verifying and measuring entanglement in a class of two-part (bipartite) mixed states. Contrary to the approaches known to date, in our experiment we verify and measure entanglement in mixed quantum bipartite states by detecting only one subsystem, the other remains undetected. Only one copy of the mixed or pure state is used but that state is in a superposition of having been created in two identical sources. We show that information shared in entangled systems can be accessed through single-particle interference patterns. Our experiment enables entanglement characterization even when one of the subsystems cannot be detected, for example, when suitable detectors are not available.},

  abstract     = {The study of nonlocality in scenarios that depart from the bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen setup is allowing one to uncover many fundamental features of quantum mechanics. Recently, an approach to building network-local models based on machine learning led to the conjecture that the family of quantum triangle distributions of [Renou et al ., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123 , 140401 (2019) ] did not admit triangle-local models in a larger range than the original proof. We prove part of this conjecture in the affirmative. Our approach consists of reducing the family of original, four-outcome distributions to families of binary-outcome ones, and then using the inflation technique to prove that these families of binary-outcome distributions do not admit triangle-local models. This constitutes the first successful use of inflation in a proof of quantum nonlocality in networks for distributions whose nonlocality could not be proved with alternative methods. Moreover, we provide a method to extend proofs of network nonlocality in concrete distributions of a parametrized family to continuous ranges of the parameter. In the process, we produce a large collection of network Bell inequalities for the triangle scenario with binary outcomes, which are of independent interest.},

The effects of such nonaffine deformation have been shown to be much stronger than for flexible polymers. To date, our understanding of nonaffinity in such systems is limited to simulations or specific 2D models of athermal fibers. Here, we present an effective medium theory for nonaffine deformation of semiflexible polymer and fiber networks, which is general to both 2D and 3D and in both thermal and athermal limits. The predictions of this model are in good agreement with both prior computational and experimental results for linear elasticity. Moreover, the framework we introduce can be extended to address nonlinear elasticity and network dynamics.},

Here, we present a counterintuitive concept to achieve time reversal of waves propagating in a lossless medium using a transitory dissipation pulse. Applying a sudden and strong damping in a limited time generates a time-reversed wave. In the limit of a high damping shock, this amounts to “freezing” the initial wave by maintaining the wave amplitude while canceling its time derivative. The initial wave then splits in two counterpropagating waves with half of its amplitude and time evolutions in opposite directions. We implement this damping-based time reversal using phonon waves propagating in a lattice of interacting magnets placed on an air cushion. We show with computer simulations that this concept also applies to broadband time reversal in complex disordered systems.},

This establishes the TUR as an inherent property of overdamped stochastic equations of motion. In addition, we extend the transient TUR to currents and densities with explicit time dependence. By including current-density correlations we, moreover, derive a new sharpened TUR for transient dynamics. Our arguably simplest and most direct proof, together with the new generalizations, allows us to systematically determine conditions under which the different TURs saturate and thus allows for a more accurate thermodynamic inference. Finally, we outline the direct proof also for Markov jump dynamics.},

The switching probability distributions are shown to be consistent with a small shunt capacitance and moderate damping, resulting in a switching current which is a small fraction of the critical current. Phase locking between two JJs leads to a difference in switching current between that of a JJ measured in isolation and that of the same JJ measured in an asymmetric SQUID loop.

The exceptional mobilities are explained by several basic physical features; particularly, we find a new feature: carrier-lattice distance, which is easy to calculate and correlates well with mobility.

At zero field, a transition to long-range order occurs at 1.38 K, caused by a weak intrinsic easy-plane anisotropy and an interlayer exchange of J ′ / k B ≈ 1 mK . Because of the moderate intralayer exchange coupling of J / k B = 6.8 K , the application of laboratory magnetic fields induces a substantial X Y anisotropy of the spin correlations. Crucially, this provides a significant BKT regime, as the tiny interlayer exchange J ′ only induces 3D correlations upon close approach to the BKT transition with its exponential growth in the spin-correlation length. We employ nuclear magnetic resonance measurements to probe the spin correlations that determine the critical temperatures of the BKT transition as well as that of the onset of long-range order. Further, we perform stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on the experimentally determined model parameters. Finite-size scaling of the in-plane spin stiffness yields excellent agreement of critical temperatures between theory and experiment, providing clear evidence that the nonmonotonic magnetic phase diagram of [ Cu ( pz ) 2 ( 2 − HOpy ) 2 ] ( PF 6 ) 2 is determined by the field-tuned X Y anisotropy and the concomitant BKT physics.},

Systematic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm the magnonic origin of the USMR. The appearance of AFM-USMR is driven by the imbalance of creation and annihilation of AFM magnons by spin orbit torque due to the thermal random field. However, unlike its ferromagnetic counterpart, theoretical modeling reveals that the USMR in Pt / α − Fe 2 O 3 is determined by the antiferromagtic magnon number with a non-monotonic field dependence. Our findings extend the generality of the USMR which pave the ways for the highly sensitive detection of AFM spin state.},

The correction is nonsingular and is distinctively weaker than, for example, the log-squared correction obtained when disordered electrons couple to diffusive spin fluctuations near a Hertz-Millis transition. The possibility of verifying this prediction in an S = 1 / 2 easy-plane ferromagnetic insulator K 2 CuF 4 under an external magnetic field is proposed.

  abstract     = {Conventional approaches for lattice dynamics based on static interatomic forces do not fully account for the effects of time-reversal-symmetry breaking in magnetic systems. Recent approaches to rectify this involve incorporating the first-order change in forces with atomic velocities under the assumption of adiabatic separation of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. In this Letter, we develop a first-principles method to calculate this velocity-force coupling in extended solids and show via the example of ferromagnetic CrI 3 that, due to the slow dynamics of the spins in the system, the assumption of adiabatic separation can result in large errors for splittings of zone-center chiral modes. We demonstrate that an accurate description of the lattice dynamics requires treating magnons and phonons on the same footing.},

  abstract     = {The spatial extent of excitons in molecular systems underpins their photophysics and utility for optoelectronic applications. Phonons are reported to lead to both exciton localization and delocalization. However, a microscopic understanding of phonon-induced (de)localization is lacking, in particular, how localized states form, the role of specific vibrations, and the relative importance of quantum and thermal nuclear fluctuations. Here, we present a first-principles study of these phenomena in solid pentacene, a prototypical molecular crystal, capturing the formation of bound excitons, exciton-phonon coupling to all orders, and phonon anharmonicity, using density functional theory, the ab initio G W -Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, finite-difference, and path integral techniques. We find that for pentacene zero-point nuclear motion causes uniformly strong localization, with thermal motion providing additional localization only for Wannier-Mott-like excitons. Anharmonic effects drive temperature-dependent localization, and, while such effects prevent the emergence of highly delocalized excitons, we explore the conditions under which these might be realized.},

  abstract     = {In quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators, the interior is insulating but electrons can travel with zero resistance along one-dimensional (1D) conducting paths known as chiral edge channels (CECs). These CECs have been predicted to be confined to the 1D edges and exponentially decay in the two-dimensional (2D) bulk. In this Letter, we present the results of a systematic study of QAH devices fashioned in a Hall bar geometry of different widths under gate voltages. At the charge neutral point, the QAH effect persists in a Hall bar device with a width of only ∼ 7 2 nm , implying the intrinsic decaying length of CECs is less than ∼ 3 6 nm . In the electron-doped regime, we find that the Hall resistance deviates quickly from the quantized value when the sample width is less than 1 μ m . Our theoretical calculations suggest that the wave function of CEC first decays exponentially and then shows a long tail due to disorder-induced bulk states. Therefore, the deviation from the quantized Hall resistance in narrow QAH samples originates from the interaction between two opposite CECs mediated by disorder-induced bulk states in QAH insulators, consistent with our experimental observations.},

In this Letter, we calculate from first principles the energy conversion associated with all higher moments of the phase space density for systems not in LTE. Particle-in-cell simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection reveal that energy conversion associated with higher-order moments can be locally significant.

An analytic solution for a 1D nonlinear plasma wake with an electron beam driver indicates that, even though the plasma density decreases, the frequency shift reaches no asymptotic limit, i.e., is unlimited provided the wake can be sustained. In fully self-consistent 1D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, more than 40 times frequency shifts were demonstrated. In quasi-3D PIC simulations, frequency shifts up to 10 times were observed, limited only by simulation resolution and nonoptimized driver evolution. The pulse energy increases in this process, by a factor of 5, and the pulse is guided and temporally compressed by group velocity dispersion, resulting in the resulting extreme ultraviolet laser pulse having near-relativistic ( a 0 ∼ 0.4 ) intensity.},

Here, we find that electro-osmotic flow can occur in electrically neutral nanochannels in the absence of definable electric double layers through extensive molecular dynamics simulations. An applied electric field is shown to cause an intrinsic channel selectivity between cations and anions, by reorienting the hydration shells of these confined ions. The ion selectivity then results in a net charge density in the channel that induces the unconventional electro-osmotic flow. The flow direction is amenable to manipulation by the field strength and the channel size, which will inform ongoing efforts to develop highly integrated nanofluidic systems capable of complex flow control.},

Since transverse photons couple to the electronic current, the appearance of non-Fermi-Liquid behavior strongly depends on the lattice. In particular, we find that in a square lattice the phase space for electron-photon scattering is reduced in such a way to preserve the quasiparticles, while in a honeycomb lattice the latter are removed due to a nonanalytical frequency dependence of the damping ∝ | ω | 2 / 3 . Standard cavity probes could allow us to measure the characteristic frequency spectrum of the overdamped critical electromagnetic modes responsible for the non-Fermi-liquid behavior.},

In contrast to nonresonant excitation, slow relaxation of charge carriers is avoided, which allows us to measure directly the radiative lifetime of the lowest energy exciton states.

Here, we present an approach that solves both problems at once. By exploiting the information stored in a time-dependent scattering matrix, we introduce a formalism enabling the identification of spatially modulated wavefronts, which simultaneously cool down multiple objects of arbitrary shapes. An experimental implementation is suggested based on stroboscopic scattering-matrix measurements and time-adaptive injections of modulated light fields.},

The spatial evolution was not previously accessible to experimental investigations at the attosecond timescale. A phase-resolved two-electron-angular-streaking method is developed to image the shape of the hole density of an ultrafast spin-orbit wave packet in the krypton cation. Furthermore, the motion of an even faster wave packet in the xenon cation is captured for the first time: An electronic hole is refilled 1.2 fs after it is produced, and the hole filling is observed on the opposite side where the hole is born.},

  abstract     = {Strong-field ionization of molecules releases electrons which can be accelerated and driven back to recombine with their parent ion, emitting high-order harmonics. This ionization also initiates attosecond electronic and vibrational dynamics in the ion, evolving during the electron travel in the continuum. Revealing this subcycle dynamics from the emitted radiation usually requires advanced theoretical modeling. We show that this can be avoided by resolving the emission from two families of electronic quantum paths in the generation process. The corresponding electrons have the same kinetic energy, and thus the same structural sensitivity, but differ by the travel time between ionization and recombination—the pump-probe delay in this attosecond self-probing scheme. We measure the harmonic amplitude and phase in aligned CO 2 and N 2 molecules and observe a strong influence of laser-induced dynamics on two characteristic spectroscopic features: a shape resonance and multichannel interference. This quantum-path-resolved spectroscopy thus opens wide prospects for the investigation of ultrafast ionic dynamics, such as charge migration.},

Cumulant ratios of net-proton (taken as proxy for net-baryon) distributions generally follow the hierarchy expected from QCD thermodynamics, except for the case of collisions at 3 GeV. The measured values of C 6 / C 2 for 0\%–40\% centrality collisions show progressively negative trend with decreasing energy, while it is positive for the lowest energy studied. These observed negative signs are consistent with QCD calculations (for baryon chemical potential, μ B ≤ 110 MeV ) which contains the crossover transition range. In addition, for energies above 7.7 GeV, the measured proton κ n , within uncertainties, does not support the two-component ( Poisson + binomial ) shape of proton number distributions that would be expected from a first-order phase transition. Taken in combination, the hyperorder proton number fluctuations suggest that the structure of QCD matter at high baryon density, μ B ∼ 750 MeV at s N N = 3 GeV is starkly different from those at vanishing μ B ∼ 24 MeV at s N N = 200 GeV and higher collision energies.},

After, by taking advantage of the underlying color structure, we define a consistent sewing procedure to iteratively compute the one-loop integrands. When gauge symmetries are involved, the whole procedure is extended to multiparticle solutions involving ghosts, which can then be accounted for in the full loop computation. Since the required input here is equations of motion and gauge symmetry, our framework naturally extends to one-loop computations in certain non-Lagrangian field theories.},

However, the silica film suffers from the cryogenic mechanical loss peak, hindering its application for the next generation detector operated at cryogenics. New low refractive index materials need to be explored. We study amorphous silicon oxy-nitride (SiON) films deposited using the method of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. By changing the N 2 O / SiH 4 flow rate ratio, we can tune the refractive index of the SiON smoothly from nitridelike to silicalike of ∼ 1.48 at 1064 nm, 1550 nm, and 1950 nm. Thermal anneal reduced the refractive index down to ∼ 1.46 and effectively reduced the absorption and cryogenic mechanical loss; the reductions correlated with the N ─ H bond concentration decrease. Extinction coefficients of the SiONs at the three wavelengths are reduced down to 5 × 10 − 6 ∼ 3 × 10 − 7 by annealing. Cryogenic mechanical losses at 10 K and 20 K (for ET and KAGRA) of the annealed SiONs are significantly lower than the annealed ion beam sputter silica. They are comparable at 120 K (for LIGO-Voyager). Absorption from the vibrational modes of the N ─ H terminal-hydride structures dominates over the absorption from other terminal hydrides, the Urbach tail, and the silicon dangling bond states in SiON at the three wavelengths.},

Focusing on the strain’s ( ℓ , m ) = ( 4 , 4 ) angular harmonic, we show the presence of a quadratic effect across a range of binary BH mass ratios that agrees with theoretical expectations. We find that the quadratic ( 4 , 4 ) mode’s amplitude exhibits quadratic scaling with the fundamental ( 2 , 2 ) mode—its parent mode. The nonlinear mode’s amplitude is comparable to or even larger than that of the linear ( 4 , 4 ) mode.

Their roles in thermodynamic order evolution keep being the frontier of modern condensed matter physics. Here, we study the generations of topological defects and their guidance on the order evolution during the phase transition of liquid crystals (LCs). With a given preset photopatterned alignment, two different types of topological defects are achieved depending on the thermodynamic process. Because of the memory effect of LC director field across the Nematic-Smectic ( N − S ) phase transition, a stable array of toric focal conic domains (TFCDs) and a frustrated one are generated in S phase, respectively. The frustrated one transfers to a metastable TFCD array with a smaller lattice constant, and further changes to a crossed-walls type N state due to the inheritance of orientational order. A free energy on temperature diagram and corresponding textures vividly describe the phase transition process and the roles of topological defects in the order evolution across the N − S phase transition. This Letter reveals the behaviors and mechanisms of topological defects on order evolution during phase transitions. It paves a way for investigating topological defect guided order evolution which is ubiquitous in soft matter and other ordered systems.},

  abstract     = {Adsorption of carbon monoxide (CO) on transition-metal surfaces is a prototypical process in surface sciences and catalysis. Despite its simplicity, it has posed great challenges to theoretical modeling. Pretty much all existing density functionals fail to accurately describe surface energies and CO adsorption site preference as well as adsorption energies simultaneously. Although the random phase approximation (RPA) cures these density functional theory failures, its large computational cost makes it prohibitive to study the CO adsorption for any but the simplest ordered cases. Here, we address these challenges by developing a machine-learned force field (MLFF) with near RPA accuracy for the prediction of coverage-dependent adsorption of CO on the Rh(111) surface through an efficient on-the-fly active learning procedure and a Δ -machine learning approach. We show that the RPA-derived MLFF is capable to accurately predict the Rh(111) surface energy and CO adsorption site preference as well as adsorption energies at different coverages that are all in good agreement with experiments. Moreover, the coverage-dependent ground-state adsorption patterns and adsorption saturation coverage are identified.},

  abstract     = {Nonradiative wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has made considerable progress with the application of the parity-time (PT) symmetry concept. In this Letter, we extend the standard second-order PT-symmetric Hamiltonian to a high-order symmetric tridiagonal pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian, relaxing the limitation of multisource/multiload systems based on non-Hermitian physics. We propose a three-mode pseudo-Hermitian dual-transmitter-single-receiver circuit and demonstrate that robust efficiency and stable frequency WPT can be attained despite the absence of PT symmetry. In addition, no active tuning is required when the coupling coefficient between the intermediate transmitter and the receiver is changed. The application of pseudo-Hermitian theory to classical circuit systems opens up an avenue for expanding the application of coupled multicoil systems.},

We show how latent symmetries can be leveraged for continuous wave setups in the form of acoustic networks. These are systematically designed to possess latent-symmetry induced pointwise amplitude parity between selected waveguide junctions for all low frequency eigenmodes. We develop a modular principle to interconnect latently symmetric networks to feature multiple latently symmetric junction pairs. By connecting such networks to a mirror symmetric subsystem, we design asymmetric setups featuring eigenmodes with domain-wise parity. Bridging the gap between discrete and continuous models, our work takes a pivotal step towards exploiting hidden geometrical symmetries in realistic wave setups.},

Displacement parallel to the walls is Brownian as characterized by its variance, but it is non-Gaussian having a nonzero fourth cumulant. Establishing a link with Taylor dispersion, we calculate the fourth cumulant and the tails of the displacement distribution for general diffusivity tensors along with potentials generated by either the walls or externally, for instance, gravity. Experimental and numerical studies of the motion of a colloid in the direction parallel to the wall give measured fourth cumulants which are correctly predicted by our theory. Interestingly, contrary to models of Brownian-yet-non-Gaussian diffusion, the tails of the displacement distribution are shown to be Gaussian rather than exponential. All together, our results provide additional tests and constraints for the inference of force maps and local transport properties near surfaces.},

While conventional transistors are point-type (lumped-element) devices, it may be interesting to realize a distributed transistor-type optical response in a bulk material. Here, we show that low-symmetry two-dimensional metallic systems may be the ideal solution to implement such a distributed-transistor response. To this end, we use the semiclassical Boltzmann equation approach to characterize the optical conductivity of a two-dimensional material under a static electric bias. Similar to the nonlinear Hall effect, the linear electro-optic (EO) response depends on the Berry curvature dipole and can lead to nonreciprocal optical interactions. Most interestingly, our analysis uncovers a novel non-Hermitian linear EO effect that can lead to optical gain and to a distributed transistor response. We study a possible realization based on strained bilayer graphene. Our analysis reveals that the optical gain for incident light transmitted through the biased system depends on the light polarization, and can be quite large, especially for multilayer configurations.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnetic materials feature intrinsic ultrafast spin dynamics, making them ideal candidates for future magnonic devices operating at THz frequencies. A major focus of current research is the investigation of optical methods for the efficient generation of coherent magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators. In magnetic lattices endowed with orbital angular momentum, spin-orbit coupling enables spin dynamics through the resonant excitation of low-energy electric dipoles such as phonons and orbital resonances which interact with spins. However, in magnetic systems with zero orbital angular momentum, microscopic pathways for the resonant and low-energy optical excitation of coherent spin dynamics are lacking. Here, we consider experimentally the relative merits of electronic and vibrational excitations for the optical control of zero orbital angular momentum magnets, focusing on a limit case: the antiferromagnet manganese phosphorous trisulfide ( MnPS 3 ), constituted by orbital singlet Mn 2 + ions. We study the correlation of spins with two types of excitations within its band gap: a bound electron orbital excitation from the singlet orbital ground state of Mn 2 + into an orbital triplet state, which causes coherent spin precession, and a vibrational excitation of the crystal field that causes thermal spin disorder. Our findings cast orbital transitions as key targets for magnetic control in insulators constituted by magnetic centers of zero orbital angular momentum.},

We discuss the necessary symmetry requirements and identify possible experimental realizations in candidate pyrochlore materials. In this context, the axions couple to both the external and the emergent electromagnetic fields. We show that the interaction between the axion and the emergent photon leads to a characteristic dynamical response, which can be measured experimentally in inelastic neutron scattering.

  abstract     = {Dirac fermion systems form a unique Landau level at the Fermi level—the so-called zero mode—whose observation itself will provide strong evidence of the presence of Dirac dispersions. Here, we report the study of semimetallic black phosphorus under pressure by P 31 -nuclear magnetic resonance measurements in a wide range of magnetic field up to 24.0 T. We have found a field-induced giant enhancement of 1 / T 1 T , where 1 / T 1 is the nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate: 1 / T 1 T at 24.0 T reaches more than 20 times larger than that at 2.0 T. The increase in 1 / T 1 T above 6.5 T is approximately proportional to the squared field, implying a linear relationship between the density of states and the field. We also found that, while 1 / T 1 T at a constant field is independent of temperature in the low-temperature region, it steeply increases with temperature above 100 K. All these phenomena are well explained by considering the effect of Landau quantization on three-dimensional Dirac fermions. The present study demonstrates that 1 / T 1 is an excellent quantity to probe the zero-mode Landau level and to identify the dimensionality of the Dirac fermion system.},

Here, we report the quasiparticle scattering spectroscopy of the quantum critical superconductor CeCoIn 5 , where a pseudogap with energy Δ g was manifested as a dip in the differential conductance ( d I / d V ) below the characteristic temperature of T g . When subjected to external pressure, T g and Δ g gradually increase, following the trend of increase in quantum entangled hybridization between the Ce 4 f moment and conduction electrons. On the other hand, the superconducting (SC) energy gap and its phase transition temperature shows a maximum, revealing a dome shape under pressure. The disparate dependence on pressure between the two quantum states shows that the pseudogap is less likely involved in the formation of SC Cooper pairs, but rather is controlled by Kondo hybridization, indicating that a novel type of pseudogap is realized in CeCoIn 5 .},

We investigate transmission of edge states through quantum point contacts fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure designed to have a sharp confining potential. When a small but finite bias is applied, we observe an intermediate conductance plateau with G = 0.5 ( e 2 / h ) . This plateau is observed in multiple QPCs, and persists over a significant range of magnetic field, gate voltage, and source-drain bias, making it a robust feature. Using a simple model that considers scattering and equilibration between counterflowing charged edge modes, we find this half-integer quantized plateau to be consistent with full reflection of an inner counterpropagating − 1 / 3 edge mode while the outer integer mode is fully transmitted. In a QPC fabricated on a different heterostructure which has a softer confining potential, we instead observe an intermediate conductance plateau at G = ( 1 / 3 ) ( e 2 / h ) . These results provide support for a model at ν = 2 / 3 in which the edge transitions from a structure having an inner upstream − 1 / 3 charge mode and outer downstream integer mode to a structure with two downstream 1 / 3 charge modes when the confining potential is tuned from sharp to soft and disorder prevails.},

We find that the K-IVC gap is robust against local perturbations, which are odd under P T , where P and T denote particle-hole conjugation and time reversal, respectively. In contrast, P T -even perturbations will in general induce subgap states and reduce or even eliminate the gap. We use this result to classify the stability of the K-IVC state against various experimentally relevant perturbations.

  abstract     = {In relativistic physics, both atomic collapse in a heavy nucleus and Hawking radiation in a black hole are predicted to occur through the Klein tunneling process that couples particles and antiparticles. Recently, atomic collapse states (ACSs) were explicitly realized in graphene because of its relativistic Dirac excitation with a large “fine structure constant.” However, the essential role of the Klein tunneling in the ACSs remains elusive in experiment. Here we systematically study the quasibound states in elliptical graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and two coupled circular GQDs. Bonding and antibonding molecular collapse states formed by two coupled ACSs are observed in both systems. Our experiments supported by theoretical calculations indicate that the antibonding state of the ACSs will change into a Klein-tunneling-induced quasibound state revealing deep connection between the ACSs and the Klein tunneling.},

In this Letter, we propose an extremely low power optomechanical coherent Ising machine based on a new enhanced symmetry breaking mechanism and highly nonlinear mechanical Kerr effect. The mechanical movement of an optomechanical actuator induced by the optical gradient force greatly increases the nonlinearity by a few orders and significantly reduces the power threshold using conventional structures capable of fabrication via photonic integrated circuit platforms. With the simple but strong bifurcation mechanism and remarkably low power requirement, our optomechanical spin model opens a path for chip-scale integration of large-size Ising machine implementations with great stability.},

  abstract     = {Coherent tripartite interactions among degrees of freedom of completely different nature are instrumental for quantum information and simulation technologies, but they are generally difficult to realize and remain largely unexplored. Here, we predict a tripartite coupling mechanism in a hybrid setup comprising a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and a micromagnet. We propose to realize direct and strong tripartite interactions among single NV spins, magnons, and phonons via modulating the relative motion between the NV center and the micromagnet. Specifically, by introducing a parametric drive (two-phonon drive) to modulate the mechanical motion (such as the center-of-mass motion of a NV spin in diamond trapped in an electrical trap or a levitated micromagnet in a magnetic trap), we can obtain a tunable and strong spin-magnon-phonon coupling at the single quantum level, with up to 2 orders of magnitude enhancement for the tripartite coupling strength. This enables, for example, tripartite entanglement among solid-state spins, magnons, and mechanical motions in quantum spin-magnonics-mechanics with realistic experimental parameters. This protocol can be readily implemented with the well-developed techniques in ion traps or magnetic traps and could pave the way for general applications in quantum simulations and information processing based on directly and strongly coupled tripartite systems.},

The phase sensitivity, the core parameter, can be quantum-enhanced to break the standard quantum limit (SQL) using quantum states. However, quantum states are highly fragile and quickly degrade with losses. We design and demonstrate a quantum interferometer utilizing a beam splitter with a variable splitting ratio to protect the quantum resource against environmental impacts. The optimal phase sensitivity can reach the quantum Cramér-Rao bound of the system. This quantum interferometer can greatly reduce the quantum source requirements in quantum measurements. In theory, with a 66.6\% loss rate, the sensitivity can break the SQL using only a 6.0 dB squeezed quantum resource with the current interferometer rather than a 24 dB squeezed quantum resource with a conventional squeezing-vacuum-injected Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In experiments, when using a 2.0 dB squeezed vacuum state, the sensitivity enhancement remains at ∼ 1.6 dB via optimizing the first splitting ratio when the loss rate changes from 0\% to 90\%, indicating that the quantum resource is excellently protected with the existence of losses in practical applications. This strategy could open a way to retain quantum advantages for quantum information processing and quantum precision measurement in lossy environments.},

This challenge is made even more difficult for dark autoionizing states owing to their ultrashort lifetime of a few femtoseconds. High-order harmonic spectroscopy recently appeared as a novel method to probe the ultrafast dynamics of a single atomic or molecular state. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of a new type of ultrafast resonance state as a manifestation of coupling between Rydberg and a dark autoionizing state dressed by a laser photon. Through high-order harmonic generation, this resonance results in extreme ultraviolet light emission that is more than one order of magnitude stronger than for the off-resonance case. The induced resonance can be leveraged to study the dynamics of a single dark autoionizing state and the transient changes in the dynamics of real states due to their overlap with the virtual laser-dressed states. In addition, the present results allow the generation of coherent ultrafast extreme ultraviolet light for advanced ultrafast science applications.},

In this Letter, we report on the first global study of meson-baryon scattering up to one-loop order. It is shown that covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory, including its unitarization for the negative strangeness sector, can describe meson-baryon scattering data remarkably well. This provides a highly nontrivial check on the validity of this important low-energy effective field theory of QCD. We show that the K ¯ N related quantities can be better described in comparison with those of lower-order studies, and with reduced uncertainties due to the stringent constraints from the π N and K N phase shifts. In particular, we find that the two-pole structure of Λ ( 1405 ) persists up to one-loop order reinforcing the existence of two-pole structures in dynamically generated states.},

  abstract     = {Matter-free lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide an ideal setting to understand confinement to deconfinement transitions at finite temperatures, which is typically due to the spontaneous breakdown (at large temperatures) of the center symmetry associated with the gauge group. Close to the transition, the relevant degrees of freedom (Polyakov loop) transform under these center symmetries, and the effective theory depends on only the Polyakov loop and its fluctuations. As shown first by Svetitsky and Yaffe, and subsequently verified numerically, for the U(1) LGT in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions, the transition is in the 2D X Y universality class, while for the Z 2 LGT, it is in the 2D Ising universality class. We extend this classic scenario by adding higher charged matter fields and show that the critical exponents γ and ν can change continuously as a coupling is varied, while their ratio is fixed to the 2D Ising value. While such weak universality is well known for spin models, we demonstrate this for LGTs for the first time. Using an efficient cluster algorithm, we show that the finite temperature phase transition of the U(1) quantum link LGT in the spin S = 1 2 representation is in the 2D X Y universality class, as expected. On the addition of Q = ± 2 e charges distributed thermally, we demonstrate the occurrence of weak universality.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new beam-dump experiment at a future TeV-scale muon collider. A beam dump would be an economical and effective way to increase the discovery potential of the collider complex in a complementary regime. In this Letter, we consider vector models such as the dark photon and L μ − L τ gauge boson as new physics candidates and explore which novel regions of parameter space can be probed with a muon beam dump. We find that for the dark photon model, we gain sensitivity in the moderate mass (MeV–GeV) range at both higher and lower couplings compared to existing and proposed experiments, and gain access to previously untouched areas of parameter space of the L μ − L τ model.},

This provides strong evidence that the IR fixed points are examples of compact, unitary, irrational conformal field theories with the minimal amount of chiral symmetry. We also analyze anomalous dimension matrices for a family of degenerate operators with increasing spin. These display further evidence of irrationality and begin to reveal the form of the leading quantum Regge trajectory.},

In neutron stars, for critical values of the axion decay constant and axion mass, the magnetic dynamo mechanism increases the total magnetic energy of the star. We show that this generates substantial internal heating due to enhanced dissipation of crustal electric currents. These mechanisms would lead magnetized neutron stars to increase their magnetic energy and thermal luminosity by several orders of magnitude, in contrast to observations of thermally emitting neutron stars. To prevent the activation of the dynamo, bounds on the allowed axion parameter space can be derived.},

Conventional noise filtering methods rely on different patterns of signal and noise in frequency or time domains, thus limiting their scope of application, especially in quantum sensing. Here, we propose a signal-nature-based (not signal-pattern-based) approach which singles out a quantum signal from its classical noise background by employing the intrinsic quantum nature of the system. We design a novel protocol to extract the quantum correlation signal and use it to single out the signal of a remote nuclear spin from its overwhelming classical noise backgrounds, which is impossible to be accomplished by conventional filter methods. Our Letter demonstrates the quantum or classical nature as a new degree of freedom in quantum sensing. The further generalization of this quantum nature-based method opens a new direction in quantum research.},

While multiphoton entangled N00N states can in principle beat the shot-noise limit and reach the Heisenberg limit, high N00N states are difficult to prepare and fragile to photon loss which hinders them from reaching unconditional quantum metrological advantages. Here, we combine the idea of unconventional nonlinear interferometers and stimulated emission of squeezed light, previously developed for the photonic quantum computer Jiuzhang, to propose and realize a new scheme that achieves a scalable, unconditional, and robust quantum metrological advantage. We observe a 5.8(1)-fold enhancement above the shot-noise limit in the Fisher information extracted per photon, without discounting for photon loss and imperfections, which outperforms ideal 5-N00N states. The Heisenberg-limited scaling, the robustness to external photon loss, and the ease-of-use of our method make it applicable in practical quantum metrology at a low photon flux regime.},

We focus on the regime where this power is larger than the spatial dimension (i.e., where the single particle energies are guaranteed to be bounded) for which we provide a comprehensive series of fundamental constraints on their equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties. First, we derive a Lieb-Robinson bound which is optimal in the spatial tail. This bound then implies a clustering property with essentially the same power law for the Green’s function, whenever its variable lies outside the energy spectrum. The widely believed (but yet unproven in this regime) clustering property for the ground-state correlation function follows as a corollary among other implications. Finally, we discuss the impact of these results on topological phases in long-range free-fermion systems: they justify the equivalence between Hamiltonian and state-based definitions and the extension of the short-range phase classification to systems with decay power larger than the spatial dimension. Additionally, we argue that all the short-range topological phases are unified whenever this power is allowed to be smaller.},

  abstract     = {Phase transitions in equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems play a major role in the natural sciences. In dynamical networks, phase transitions organize qualitative changes in the collective behavior of coupled dynamical units. Adaptive dynamical networks feature a connectivity structure that changes over time, coevolving with the nodes’ dynamical state. In this Letter, we show the emergence of two distinct first-order nonequilibrium phase transitions in a finite-size adaptive network of heterogeneous phase oscillators. Depending on the nature of defects in the internal frequency distribution, we observe either an abrupt single-step transition to full synchronization or a more gradual multistep transition. This observation has a striking resemblance to heterogeneous nucleation. We develop a mean-field approach to study the interplay between adaptivity and nodal heterogeneity and describe the dynamics of multicluster states and their role in determining the character of the phase transition. Our work provides a theoretical framework for studying the interplay between adaptivity and nodal heterogeneity.},

Nevertheless, the most common unsupervised dimensional reduction methods are designed for continuous spaces, and their use for discrete spaces can lead to errors and biases. In this Letter we introduce an algorithm to infer the intrinsic dimension (ID) of datasets embedded in discrete spaces. We demonstrate its accuracy on benchmark datasets, and we apply it to analyze a metagenomic dataset for species fingerprinting, finding a surprisingly small ID, of order 2. This suggests that evolutive pressure acts on a low-dimensional manifold despite the high dimensionality of sequences’ space.},

In this Letter, we leverage a combination of fine-tuned chemical engineering and photoemission spectroscopy with photon energy contrast to discover the higher-fold topology of a chiral crystal. We identify all bulk branches of a higher-fold chiral fermion for the first time, critically important for allowing us to explore unique Fermi arc surface states in multiple interband gaps, which exhibit an emergent ladder structure. Through designer chemical gating of the samples in combination with our measurements, we uncover an unprecedented multigap bulk boundary correspondence.

In a prototypical case of a first-order Mott transition the surface associated with the equation of state for the homogeneous system is “folded” so that in a range of parameters stable metallic and insulating phases exist and are connected by an unstable metallic branch. Here we show that tuning the chemical potential, the zero-temperature equation of state gradually unfolds. Under general conditions, we find that the Mott transition evolves into a first-order transition between two metals, associated with a phase separation region ending in the finite-doping QCP. This scenario is here demonstrated solving a minimal multiorbital Hubbard model relevant for the iron-based superconductors, but its origin—the splitting of the atomic ground state multiplet by a small energy scale, here Hund’s coupling—is much more general. A strong analogy with cuprate superconductors is traced.},

The impurity spin stems from the nonlocal topological ground state degeneracy of the island and thus the effect is known as the topological Kondo effect. We introduce a physically motivated N -channel generalization of the topological Kondo model. Starting from the simplest case N = 2 , we conjecture a stable intermediate coupling fixed point and evaluate the resulting low-temperature impurity entropy. The impurity entropy indicates that an emergent Fibonacci anyon can be realized in the N = 2 model. We also map the case N = 2 , M = 4 to the conventional four-channel Kondo model and find the conductance at the intermediate fixed point. By using the perturbative renormalization group, we also analyze the large- N limit, where the fixed point moves to weak coupling. In the isotropic limit, we find an intermediate stable fixed point, which is stable to “exchange” coupling anisotropies, but unstable to channel anisotropy. We evaluate the fixed point impurity entropy and conductance to obtain experimentally observable signatures of our results. In the large- N limit, we evaluate the full crossover function describing the temperature-dependent conductance.},

In this Letter, we include the effects of long-wavelength inhomogeneities, building on the results for a continuous metal-insulator transition at fixed filling in the clean limit. We examine the effects of mesoscale inhomogeneities near the critical point on transport using the framework of random resistor networks, highlighting the salient differences from a simple percolation-based picture.

Second, we reveal that, with application of D 0 , the spin-orbit-induced spin textures exhibit vortices which lead to “Möbius fermi surfaces” in the interior of the Brillouin zone: diabatic electron trajectories, which are predicted to dominate quantum oscillation experiments, require encircling the Γ point twice, making their Möbius nature directly observable. Further, we show that the superconducting order parameter inherits the unconventional, Möbius spin textures. Our findings suggest that this system provides a promising experimental avenue for systematically studying the impact of spin-orbit coupling on the multitude of topological and correlated phases in near-magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene.},

Here we report the observation of Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization of light waves to negative-temperature equilibrium states. The optical wave relaxes to the equilibrium state through its propagation in a multimode optical fiber—i.e., in a conservative Hamiltonian system. The bounded energy spectrum of the optical fiber enables negative-temperature equilibriums with high energy levels (high-order fiber modes) more populated than low energy levels (low-order modes). Our experiments show that negative-temperature speckle beams are featured, in average, by a nonmonotonic radial intensity profile. The experimental results are in quantitative agreement with the Rayleigh-Jeans theory without free parameters. Bringing negative temperatures to the field of optics opens the door to the investigation of fundamental issues of negative-temperature states in a flexible experimental environment.},

  abstract     = {We present an exact solution in arbitrary dimensions for the steady states of a class of quantum driven-dissipative bosonic models, where a set of modes is subject to arbitrary two-photon driving, single-photon loss, and a global Hubbard (or Kerr)-like interaction. Our solutions reveal a wealth of striking phenomena, including the emergence of dissipative phase transitions, nontrivial mode competition physics and symmetry breaking, and the stabilization of many-body SU(1,1) pair-coherent states. Our exact solutions enable the description of spatial correlations, and are fully valid in regimes where traditional mean-field and semiclassical approaches break down.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high energy resolution in spin systems is important for fundamental physics research and precision measurements, with alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers being among the best available sensors. We found a new relaxation mechanism in such devices, the gradient of the Fermi-contact-interaction field that dominates the relaxation of hyperpolarized nuclear spins. We report on precise control over spin distribution, demonstrating a tenfold increase of nuclear spin hyperpolarization and transverse coherence time with optimal hybrid optical pumping. Operating in the self-compensation regime, our Ne 21 − Rb − K comagnetometer achieves an ultrahigh inertial rotation sensitivity of 3 × 10 − 8 rad / s / Hz 1 / 2 in the frequency range from 0.2 to 1.0 Hz, which is equivalent to the energy resolution of 3.1 × 10 − 23 eV / Hz 1 / 2 . We propose to use this comagnetometer to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions involving proton and neutron spins. The projected sensitivity surpasses the previous experimental and astrophysical limits by more than 4 orders of magnitude.},

We present the first lattice QCD calculation of partial decay width of J / ψ radiatively decaying into η ( 2 ) , the SU(2) flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson, which confirms QCD U A ( 1 ) anomaly enhancement to the coupling of gluons with flavor singlet pseudoscalar mesons. The lattice simulation is carried out using N f = 2 lattice QCD gauge configurations at the pion mass m π ≈ 350 MeV . In particular, the distillation method has been utilized to calculate light quark loops. The results are reported here with the mass m η ( 2 ) = 718 ( 8 ) MeV and the decay width Γ ( J / ψ → γ η ( 2 ) ) = 0.385 ( 45 ) keV . By assuming the dominance of U A ( 1 ) anomaly and flavor singlet-octet mixing angle θ = − 24.5 ° , the production rates for the physical η and η ′ in J / ψ radiative decay are predicted to be 1.15 ( 14 ) × 10 − 3 and 4.49 ( 53 ) × 10 − 3 , respectively, which agree well with the experimental measurement data.

Stationary and axisymmetric ultracompact objects that can form from smooth, quasi-Minkowski initial data must have at least one stable LR, which has been argued to trigger a spacetime instability ; but its development and fate have been unknown. Using fully nonlinear numerical evolutions of ultracompact bosonic stars free of any other known instabilities and introducing a novel adiabatic effective potential technique, we confirm the LRs triggered instability, identifying two possible fates: migration to nonultracompact configurations or collapse to BHs. In concrete examples we show that typical migration (collapse) timescales are not larger than ∼ 10 3 light-crossing times, unless the stable LR potential well is very shallow. Our results show that the LR instability is effective in destroying horizonless ultracompact objects that could be plausible BH imitators.},

Probing the Galactic Center region with ground-based Cherenkov telescopes enables the search for TeV spectral features in immediate association with a dense dark matter reservoir at a sensitivity out of reach for satellite γ -ray detectors, and direct detection and collider experiments. We report on 223 hours of observations of the Galactic Center region with the MAGIC stereoscopic telescope system reaching γ -ray energies up to 100 TeV. We improved the sensitivity to spectral lines at high energies using large-zenith-angle observations and a novel background modeling method within a maximum-likelihood analysis in the energy domain. No linelike spectral feature is found in our analysis. Therefore, we constrain the cross section for dark matter annihilation into two photons to ⟨ σ v ⟩ ≲ 5 × 10 − 28 cm 3 s − 1 at 1 TeV and ⟨ σ v ⟩ ≲ 1 × 10 − 25 cm 3 s − 1 at 100 TeV, achieving the best limits to date for a dark matter mass above 20 TeV and a cuspy dark matter profile at the Galactic Center.

These particles could have been produced during the post-inflationary epoch and match the relic abundance of dark matter inferred today. The nonobservation of the signatures searched for allows us to derive a bound on the reduced coupling constant of gauge interactions in the dark sector: α X ≲ 0.09 , for 10 9 ≲ M X / GeV &lt; 10 19 . Conversely, we obtain that, for instance, a reduced coupling constant α X = 0.09 excludes masses M X ≳ 3 × 10 13 GeV . In the context of dark matter production from gravitational interactions alone, we illustrate how these bounds are complementary to those obtained on the Hubble rate at the end of inflation from the nonobservation of tensor modes in the cosmological microwave background.},

Our findings demonstrate that the implementation of the function requires moderate sample sizes, which can be over 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the ones predicted by the Chernoff bound; whereas for numbers of photons n ≥ 3 and bins d ∼ poly ( m , n ) , the same output of the function cannot be generated by nonboson samplers.

Our approach relies on a scalable circuit that measures the total number of particles without destroying long-range coherence. We introduce two complementary probes of global and relative phase coherence, study how they are affected by measurements of the particle number, and implement them on a superconducting quantum computer by Rigetti.

While KZM scaling holds below a critical quench rate, for faster quenches the defect density and the freeze-out time become independent of the quench rate and exhibit a universal power-law scaling with the final value of the control parameter.

Here, by employing the rigid base-pair model, we connect its microscopic parameters to the persistence length. Combined with all-atom molecular dynamic simulations, our scheme identifies relevant couplings between different degrees of freedom at each coarse-graining step. This allows us to clarify how the scale dependence of the elastic moduli is determined in a systematic way encompassing the role of previously unnoticed off-site couplings between deformations with different parity.},

Though studied since the 1930s, the underlying many-body dynamics is still incompletely understood, as underscored by the recent empirical discovery of an unexpected third-root scaling in the particle-fluid density ratio. Here, by means of grain-scale simulations and analytical modeling, we elucidate how a complex coupling between grain-bed collisions and granular creep within the sand bed yields a dilatancy-enhanced bed erodibility. Our minimal saltation model robustly predicts both the observed scaling and a new undersaturated steady transport state that we confirm by simulations for rarefied atmospheres.},

Here we explore the rheological implication of such coupling in a minimal model of a dense cellular material where each cell exerts an active mechanical stress along its axis of elongation. Increasing the active stress amplitude leads to several transitions. An initially hexagonal crystal motif is first destabilized into a solid with anisotropic cells whose shear modulus eventually vanishes at a first critical activity. Increasing activity beyond this first critical value, we find a re-entrant transition to a regime with finite hexatic order and finite shear modulus, in which cells arrange according to a rhombile pattern with periodically arranged rosette structures. The shear modulus vanishes again at a third threshold beyond which spontaneous tissue flows and topological defects of the nematic cell shape field arise. Flow and stress fields around the defects agree with active nematic theory, with either contractile or extensile signs, as also observed in several epithelial tissue experiments.},

Though this has already led to the observance of so-called chiral crystals, active chiral glasses remain largely unexplored. A possible reason for this could be the naive expectation that interactions dominate the glassy dynamics and the details of the active motion become increasingly less relevant. Here, we show that quite the opposite is true by studying the glassy dynamics of interacting chiral active Brownian particles. We demonstrate that when our chiral fluid is pushed to glassy conditions, it exhibits highly nontrivial dynamics, especially compared to a standard linear active fluid such as common active Brownian particles. Despite the added complexity, we are still able to present a full rationalization for all identified dynamical regimes. Most notably, we introduce a new “hammering” mechanism, unique to rapidly spinning particles in high-density conditions, that can fluidize a chiral active solid.},

We theoretically investigate the charging kinetics of solid-liquid interfaces and find that the time-dependent equilibration of surface charge contains key information not only on the reaction mechanism, but also on the valency of the reacting ions. We construct a nonlinear differential equation describing surface charging by combining chemical Langmuir kinetics and electrostatic Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Our results reveal a clear distinction between late-time (near-equilibrium) and short-time (far-from-equilibrium) relaxation rates, the ratio of which contains information on the charge valency and ad- or desorption mechanism of the charging process. Similarly, we find that single-ion reactions can be distinguished from two-ion reactions, as the latter show an inflection point during equilibration. Interestingly, such inflection points are characteristic of autocatalytic reactions, and we conclude that the Coulombic ion-surface interaction is an autocatalytic feedback mechanism.},

Here we ask to what extent homophily can explain the formation of social groups, particularly their size distribution. We propose a spin-glass-inspired framework of self-assembly, where opinions are represented as multidimensional spins that dynamically self-assemble into groups; individuals within a group tend to share similar opinions (intragroup homophily), and opinions between individuals belonging to different groups tend to be different (intergroup heterophily). We compute the associated nontrivial phase diagram by solving a self-consistency equation for “magnetization” (combined average opinion). Below a critical temperature, there exist two stable phases: one ordered with nonzero magnetization and large clusters, the other disordered with zero magnetization and no clusters. The system exhibits a first-order transition to the disordered phase. We analytically derive the group-size distribution that successfully matches empirical group-size distributions from online communities.},

Since this class of topological insulating phases was theoretically proposed in 2008, they have attracted significant interest owing to their conceptual novelty, connection to knot theory, and many fascinating physical properties. However, because their realization requires special forms of long-range spin-orbit coupling, they have not been achieved in any 3D system yet. Here, we report the first experimental realization of the long-sought-after Hopf insulator in a 3D circuit system. To implement the Hopf insulator, we construct basic pseudospin modules and connection modules that can realize 2 × 2 -matrix elements and then design the circuit network according to a tight-binding Hopf insulator Hamiltonian constructed by the Hopf map. By simulating the band structure of the designed circuit network and calculating the Hopf invariant, we find that the circuit realizes a Hopf insulator with Hopf invariant equaling 4. Experimentally, we measure the band structure of a printed circuit board and find the observed properties of the bulk bands and topological surface states are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, verifying the bulk-boundary correspondence of the Hopf insulator. Our scheme brings the experimental study of Hopf insulators to reality and opens the door to the implementation of more unexplored topological phases beyond the known topological classifications.},

On the one hand, this synthetic lattice presents bands characterized by a winding number. The winding emerges from the breakup of inversion symmetry, and it directly relates to the appearance of Bloch suboscillations within its bulk. On the other hand, the Floquet nature of the lattice results in well-known anomalous insulating phases with topological edge states. The combination of broken inversion symmetry and periodic time modulation studied here enriches the variety of topological phases available in lattices subject to Floquet driving and suggests the possible emergence of novel phases when periodic modulation is combined with the breakup of spatial symmetries.},

  abstract     = {Magnetization switching is the most important operation in spintronic devices. In modern nonvolatile magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), it is usually realized by spin-transfer torque (STT) or spin-orbit torque (SOT). However, both STT and SOT MRAM require current to drive magnetization switching, which will cause Joule heating. Here, we report an alternative mechanism, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) torque, that can realize magnetization switching fully controlled by voltage pulses. We find that a consequential voltage-controlled reversal of DMI chirality in multiferroics can lead to continued expansion of a skyrmion thanks to the DMI torque. Enough DMI torque will eventually make the skyrmion burst into a quasiuniform ferromagnetic state with reversed magnetization, thus realizing the switching of a perpendicular magnet. The discovery is demonstrated in two-dimensional multiferroics, CuCrP 2 Se 6 and CrN, using first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations. As an example, we applied the DMI torque for simulating leaky-integrate-fire functionality of biological neurons. Our discovery of DMI torque switching of perpendicular magnetization provides tremendous potential toward magnetic-field-free and current-free spintronic devices, and neuromorphic computing as well.},

  abstract     = {Unidirectional guided resonances (UGRs) are optical modes in photonic crystal slabs that radiate toward one side without the need for mirrors on the other. In this Letter, we report a mechanism to realize UGRs by tuning the interband coupling effect originating from up-down symmetry breaking. We theoretically find that UGRs that reside along high-symmetric lines correspond to phase singularities of far-field radiation, depicted by phase winding numbers as a type of topological indices. We investigate the phase dislocation lines in three-dimensional parameter space and elaborate on the interplay between UGRs and non-Hermitian degeneracies accordingly. Our findings reveal the topological nature of UGRs about their generation, evolution, and annihilation in general parameter spaces, thus paving the way to new possibilities of light manipulation.},

  abstract     = {New-generation transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) are equipped with detectors that approach the shot-noise limit. Hence it is pertinent to ask: What are the quantum limits of electron scattering experiments in the TEM? For example, for a given electron dose, what is the ultimate accuracy allowed by quantum mechanics for the atomic structure of a material? We provide quantitative answers based on quantum estimation theory. We also show that, for an arbitrary set of sample parameters, the quantum limit is achievable under conditions of weak scattering, but not strong multiple scattering (this conclusion extends to scattering of other types of radiation). Implications for structure determination of radiation-sensitive materials are discussed.},

Particles collected on the bubble surface have the potential to become highly concentrated in the jet drops, dramatically increasing their impact. It has been assumed that only particles small enough to fit within a thin microlayer surrounding the bubble can be transported into its influential top jet drop. Yet here, we demonstrate that not only can larger particles be transported into this jet drop, but also that these particles can exceed previous enrichment measurements. Through experiments and simulations, we identify the prerupture location of the liquid that develops into the top jet drop and model how interfacial rearrangement combines with the bubble size, particle size, and the angular distribution of particles on the bubble surface to set the particle enrichment.},

  abstract     = {As an important imaging technique, holography has been realized with different physical dimensions of light, including polarization, wavelength, and time. Recently, quantum holography has been demonstrated by utilizing polarization entangled state with the advantages of high robustness and enhanced spatial resolution, comparing with classical holography. However, the polarization is only a two-dimensional degree of freedom, which greatly limits the capacity of quantum holography. Here, we propose a method to realize high-dimensional quantum holography by using high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement. A high-capacity OAM-encoded quantum holographic system can be obtained by multiplexing a wide range of OAM-dependent holographic images. Proof-of-principle experiments with four- and six-dimensional OAM entangled states have been implemented and verify the feasibility of our idea. Our experimental results also demonstrate that the high-dimensional quantum holography shows a high robustness to classical noise. What is more, the level of security of the holographic imaging encryption system can be greatly improved in our high-dimensional quantum holography.},

Taking advantage of the adjustable decay processes of giant atoms into the waveguide and of the interference processes, spontaneous sudden birth of entanglement can be strongly enhanced with giant atoms. Highly entangled states can also be generated in the steady-state regime when the system is driven by a resonant classical field. We show that the statistics of the light emitted by the system can be used as a witness of the presence of entanglement in the system, since giant photon bunching is observed close to the regime of maximal entanglement. Given the degree of quantum correlations incoherently generated in this system, our results open a broad avenue for the generation of quantum correlations and manipulation of photon statistics in systems of giant atoms.},

This value is found from historical muonic-atom measurements in combination with our muonic-atom and atomic many-body calculations. The effect differs by 0.5\% in the hyperfine structure from the value found using the uniform magnetization distribution, which has been commonly employed in the precision heavy-atom community over the last several decades. We also deduce accurate values for the BW effect in other isotopes and states of cesium. These results enable cesium atomic wave functions to be tested in the nuclear region at an unprecedented 0.2\% level, and are needed for the development of precision atomic many-body methods. This is important for increasing the discovery potential of precision atomic searches for new physics, in particular for atomic parity violation in cesium.},

This mass region consists of complex many-body systems that can behave in astonishingly simple and regular ways, as classified in the Casten symmetry triangle. By applying the shell model Hamiltonian proposed recently, we carry out calculations using the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov plus generator coordinate method, in the large model space containing the ( 1 g 9 / 2 , 1 g 7 / 2 , 2 d 5 / 2 , 2 d 3 / 2 , 3 s 1 / 2 , 1 h 11 / 2 , 2 f 7 / 2 ) orbits. Based on good reproduction of the experimentally known energy levels, spectroscopic quadrupole moments, and E 2 transition probabilities, we identify the quasi-SU(3) couplings across the N = 50 and 82 shell gaps, which play a role in driving shape evolution and phase transition discussed in the extended Casten triangle. Specifically, we demonstrate that the quasi-SU(3) coupling mechanism in the proton partner orbits ( 1 g 9 / 2 , 2 d 5 / 2 ) tends to drive the system to be more γ soft, and that in the neutron partner orbits ( 1 h 11 / 2 , 2 f 7 / 2 ) are responsible for the oblate-to-prolate shape phase transition. With an emphasis on discussing spectroscopic quadrupole moments, our Letter uncovers hidden symmetries from the vast shell-model configurations and adds microscopical insights into the empirical symmetry triangle.},

We discuss the applicability of axial gauge n · A = 0 to calculate them. In particular, we address issues that appear when one attempts to trivialize the Wilson lines in the correlation functions by gauge fixing. We find it is always impossible to completely remove the gauge fields n · A in Wilson lines that extend to infinity in the n direction by means of gauge transformations. We show how the obstruction appears in an explicit example of a perturbative calculation, and we also explain it more generally from the perspective of the path integral that defines the theory. Our results explain why the two correlators that define the heavy quark and quarkonium transport coefficients, which are seemingly equal in axial gauge, are actually different physical quantities of the quark-gluon plasma and have different values. Furthermore, our findings provide insights into the difference between two inequivalent gluon parton distribution functions.},

We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by γ -triggered jets in Pb + Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. Using a two-Gaussian fit, we extract the diffusion wake and MPI contributions to the double peak. The diffusion wake valley is found to deepen with the jet energy loss as characterized by the γ -jet asymmetry. Its sensitivity to the equation of state and shear viscosity is also studied.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional (HD) entanglement enables an encoding of more bits than in the two-dimensional case and promises to increase communication capacity over quantum channels and to improve robustness to noise. In practice, however, one of the central challenges is to devise efficient methods to quantify the HD entanglement explicitly. Full quantum state tomography is a standard technology to obtain all the information about the quantum state, but it becomes impractical because the required measurements increase exponentially with the dimension in HD systems. Hence, it is highly anticipated that a new method will be found for characterizing the HD entanglement with as few measurements as possible and without introducing unwarranted assumptions. Here, we present and demonstrate a scan-free tomography method independent of dimension, which only requires two measurements for the characterization of two-photon HD orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement. Taking Laguerre-Gaussian modes of photons as an example, the density matrices of OAM entangled states are experimentally reconstructed with very high fidelity. Our method is also generalized to the mixed HD OAM entanglement. Our results provide realistic approaches for quantifying more complex OAM entanglement in many scientific and engineering fields such as multiphoton HD quantum systems and quantum process tomography.},

We study the quantum hitting time with restart using a monitored quantum walk. The restart strategy eliminates the problem of dark states, i.e., cases where the particle evades detection, while maintaining the ballistic propagation which is important for a fast search. We find profound effects of quantum oscillations on the restart problem, namely, a type of instability of the mean detection time, and optimal restart times that form staircases, with sudden drops as the rate of sampling is modified. In the absence of restart and in the Zeno limit, the detection of the walker is not possible, and we examine how restart overcomes this well-known problem, showing that the optimal restart time becomes insensitive to the sampling period.},

Here we prove that there exists a set of control pulses that implement this transfer with arbitrarily high fidelity and, simultaneously, realize a prespecified N × N unitary transformation between the two sets of modes. Moreover, we provide a numerical algorithm for constructing these control pulses and discuss the scaling and robustness of this protocol in terms of several illustrative examples. By being purely control-based and not relying on any adaptations of the underlying hardware, the presented scheme is extremely flexible and can find widespread applications, for example, for boson-sampling experiments, multiqubit state transfer protocols, or in continuous-variable quantum computing architectures.},

The excitation density, which quantifies the degree of adiabaticity of the dynamics, is found to obey scaling laws in the cooling velocity as well as in the initial and final temperatures of the cooling protocol. The scaling laws are universal, governed by the critical exponents of the quantum phase transition. The validity of these statements is shown analytically for a Kitaev quantum wire coupled to Markovian baths and argued to be valid under rather general conditions. Our results establish that quantum critical properties can be probed dynamically at finite temperature, without even varying the control parameter of the quantum phase transition.},

Here, we show that dissipation is a generic macroscopic indicator of the memory of the largest perturbation. Through experiments in crumpled sheets under cyclic drive, we show that dissipation transiently increases when first surpassing the largest perturbation due to irreversible structural changes with unique statistics. This finding is used to devise novel memory readout protocols based on global observables only. The general applicability of this approach is demonstrated by revealing a similar memory effect in a three-dimensional amorphous solid.},

Toroidal structures, which widely exist in nature, present interesting features containing positive, zero, and negative Gaussian curvatures within one system. Such varying curvatures would significantly affect the growing or dehydrating morphogenesis, as observed in various intricate patterns in abundant biological structures. To understand the underlying morphoelastic mechanism and to determine the crucial factors that govern the patterning in toroidal structures, we develop a core-shell model and derive a scaling law to characterize growth- or dehydration-induced instability patterns. We find that the eventual patterns are mainly determined by two dimensionless parameters that are composed of stiffness and curvature of the system. Moreover, we construct a phase diagram showing the multiphase wrinkling pattern selection in various toroidal structures in terms of these two parameters, which is confirmed by our experimental observations. Physical insights into the multiphase transitions and existence of bistable modes are further provided by identifying hysteresis loops and the Maxwell equal-energy conditions. The universal law for morphology selection on core shell structures with varying curvatures can fundamentally explain and precisely predict wrinkling patterns of diverse toroidal structures, which may also provide a platform to design morphology-related functional surfaces.},

We show that the normal drift-diffusion regime can be effectively modeled as a one-dimensional stochastic process in a tilted periodic potential. We use the theory of stochastic processes to recover the potential from nonequilibrium unzipping trajectories and show that it corresponds to the free-energy landscape for single-base-pair unzipping.

We employ a gauge-invariant random-phase approximation capable of describing collective excitations and other fluctuations. In line with the experimental findings, we have found that in the range of frequencies of interest, and for sufficiently low temperatures, an exponential increase of the kinetic inductance with disorder coexists with a still large quality factor of ∼ 10 4 . More interestingly, on the metallic side of the superconductor-insulator transition, we have identified a range of frequencies and temperatures, T ∼ 0.1 T c , where quantum coherence effects induce a broad statistical distribution of the quality factor with an average value that increases with disorder. We expect these findings to further stimulate experimental research on the design and optimization of superinductors for a better performance and miniaturization of quantum devices such as qubit circuits and microwave detectors.},

This anticrossing inherits an excellent tunability from the pump, which allows us to control the anticrossing via the pump power, frequency, and waveform. Further, we realize a remarkable functionality of this anticrossing, namely, a microwave frequency comb, in terms of the nonlinear interaction that mixes the pump and probe frequencies. Such a frequency comb originates from the magnetic dynamics and thereby does not suffer from the charge noise.

Moreover, t − 1 dependence of the anisotropic damping indicates the emergence of an anisotropic effective spin mixing conductance according to the theory of spin pumping. The results establish new opportunities for controlling the Gilbert damping and for fundamental studies of magnetization dynamics in reduced dimension.},

We observe a strong coupling between the Kittel and microwave cavity modes in terms of an avoided crossing as a function of magnetic fields at low microwave input powers, but a complete closing of the gap at high powers. The experimental results are well explained by a theoretical model including the three-magnon decay of the Kittel magnon into spin waves. The gap closure originates from the saturation of the ferromagnetic resonance above the Suhl instability threshold by a coherent backreaction from the spin waves.},

  abstract     = {Recently, evidence has emerged in the topological superconductor Fe-chalcogenide FeTe 1 − x Se x for time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), the nature of which has strong implications on the Majorana zero modes (MZM) discovered in this system. It remains unclear, however, whether the TRSB resides in the topological surface state (TSS) or in the bulk, and whether it is due to an unconventional TRSB superconducting order parameter or an intertwined order. Here, by performing in superconducting FeTe 1 − x Se x crystals both surface-magneto-optic-Kerr effect measurements using a Sagnac interferometer and bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements, we pinpoint the TRSB to the TSS, where we also detect a Dirac gap. Further, we observe surface TRSB in nonsuperconducting FeTe 1 − x Se x of nominally identical composition, indicating that TRSB arises from an intertwined surface ferromagnetic (FM) order. The observed surface FM bears striking similarities to the two-dimensional (2D) FM found in 2D van der Waals crystals, and is highly sensitive to the exact chemical composition, thereby providing a means for optimizing the conditions for Majorana particles that are useful for robust quantum computing.},

Above a certain threshold power of an applied microwave field, a CoFeB Kittel magnon splits into a pair of counterpropagating YIG magnons that induce voltage signals in Pt electrodes on each side, in excellent agreement with model calculations based on the interlayer dipolar interaction. The excited YIG magnon pairs reside mainly in the first excited ( n = 1 ) perpendicular standing spin-wave mode. With increasing power, the n = 1 magnons successively scatter into nodeless ( n = 0 ) magnons through a four-magnon process.

This spin-textured surface state exhibits a fully gapped superconducting Cooper pairing structure below T c ∼ 4.5 K . Moreover, we find a node in the bulk near the Brillouin zone boundary, away from the topological Fermi arc. These observations not only demonstrate the band resolved electronic correlation between topological Fermi arc states and the way it induces Cooper pairing in PdTe, but also provide a rare case where surface and bulk states host a coexistence of nodeless and nodal gap structures enforced by spin-orbit coupling.},

In this Letter, we theoretically predict nonrelativistic spin-momentum coupling in two-dimensional materials. By proposing magnetic symmetry requirements for spin splitting in two-dimensional systems, we find that a simple twisting operation can realize nonrelativistic spin splitting in antiferromagnetic bilayers. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that momentum-dependent spin splitting exists extensively in antiferromagnetic twisted bilayers with different crystal structures and twist angles. The size of the spin splitting caused by twisting is of the same order of magnitude as that arising from spin-orbit coupling. In particular, a transverse spin current with an extremely high charge-spin conversion ratio can be generated in twisted structures under an external electric field. The findings demonstrate the potential for achieving electrically controlled magnetism in materials without spin-orbit coupling.},

It has been predicted that 2D TIs can be created from thin films of three-dimensional TIs by reducing the film thickness until the surface states hybridize. Here, we employ this technique to report the first observation of a 2D TI state in epitaxial thin films of cadmium arsenide, a prototype Dirac semimetal in bulk form. Using magnetotransport measurements with electrostatic gating, we observe a Landau level spectrum and quantum Hall effect that are in excellent agreement with those of an ideal 2D TI. Specifically, we observe a crossing of the zeroth Landau levels at a critical magnetic field. We show that the film thickness can be used to tune the critical magnetic field. Moreover, a larger change in film thickness causes a transition from a 2D TI to a 2D trivial insulator, just as predicted by theory. The high degree of tunability available in epitaxial cadmium arsenide heterostructures can thus be used to fine-tune the 2D TI, which is essential for future topological devices.},

The Fredkin staircase has two families of ballistically propagating quasiparticles, each with infinitely many species. Despite the presence of ballistic quasiparticles, charge transport is diffusive in the dc limit, albeit with a highly non-Gaussian dynamic structure factor. Remarkably, this model exhibits persistent temporal oscillations of the current, leading to a delta-function singularity (Drude peak) in the ac conductivity at nonzero frequency . We analytically construct an extensive set of operators that anticommute with the time-evolution operator; the existence of these operators both demonstrates the integrability of the model and allows us to lower bound the weight of this finite-frequency singularity.},

In cavity optomechanics, this enables a wealth of phenomena ranging from optomechanically induced transparency to macroscopic objects cooled to their motional ground state. Previous work in cavity optomechanics employed devices where ubiquitous structural disorder played no role beyond perturbing resonance frequencies and quality factors. More generally, the interplay between disorder, which must be described by statistical physics, and optomechanical effects has thus far been unexplored. Here, we demonstrate how sidewall roughness in air-slot photonic-crystal waveguides can induce sufficiently strong backscattering of slot-guided light to create Anderson-localized modes with quality factors as high as half a million and mode volumes estimated to be below the diffraction limit. We observe how the interaction between these disorder-induced optical modes and in-plane mechanical modes of the slotted membrane is governed by a distribution of coupling rates, which can exceed g o / 2 π ∼ 200 kHz , leading to mechanical amplification up to self sustained oscillations via optomechanical backaction. Our Letter constitutes the first steps towards understanding optomechanics in the multiple-scattering regime and opens new perspectives for exploring complex systems with a multitude of mutually coupled degrees of freedom.},

  abstract     = {Systems with strong light-matter interaction open up new avenues for studying topological phases of matter. Examples include exciton polaritons, mixed light-matter quasiparticles, where the topology of the polaritonic band structure arises from the collective coupling between matter wave and optical fields strongly confined in periodic dielectric structures. Distinct from light-matter interaction in a uniform environment, the spatially varying nature of the optical fields leads to a fundamental modification of the well-known optical selection rules, which were derived under the plane wave approximation. Here we identify polaritonic Chern insulators by coupling valley excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides to photonic Bloch modes in a dielectric photonic crystal slab. We show that polaritonic Dirac points, which are markers for topological phase transition points, can be constructed from the collective coupling between valley excitons and photonic Dirac cones in the presence of both time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Lifting exciton valley degeneracy by breaking time-reversal symmetry leads to gapped polaritonic bands with nonzero Chern numbers. Through numerical simulations, we predict polaritonic chiral edge states residing inside the topological gaps. Our Letter paves the way for the further study of strong exciton-photon interaction in nanophotonic structures and for exploring polaritonic topological phases and their practical applications in polaritonic devices.},

  abstract     = {We present a combined analytical and numerical study for coherent terahertz control of a single molecular polariton, formed by strongly coupling two rotational states of a molecule with a single-mode cavity. Compared to the bare molecules driven by a single terahertz pulse, the presence of a cavity strongly modifies the postpulse orientation of the polariton, making it difficult to obtain its maximal degree of orientation. To solve this challenging problem toward achieving complete quantum coherent control, we derive an analytical solution of a pulse-driven quantum Jaynes-Cummings model by expanding the wave function into entangled states and constructing an effective Hamiltonian. We utilize it to design a composite terahertz pulse and obtain the maximum degree of orientation of the polariton by exploiting photon blockade effects. This Letter offers a new strategy to study rotational dynamics in the strong-coupling regime and provides a method for complete quantum coherent control of a single molecular polariton. It, therefore, has direct applications in polariton chemistry and molecular polaritonics for exploring novel quantum optical phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Identification, and subsequent quantification of quantum correlations, is critical for understanding, controlling, and engineering quantum devices and processes. We derive and implement a general method to quantify various forms of quantum correlations using solely the experimental intensity moments up to the fourth order. This is possible as these moments allow for an exact determination of the global and marginal impurities of two-beam Gaussian fields. This leads to the determination of steering, tight lower and upper bounds for the negativity, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence used as a quantifier of state nonseparability. The principal squeezing variances are determined as well using the intensity moments. The approach is demonstrated on the experimental twin beams with increasing intensity and the squeezed super-Gaussian beams composed of photon pairs. Our method is readily applicable to multibeam Gaussian fields to characterize their quantum correlations.},

The enhancement of the dissipative process is pronounced for the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction regime, and it was suggested that the effect is due to the presence of quasiparticles localized inside the vortex core. We test this hypothesis through numerical simulations with time-dependent density-functional theory: a fully microscopic framework with fermionic degrees of freedom. The results of fully microscopic calculations expose the impact of the vortex-bound states on dissipative dynamics in a fermionic superfluid. Their contribution is too weak to explain the experimental measurements, and we identify that thermal effects, giving rise to mutual friction between superfluid and the normal component, dominate the observed dynamics.},

Requiring for our predictions to be compatible with recent ATLAS measurements yields stringent new constraints on charmonium long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) being nonperturbative, process-independent input parameters. Considering four popular LDME sets fitted to data of single J / ψ inclusive production, we find that one is marginally compatible with the data, with central predictions typically falling short by a factor of 3, one is unfavored, the factor of shortfall being about 1 order of magnitude, and two violate cross section positivity for direct J / ψ + W / Z production. The large rate of prompt J / ψ plus W production observed by ATLAS provides strong evidence for the color octet mechanism inherent to NRQCD factorization, the leading color singlet contribution entering only at O ( G F α s 4 ) , beyond the order considered here.},

We present a generalized geometric framework that extends this manifest covariance to all allowed field redefinitions. Amplitudes satisfy a recursion relation to all orders in perturbation theory that closely resembles the application of covariant derivatives to increase the rank of a tensor. This allows us to argue that tree-level amplitudes possess a notion of “on-shell covariance,” in that they transform as a tensor under any allowed field redefinition up to a set of terms that vanish when the equations of motion and on-shell momentum constraints are imposed. We highlight a variety of immediate applications to effective field theories.},

Here, focusing on the time evolution of a fixed input quantum state, we propose an adaptive approach to construct a low-depth time evolution circuit. By introducing a measurable quantifier that characterizes the simulation error, we use an adaptive strategy to learn the shallow quantum circuit that minimizes that error. We numerically test the adaptive method with electronic Hamiltonians of the H 2 O and H 4 molecules, and the transverse field Ising model with random coefficients. Compared to the first-order Suzuki-Trotter product formula, our method can significantly reduce the circuit depth (specifically the number of two-qubit gates) by around two orders while maintaining the simulation accuracy. We show applications of the method in simulating many-body dynamics and solving energy spectra with the quantum Krylov algorithm. Our work sheds light on practical Hamiltonian simulation with noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum devices.},

Nevertheless one may wonder if it would be possible to attribute a meaningful notion of temperature to an arbitrary quantum state, beyond simply the thermal (Gibbs) state. In this Letter, we propose such a notion of temperature considering an operational task, inspired by the zeroth law of thermodynamics. Specifically, we define two effective temperatures for quantifying the ability of a quantum system to cool down or heat up a thermal environment. In this way we can associate an operationally meaningful notion of temperature to any quantum density matrix. We provide general expressions for these effective temperatures, for both single- and many-copy systems, establishing connections to concepts previously discussed in the literature. Finally, we consider a more sophisticated scenario where the heat exchange between the system and the thermal environment is assisted by a quantum reference frame. This leads to an effect of “coherent quantum catalysis,” where the use of a coherent catalyst allows for exploiting quantum energetic coherences in the system, now leading to much colder or hotter effective temperatures. We demonstrate our findings using a two-level atom coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field.},

  abstract     = {Linear time evolution is one of the fundamental postulates of quantum theory. Past theoretical attempts to introduce nonlinearity into quantum evolution have violated causality. However, a recent theory has introduced nonlinear state-dependent terms in quantum field theory, preserving causality [D. E. Kaplan and S. Rajendran, Phys. Rev. D 105 , 055002 (2022) ]. We report the results of an experiment that searches for such terms. Our approach, inspired by the Everett many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory, correlates a binary macroscopic classical voltage with the outcome of a projective measurement of a quantum bit, prepared in a coherent superposition state. Measurement results are recorded in a bit string, which is used to control a voltage switch. Presence of a nonzero voltage reading in cases of no applied voltage is the experimental signature of a nonlinear state-dependent shift of the electromagnetic field operator. We implement blinded measurement and data analysis with three control bit strings. Control of systematic effects is realized by producing one of the control bit strings with a classical random-bit generator. The other two bit strings are generated by measurements performed on a superconducting qubit in an IBM Quantum processor and on a N 15 nuclear spin in a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Our measurements find no evidence for electromagnetic quantum state-dependent nonlinearity.

  abstract     = {Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality are two remarkable nonclassical features of quantum theory, related to strong correlations between outcomes of measurements performed on quantum systems. Both phenomena can be witnessed by the violation of certain inequalities, the simplest and most important of which are the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and the Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovski (KCBS), for Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality, respectively. It has been shown that, using the most common interpretation of Bell scenarios, quantum systems cannot violate both inequalities concomitantly, thus suggesting a monogamous relation between the two phenomena. In this Letter, we show that the joint consideration of the CHSH and KCBS inequalities naturally calls for the so-called generalized Bell scenarios, which, contrary to the previous results, allows for joint violation of them. In fact, this result is not a special feature of such inequalities: We provide very strong evidence that there is no monogamy between nonlocality and contextuality in any scenario where both phenomena can be observed. We also implement a photonic experiment to test the synchronous violation of both CHSH and KCBS inequalities. Our results agree with the theoretical predictions, thereby providing experimental proof of the coexistence of Bell nonlocality and contextuality in the simplest scenario, and lead to novel possibilities where both concepts could be jointly employed for quantum information processing protocols.},

At the nanoscale, interactions between such particles and their confining boundaries become unavoidable. We address the roles of electrostatic repulsion and absorption on the spatial distribution and dispersion of charged nanoparticles in near-surface shear flows, observed under evanescent illumination. The electrostatic repulsion between particles and the lower charged surface is tuned by varying electrolyte concentrations. Particles leaving the field of vision can be neglected from further analysis, such that the experimental ensemble is equivalent to that of Taylor dispersion with absorption. These two ingredients modify the particle distribution, deviating strongly from the Gibbs-Boltzmann form at the nanoscale studied here. The overall effect is to restrain the accessible space available to particles, which leads to a striking, tenfold reduction in the spreading dynamics as compared to the noninteracting case.},

Empirical studies document substantial evidence for opinion polarization across social media, showing a typical bipolarized pattern devising individuals into two groups with opposite opinions. While coevolving network models have been proposed to understand polarization, existing works cannot generate a stable bipolarized structure. Moreover, a quantitative and comprehensive theoretical framework capturing generic mechanisms governing polarization remains unaddressed. In this Letter, we discover a universal scaling law for opinion distributions, characterized by a set of scaling exponents. These exponents classify social systems into bipolarized and depolarized phases. We find two generic mechanisms governing the polarization dynamics and propose a coevolving framework that counts for opinion dynamics and network evolution simultaneously. Under a few generic assumptions on social interactions, we find a stable bipolarized community structure emerges naturally from the coevolving dynamics. Our theory analytically predicts two-phase transitions across three different polarization phases in line with the empirical observations for the Facebook and blogosphere data sets. Our theory not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also allows us to predict scaling exponents quantitatively.},

Our experimental results show evidence for nonreciprocal scattering, and excellent agreement with theoretical simulations.

However, the critical nonlinear effect, such as valley polariton bosonic stimulation, has long remained an unresolved challenge due to the generation of limited polariton ground state densities necessary to induce the stimulated scattering of polaritons in specific valleys. Here, we report the self-induced valley bosonic stimulation of exciton polaritons via spin-valley locking in a WS 2 monolayer microcavity. This is achieved by the resonant injection of valley polaritons at specific energy and wave vector, which allows spin-polarized polaritons to efficiently populate their ground state and induce a valley-dependent bosonic stimulation. As a result, we observe the nonlinear self-amplification of polariton emission from the valley-dependent ground state. Our finding paves the way for the investigation of spin ordering and phase transitions in transition metal dichalcogenides polariton Bose-Einstein condensate, offering a promising route for the realization of polariton spin lattices in moiré polariton systems and spin lasers.},

The algorithm is based on a self-consistently computed three-point vertex and a stochastically sampled four-point vertex, and it allows one to obtain numerically exact results in a wide parameter regime. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated with applications to a spin-boson model representing an emitter in a waveguide. As a function of the coupling strength, the spin exhibits a delocalization-localization crossover at low temperatures, signaling a qualitative change in the real-time relaxation. In certain parameter regimes, the response functions of the emitter coupled to the electromagnetic continuum can be described by an effective Rabi model with appropriately defined parameters. We also discuss the spatial distribution of the photon density around the emitter.},

Here, we explore the spin-lattice coupling in multiferroic Swedenborgites with mixed valence and Jahn-Teller active transition metal ions on a stacked triangular and Kagome lattice using infrared and dielectric spectroscopy. On one hand, in CaBa M 4 O 7 ( M = Co , Fe), we observe a strong magnetic-order-induced shift in the phonon frequencies and a corresponding large change in the dielectric response. Remarkably, as an unusual manifestation of the spin-phonon coupling, the spin fluctuations reduce the phonon lifetime by one order of magnitude at the magnetic phase transitions. On the other hand, lattice vibrations, dielectric response, and electric polarization show no variation at the Néel temperature of CaBaFe 2 Co 2 O 7 , which is built up by orbital singlet ions.

Moreover, the electrical activation and the number of DW magnons at a frequency can be controlled by applying symmetry-breaking static magnetic field, adding tunability of signal transmission by them.

High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy or spectroscopy shows mesoscale, highly ordered, and uniform THPB HOF domains, while angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy highlights a FB over the whole Brillouin zone.

  abstract     = {In time-reversal invariant systems, all charge Hall effects predicted so far are extrinsic effects due to the dependence on the relaxation time. We explore intrinsic Hall signatures by studying the quantum noise spectrum of the Hall current in time-reversal invariant systems, and discover intrinsic thermal Hall noises in both linear and nonlinear regimes. As the band geometric characteristics, quantum geometric tensor and Berry curvature play critical roles in various Hall effects; so do their quantum fluctuations. It is found that the thermal Hall noise in linear order of the electric field is purely intrinsic, and the second-order thermal Hall noise has both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions. In particular, the intrinsic part of the second-order thermal Hall noise is a manifestation of the quantum fluctuation of the quantum geometric tensor, which widely exists as long as Berry curvature is nonzero. These intrinsic thermal Hall noises provide direct measurable means to band geometric information, including Berry curvature related quantities and quantum fluctuation of quantum geometric tensor.},

  abstract     = {Electroluminescence from single molecules adsorbed on a conducting surface imposes conflicting demands for the molecule-electrode coupling. To conduct electrons, the molecular orbitals need to be hybridized with the electrodes. To emit light, they need to be decoupled from the electrodes to prevent fluorescence quenching. Here, we show that fully quenched 2,6-core-substituted naphthalene diimide derivative in a self-assembled monolayer directly deposited on a Au(111) surface can be activated with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope to decouple the relevant frontier orbitals from the metallic substrate. In this way, individual molecules can be driven from a strongly hybridized state with quenched luminescence to a light-emitting state. The emission performance compares in terms of quantum efficiency, stability, and reproducibility to that of single molecules deposited on thin insulating layers. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the emitted light originates from the singly charged cationic pair of the molecules.},

Hybrid kinetic-magnetohydrodynamic simulations reveal an edge resonant transport layer activated by the 3D perturbative field as the responsible mechanism for the fast-ion redistribution.

  abstract     = {Convection in radial force fields is a fundamental process behind weather on Earth and the Sun, as well as magnetic dynamo action in both. Until now, benchtop experiments have been unable to study convection in radial force fields due to the inability to generate radial forces of sufficient strength. Recently, it has been appreciated that sound, when averaged over many cycles, exerts a force on density gradients in the gas it travels through. The acoustic radiation pressure on thermal gradients draws cooler gas to regions with large time-averaged acoustic velocity and can be modeled as an effective acoustic gravity. We have constructed a system which generates a high amplitude, spherically symmetric acoustic wave in a rotating spherical bulb containing weakly ionized sulfur gas. Without sound, the gas stratifies itself into an initial state with the warmest gas near the center of the bulb, and the coolest gas near the bulb surface. When the sound is initiated, the acoustic radiation pressure is not balanced and a convective instability is triggered. With high speed videography, we observe the initial shape and growth rate of the most unstable mode at various acoustic amplitudes. Acoustic and rotational forces both contribute to the detailed mode shape, which changes qualitatively at low amplitudes where acoustic forces no longer surpass rotational ones everywhere in the bulb.},

Although self-similar power-law pinch-off is well documented for threads of Newtonian fluids, we report that when a viscoelastic layer is formed in situ at the interface, the pinch-off dynamics follows an exponential decay. Recently, such exponential neck thinning was found theoretically when surface viscous effects were taken into account. We introduce a simple approach to calculate the effective relaxation time of viscoelastic interfaces and estimate the thickness of the interfacial layer and the viscoelastic properties of liquid-fluid interfaces, where the direct measurement of interfacial rheology is not possible.},

  abstract     = {Optomechanics is a prime example of light matter interaction, where photons directly couple to phonons, allowing the precise control and measurement of the state of a mechanical object. This makes it a very appealing platform for testing fundamental physics or for sensing applications. Usually, such mechanical oscillators are in highly excited thermal states and require cooling to the mechanical ground state for quantum applications, which is often accomplished by using optomechanical backaction. However, while massive mechanical oscillators are desirable for many tasks, their frequency usually decreases below the cavity linewidth, significantly limiting the methods that can be used to efficiently cool. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach relying on an intrinsically nonlinear cavity to backaction-cool a low frequency mechanical oscillator. We experimentally demonstrate outperforming an identical, but linear, system by more than 1 order of magnitude. Furthermore, our theory predicts that with this approach we can also surpass the standard cooling limit of a linear system. By exploiting a nonlinear cavity, our approach enables efficient cooling of a wider range of optomechanical systems, opening new opportunities for fundamental tests and sensing.},

As a result, the discrete peaks in the photoelectron energy spectrum correlated with the HHe + from the dissociative in-droplet molecule shift to higher energies. Based on the electron-nuclear correlation, the photoelectrons with higher energies are correlated to the nuclei of the low-vibrationally excited molecular ion as the nuclei share less photon energy. Our time-dependent nuclear wave packet quantum simulation using a simplified He − H 2 + system confirms the joint contribution of the driving laser field and the neighboring He atoms to the dissociation dynamics of the solute molecular ion.

This has been achieved by using a seminumerical technique for the two-loop vertex and box diagrams, based on Feynman parameters and dispersion relations for one of the two subloops. UV divergences are treated with suitable subtraction terms. Numerical results for the unpolarized differential and integrated cross section at center-of-mass energy 240 GeV are provided. The new corrections are found to increase the predicted cross section by 0.7\%.},

  abstract     = {We study the dynamics of perturbations around nonthermal fixed points associated with universal scaling phenomena in quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium. For an N -component scalar quantum field theory in 3 + 1 space-time dimensions, we determine the stability scaling exponents using a self-consistent large- N expansion to next-to-leading order. Our analysis reveals the presence of both stable and unstable perturbations, the latter leading to quasiexponential deviations from the fixed point in the infrared. We identify a tower of far-from-equilibrium quasiparticle states and their dispersion relations by computing the spectral function. With the help of linear response theory, we demonstrate that unstable dynamics arises from a competition between elastic scattering processes among the quasiparticle states. What ultimately renders the fixed point dynamically attractive is the phenomenon of a “scaling instability,” which is the universal scaling of the unstable regime toward the infrared due to a self-similar quasiparticle cascade. Our results provide ab initio understanding of emergent stability properties in self-organized scaling phenomena.},

  abstract     = {In the past two decades, quantum key distribution networks based on telecom fibers have been implemented on metropolitan and intercity scales. One of the bottlenecks lies in the exponential decay of the key rate with respect to the transmission distance. Recently proposed schemes mainly focus on achieving longer distances by creating a long-arm single-photon interferometer over two communication parties. Despite their advantageous performance over long communication distances, the requirement of phase locking between two remote lasers is technically challenging. By adopting the recently proposed mode-pairing idea, we realize high-performance quantum key distribution without global phase locking. Using two independent off-the-shelf lasers, we show a quadratic key-rate improvement over the conventional measurement-device-independent schemes in the regime of metropolitan and intercity distances. For longer distances, we also boost the key rate performance by 3 orders of magnitude via 304 km commercial fiber and 407 km ultralow-loss fiber. We expect this ready-to-implement high-performance scheme to be widely used in future intercity quantum communication networks.},

  abstract     = {Gate-based quantum computation has been extensively investigated using quantum circuits based on qubits. In many cases, such qubits are actually made out of multilevel systems but with only two states being used for computational purpose. While such a strategy has the advantage of being in line with the common binary logic, it in some sense wastes the ready-for-use resources in the large Hilbert space of these intrinsic multidimensional systems. Quantum computation beyond qubits (e.g., using qutrits or qudits) has thus been discussed and argued to be more efficient than its qubit counterpart in certain scenarios. However, one of the essential elements for qutrit-based quantum computation, two-qutrit quantum gate, remains a major challenge. In this Letter, we propose and demonstrate a highly efficient and scalable two-qutrit quantum gate in superconducting quantum circuits. Using a tunable coupler to control the cross-Kerr coupling between two qutrits, our scheme realizes a two-qutrit conditional phase gate with fidelity 89.3\% by combining simple pulses applied to the coupler with single-qutrit operations. We further use such a two-qutrit gate to prepare an EPR state of two qutrits with a fidelity of 95.5\%. Our scheme takes advantage of a tunable qutrit-qutrit coupling with a large on:off ratio. It therefore offers both high efficiency and low crosstalk between qutrits, thus being friendly for scaling up. Our Letter constitutes an important step toward scalable qutrit-based quantum computation.},

However, generating high-fidelity gates, in a scalable manner, remains a major challenge in all quantum information processing platforms. Accordingly, improving the fidelity and robustness of these gates has been a research focus in recent years. In trapped ions quantum computers, entangling gates are performed by driving the normal modes of motion of the ion chain, generating a spin-dependent force. Even though there has been significant progress in increasing the robustness and modularity of these gates, they are still sensitive to noise in the intensity of the driving field. Here we supplement the conventional spin-dependent displacement with spin-dependent squeezing, which creates a new interaction, that enables a gate that is robust to deviations in the amplitude of the driving field. We solve the general Hamiltonian and engineer its spectrum analytically. We also endow our gate with other, more conventional, robustness properties, making it resilient to many practical sources of noise and inaccuracies.},

Here, we experimentally demonstrate a 99.920(7)\%-fidelity controlled- not gate by suppressing the complicated noise in a solid-state spin system at room temperature. We found that the fidelity limited at 99\% in previous works results from considering only static classical noise, and, thus, in this work, a complete noise model is constructed by also considering the time dependence and the quantum nature of the spin bath. All noises in the model are dynamically corrected by an exquisitely designed shaped pulse, giving the resulting error below 10 − 4 . The residual gate error is mainly originated from the longitudinal relaxation and the waveform distortion that can both be further reduced technically. Our noise-resistant method is universal and will benefit other solid-state spin systems.},

In these systems, there is a natural separation of scales between the strong intrachain interactions and the weak interchain coupling. When the intrachain interactions are integrable, weak interchain couplings play a crucial part in thermalizing the system. Here, we develop a Boltzmann-equation formalism involving a collision integral that is asymptotically exact for any interacting integrable system, and apply it to develop a quantitative theory of relaxation in coupled Bose gases in the experimentally relevant Newton’s cradle setup. We find that relaxation involves a broad spectrum of timescales. We provide evidence that the Markov process governing relaxation at late times is gapless ; thus, the approach to equilibrium is generally nonexponential, even for spatially uniform perturbations.},

As the polymerization front transforms the liquid monomer into the solid polymer, the large thermal gradients associated with the propagating front sustain a natural convection of the fluid ahead of the front. The fluid convection in turn affects the reaction-diffusion (RD) dynamics and the shape of the front. Detailed multiphysics numerical analyses and particle image velocimetry experiments reveal this coupling between natural convection and frontal polymerization. The frontal Rayleigh (Ra) number affects the magnitude of the velocity field and the inclination of the front. A higher Ra number drives instability during FP, leading to the observation of thermal-chemical patterns with tunable wavelengths and magnitudes.},

Both effects can be traced back to the underlying moiré pattern in the MoSe 2 homobilayers, as confirmed by our low-energy continuum model for different moiré excitons. We identify two distinct intralayer moiré excitons for R stacking, while H stacking yields two degenerate intralayer excitons due to inversion symmetry. In both cases, bright interlayer excitons are found at higher energies.

This DQCP occurs in an unusual setting, namely, at the edge of a ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase with Z 2 × Z 2 symmetry. The DQCP describes a transition between two gapped edges that break different Z 2 subgroups of the full Z 2 × Z 2 symmetry. Our construction is based on an exact mapping between the SPT edge theory and a Z 4 spin chain. This mapping reveals that DQCPs in this system are directly related to ordinary Z 4 symmetry breaking critical points.},

Here, we present a new perspective on their electronic structure from simple model Hamiltonians and ab initio calculations. We focus on a specific set of nanoribbons of width n = 3 p + 2 , where n is the number of carbon atoms across the nanoribbon axis and p is a positive integer. We demonstrate that the energy-gap opening in these nanoribbons originates from the breaking of a previously unidentified hidden symmetry by long-ranged hopping of π electrons and structural distortions occurring at the edges. This hidden symmetry can be restored or manipulated through the application of in-plane lattice strain, which enables continuous energy-gap tuning, the emergence of Dirac points at the Fermi level, and topological quantum phase transitions. Our work establishes an original interpretation of the semiconducting character of armchair graphene nanoribbons and offers guidelines for rationally designing their electronic structure.},

Using a parton-based mean-field approach, we obtain the interacting phase diagram for an electronic two-orbital model with tunable topology in a two-dimensional amorphous network. In addition to the (non-)topological phases that are adiabatically connected to the free fermion limit, we find a number of strongly interacting amorphous analogs of crystalline Mott insulating phases with nontrivial chiral neutral edge modes, and a fractionalized Anderson insulating phase. The amorphous networks thus provide a new playground for studying a plethora of exotic states of matter, and their glassy dynamics, due to the combined effects of nontrivial topology, disorder, and strong interactions.},

We determine various critical exponents and reveal the water chain QPT to belong to the ( 1 + 1 )-dimensional Ising universality class. Furthermore, the effect of breaking symmetries is examined, and it is shown that, by breaking the inversion symmetry, the ground state degeneracy of the ordered quantum phase is lifted to yield two many-body states with opposite polarization. The possibility of forming ferroelectric phases together with a thermal stability of the quantum critical regime up to ∼ 10 K makes the linear water chain a promising candidate as a platform for quantum devices.},

However, only recently has it been realized theoretically that in the presence of gauge symmetry, the algebraic structure of symmetries can be projectively represented, which possibly enables the switch between spinless and spinful topological phases. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of this idea by realizing spinful topological phases in “spinless” acoustic crystals with projective space-time inversion symmetry. In particular, we realize a one-dimensional topologically gapped phase characterized by a 2 Z winding number, which features double-degenerate bands in the entire Brillouin zone and two pairs of degenerate topological boundary modes. Our Letter thus overcomes a fundamental constraint on topological phases by spin classes.},

To access the intermediate coupling limit, we invoke large- N limits of Fermi liquids with repulsive BCS interactions that admit saddle point solutions. We show that the requirements for long-range PDW order are that the repulsive BCS couplings must be nonmonotonic in space and that their strength must exceed a threshold value.

We analyze the nonequilibrium properties and calculate the dynamic structure factor. Its structure differs in compressible and insulating phases. In particular, the low-energy excitations in compressible phases are linear phonons. We extract the speed of sound and analyze its dependence on dipolar interaction and density. We show that it exhibits a nontrivial behavior owing to the breaking of Galilean invariance. We argue that an experimental detection of this previously unknown quantum liquid could provide a fingerprint of the superexchange process and open intriguing possibilities for investigating non-Galilean invariant liquids.},

However, such lifetimes are observed only at zero temperature. At room temperature, blackbody-radiation-induced transfers cancel this essential asset of circular states, which have thus been used mostly so far in specific, complex cryogenic experiments. We demonstrate here, on a laser-cooled atomic sample, a circular state lifetime of more than 1 millisecond at room temperature for a principal quantum number 60. A simple plane-parallel capacitor efficiently inhibits the blackbody-radiation-induced transfers. One of the capacitor electrodes is fully transparent and provides large optical access to the atoms.

The spin diffusion in nonuniform magnetic fields causes broadening of the resonance and limits the sensitivity and the spectral resolution in applications like magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Here, by observation of the parity-time (PT) phase transition of diffusive spins in gradient magnetic fields, we show that the spatial degrees of freedom of atoms could become a resource, rather than harmful, for high-precision measurement of weak signals. In the normal phase with zero or low gradient fields, the diffusion results in dissipation of spin precession. However, by increasing the field gradient, the spin system undergoes a PT transition, and enters the PT symmetry broken phase. In this novel phase, the spin precession frequency splits due to spatial localization of the eigenmodes. We demonstrate that, using these spatial-motion-induced split frequencies, the spin system can serve as a stable magnetometer, whose output is insensitive to the inevitable long-term drift of control parameters. This opens a door to detect extremely weak signals in imperfectly controlled environments.},

  abstract     = {We characterize numerically the dominant dynamical regimes in a superfluid ultracold fermionic Josephson junction. Beyond the coherent Josephson plasma regime, we discuss the onset and physical mechanism of dissipation due to the superflow exceeding a characteristic speed, and provide clear evidence distinguishing its physical mechanism across the weakly and strongly interacting limits, despite qualitative dynamics of global characteristics being only weakly sensitive to the operating dissipative mechanism. Specifically, dissipation in the strongly interacting regime occurs through the phase-slippage process, caused by the emission and propagation of quantum vortices, and sound waves—similar to the Bose-Einstein condensation limit. Instead, in the weak interaction limit, the main dissipative channel arises through the pair-breaking mechanism.},

A striking exception are ultralong-range Rydberg molecules, for which dynamics is dramatically slowed down as a consequence of the huge bond length of up to several micrometers. Here, we report on the direct observation of vibrational dynamics of a recently observed Rydberg-atom-ion molecule. By applying a weak external electric field of a few millivolts per centimeter, we are able to control the orientation of the photoassociated ultralong-range Rydberg molecules and induce vibrational dynamics by quenching the electric field. A high resolution ion microscope allows us to detect the molecule’s orientation and its temporal vibrational dynamics in real space. Our study opens the door to the control of molecular dynamics in Rydberg molecules.},

  abstract     = {A gas of interacting fermions confined in a quasi one-dimensional geometry shows a BEC to BCS crossover upon slowly driving its coupling constant through a confinement-induced resonance. On one side of the crossover the fermions form tightly bound bosonic molecules behaving as a repulsive Bose gas, while on the other they form Cooper pairs, whose size is much larger than the average interparticle distance. Here we consider the situation arising when the coupling constant is varied suddenly from the BEC to the BCS value. Namely, we study a BEC-to-BCS quench. By exploiting a suitable continuum limit of recently discovered solvable quenches in the Hubbard model, we show that the local stationary state reached at large times after the quench can be determined exactly by means of the quench action approach. We provide an experimentally accessible characterization of the stationary state by computing local pair correlation function as well as the quasiparticle distribution functions. We find that the steady state is increasingly dominated by two-particle spin singlet bound states for stronger interaction strength, but that bound state formation is inhibited at larger BEC density. The bound state rapidity distribution displays quartic power-law decay suggesting a violation of Tan’s contact relations.},

In this reaction, two hadrons are produced in opposite hemispheres along the z axis in the virtual photon-target nucleon center-of-mass frame, with the first hadron produced in the current-fragmentation region and the second in the target-fragmentation region. The data were taken with longitudinally polarized electron beams of 10.2 and 10.6 GeV incident on an unpolarized liquid-hydrogen target using the CLAS12 spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. Observed nonzero sin Δ ϕ modulations in e p → e ′ p π + X events, where Δ ϕ is the difference of the azimuthal angles of the proton and pion in the virtual photon and target nucleon center-of-mass frame, indicate that correlations between the spin and transverse momenta of hadrons produced in the target- and current-fragmentation regions may be significant. The measured beam-spin asymmetries provide a first access in dihadron production to a previously unexplored leading-twist spin- and transverse-momentum-dependent fracture function. The fracture functions describe the hadronization of the target remnant after the hard scattering of a virtual photon off a quark in the target particle and provide a new avenue for studying nucleonic structure and hadronization.},

A generalization of the approach to gauge symmetries has faced the problem of defining gauge-independent observables and, therefore, has not been developed so far. We employ the large-charge expansion to calculate the scaling dimension of the lowest-lying operators carrying U ( 1 ) charge Q in the critical Abelian Higgs model in D = 4 − ε dimensions to leading and next-to-leading orders in the charge and all orders in the ε expansion. Remarkably, the results match our independent diagrammatic computation of the three-loop scaling dimension of the operator ϕ Q ( x ) in the Landau gauge. We argue that this matching is a consequence of the equivalence between the gauge-independent dressed two-point function of Dirac type with the gauge-dependent two-point function of ϕ Q ( x ) in the Landau gauge. We, therefore, shed new light on the problem of defining gauge-independent exponents which has been controversial in the literature on critical superconductors, as well as lay the foundation for large-charge methods in gauge theories.},

We employ modern scattering amplitude and loop integration techniques, in particular numerical unitarity, integration-by-parts identities, and the method of regions. The conservative potential in terms of rest-frame spin vectors is extracted by matching to a nonrelativistic effective field theory. We also apply the Kosower-Maybee-O’Connell (KMOC) formalism to calculate the impulse in the covariant spin formalism directly from the amplitude. We work systematically in conventional dimensional regularization and explicitly evaluate all divergent integrals that appear in full- and effective-theory amplitudes, as well as in the phase-space integrals that arise in the KMOC formalism.},

  abstract     = {The ringdown signal emitted during a binary black hole coalescence can be modeled as a linear superposition of the characteristic damped modes of the remnant black hole that get excited during the merger phase. While checking the consistency of the measured frequencies and damping times against the Kerr BH spectrum predicted by general relativity (GR) is a cornerstone of strong-field tests of gravity, the consistency of measured excitation amplitudes and phases have been largely left unexplored. For a nonprecessing, quasicircular binary black hole merger, we find that GR predicts a narrow region in the space of mode amplitude ratio and phase difference, independently of the spin of the binary components. Using this unexpected result, we develop a new null test of strong-field gravity which demands that the measured amplitudes and phases of different ringdown modes should lie within this narrow region predicted by GR. We call this the amplitude-phase consistency test and introduce a procedure for performing it using information from the ringdown signal. Lastly, we apply this test to the GW190521 event, using the multimodal ringdown parameters inferred by Capano et al. [ arXiv:2105.05238 ]. While ringdown measurements errors for this event are large, we show that GW190521 is consistent with the amplitude-phase consistency test. Our test is particularly well suited for accommodating multiple loud ringdown detections as those expected in the near future, and can be used complementarily to standard black-hole spectroscopy as a proxy for modified gravity, compact objects other than black holes, binary precession and eccentricity.},

In doing so, we discovered that, in the original proof by D’Ariano and Presti, only sufficiency was shown, not the full equivalence between faithfulness of state and invertibility of the corresponding Jamiołkowski map. We complete the proof by showing necessity and examine how far this characterization of faithfulness can be generalized by applying it to various classes of quantum channels. We also explore a more general notion we call sensitivity, the property of quantum state being altered by any nontrivial action of quantum channel. We study their relationship by characterizing both properties for important classes of quantum channels such as unital channels, random unitary operations, and unitary operations. Unexpected (non)equivalence results among them shed light on the structure of quantum channels by showing that we need only two classes of quantum states for characterizing quantum states faithful or sensitive to various subclasses of quantum channels.},

It is shown here that, even if all but one particle are fixed in generic positions, the excited states of the moving particle are chaotic. They are characterized by the number of principal components (NPC)—the number of integrable system eigenstates involved into the nonintegrable one, which increases linearly with the number of strong scatterers. This rule is a particular case of the general effect of an additional perturbation on the system chaotic properties. The perturbation independence criteria supposing the system chaoticity increase are derived here as well. The effect can be observed in experiments with photons or cold atoms as the decay of observable fluctuation variance, which is inversely proportional to NPC and, therefore, to the number of scatterers. This decay indicates that the eigenstate thermalization is approached. The results are confirmed by numerical calculations for a harmonic waveguide with zero-range scatterers along its axis.},

However, the preparation of some correlated states can carry a substantial cost that should be compared against its value. We show that classical correlations generated in information erasure can be catalytically exploited, which enables us to mitigate the resulting dissipation of heat and entropy. Because these correlations are a byproduct of erasure, they can be considered free. Our framework consists of a composition of two transformations, where an initial erasure transformation is followed by a catalytic mitigation of dissipation. Although we also show that maximum erasure with minimum dissipation and no correlations is theoretically possible, catalysts are always useful in practical erasure settings, where correlations are expected to take place.},

  abstract     = {Tracer dynamics in the symmetric exclusion process (SEP), where hard-core particles diffuse on an infinite one-dimensional lattice, is a paradigmatic model of anomalous diffusion. While the equilibrium situation has received a lot of attention, the case where the tracer is driven by an external force, which provides a minimal model of nonequilibrium transport in confined crowded environments, remains largely unexplored. Indeed, the only available analytical results concern the means of both the position of the tracer and the lattice occupation numbers in its frame of reference and higher-order moments but only in the high-density limit. Here, we provide a general hydrodynamic framework that allows us to determine the first cumulants of the bath-tracer correlations and of the tracer’s position in function of the driving force, up to quadratic order (beyond linear response). This result constitutes the first determination of the bias dependence of the variance of a driven tracer in the SEP for an arbitrary density. The framework presented here can be applied, beyond the SEP, to more general configurations of a driven tracer in interaction with obstacles in one dimension.},

Despite identification of molecular factors that regulate organelle sizes we lack insight into the quantitative principles underlying organelle size control. Here we show experimentally that cells can robustly control average fluctuations in organelle size. By demonstrating that organelle sizes obey a universal scaling relationship we predict theoretically, our framework suggests that organelles grow in random bursts from a limiting pool of building blocks. Burstlike growth provides a general biophysical mechanism by which cells can maintain on average reliable yet plastic organelle sizes.},

Recently, fast growing efforts are invested to the braiding topology of complex Bloch bands in non-Hermitian systems. This new classification of band topology goes far beyond those established in Hermitian counterparts. Here, we present the first acoustic realization of the topological non-Hermitian Bloch braids, based on a two-band model easily accessible for realizing any desired knot structure. The non-Hermitian bands are synthesized by a simple binary cavity-tube system, where the long-range, complex-valued, and momentum-resolved couplings are accomplished by a well-controlled unidirectional coupler. In addition to directly visualizing various two-band braiding patterns, we unambiguously observe the highly elusive topological phase transitions between them. Not only do our results provide a direct demonstration for the non-Hermitian band topology, but also the experimental techniques open new avenues for designing unconventional acoustic metamaterials.},

Here we investigate the interface between two spin chains in different chiral phases. Surprisingly, the mean field theory approximation of this interacting composite system is given in terms of Dirac fermions in a curved space-time geometry. In particular, the interface between the two phases represents a black hole horizon. We demonstrate that this representation is faithful both analytically, by employing bosonization to obtain a Luttinger liquid model, and numerically, by employing matrix product state methods. A striking prediction from the black hole equivalence emerges when a quench, at one side of the interface between two opposite chiralities, causes the other side to thermalize with the Hawking temperature for a wide range of parameters and initial conditions.},

Here we show, by means of momentum-space quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization, in chiral limit there exists a unique thermodynamic characteristic for the correlated flat-band model with interaction-driven quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) ground state, namely, the transition from the QAH insulator to the metallic state takes place at a much lower temperature compared with the zero-temperature single-particle gap generated by the long-range Coulomb interaction. Such low transition temperature comes from the proliferation of excitonic particle-hole excitations, which transfers the electrons across the gap between different topological bands to restore the broken time-reversal symmetry and gives rise to a pronounced enhancement in the charge compressibility. Future experiments, to verify such generic thermodynamic characteristics, are proposed.},

We show that electron radiative polarization emerges during the instability along the azimuthal direction in the momentum space, which significantly varies across the regimes. We put forward an intuitive Hamiltonian model to trace the origin of the electron polarization dynamics. In particular, we discern the role of nonlinear transverse motion of plasma filaments, which induces asymmetry in radiative spin flips, yielding an accumulation of electron polarization. Our results break the conventional perception that quasisymmetric fields are inefficient for generating radiative spin-polarized beams, suggesting the potential of electron polarization as a source of new information on laboratory and astrophysical plasma instabilities.},

It is shown that the particle deformability has a strong impact on their distribution in the network. For sufficiently soft particles, we observe a short memory behavior from one bifurcation to the next, and the overall behavior consists in a random partition of particles, exhibiting a diffusionlike transport. On the contrary, stiff enough particles undergo a biased distribution whereby they follow a deterministic partition at bifurcations, due to long memory. This leads to a lateral ballistic drift in the network at small concentration and anomalous superdiffusion at larger concentration, even though the network is ordered. A further increase of concentration enhances particle-particle interactions which shorten the memory effect, turning the particle anomalous diffusion into a classical diffusion. We expect the drifting and diffusive regime transition to be generic for deformable particles.},

  abstract     = {The transportation of photons and phonons typically obeys the principle of reciprocity. Breaking reciprocity of these bosonic excitations will enable the corresponding nonreciprocal devices, such as isolators and circulators. Here, we use two optical modes and two mechanical modes in a microresonator to form a four-mode plaquette via radiation pressure force. The phase-controlled nonreciprocal routing between any two modes with completely different frequencies is demonstrated, including the routing of phonon to phonon (megahertz to megahertz), photon to phonon (terahertz to megahertz), and especially photon to photon with frequency difference of around 80 THz for the first time. In addition, one more mechanical mode is introduced to this plaquette to realize a phononic circulator in such single microresonator. The nonreciprocity is derived from interference between multimode transfer processes involving optomechanical interactions in an optomechanical resonator. It not only demonstrates the nonreciprocal routing of photons and phonons in a single resonator but also realizes the nonreciprocal frequency conversion for photons and circulation for phonons, laying a foundation for studying directional routing and thermal management in an optomechanical hybrid network.},

  abstract     = {The atomic masses of Sc 55 , Ti 56 , 58 , and V 56 − 59 have been determined using the high-precision multireflection time-of-flight technique. The radioisotopes have been produced at RIKEN’s Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) and delivered to the novel designed gas cell and multireflection system, which has been recently commissioned downstream of the ZeroDegree spectrometer following the BigRIPS separator. For Ti 56 , 58 and V 56 − 59 , the mass uncertainties have been reduced down to the order of 10 keV, shedding new light on the N = 34 shell effect in Ti and V isotopes by the first high-precision mass measurements of the critical species Ti 58 and V 59 . With the new precision achieved, we reveal the nonexistence of the N = 34 empirical two-neutron shell gaps for Ti and V, and the enhanced energy gap above the occupied ν p 3 / 2 orbit is identified as a feature unique to Ca. We perform new Monte Carlo shell model calculations including the ν d 5 / 2 and ν g 9 / 2 orbits and compare the results with conventional shell model calculations, which exclude the ν g 9 / 2 and the ν d 5 / 2 orbits. The comparison indicates that the shell gap reduction in Ti is related to a partial occupation of the higher orbitals for the outer two valence neutrons at N = 34 .},

We observe no evidence of light sterile neutrino oscillations and derive exclusion contours at the 95\% confidence level in the plane of the mass-squared splitting Δ m 41 2 and the sterile neutrino mixing angles θ μ e and θ e e , excluding part of the parameter space allowed by experimental anomalies. Cancellation of ν e appearance and ν e disappearance effects due to the full 3 + 1 treatment of the analysis leads to a degeneracy when determining the oscillation parameters, which is discussed in this Letter and will be addressed by future analyses.},

For example, a gravastar which satisfies the weak energy condition turns out to be dynamically unstable. A thin-layer black hole mimicker is stable only if it has positive pressure and negative surface density (such as a wormhole), or vice versa.},

This puzzling property can be avoided by adopting a supertranslation-invariant definition of the angular momentum flux in general relativity. Definitions currently available in the literature cannot reproduce the flux necessary to obtain the correct radiation reaction effects in gravitational scattering. They also disagree with computations of the flux performed using scattering amplitudes and soft-graviton theorems. In this Letter, we provide a new supertranslation-invariant definition of the angular momentum flux in gravitational scattering that uses only asymptotic metric data and reproduces the flux necessary to obtain the correct radiation reaction effects.},

In this Letter, by considering such structural information, we derive a unified topological speed limit for the evolution of physical states using an optimal transport approach. We prove that the minimum time required for changing states is lower bounded by the discrete Wasserstein distance, which encodes the topological information of the system, and the time-averaged velocity. The bound obtained is tight and applicable to a wide range of dynamics, from deterministic to stochastic, and classical to quantum systems. In addition, the bound provides insight into the design principles of the optimal process that attains the maximum speed. We demonstrate the application of our results to chemical reaction networks and interacting many-body quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement entropy is a powerful tool in characterizing universal features in quantum many-body systems. In quantum chaotic Hermitian systems, typical eigenstates have near maximal entanglement with very small fluctuations. Here, we show that for Hamiltonians displaying non-Hermitian many-body quantum chaos, modeled by the Ginibre ensemble, the entanglement entropy of typical eigenstates is greatly suppressed. The entropy does not grow with the Hilbert space dimension for sufficiently large systems, and the fluctuations are of equal order. We derive the novel entanglement spectrum that has infinite support in the complex plane and strong energy dependence. We provide evidence of universality, and similar behavior is found in the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, indicating the general applicability of the Ginibre ensemble to dissipative many-body quantum chaos.},

  abstract     = {Intriguingly, quantum many-body systems may defy thermalization even without disorder. One example is so-called fragmented models, where the many-body Hilbert space fragments into dynamically disconnected subspaces that are not determined by the global symmetries of the model. In this Letter we demonstrate that the tilted one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model naturally realizes distinct effective Hamiltonians that are expected to support nonergodic behavior due to fragmentation, even at resonances between the tilt energy and the Hubbard on site interaction. We find that the effective description captures the observed dynamics in experimentally accessible parameter ranges of moderate tilt values. Specifically, we observe a pronounced dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the initial doublon fraction, which directly reveals the microscopic processes of the fragmented model. Our results pave the way for future studies of nonergodic behavior in higher dimensions.},
