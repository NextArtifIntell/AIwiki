  abstract     = {The elementary excitations in weakly interacting quantum fluids have a nontrivial nature which is at the basis of defining quantum phenomena such as superfluidity. These excitations and the physics they lead to have been explored in closed quantum systems at thermal equilibrium both theoretically within the celebrated Bogoliubov framework and experimentally in quantum fluids of ultracold atoms. Over the past decade, the relevance of Bogoliubov excitations has become essential to understand quantum fluids of interacting photons. Their driven-dissipative character leads to distinct properties with respect to their equilibrium counterparts. For instance, the condensate coupling to the photonic vacuum environment leads to a nonzero generation rate of elementary excitations with many striking implications. In this work, considering that quantum fluids of light are often hosted in solid-state systems, we show within a joint theory-experiment analysis that the vibrations of the crystal constitute another environment that the condensate is fundamentally coupled to. This coupling leads to a unique heat transfer mechanism, resulting in a large generation rate of elementary excitations in typical experimental conditions, and to a fundamental nonzero contribution at vanishing temperatures. Our work provides a complete framework for solid-embedded quantum fluids of light, which is invaluable in view of achieving a regime dominated by photon-vacuum fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {A number of commercially available quantum computers, such as those based on trapped-ion or superconducting qubits, can now perform mid-circuit measurements and resets. In addition to being crucial for quantum error correction, this capability can help reduce the number of qubits needed to execute many types of quantum algorithms by measuring qubits as early as possible, resetting them, and reusing them elsewhere in the circuit. In this work, we introduce the idea of qubit-reuse compilation, which takes as input a quantum circuit and produces as output a compiled circuit that requires fewer qubits to execute due to qubit reuse. We present two algorithms for performing qubit-reuse compilation: an exact constraint programming optimization model and a greedy heuristic. We introduce the concept of dual circuits , obtained by exchanging state preparations with measurements and vice versa and reversing time, and show that optimal qubit-reuse compilation requires the same number of qubits to execute a circuit as its dual. We illustrate the performance of these algorithms on a variety of relevant near-term quantum circuits, such as one-dimensional and two-dimensional time-evolution circuits, and numerically benchmark their performance on the quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm (QAOA) applied to the MaxCut problem on random three-regular graphs. To demonstrate the practical benefit of these techniques, we experimentally realize an 80-qubit QAOA MaxCut circuit on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum processor using qubit-reuse compilation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {After two decades of measurements, neutrino physics is now advancing into the precision era. With the long-baseline experiments designed to tackle current open questions, a new query arises: Can atmospheric neutrino experiments also play a role? To that end, we analyze the expected sensitivity of current and near-future water(ice)-Cherenkov atmospheric neutrino experiments in the context of standard three-flavor neutrino oscillations. In this first in-depth combined atmospheric neutrino analysis, we analyze the current shared systematic uncertainties arising from the common flux and neutrino-water interactions. We then implement the systematic uncertainties of each experiment in detail and develop the atmospheric neutrino simulations for Super-Kamiokande, with and without neutron-tagging capabilities, IceCube Upgrade, ORCA, and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors. We carefully review the synergies and features of these experiments to examine the potential of a joint analysis of these atmospheric neutrino data in resolving the θ 23 octant at 99\% confidence level (CL), and determining the neutrino mass ordering above 5 σ by 2030. Additionally, we assess the capability to constrain θ 13 and the C P -violating phase ( δ C P ) in the leptonic sector independently from reactor and accelerator neutrino data. A combination of the atmospheric neutrino measurements will enhance the sensitivity to a greater extent than the simple sum of individual experiment results reaching more than 3 σ for some values of δ C P . These results will provide vital information for next-generation accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande.},

  abstract     = {Individuals involved in common group activities or settings, e.g., college students that are enrolled in the same class and/or live in the same dorm, are exposed to recurrent contacts of physical proximity. These contacts are known to mediate the spread of an infectious disease; however, it is not obvious how the properties of the spreading process are determined by the structure of and the interrelation among the group settings that are at the root of those recurrent interactions. Here, we show that reshaping the organization of groups within a population can be used as an effective strategy to decrease the severity of an epidemic. Specifically, we show that when group structures are sufficiently correlated, e.g., the likelihood for two students living in the same dorm to attend the same class is sufficiently high, outbreaks are longer but milder than for uncorrelated group structures. Also, we show that the effectiveness of interventions for disease containment increases as the correlation among group structures increases. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our findings by taking advantage of data about housing and attendance of students at the Indiana University campus in Bloomington. By appropriately optimizing the assignment of students to dorms based on their enrollment, we are able to observe a twofold to fivefold reduction in the severity of simulated epidemic processes.},

While existing tools in statistical inference, such as maximum entropy models, reproduce the empirical steady-state distributions, it remains challenging to learn dynamical models. We present a novel inference method, called generalized Glauber dynamics. Constructed through a non-Markovian fluctuation dissipation theorem, generalized Glauber dynamics tunes the dynamics of an interacting system, while keeping the steady-state distribution fixed. We motivate the need for the method on real data from Eco-HAB, an automated habitat for testing behavior in groups of mice under seminaturalistic conditions, and present it on simple Ising spin systems. We show its applicability for experimental data by inferring dynamical models of social interactions in a group of mice that reproduce both its collective behavior and the long tails observed in individual dynamics.},

A Mott insulator with the simplest degree of freedom is an ideal and highly desirable system for studying the fundamental physics of Mottness. In this study, we have unambiguously identified such an anticipated Mott insulator in a van der Waals layered compound Nb 3 Cl 8 . In the high-temperature phase, where interlayer coupling is negligible, density functional theory calculations for the monolayer of Nb 3 Cl 8 suggest a half-filled flat band at the Fermi level, whereas angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments observe a large gap. This observation is perfectly reproduced by dynamical mean-field theory calculations considering strong electron correlations, indicating a correlation-driven Mott insulator state. Since this half-filled band derived from a single 2 a 1 orbital is isolated from all other bands, the monolayer of Nb 3 Cl 8 is an ideal realization of the celebrated single-band Hubbard model. Upon decreasing the temperature, the bulk system undergoes a phase transition, where structural changes significantly enhance the interlayer coupling. This results in a bonding-antibonding splitting in the Hubbard bands, while the Mott gap remains dominant. Our discovery provides a simple and seminal model system for investigating Mott physics and other emerging correlated states.},

  abstract     = {Detection and parameter inference of gravitational-wave signals from compact mergers rely on the comparison of the incoming detector strain data d ( t ) to waveform templates for the gravitational-wave strain h ( t ) that ultimately rely on the resolution of Einstein’s equations via numerical relativity simulations. These, however, commonly output a quantity known as the Newman-Penrose scalar ψ 4 ( t ) which, under the Bondi gauge, is related to the gravitational-wave strain by ψ 4 ( t ) = d 2 h ( t ) / d t 2 . Therefore, obtaining strain templates involves an integration process that introduces artifacts that need to be treated in a rather manual way. By taking second-order finite differences on the detector data and inferring the corresponding background noise distribution, we develop a framework to perform gravitational-wave data analysis directly using ψ 4 ( t ) templates. We first demonstrate this formalism, and the impact of integration artifacts in strain templates, through the recovery of numerically simulated signals from head-on collisions of Proca stars injected in Advanced LIGO noise. Next, we reanalyze the event GW190521 under the hypothesis of a Proca-star merger, obtaining results equivalent to those previously published [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 126 , 081101 (2021) ], where we used the classical strain framework. We find, however, that integration errors would strongly impact our analysis if GW190521 was 4 times louder. Finally, we show that our framework fixes significant biases in the interpretation of the high-mass gravitational-wave trigger S200114f arising from the usage of strain templates. We remove the need to obtain strain waveforms from numerical relativity simulations, avoiding the associated systematic errors.},

  abstract     = {The neural dynamics generating sensory, motor, and cognitive functions are commonly understood through field theories for neural population activity. Classic neural field theories are derived from highly simplified models of individual neurons, while biological neurons are highly complex cells. Integrate-and-fire models retain a key nonlinear feature of neuronal activity: Action potentials return the membrane potential to a nearly fixed reset value. This nonlinear reset of the membrane voltage after a spike is absent from classic neural field theories. Here, we develop a statistical field theory for networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with stochastic spike emission. This reveals a new mean-field theory for the activity in these networks, fluctuation corrections to the mean-field dynamics, and a mapping to a self-consistent renewal process. We use these to study the impact of the spike-driven reset of the membrane voltage on population activity. The spike reset gives rise to a multiplicative, rate-dependent leak term in the mean-field membrane voltage dynamics. This leads to bistability between quiescent and active states in the mean-field theory of homogeneous and excitatory-inhibitory pulse-coupled networks. We uncover two types of fluctuation correction to the mean-field theory, due to the nonlinear mapping from membrane voltage to spike emission and the nonlinear reset. These can have competing effects, promoting and suppressing activity, respectively. We then examine the roles of spike resets and recurrent inhibition in stabilizing network activity. We calculate the phase diagram for inhibitory stabilization and find that an inhibition-stabilized regime occurs in wide regions of parameter space, consistent with experimental reports of inhibitory stabilization in diverse brain regions. Fluctuations narrow the region of inhibitory stabilization, consistent with their role in suppressing activity through spike resets.},

  abstract     = {We develop an analytical approach to the study of one-dimensional free fermions subject to random projective measurements of local site occupation numbers, based on the Keldysh path-integral formalism and replica trick. In the limit of rare measurements, γ / J ≪ 1 (where γ is measurement rate per site and J is hopping constant in the tight-binding model), we derive a nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) as an effective field theory of the problem. Its replica-symmetric sector is described by a U ( 2 ) / U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) ≃ S 2 sigma model with diffusive behavior, and the replica-asymmetric sector is a two-dimensional NLSM defined on SU ( R ) manifold with the replica limit R → 1 . On the Gaussian level, valid in the limit γ / J → 0 , this model predicts a logarithmic behavior for the second cumulant of number of particles in a subsystem and for the entanglement entropy. However, the one-loop renormalization group analysis allows us to demonstrate that this logarithmic growth saturates at a finite value ∼ ( J / γ ) 2 even for rare measurements, which corresponds to the area-law phase. This implies the absence of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition for free fermions. The crossover between logarithmic growth and saturation, however, happens at exponentially large scale, ln l corr ∼ J / γ . This makes this crossover very sharp as a function of the measurement frequency γ / J , which can be easily confused with a transition from the logarithmic to area law in finite-size numerical calculations. We have performed a careful numerical analysis, which supports our analytical predictions.},

  abstract     = {We derive field theory descriptions for measurement-induced phase transitions in free fermion systems. We focus on a multiflavor Majorana chain, undergoing Hamiltonian evolution with continuous monitoring of local fermion parity operators. Using the replica trick, we map the dynamics to the imaginary time evolution of an effective spin chain and use the number of flavors as a large parameter for a controlled derivation of the effective field theory. This is a nonlinear sigma model for an orthogonal N × N matrix, in the replica limit N → 1 . (On a boundary of the phase diagram, another sigma model with higher symmetry applies.) Together with known results for the renormalization-group beta function, this derivation establishes the existence of stable phases—nontrivially entangled and disentangled, respectively—in the physically relevant replica limit N → 1 . In the nontrivial phase, an asymptotically exact calculation shows that the bipartite entanglement entropy for a system of size L scales as ( ln L ) 2 , in contrast to findings in previously studied models. Varying the relative strength of Hamiltonian evolution and monitoring, as well as a dimerization parameter, the model’s phase diagram contains transitions out of the nontrivial phase, which we map to vortex-unbinding transitions in the sigma model, and also contains separate critical points on the measurement-only axis. We highlight the close analogies as well as the differences with the replica approach to Anderson transitions in disordered systems.},

  abstract     = {First-order nonequilibrium phase transitions observed in active matter, fluid dynamics, biology, climate science, and other systems with irreversible dynamics are challenging to analyze, because they cannot be inferred from a simple free energy minimization principle. Rather, the mechanism of these transitions depends crucially on the system’s dynamics, which requires us to analyze them in trajectory space rather than in phase space. Here, we consider situations where the path of these transitions can be characterized as the minimizer of an action, whose minimum value can be used in a nonequilibrium generalization of the Arrhenius law to calculate the system’s phase diagram. We also develop efficient numerical tools for the minimization of this action. These tools are general enough to be transportable to many situations of interest, in particular, when the fluctuations present in the microscopic system are non-Gaussian and its dynamics is not governed by the standard Langevin equation. As an illustration, first-order phase transitions in two spatially extended nonequilibrium systems are analyzed: a modified Ginzburg-Landau equation with a chemical potential which is nongradient and a reaction-diffusion network based on the Schlögl model. The phase diagrams of both systems are calculated as a function of their control parameters, and the paths of the transitions, including their critical nuclei, are identified. These results clearly demonstrate the nonequilibrium nature of the transitions, with differing forward and backward paths.},

Nonequilibrium dynamics can allow these systems to have memory capacity, assembly or pattern recognition properties, and learning ability, in excess of their corresponding equilibrium counterparts. Our results demonstrate the generality of the enhancement of memory capacity arising from nonequilibrium, active dynamics when compared to noise sources characteristic of equilibrium dynamics.

We study the impact of measurements on paradigmatic Ising quantum-critical chains using an explicit protocol, whereby correlated ancillae are entangled with the critical chain and then projectively measured. Using a perturbative analytic framework supported by extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that measurements can qualitatively alter critical correlations in a manner dependent on the choice of entangling gate, ancilla measurement basis, measurement outcome, and nature of ancilla correlations. We further show that measurement-altered Ising criticality can be pursued surprisingly efficiently in experiments featuring of order 100 qubits by postselecting for high-probability measurement outcomes or, in certain cases, by averaging observables separately over measurement outcomes residing in distinct symmetry sectors. Our framework naturally adapts to more exotic quantum-critical points and highlights opportunities for realization in noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware and in Rydberg arrays.},

When individual masses and spring constants can be efficiently queried, and when the initial state can be efficiently prepared, the complexity of our quantum algorithm is polynomial in n , almost linear in the evolution time, and sublinear in the sparsity. As an example application, we apply our quantum algorithm to efficiently estimate the kinetic energy of an oscillator at any time. We show that any classical algorithm solving this same problem is inefficient and must make 2 Ω ( n ) queries to the oracle, and when the oracles are instantiated by efficient quantum circuits, the problem is bounded-error quantum polynomial time complete. Thus, our approach solves a potentially practical application with an exponential speedup over classical computers. Finally, we show that under similar conditions our approach can efficiently simulate more general classical harmonic systems with 2 n modes.},

  abstract     = {The effort to discover a quantum theory of gravity is motivated by the need to reconcile the incompatibility between quantum theory and general relativity. Here, we present an alternative approach by constructing a consistent theory of classical gravity coupled to quantum field theory. The dynamics is linear in the density matrix, completely positive, and trace preserving, and reduces to Einstein’s theory of general relativity in the classical limit. Consequently, the dynamics does not suffer from the pathologies of the semiclassical theory based on expectation values. The assumption that general relativity is classical necessarily modifies the dynamical laws of quantum mechanics; the theory must be fundamentally stochastic in both the metric degrees of freedom and in the quantum matter fields. This breakdown in predictability allows it to evade several no-go theorems purporting to forbid classical quantum interactions. The measurement postulate of quantum mechanics is not needed; the interaction of the quantum degrees of freedom with classical space-time necessarily causes decoherence in the quantum system. We first derive the general form of classical quantum dynamics and consider realizations which have as its limit deterministic classical Hamiltonian evolution. The formalism is then applied to quantum field theory interacting with the classical space-time metric. One can view the classical quantum theory as fundamental or as an effective theory useful for computing the backreaction of quantum fields on geometry. We discuss a number of open questions from the perspective of both viewpoints.},

Of these, 18 were previously reported as low-latency public alerts, and 17 are reported here for the first time. Based upon estimates for the component masses, our O3b candidates with p astro &gt; 0.5 are consistent with gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes or neutron-star–black-hole binaries, and we identify none from binary neutron stars. However, from the gravitational-wave data alone, we are not able to measure matter effects that distinguish whether the binary components are neutron stars or black holes. The range of inferred component masses is similar to that found with previous catalogs, but the O3b candidates include the first confident observations of neutron-star–black-hole binaries. Including the 35 candidates from O3b in addition to those from GWTC-2.1, GWTC-3 contains 90 candidates found by our analysis with p astro &gt; 0.5 across the first three observing runs.

  abstract     = {We develop a multiscale approach to estimate high-dimensional probability distributions. Our approach applies to cases in which the energy function (or Hamiltonian) is not known from the start. Using data acquired from experiments or simulations we can estimate the energy function. We obtain a representation of the approximate probability distribution based on a multiscale cascade of conditional probabilities. This representation allows for fast sampling of many-body systems in various domains, from statistical physics to cosmology. Our method—the wavelet-conditional renormalization group (WCRG)—proceeds scale by scale, estimating models for the conditional probabilities of “fast degrees of freedom” conditioned by coarse-grained fields. These probability distributions are modeled by energy functions associated with scale interactions, and are represented in an orthogonal wavelet basis. The WCRG decomposes the microscopic energy function as a sum of interaction energies at all scales and can efficiently generate new samples by going from coarse to fine scales. Near phase transitions, this representation of the approximate probability distribution completely avoids the “critical slowing-down” of direct estimation and sampling algorithms. This is explained theoretically by combining results from RG and wavelet theories, and verified numerically for the Gaussian and φ 4 -field theories. We show that multiscale WCRG energy-based models are more general than local potential models and can capture the physics of complex many-body interacting systems at all length scales. This is demonstrated for weak-gravitational-lensing fields reflecting dark-matter distributions in cosmology, which include long-range interactions with long-tail probability distributions. The WCRG has a large number of potential applications in nonequilibrium systems, where the underlying distribution is not known a priori . Finally, we discuss the connection between the WCRG and deep network architectures.},

  abstract     = {Robust spin-photon interfaces in solids are essential components in quantum networking and sensing technologies. Ideally, these interfaces combine a long-lived spin memory, coherent optical transitions, fast and high-fidelity spin manipulation, and straightforward device integration and scaling. The tin-vacancy center (SnV) in diamond is a promising spin-photon interface with desirable optical and spin properties at 1.7 K. However, the SnV spin lacks efficient microwave control, and its spin coherence degrades with higher temperature. In this work, we introduce a new platform that overcomes these challenges—SnV centers in uniformly strained thin diamond membranes. The controlled generation of crystal strain introduces orbital mixing that allows microwave control of the spin state with 99.36(9)\% gate fidelity and spin coherence protection beyond a millisecond. Moreover, the presence of crystal strain suppresses temperature-dependent dephasing processes, leading to a considerable improvement of the coherence time up to 223 ( 10 ) μ s at 4 K, a widely accessible temperature in common cryogenic systems. Critically, the coherence of optical transitions is unaffected by the elevated temperature, exhibiting nearly lifetime-limited optical linewidths. Combined with the compatibility of diamond membranes with device integration, the demonstrated platform is an ideal spin-photon interface for future quantum technologies.},

Here, we numerically analyze SC by using ab initio low-energy effective Hamiltonians consisting of the antibonding combination of Cu 3 d x 2 − y 2 and O 2 p σ orbitals without adjustable parameters. We have performed the state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo calculations for the four carrier doped cuprates with diverse experimental optimal SC critical temperature T c opt : CaCuO 2 ( T c opt ∼ 110 K ), Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6 ( T c opt ∼ 10 – 40 K ), Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 ( T c opt ∼ 85 – 100 K ), and HgBa 2 CuO 4 ( T c opt ∼ 90 K ). Materials and hole doping concentration ( δ ) dependencies of the SC order parameter F SC and the competition with spin or charge order show essential and quantitative agreement with the available experiments on the four materials in the following points. (1) In a wide range 0.05 ≤ δ ≤ 0.25 , the ground state is commonly the uniform SC state, which is severely competing with the charge or spin stripe and antiferromagnetic states. (2) F SC at the optimum doping shows amplitude consistent with the superfluid density measured in the muon spin resonance and its dome structure found in δ dependence shows consistency with that of the SC gap in the tunneling and photoemission measurements. Based on the confirmed materials dependence, we further find insights into the universal SC mechanism. (I) F SC increases with the ratio U / | t 1 | within the available realistic materials, indicating that U / | t 1 | is the principal component controlling the strength of the SC in the real materials dependence. Here, U and t 1 are the on-site Coulomb repulsion and the nearest neighbor hopping, respectively, in the ab initio Hamiltonians. (II) A universal scaling T c opt ∼ 0.16 | t 1 | F SC holds. (III) SC is enhanced and optimized if U is increased beyond the real available materials, and it is further enhanced when the off-site interaction is reduced, while the presence of the off-site interaction is important to make the SC ground state against other competing states. The present findings provide useful clues for the design of new SC materials with even higher T c opt .},

  abstract     = {Midcircuit operations, such as qubit state measurement or reset, are central to many tasks in quantum information science, including quantum computing, entanglement generation, and metrology. For instance, in quantum error correction, the information gained from a measurement on a subset of qubits is used to influence the state of the remaining unmeasured qubits, rectifying inevitable errors that arise in a quantum circuit. Such partial projective operations pose a challenge for dense neutral atom arrays and trapped ions, where accidental exposure to resonant laser light during quantum state initialization and detection can spoil the state of untargeted qubits. In this work, we implement midcircuit operations in a 48-site array of neutral atoms, enabled by new methods for high-fidelity control of the omg (optical-metastable-ground-state qubit) architecture present in Yb 171 . Here, the quantum information is encoded in either of the three qubit manifolds and can be shuttled between them. With state-sensitive shelving between the ground and metastable states, we realize a nondestructive state detection for Yb 171 , incorporating global control and local feed-forward operations. Using new schemes for local addressing of the optical clock transition, we shelve a subset of qubits to the metastable state, hiding them from projective operations performed on the qubits remaining in the ground state, demonstrating midcircuit measurement, spin reset, and motional reset in the form of ground-state cooling.},

  abstract     = {Measurement-based quantum error correction relies on the ability to determine the state of a subset of qubits (ancillas) within a processor without revealing or disturbing the state of the remaining qubits. Among neutral-atom-based platforms, a scalable, high-fidelity approach to midcircuit measurement that retains the ancilla qubits in a state suitable for future operations has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we perform maging using a narrow-linewidth transition in an array of tweezer-confined Yb 171 atoms to demonstrate nondestructive state-selective and site-selective detection. By applying site-specific light shifts, selected atoms within the array can be hidden from imaging light, which allows a subset of qubits to be measured while causing only percent-level errors on the remaining qubits. As a proof-of-principle demonstration of conditional operations based on the results of the midcircuit measurements, and of our ability to reuse ancilla qubits, we perform conditional refilling of ancilla sites to correct for occasional atom loss, while maintaining the coherence of data qubits. Looking toward true continuous operation, we demonstrate loading of a magneto-optical trap with a minimal degree of qubit decoherence.},

  abstract     = {One challenge of physics is to explain how collective properties arise from microscopic interactions. Indeed, interactions form the building blocks of almost all physical theories and are described by polynomial terms in the action. The traditional approach is to derive these terms from elementary processes and then use the resulting model to make predictions for the entire system. But what if the underlying processes are unknown? Can we reverse the approach and learn the microscopic action by observing the entire system? We use invertible neural networks to first learn the observed data distribution. By the choice of a suitable nonlinearity for the neuronal activation function, we are then able to compute the action from the weights of the trained model; a diagrammatic language expresses the change of the action from layer to layer. This process uncovers how the network hierarchically constructs interactions via nonlinear transformations of pairwise relations. We test this approach on simulated datasets of interacting theories and on an established image dataset (MNIST). The network consistently reproduces a broad class of unimodal distributions; outside this class, it finds effective theories that approximate the data statistics up to the third cumulant. We explicitly show how network depth and data quantity jointly improve the agreement between the learned and the true model. This work shows how to leverage the power of machine learning to transparently extract microscopic models from data.},

  abstract     = {Controlling the evolution of nonequilibrium systems to minimize dissipated heat or work is a key goal for designing nanodevices, in both nanotechnology and biology. Progress in computing optimal protocols to extremize thermodynamic variables has, thus far, been limited to either simple systems or near-equilibrium evolution. Here, we present an approach for computing optimal protocols based on automatic differentiation. Our methodology is applicable to complex systems and multidimensional protocols and is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We validate our method by reproducing theoretical optimal protocols for a Brownian particle in a time-varying harmonic trap. We also compute departures from near-equilibrium behavior for magnetization reversal on an Ising lattice and for barrier crossing driven by a harmonic trap, which is used to represent a range of biological processes including biomolecular unfolding reactions. Algorithms based on automatic differentiation outperform the near-equilibrium theory for far-from-equilibrium magnetization reversal and for driven barrier crossing beyond the linear regime. The optimal protocol for far-from-equilibrium driven barrier crossing is found to hasten the approach to, and slow the departure from, the barrier region compared to the near-equilibrium theoretical protocol. We demonstrate the utility of our method in a real-world use case by reducing the work required to unfold a DNA hairpin in the coarse-grained oxDNA model and improving its nonequilibrium free-energy landscape reconstruction compared to a naive linear protocol.},

From a microscopic point of view, this limit corresponds to the condition where plastic regions become so densely packed that they give rise to system-spanning structures. This limit for glasses is abrupt, which makes experimental investigations challenging. Here, the yield point is reached by the alternative approach of increasing the density of plastic regions by generation of point defects during x-ray irradiation. For the case of a LiBO 2 glass, we show that at low doses, i.e., for a low density of defects, the defects behave as isolated stress sources that induce atomic displacements typical of an elastic solid. As the density of defects increases, the mechanical response of the glass at the local scale changes from elastic to more and more plastic, until reaching the limit where it becomes characteristic of a flowing system, which signals that the yield point is reached.},

However, the existing RB methods either do not scale to many qubits or cannot benchmark a universal gate set. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a technique for scalable RB of many universal and continuously parametrized gate sets, using a class of circuits called randomized mirror circuits. Our technique can be applied to a gate set containing an entangling Clifford gate and the set of arbitrary single-qubit gates, as well as gate sets containing controlled rotations about the Pauli axes. We use our technique to benchmark universal gate sets on four qubits of the Advanced Quantum Testbed, including a gate set containing a controlled-S gate and its inverse, and we investigate how the observed error rate is impacted by the inclusion of non-Clifford gates. Finally, we demonstrate that our technique scales to many qubits with experiments on a 27-qubit IBM Q processor. We use our technique to quantify the impact of crosstalk on this 27-qubit device, and we find that it contributes approximately 2 / 3 of the total error per gate in random many-qubit circuit layers.},

We recently suggested that chromosomes are organized into loops by an active process of loop extrusion. Yet loops remain elusive to direct observations in living cells; detection and characterization of myriads of such loops is a major challenge. The lack of a tractable physical model of a polymer folded into loops limits our ability to interpret experimental data and detect loops. Here, we introduce a new physical model—a polymer folded into a sequence of loops—and solve it analytically. Our model and a simple geometrical argument show how loops affect the statistics of contacts in a polymer across different scales, explaining universally observed shapes of the contact probability. Moreover, we reveal that folding into loops reduces the density of topological entanglements, a novel phenomenon we refer to as “the dilution of entanglements.” Supported by simulations, this finding suggests that up to approximately 1–2-Mb chromosomes with loops are not topologically constrained, yet become crumpled at larger scales. Our theoretical framework allows inference of loop characteristics, draws a new picture of chromosome organization, and shows how folding into loops affects topological properties of crumpled polymers.},

  abstract     = {Projective measurements in random quantum circuits lead to a rich breadth of entanglement phases and extend the realm of nonunitary quantum dynamics. Here, we explore the connection between measurement-only quantum circuits in one spatial dimension and the statistical mechanics of loop models in two dimensions. While Gaussian Majorana circuits admit a microscopic mapping to loop models, for non-Gaussian, i.e., generic Clifford, circuits, a corresponding mapping may emerge only on a coarse-grained scale. We then focus on a fundamental symmetry of loop models: the orientability of worldlines. We discuss how orientability enters in the measurement framework, acting as a separatrix for the universal long-wavelength behavior in a circuit. When orientability is broken, the circuit falls into the universality class of closely packed loops with crossings (CPLC) and features a Goldstone phase with a peculiar, universal log 2 ( L ) scaling of the entanglement entropy. In turn, when orientability is preserved, the long-wavelength behavior of the circuit mimics that of (coupled) two-dimensional Potts models. We demonstrate the strength of the loop model approach by numerically simulating a variety of measurement-only Clifford circuits. Upon varying the set of measured operators, a rich circuit dynamics is observed, ranging from CPLC to the one-state Potts model (percolation), the two-state Potts model (Ising), and coupled Potts models (Berezhinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless) universality class. Loop models, thus, provide a handle to access a large class of measurement-only circuits and yield a blueprint on how to realize desired entanglement phases by measurement.},

However, for a quantum system that is initially in a degenerate ground state, the situation could be different. In this case, the infinite manifold of ground state eigenfunctions can contain a few states of zero entanglement, which can be demonstrated based on the minimization of the von Neumann entropy. Then, following quantum Darwinism, these “classical” combinations are selected and promoted by the quantum environment, which means that different independent observers find them in experiments. In this work, we find and explore such classical states in the eigenspectra of skyrmionic and antiferromagnetic quantum systems starting from a numerical realization of Anderson’s tower of states. The degeneracy of the quantum ground state is shown to be the key for explaining nontrivial properties of magnetic matter in the classical world including topological protection arising in the classical limit.},

We predict a cascade of phase transitions tuned by the twist angle θ . At the hole-filling factor ν = 1 (one hole per moiré unit cell), the ground state can be in the multiferroic phase, with coexisting spontaneous layer polarization and magnetism; the quantum anomalous Hall phase; and finally, the topologically trivial magnetic phases, as θ increases from 1.5° to 5°. At ν = 2 , the ground state can have a second-order phase transition between an antiferromagnetic phase and the quantum spin Hall phase as θ passes through a critical value. The dependence of the phase boundaries on model parameters, such as the gate-to-sample distance, the dielectric constant, and the moiré potential amplitude, is examined. The predicted phase diagrams can guide the search for topological phases in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers.},

  abstract     = {Chiral molecules provide an ideal test platform to search for symmetry breaking in nature, due to the perfect parity symmetry of their left- and right-handed enantiomers under the electromagnetic interaction. This high degree of symmetry drives efforts to probe the two enantiomers individually after they have been chemically separated, but this allows external effects to influence the measurement, ultimately harming the precision. In particular, the complexity of such polyatomic molecules makes them difficult to control and detect precisely. Employing a more symmetrical measurement procedure can improve the experiment fidelity and alleviate issues associated with molecular complexity. To this end, we theoretically introduce a scheme to perform Ramsey spectroscopy on a racemic mixture of chiral molecules, simultaneously extracting the transition frequencies of the two enantiomers. By taking the difference between the enantiospecific frequencies, we isolate parity violating effects such as the weak force, which is predicted to break the symmetry between enantiomers. To perform the scheme, we design a pulse sequence that creates enantiospecific superpositions in a three-level system using the enantiomer-dependent sign of the electric-dipole moment components’ triple product. A delayed second pulse sequence completes the Ramsey interrogation sequence, enabling readout of the phase evolution for each enantiomer’s transition through a separate quantum state. Our technique overcomes the need to alternate between enantiopure samples to measure parity violation, and is applicable to both charged and neutral molecular species. We describe the advantages of the proposed method for precision metrology.},

However, it has been recognized that their performance is often hindered by ubiquitous material loss and nonlocal phenomena. A canonical problem consists in imaging through metamaterial superlenses, which hold the promise of superresolution but which are, in practice, limited by material loss as we attempt to image deeply subwavelength details. Active metamaterials have been explored to compensate for loss; however, material gain introduces other obstacles, e.g., instabilities, nonlinearity, and noise. Here, we demonstrate that the temporal excitation of passive metamaterials using signals oscillating at complex frequencies can effectively compensate material loss, leading to resolution enhancement when applied to metamaterial superlenses. More broadly, our results demonstrate that virtual gain stemming from tailored forms of excitation can tackle the impact of loss in metamaterials, opening promising avenues for a broad range of applications from acoustic to photonic technologies.},

To achieve this, we overcome present-day limitations in the preparation of thermal ensembles and in the measurement of work distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We discuss the accuracy to which the Jarzynski equality holds on different quantum computing platforms subject to platform-specific errors.

In this article, we propose a scheme for overcoming the conventional T 1 limit on fidelity by designing qubits in a way that amplitude-damping errors can be detected and converted into erasure errors. Compared to standard qubit implementations, our scheme improves the performance of fault-tolerant protocols, as numerically demonstrated by the circuit-noise simulations of the surface code. We describe two simple qubit implementations with superconducting circuits and discuss procedures for detecting amplitude-damping errors, performing entangling gates, and extending T ϕ . Our results suggest that engineering efforts should focus on improving T ϕ and the quality of quantum coherent control, as they effectively become the limiting factor on the performance of fault-tolerant protocols.},

  abstract     = {Quantum noise imposes a fundamental limitation on the sensitivity of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO, manifesting as shot noise and quantum radiation pressure noise. Here, we present the first realization of frequency-dependent squeezing in full-scale gravitational-wave detectors, resulting in the reduction of both shot noise and quantum radiation pressure noise, with broadband detector enhancement from tens of hertz to several kilohertz. In the LIGO Hanford detector, squeezing reduced the detector noise amplitude by a factor of 1.6 (4.0 dB) near 1 kHz; in the Livingston detector, the noise reduction was a factor of 1.9 (5.8 dB). These improvements directly impact LIGO’s scientific output for high-frequency sources (e.g., binary neutron star postmerger physics). The improved low-frequency sensitivity, which boosted the detector range by 15\%–18\% with respect to no squeezing, corresponds to an increase in the astrophysical detection rate of up to 65\%. Frequency-dependent squeezing was enabled by the addition of a 300-meter-long filter cavity to each detector as part of the LIGO A + upgrade.},

  abstract     = {The expressive capacity of physical systems employed for learning is limited by the unavoidable presence of noise in their extracted outputs. Though present in physical systems across both the classical and quantum regimes, the precise impact of noise on learning remains poorly understood. Focusing on supervised learning, we present a mathematical framework for evaluating the resolvable expressive capacity (REC) of general physical systems under finite sampling noise and provide a methodology for extracting its extrema, the eigentasks. Eigentasks are a native set of functions that a given physical system can approximate with minimal error. We show that the REC of a quantum system is limited by the fundamental theory of quantum measurement and obtain a tight upper bound for the REC of any finitely sampled physical system. We then provide empirical evidence that extracting low-noise eigentasks can lead to improved performance for machine learning tasks such as classification, displaying robustness to overfitting. We present analyses suggesting that correlations in the measured quantum system enhance learning capacity by reducing noise in eigentasks. The applicability of these results in practice is demonstrated with experiments on superconducting quantum processors. Our findings have broad implications for quantum machine learning and sensing applications.},

The recent observation of a field-trainable spontaneous Kerr signal in UTe 2 at the onset of superconductivity provides strong evidence that the superconducting order parameter is multicomponent and breaks time-reversal symmetry. Here, we perform Kerr effect measurements on a number of UTe 2 samples—grown via both chemical vapor transport and the molten-salt-flux methods—that show a single superconducting transition between 1.6 K and 2.1 K. Our results show no evidence for a spontaneous Kerr signal in zero-field measurements. This implies that the superconducting state of UTe 2 does not intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry. Instead, we observe a field-trainable signal that varies in magnitude between samples and between different locations on a single sample, which is a sign of inhomogeneous magnetic regions. Our results provide an examination of representative UTe 2 samples and place strong constraints on the superconducting order parameter of UTe 2 .},

  abstract     = {Quantum materials display rich and myriad types of magnetic, electronic, and structural ordering, often with these ordering modes either competing with one another or “intertwining,” that is, reinforcing one another. Low-dimensional quantum materials influenced strongly by competing interactions and/or geometric frustration are particularly susceptible to such ordering phenomena and thus offer fertile ground for understanding the consequent emergent collective quantum phenomena. Such is the case of the quasi-2D materials R 4 Ni 3 O 10 ( R = La , Pr), in which intertwined charge- and spin-density waves (CDW and SDW) on the Ni sublattice have been identified and characterized. Not unexpectedly, these density waves are largely quasi-2D as a result of weak coupling between planes, compounded with magnetic frustration. In the case of R = Pr , however, we show here that exchange coupling between the transition-metal and rare-earth sublattices upon cooling overcomes both obstacles, leading to a dimensional crossover into a fully 3D-ordered and coupled SDW state on both sublattices, as an induced moment on notionally nonmagnetic Pr 3 + opens exchange pathways in the third dimension. In the process, the structure of the SDW on the Ni sublattice is irreversibly altered, an effect that survives reheating of the material until the underlying CDW melts. This “bootstrapping” mechanism linking incommensurate SDWs on the two sublattices illustrates a new member of the multitude of quantum states that low-dimensional magnets can express, driven by coupled orders and modulated by frustrated exchange pathways.},

  abstract     = {Most natural and engineered information-processing systems transmit information via signals that vary in time. Computing the information transmission rate or the information encoded in the temporal characteristics of these signals requires the mutual information between the input and output signals as a function of time, i.e., between the input and output trajectories. Yet, this is notoriously difficult because of the high-dimensional nature of the trajectory space, and all existing techniques require approximations. We present an exact Monte Carlo technique called path weight sampling (PWS) that, for the first time, makes it possible to compute the mutual information between input and output trajectories for any stochastic system that is described by a master equation. The principal idea is to use the master equation to evaluate the exact conditional probability of an individual output trajectory for a given input trajectory and average this via Monte Carlo sampling in trajectory space to obtain the mutual information. We present three variants of PWS, which all generate the trajectories using the standard stochastic simulation algorithm. While direct PWS is a brute-force method, Rosenbluth-Rosenbluth PWS exploits the analogy between signal trajectory sampling and polymer sampling, and thermodynamic integration PWS is based on a reversible work calculation in trajectory space. PWS also makes it possible to compute the mutual information between input and output trajectories for systems with hidden internal states as well as systems with feedback from output to input. Applying PWS to the bacterial chemotaxis system, consisting of 182 coupled chemical reactions, demonstrates not only that the scheme is highly efficient but also that the number of receptor clusters is much smaller than hitherto believed, while their size is much larger.},

  abstract     = {A time crystal is a state of periodically driven matter that breaks discrete time-translation symmetry. Time crystals have been demonstrated experimentally in various programmable quantum simulators, and they exemplify how nonequilibrium, driven quantum systems can exhibit intriguing and robust properties absent in systems at equilibrium. These robust driven states need to be stabilized by some mechanism, with the preeminent candidates being many-body localization and prethermalization. This introduces additional constraints that make it challenging to experimentally observe time crystallinity in naturally occurring systems. Recent theoretical work has developed the notion of prethermalization without temperature , expanding the class of time-crystal systems to explain time-crystalline observations at (or near) infinite temperature. In this work, we conclusively observe the emergence of a prethermal U ( 1 ) time-crystalline state at quasi-infinite temperature in a solid-state NMR quantum emulator by verifying the requisites of prethermalization without temperature. In addition to observing the signature period-doubling behavior, we show the existence of a long-lived prethermal regime whose lifetime is significantly enhanced by strengthening an emergent U ( 1 ) conservation law. Not only do we measure this enhancement through the global magnetization, but we also exploit on-site disorder to measure local observables, ruling out the possibility of many-body localization and confirming the emergence of long-range correlations.},

Work-arounds for small devices, including prepulsing with an off-resonant microwave burst to bring a device to a steady state, wait times prior to measurement, and qubit-specific calibrations all bode ill for device scalability. Here, we make substantial progress in understanding and overcoming this effect. We report a surprising nonmonotonic relation between mixing chamber temperature and spin Larmor frequency which is consistent with observed frequency shifts induced by microwave and baseband control signals. We find that purposefully operating the device at 200 mK greatly suppresses the adverse heating effect while not compromising qubit coherence or single-qubit fidelity benchmarks. Furthermore, systematic non-Markovian crosstalk is greatly reduced. Our results provide a straightforward means of improving the quality of multispin control while simplifying calibration procedures for future spin-based quantum processors.},

  abstract     = {Continuum mechanics describes compressive failure as a standard bifurcation in the response of a material to an increasing load: Damage, which initially grows uniformly in the material, localizes within a thin band at failure. Yet, experiments recording the acoustic activity preceding localization evidence power-law-distributed failure precursors of increasing size, suggesting that compressive failure is a critical phenomenon. We examine here this apparent contradiction by probing the spatial organization of the damage activity and its evolution until localization during compression experiments of 2D cellular solids. The intermittent damage evolution measured in our experiments is adequately described by a nonstationary depinning equation derived from damage mechanics and reminiscent of critical phenomena. In this description, precursors are damage cascades emerging from the interplay between the material’s disorder and the long-range stress redistributions following individual damage events. Yet, the divergence of their characteristic size close to failure, which we observe in our experiments, is not the signature of a transition toward criticality. Instead, the system remains at a fixed distance to the critical point at all stages of the damage evolution. The divergence results from the progressive loss of stability of the material as it is driven toward localization. Thus, our study shows that compressive failure is a standard bifurcation for which the material disorder plays a marginal role. It also implies that the precursory acoustic activity behaves as a tracer of the evolution of materials toward failure and can therefore be used to assess their residual lifetime.},

In this work, we identify a new type of structured noise motivated by neutral-atom qubits, biased erasure errors, which arises when qubit errors are dominated by detectable leakage from only one of the computational states of the qubit. We study the performance of this model using gate-level simulations of the X Z Z X surface code. Using the predicted erasure fraction and bias of metastable Yb 171 qubits, we find a threshold of 8.2\% for two-qubit gate errors, which is 1.9 times higher than the threshold for unbiased erasures and 7.5 times higher than the threshold for depolarizing errors. Surprisingly, the improved threshold is achieved without bias-preserving controlled- not gates and, instead, results from the lower noise entropy in this model. We also introduce an X Z Z X cluster state construction for measurement-based error correction, hybrid fusion, that is optimized for this noise model. By combining fusion operations and deterministic entangling gates, this construction preserves the intrinsic symmetry of the X Z Z X code, leading to a higher threshold of 10.3\% and enabling the use of rectangular codes with fewer qubits. We discuss a potential physical implementation using a single plane of atoms and movable tweezers.},

Here, we show that a simple RD system, predicting the cellular-automaton-like patterning of ocellated lizards’ skin into green and black labyrinthine chains of scales, additionally predicts unsuspected subtle color subclustering that correlates with the colors of the scales’ neighbors. Hyperspectral imaging indicates that color subclustering is present in real lizards, confirming the numerical model nontrivial prediction. In addition, extensive histological analyses show that melanophores’ spatial distribution correlates with scale neighborhood, confirming that color subclustering is associated to the underlying microscopic system of chromatophore interactions. We then show that the observed subclustering is efficiently captured by RD models, irrespective of their form, discretization, and spatial dimensionality. We also show that sets of values can be identified in the 12-dimensional RD parameter space to yield the correct direction of correlation (i.e., observed in real lizards) between green-scale blackness and their neighborhood configuration, hence instructing the mathematical model. More generally, our results show that subtle mesoscopic properties of biological dynamical systems, as well as some of the underlying microscopic features, are quantitatively captured by simple RD models without integrating the unmanageable profusion of variables at lower scales.},

Frustrated assemblies have drawn recent interest due to the unique possibility that their thermodynamics can sense and select the finite size of assembly at length scales much larger than constituent building blocks or their interactions. At present, self-limitation is chiefly understood to derive from zero-temperature considerations, specifically the competition between cohesion and scale-dependent elastic costs of frustration. While effects of entropy and finite-temperature fluctuations are necessarily significant for self-assembling systems, their impact on the self-limiting states of frustrated assemblies is not known. We introduce a generic, minimal model of frustrated assembly and establish its finite-temperature and concentration-dependent thermodynamics by way of simulation and continuum theory. The phase diagram is marked by three distinct states of translation order: a dispersed vapor, a defect-riddled condensate, and the self-limiting aggregate state. We show that, at finite temperature, the self-limiting state is stable at intermediate frustration. Furthermore, in contrast to the prevailing picture, its thermodynamic boundaries with the macroscopic disperse and bulk states are temperature controlled, pointing to the essential importance of translational and conformational entropy in their formation.},

These shortcomings can be addressed through corrections to the phonon self-energy arising from the low-energy electrons. The exact self-energy involves a product of a bare and a screened electron-phonon vertex [ Rev. Mod. Phys. 89 , 015003 (2017) ]; still, calculations often employ two adiabatically screened vertices, which have been proposed as a reliable approximation for self-energy differences [ Phys. Rev. B 82 , 165111 (2010) ]. We assess the accuracy of both approaches in estimating the phonon spectral functions of model Hamiltonians and the adiabatic low-temperature phonon dispersions of monolayer TaS 2 and doped MoS 2 . We find that the approximate method yields excellent corrections at low computational cost, due to its designed error cancellation to first order, while using a bare vertex could in principle improve these results but is challenging in practice.

  abstract     = {The concept of space evolution (or space-time duality) has emerged as a promising approach for studying quantum dynamics. The basic idea involves exchanging the roles of space and time, evolving the system using a space transfer matrix rather than the time evolution operator. The infinite-volume limit is then described by the fixed points of the latter transfer matrix, also known as influence matrices. To establish the potential of this method as a bona fide computational scheme, it is important to understand whether the influence matrices can be efficiently encoded in a classical computer. Here we begin this quest by presenting a systematic characterization of their entanglement—dubbed temporal entanglement—in chaotic quantum systems. We consider the most general form of space evolution, i.e., evolution in a generic spacelike direction, and present two fundamental results. First, we show that temporal entanglement always follows a volume law in time. Second, we identify two marginal cases—(i) pure space evolution in generic chaotic systems and (ii) any spacelike evolution in dual-unitary circuits—where Rényi entropies with index larger than one are sublinear in time while the von Neumann entanglement entropy grows linearly. We attribute this behavior to the existence of a product state with large overlap with the influence matrices. This unexpected structure in the temporal entanglement spectrum might be the key to an efficient computational implementation of the space evolution.},

By using an effective continuum model, we show that the relaxed lattice structure forms a patchwork of moiré-of-moiré domains, where a moiré pattern given by layer 1 and 2 and another pattern given by layer 2 and 3 become locally commensurate. The atomic configuration inside the domain exhibits a distinct contrast between chiral and alternating stacks, which are determined by the relative signs of the two twist angles. In the chiral case, the electronic band calculation reveals a wide energy window ( &gt; 50 meV ) with low density of states, featuring sparsely distributed highly one-dimensional electron bands. These one-dimensional states exhibit a sharp localization at the boundaries between supermoiré domains, and they are identified as a topological boundary state between distinct Chern insulators. The alternating trilayer exhibits a coexistence of the flat bands and a monolayerlike Dirac cone, and it is attributed to the formation of moiré-of-moiré domains equivalent to the mirror-symmetric twisted trilayer graphene.},

  abstract     = {The interplay between stochastic chemical reactions and diffusion can generate rich spatiotemporal patterns. While the timescale for individual reaction or diffusion events may be very fast, the timescales for organization can be much longer. That separation of timescales makes it particularly challenging to anticipate how the rapid microscopic dynamics gives rise to macroscopic rates in the nonequilibrium dynamics of many reacting and diffusing chemical species. Within the regime of stochastic fluctuations, the standard approach is to employ Monte Carlo sampling to simulate realizations of random trajectories. Here, we present an alternative numerically tractable approach to extract macroscopic rates from the full ensemble evolution of many-body reaction-diffusion problems. The approach leverages the Doi-Peliti second-quantized representation of reaction-diffusion master equations along with compression and evolution algorithms from tensor networks. By focusing on a Schlögl model with one-dimensional diffusion between L otherwise well-mixed sites, we illustrate the potential of the tensor network approach to compute rates from many-body systems, here with approximately 3 × 10 15 microstates. Specifically, we compute the rate for switching between metastable macrostates, with the expense for computing those rates growing subexponentially in L . Because we directly work with ensemble evolutions, we crucially bypass many of the difficulties encountered by rare event sampling techniques—detailed balance and reaction coordinates are not needed.},

Recently discovered tantalum-based qubits exhibit record lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. Here, we perform systematic, detailed measurements of superconducting tantalum resonators in order to disentangle sources of loss that limit state-of-the-art tantalum devices. By studying the dependence of loss on temperature, microwave photon number, and device geometry, we quantify materials-related losses and observe that the losses are dominated by several types of saturable two-level systems (TLSs), with evidence that both surface and bulk related TLSs contribute to loss. Moreover, we show that surface TLSs can be altered with chemical processing. With four different surface conditions, we quantitatively extract the linear absorption associated with different surface TLS sources. Finally, we quantify the impact of the chemical processing at single-photon powers, the relevant conditions for qubit device performance. In this regime, we measure resonators with internal quality factors ranging from 5 to 15 × 10 6 , comparable to the best qubits reported. In these devices, the surface and bulk TLS contributions to loss are comparable, showing that systematic improvements in materials on both fronts are necessary to improve qubit coherence further.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of machine-learning models that use adversarial training to generate new samples with the same (potentially very complex) statistics as the training samples. One major form of training failure, known as mode collapse, involves the generator failing to reproduce the full diversity of modes in the target probability distribution. Here, we present an effective model of GAN training, which captures the learning dynamics by replacing the generator neural network with a collection of particles in the output space; particles are coupled by a universal kernel valid for certain wide neural networks and high-dimensional inputs. The generality of our simplified model allows us to study the conditions under which mode collapse occurs. Indeed, experiments which vary the effective kernel of the generator reveal a mode collapse transition, the shape of which can be related to the type of discriminator through the frequency principle. Further, we find that gradient regularizers of intermediate strengths can optimally yield convergence through critical damping of the generator dynamics. Our effective GAN model thus provides an interpretable physical framework for understanding and improving adversarial training.},

  abstract     = {We present an extensive study of resonant two-dimensional (2D) plasmon excitations in grating-gated quantum well heterostructures, which enable an electrical control of periodic charge carrier density profile. Our study combines theoretical and experimental investigations of nanometer-scale AlGaN / GaN grating-gate structures and reveals that all terahertz (THz) plasmonic resonances in these structures can be explained only within the framework of the plasmonic crystal model. We identify two different plasmonic crystal phases. The first is the delocalized phase, where THz radiation is absorbed with the entire grating-gate structure that is realized at a weakly modulated 2D electron gas (2DEG) regime. In the second, the localized phase, THz radiation interacts only with the ungated portions of the structure. This phase is achieved by fully depleting the gated regions, resulting in strong modulation. By gate controlling of the modulation degree, we observe a continuous transition between these phases. We also discover that, unexpectedly, the resonant plasma frequencies of ungated parts (in the localized phase) still depend on the gate voltage. We attribute this phenomenon to the specific depletion of the conductive profile in the ungated region of the 2DEG, the so-called edge gating effect. Although we study a specific case of plasmons in AlGaN / GaN grating-gate structures, our results have a general character and are applicable to any other semiconductor-based plasmonic crystal structures. Our work represents the first demonstration of an electrically tunable transition between different phases of THz plasmonic crystals, which is a crucial step toward a deeper understanding of THz plasma physics and the development of all-electrically tunable devices for THz optoelectronics.},

The main contribution—Brownian thermal noise—is related to the mechanical loss of the coating material. Al 0.92 Ga 0.08 As / GaAs crystalline mirror coatings are expected to reduce this limit. The first measurements of cryogenic silicon cavities revealed the existence of additional noise contributions exceeding the expected Brownian thermal noise. We describe a novel, nonthermal, photoinduced effect in birefringence that is most likely related to the recently discovered birefringence noise. Our studies of the dynamics and power dependence are an important step toward uncovering the underlying mechanisms. Averaging the anticorrelated birefringent noise results in a residual noise that is shown to be substantially different from Brownian thermal noise. To this end, we develop a new method for analyzing the coating noise in higher-order transverse-cavity modes, which makes it possible for the first time to determine the contribution of Brownian thermal noise to the total cavity noise. The new noise contributions must be considered carefully in precision interferometry experiments using similar coatings based on semiconductor materials.},

However, many experiments admit effective descriptions in terms of other state spaces, such as classical probability distributions or quantum systems with superselection rules. Which kind of effective statistics would allow us to experimentally falsify quantum theory as a fundamental description of nature? Here, we address this question by introducing a methodological principle that generalizes Spekkens’s notion of noncontextuality: Processes that are statistically indistinguishable in an effective theory should not require explanation by multiple distinguishable processes in a more fundamental theory. We formulate this principle in terms of linear embeddings and simulations of one probabilistic theory by another, show how this concept subsumes standard notions of contextuality, and prove a multitude of fundamental results on the exact and approximate embedding of theories (in particular, into quantum theory). We prove that only Jordan-algebraic state spaces are exactly embeddable into quantum theory, and show how results on Bell inequalities can be used for the certification of nonapproximate embeddability. From this, we propose an experimental test of quantum theory by probing single physical systems without assuming access to a tomographically complete set of procedures or calibration of the devices, arguably avoiding a significant loophole of earlier approaches.},

Such ray bending requires space-variant structures, inevitably introducing a geometric center to the lens. To overcome the limitations arising from the conventional imaging mechanism, we consider imaging elements that employ a different mechanism, which we call reciprocal lenses. This type of imaging element relies on lateral ray shifting, enabled by momentum-space-variant phase modulations in periodic structures. As such, it has the distinct advantage of not requiring alignment with a geometric center. Moreover, upright real images can be produced directly with a single reciprocal lens as the directions of rays are not changed. We realize an ultrathin reciprocal lens based on a photonic crystal slab. We characterize the lateral ray shifting behavior of the reciprocal lens and demonstrate imaging. Our work gives an alternative mechanism for imaging and provides a new way to modulate electromagnetic waves.},

One well-known example is the fractional quantum Hall effect, where exotic electron fluids with fractionally charged excitations form in partially filled Landau levels. The emergence of topological moiré flat bands provides exciting opportunities to realize the lattice analogs of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects without the need for an external magnetic field. These effects are known as the integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH and FQAH) effects. Here, we present direct transport evidence of the existence of both IQAH and FQAH effects in small-angle-twisted bilayer MoTe 2 . At zero magnetic field, we observe well-quantized Hall resistance of h / e 2 around moiré filling factor ν = − 1 (corresponding to one hole per moiré unit cell), and nearly quantized Hall resistance of 3 h / 2 e 2 around ν = − 2 / 3 , respectively. Concomitantly, the longitudinal resistance exhibits distinct minima around ν = − 1 and − 2 / 3 . The application of an electric field induces topological quantum phase transition from the IQAH state to a charge transfer insulator at ν = − 1 , and from the FQAH state to a topologically trivial correlated insulator, further transitioning to a metallic state at ν = − 2 / 3 .

Here, we explore Bose polaron physics in a two-dimensional nonequilibrium setting by injecting σ − polarized exciton-polariton impurities into a bath of coherent σ + polarized polaritons generated by resonant laser excitation of monolayer MoSe 2 embedded in an optical cavity. By exploiting a biexciton Feshbach resonance between the impurity and the bath polaritons, we tune the interacting system to the strong-coupling regime and demonstrate the coexistence of two new quasiparticle branches. Using time-resolved pump-probe measurements, we observe how polaron dressing modifies the interaction between impurity polaritons. Remarkably, we find that the interactions between high-energy polaron quasiparticles, which are repulsive for small bath occupancy, can become attractive in the strong impurity-bath coupling regime. Our experiments provide the first direct measurement of Bose polaron-polaron interaction strength in any physical system and pave the way for exploration and control of many-body correlations in driven-dissipative settings.},

Relative to architectures that exclusively rely on a direct coupling between fluxonium qubits, FTF enables stronger couplings for gates using noncomputational states while simultaneously suppressing the static controlled-phase entangling rate ( Z Z ) down to kilohertz levels, all without requiring strict parameter matching. Here, we implement FTF with a flux-tunable transmon coupler and demonstrate a microwave-activated controlled- Z (CZ) gate whose operation frequency can be tuned over a 2-GHz range, adding frequency allocation freedom for FTFs in larger systems. Across this range, state-of-the-art CZ gate fidelities are observed over many bias points and reproduced across the two devices characterized in this work. After optimizing both the operation frequency and the gate duration, we achieve peak CZ fidelities in the 99.85\%–99.9\% range. Finally, we implement model-free reinforcement learning of the pulse parameters to boost the mean gate fidelity up to 99.922\% ± 0.009\% , averaged over roughly an hour between scheduled training runs. Beyond the microwave-activated CZ gate we present here, FTF can be applied to a variety of other fluxonium gate schemes to improve gate fidelities and passively reduce unwanted Z Z interactions.},

  abstract     = {We provide a theoretical description of dynamical heterogeneities in glass-forming liquids, based on the premise that relaxation occurs via local rearrangements coupled by elasticity. In our framework, the growth of the dynamical correlation length ξ and of the correlation volume χ 4 are controlled by a zero-temperature fixed point. We connect this critical behavior to the properties of the distribution of local energy barriers at zero temperature. Our description makes a direct connection between dynamical heterogeneities and avalanche-type relaxation associated to dynamic facilitation, allowing us to relate the size distribution of heterogeneities to their time evolution. Within an avalanche, a local region relaxes multiple times; the more, the larger the avalanche. This property, related to the nature of the zero-temperature fixed point, directly leads to decoupling of particle diffusion and relaxation time (the so-called Stokes-Einstein violation). Our most salient predictions are tested and confirmed by numerical simulations of scalar and tensorial thermal elastoplastic models. Our most salient predictions are tested and confirmed by numerical simulations of scalar and tensorial thermal elasto-plastic models, and in agreement with molecular dynamic simulations.},

We develop the framework of these ETH matrix models and put it in the context of recent studies in statistical physics incorporating higher statistical moments into the ETH ansatz. We then use the ETH matrix model in order to develop a matrix-integral description of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled to a single scalar field in the bulk. This particular example takes the form of a double-scaled ETH matrix model with non-Gaussian couplings matching disk correlators and the density of states of the gravitational theory. Having defined the model from the disk data, we present evidence that the model correctly captures the JT + matter theory with multiple boundaries and, conjecturally, at higher genus.

We achieve suppression of the loss by 2 orders of magnitude with the lowest two-body loss rate coefficient reduced to 3 × 10 − 12 cm 3 / s . Meanwhile, the elastic collision rate coefficient is increased to the 10 − 8 cm 3 / s level. The large good-to-bad collision ratio has allowed us to carry out evaporative cooling of Na 23 Rb 87 with an efficiency of 1.7(2), increasing the phase-space density by a factor of 10.

Here, we show that Andreev bound states formed in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures can mediate CAR and ECT over mesoscopic length scales. Andreev bound states possess both an electron and a hole component, giving rise to an intricate interference phenomenon that allows us to tune the ratio between CAR and ECT deterministically. We further show that the combination of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in InSb nanowires and an applied magnetic field provides another efficient knob to tune the ratio between ECT and CAR and optimize the amount of coupling between neighboring quantum dots.},

Here, we use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to reveal how the surprising cascade of higher- and lower-dimensional density waves in CsV 3 Sb 5 is intimately tied to a set of small reconstructed Fermi pockets. ARPES measurements visualize the formation of these pockets generated by a 3D charge density wave transition. The pockets are connected by dispersive q * wave vectors observed in Fourier transforms of STM differential conductance maps. As the additional 1D charge order emerges at a lower temperature, q * wave vectors become substantially renormalized, signaling further reconstruction of the Fermi pockets. Remarkably, in the superconducting state, the superconducting gap modulations give rise to an in-plane Cooper pair density wave at the same q * wave vectors. Our work demonstrates the intrinsic origin of the charge stripes and the pair density wave in CsV 3 Sb 5 and their relationship to the Fermi pockets. These experiments uncover a unique scenario of how Fermi pockets generated by a parent charge density wave state can provide a favorable platform for the emergence of additional density waves.},

One of the quintessential objects is a ring dark soliton (RDS), whose dynamics are expected to display remarkable interplay between symmetry and self-patterned topological defect formation from a transverse (snake) instability, but it has thus far evaded full experimental observations. Here, we report an experimental realization of RDS generation in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid trapped in a circular box. By quenching the confining box potential, we observe an RDS emitted from the edge and its peculiar signature in the radial motion. As an RDS evolves, we observe transverse modulations at discrete azimuthal angles, which clearly result in a patterned formation of a circular vortex dipole array. Through collisions of the vortex dipoles with the box trap, we observe vortex unbinding, vortex pinning to the edge, and emission of rarefaction pulses. Our box-quench protocol opens a new way to study multidimensional dark solitons, structured formation of topological defects, and potentially the dynamics of ordered quantum vortex matter.},

Sustaining symmetric, redundant neural circuitry has associated metabolic costs, but it might aid in implementing computations within noisy environments or with faulty pieces. It has been suggested that the complexity of a computational task might play a role in breaking bilaterally symmetric circuits into fully lateralized ones; however, a rigorous, mathematically grounded theory of how this mechanism might work is missing. Here, we provide such a mathematical framework, starting with the simplest assumptions but extending our results to a comprehensive range of biologically relevant scenarios. We show mathematically that only fully lateralized or bilateral solutions are relevant within our framework (dismissing configurations in which circuits are only partially engaged). We provide maps that show when each configuration is preferred depending on costs, fitness contributed, circuit reliability, and task complexity. We discuss evolutionary paths leading from bilateral to lateralized configurations and other possible outcomes. The implications of these results for evolution, development, and rehabilitation of damaged or aging brains is discussed. Our work constitutes a limit case that should constrain and underlie similar mappings when other aspects (besides task complexity and circuit reliability) are considered.},

Our focus is on the harmonic approximation, but the developed tools can readily incorporate anharmonic effects. We begin by showing the necessity of determining the ab initio Hamiltonian in a self-consistent manner to ensure the existence of an equilibrium state. We then identify the correct partitioning into a “noninteracting” and an “interacting” part to carry out diagrammatic expansions in terms of dressed propagators and screened interactions. The final outcome is the finite-temperature nonequilibrium extension of the Hedin equations, showcasing the emergence of the coupling between electrons and coherent phonons through the time-local Ehrenfest diagram. The Hedin equations have limited practical utility for real-time simulations of systems driven out of equilibrium by external fields. To overcome this limitation, we leverage the versatility of the diagrammatic approach to generate a closed system of differential equations for the dressed propagators and nuclear displacements. These are the Kadanoff-Baym equations for electrons and phonons. The formalism naturally merges with the theory of conserving approximations, which guarantee the satisfaction of the continuity equation and the conservation of total energy during time evolution. As an example, we show that the popular Born-Oppenheimer approximation is not conserving whereas its dynamical extension is conserving, provided that the electrons are treated in the Fan-Migdal approximation with a dynamically screened electron-phonon coupling. We also derive the formal solution of the Kadanoff-Baym equations for nonequilibrium steady states, which is useful for studies in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Interestingly, the expansion of the phononic Green’s function around the quasiphonon energies points to a correlation-induced splitting of the phonon dispersion in materials with no time-reversal invariance.},

Here we report on dynamic ramp compression of quartz-type germanium dioxide GeO 2 to stresses up to 882 GPa, a higher peak stress than previous studies by a factor of 5. X-ray diffraction data show that HP − PdF 2 -type GeO 2 occurs under ramp loading from 154 to 440 GPa, and this phase persists to higher pressure than predicted by theory. Above 440 GPa, we observe evidence for transformation to a new phase of GeO 2 . Based on the diffraction data, the best candidate for this new phase is the cotunnite-type structure which has been predicted to be a stable phase of GeO 2 above 300 GPa. The HP − PdF 2 -type and cotunnite-type structures are important phases in a wide range of A X 2 compounds, including SiO 2 , at multihundred GPa stresses. Our results demonstrate that ramp compression can be an effective technique for synthesizing and characterizing such phases in oxides. In addition, we show that pulsed x-ray diffraction under ramp compression can be used to examine lower-symmetry phases in oxide materials.},

  abstract     = {XY* transitions represent one of the simplest examples of unconventional quantum criticality, in which fractionally charged excitations condense into a superfluid and display novel features that combine quantum criticality and fractionalization. Nevertheless, their experimental realization is challenging. Here we propose to study the XY* transition in quantum Hall bilayers at filling ( ν 1 , ν 2 ) = ( 1 3 , 2 3 ) where the exciton condensate (EC) phase plays the role of the superfluid. Supported by exact diagonalization calculation, we argue that there is a continuous transition between an EC phase at small bilayer separation to a pair of decoupled fractional quantum Hall states at large separation. The transition is driven by condensation of a fractional exciton, a bound state of a Laughlin quasiparticle and quasihole, and is in the XY* universality class. The fractionalization is manifested by unusual properties including a large anomalous exponent and fractional universal conductivity, which can be conveniently measured through interlayer tunneling and counterflow transport, respectively. We also show that the edge is likely to realize the newly predicted extraordinary log boundary criticality. Our work highlights the promise of quantum Hall bilayers as an ideal platform for exploring exotic bulk and boundary critical behaviors that are amenable to immediate experimental exploration in dual-gated bilayer systems. The XY* critical theory can be generalized to a bilayer system with an arbitrary Abelian state in one layer and its particle-hole partner in the other layer. Therefore, we anticipate many distinct XY* transitions corresponding to the different Laughlin states and Jain sequences in the single-layer case.},

  abstract     = {The negatively charged tin-vacancy ( SnV − ) center in diamond is a promising solid-state qubit for applications in quantum networking due to its high quantum efficiency, strong zero phonon emission, and reduced sensitivity to electrical noise. The SnV − has a large spin-orbit coupling, which allows for long spin lifetimes at elevated temperatures, but unfortunately suppresses the magnetic dipole transitions desired for quantum control. Here, by use of a naturally strained center, we overcome this limitation and achieve high-fidelity microwave spin control. We demonstrate a π -pulse fidelity of up to 99.51 ± 0.03\% and a Hahn-echo coherence time of T 2 echo = 170.0 ± 2.8 μ s , both the highest yet reported for SnV − platform. This performance comes without compromise to optical stability, and is demonstrated at 1.7 K where ample cooling power is available to mitigate drive-induced heating. These results pave the way for SnV − spins to be used as a building block for future quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {The cavity method is one of the cornerstones of the statistical physics of disordered systems such as spin glasses and other complex systems. It is able to analytically and asymptotically exactly describe the equilibrium properties of a broad range of models. Exact solutions for dynamical, out-of-equilibrium properties of disordered systems are traditionally much harder to obtain. Even very basic questions such as the limiting energy of a fast quench are so far open. The dynamical cavity method partly fills this gap by considering short trajectories and leveraging the static cavity method. However, being limited to a couple of steps forward from the initialization, it typically does not capture dynamical properties related to attractors of the dynamics. We introduce the backtracking dynamical cavity method that instead of analyzing the trajectory forward from initialization, it analyzes the trajectories that are found by tracking them backward from attractors. We illustrate that this rather elementary twist on the dynamical cavity method leads to new insight into some of the very basic questions about the dynamics of complex disordered systems. This method is as versatile as the cavity method itself, and we hence anticipate that our paper will open many avenues for future research of dynamical, out-of-equilibrium properties in complex systems.},

In this way, neither external processing and feedback nor knowledge of (and control of) these internal degrees of freedom is required. We introduce a general scheme for self-learning in any time-reversible Hamiltonian system. It relies on implementing a time-reversal operation and injecting a small error signal on top of the echo dynamics. We show how the physical dynamics itself will then lead to the required gradient update of learnable parameters, independent of the details of the Hamiltonian.

  abstract     = {We perform a systematic symmetry classification of many-body Lindblad superoperators describing general (interacting) open quantum systems coupled to a Markovian environment. Our classification is based on the behavior of the many-body Lindbladian under antiunitary symmetries and unitary involutions. We find that Hermiticity preservation reduces the number of symmetry classes, while trace preservation and complete positivity do not, and that the set of admissible classes depends on the presence of additional unitary symmetries: in their absence or in symmetry sectors containing steady states, many-body Lindbladians belong to one of ten non-Hermitian symmetry classes; if however, there are additional symmetries and we consider non-steady-state sectors, they belong to a different set of 19 classes. In both cases, it does not include classes with Kramers degeneracy. Remarkably, our classification admits a straightforward generalization to the case of non-Markovian, and even non-trace-preserving, open quantum dynamics. While the abstract classification is completely general, we then apply it to general (long-range, interacting, spatially inhomogeneous) spin- 1 / 2 chains. We explicitly build examples in all ten classes of Lindbladians in steady-state sectors, describing standard physical processes such as dephasing, spin injection and absorption, and incoherent hopping, thus illustrating the relevance of our classification for practical physics applications. Finally, we show that the examples in each class display unique random-matrix correlations. To fully resolve all symmetries, we employ the combined analysis of bulk complex spacing ratios and the overlap of eigenvector pairs related by symmetry operations. We further find that statistics of levels constrained onto the real and imaginary axes or close to the origin are not universal due to spontaneous breaking of Lindbladian P T symmetry.},

Preparation of the spin-stretched state puts the system initially into the nonreactive quartet potential. A total of 25 resonances are observed, in qualitative agreement with quantum-chemistry calculations using a coupled-channels approach. Although the theory cannot predict the positions of resonances, it can account for several experimental findings and provide unprecedented insight into the nature and couplings of ultracold, strongly interacting complexes. Previous work has addressed only weakly bound complexes. We show that the main coupling mechanism results from spin-rotation and spin-spin couplings in combination with the anisotropic atom-molecule interaction, and that the collisional complexes which support the resonances have a size of 30 a 0 – 40 a 0 . This study illustrates the potential of a combined experimental and theoretical approach.},

Using this approach, known as Floquet engineering, we experimentally realize a long-ranged, anisotropic Heisenberg model with tunable interactions in a trapped ion quantum simulator. We demonstrate that the spectrum of the model contains not only single-magnon excitations, but also composite magnon bound states. For long-range interactions with the experimentally realized power-law exponent, the group velocity of magnons is unbounded. Nonetheless, for sufficiently strong interactions, we observe bound states of these unconventional magnons which possess a nondiverging group velocity. By measuring the configurational mutual information between two disjoint intervals, we demonstrate the implications of bound-state formation on the entanglement dynamics of the system. Our observations provide key insights into the peculiar role of composite excitations in the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems.},

In this work we show that SPT phases are also well defined for average symmetries, where quenched disorders locally break the symmetries, but restore the symmetries upon disorder averaging. An example would be crystalline SPT phases with imperfect lattices. Specifically, we define the notion of average SPT phase for disordered ensembles of quantum states. We then classify and characterize a large class of average SPT phases using a decorated domain wall approach, in which domain walls (and more general defects) of the average symmetries are decorated with lower-dimensional topological states. We then show that if the decorated domain walls have dimension higher than ( 0 + 1 ) D , then the boundary states of such average SPT phases will almost certainly be long-range entangled, with probability approaching 1 as the system size approaches infinity. This generalizes the notion of t’Hooft anomaly to average symmetries, which we dub “average anomaly.” The average anomaly can also manifest as constraints on lattice systems similar to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems, but with only average lattice symmetries. We also generalize our problem to “quantum disorders” that can admit short-range entanglement on their own, and develop a theory of such generalized average SPT phases purely based on density matrices and quantum channels. Our results indicate that topological quantum phenomena associated with average symmetries can be at least as rich as those with ordinary exact symmetries.},

  abstract     = {Twisted graphene multilayers are highly tunable flatband systems for developing new phases of matter. Thus far, while orbital ferromagnetism has been observed in valley-polarized phases, the long-range orders of other correlated phases as well as the quantum phase transitions between different orders mostly remain unknown. Here, we report an observation of Coulomb-interaction-driven first-order quantum phase transitions and ferromagnetism in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG). At zero magnetic field, the transitions are revealed in a series of steplike abrupt resistance jumps with a prominent hysteresis loop when either the displacement field ( D ) or the carrier density ( n ) is tuned across a symmetry-breaking boundary near half filling, indicating a formation of ordered domains. It is worth noting that the good tunability and switching of these states give rise to a memory performance with a large on/off ratio. Moreover, when both spin and valley play the roles at finite magnetic field, we observe abundant first-order quantum phase transitions among normal metallic states from the charge-neutral point, orbital ferromagnetic states from quarter filling, and spin-polarized states from half filling. We interpret these first-order phase transitions in the picture of phase separations and spin-domain percolations driven by multifield tunable Coulomb interactions, in agreement with the Lifshitz transition and the Hartree-Fock calculations. The observed multifield tunable domain structure and its hysteresis resembles the characteristics of multiferroics, revealing intriguing magnetoelectric properties. Our result enriches the correlated phase diagram in TDBG for discovering novel exotic phases and quantum phase transitions, and it will benefit other twisted moiré systems as well.},

We primarily investigate a model system consisting of DNA nanostars: finite-valence, self-assembled particles that form micron-scale liquid droplets via a binodal phase transition. We demonstrate that, upon phase separation, nanostar droplets spontaneously form hyperuniform structures, a type of disordered material with “hidden order” that combines the long-range order of crystals with the short-range isotropy of liquids. We find that the hyperuniformity of the DNA droplets reflects near-equilibrium dynamics, where phase separation drives the organization of droplets that then relax toward equilibrium via droplet Brownian motion. We engineer a two-species system of immiscible DNA droplets and find two distinctly hyperuniform structures in the same sample, but with random cross-species droplet correlations, which rules out explanations that rely on droplet-droplet hydrodynamic interactions. In addition, we perform experiments on the electrostatic coacervation of peptides and nucleotides which exhibit hyperuniform structures indistinguishable from DNA nanostars, indicating the phenomenon generally applies to phase-separating systems that experience Brownian motion. Our work on near-equilibrium droplet assembly and structure provides a foundation to investigate droplet organizational mechanisms in driven and/or biological environments. This approach also provides a path to implement phase-separated droplet patterns as exotic optical or mechanical metamaterials or as efficient biochemical reactors.},

A rigorous operator algebraic theory of dynamics in locally interacting systems in any dimension is provided here in terms of time-dependent equilibrium (Gibbs) ensembles. The theory explains dynamics in closed, open, and time-dependent systems, provided that relevant pseudolocal quantities can be identified, and time-dependent Gibbs ensembles unify wide classes of quantum nonergodic and ergodic systems. The theory is applied to quantum many-body scars, continuous, discrete, and dissipative time crystals, Hilbert space fragmentation, lattice gauge theories, and disorder-free localization, among other cases. Novel pseudolocal classes of operators are introduced in the process: projected-local , which are local only for some states, cryptolocal , whose locality is not manifest in terms of any finite number of local densities, and transient ones, that dictate finite-time relaxation dynamics. An immediate corollary is proving saturation of the Mazur bound for the Drude weight. This proven theory is intuitively the rigorous algebraic counterpart of the weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and has deep implications for thermodynamics: Quantum many-body systems “out of equilibrium” are actually always in a time-dependent equilibrium state for any natural initial state. The work opens the possibility of designing novel out-of-equilibrium phases, with the newly identified scarring and fragmentation phase transitions being examples.},

  abstract     = {Continuous monitoring of driven-dissipative quantum-optical systems is a crucial element in the implementation of quantum metrology, providing essential strategies for achieving highly precise measurements beyond the classical limit. In this context, the relevant figure of merit is the quantum Fisher information of the radiation field emitted by the driven-dissipative sensor. Saturation of the corresponding precision limit as defined by the quantum Cramér-Rao bound is typically not achieved by conventional, temporally local continuous-measurement schemes such as counting or homodyning. To address the outstanding open challenge of efficient retrieval of the quantum Fisher information of the emission field, we design a novel continuous-measurement strategy featuring temporally quasilocal measurement bases as captured by matrix-product states. Such a measurement can be implemented effectively by injecting the emission field of the sensor into an auxiliary open system, a “quantum-decoder” module, which “decodes” specific input matrix-product states into simple product states as its output field, and performing conventional continuous measurement at the output. We devise a universal recipe for the construction of the decoder by exploiting the time-reversal transformation of quantum-optical input-output channels, thereby establishing a universal method to achieve the quantum Cramér-Rao precision limit for generic sensor designs based on continuous measurement. As a by-product, we establish an effective formula for the evaluation of the quantum Fisher information of the emission field of generic driven-dissipative open sensors. We illustrate the power of our scheme with paramagnetic open sensor designs including linear force sensors, fiber-interfaced nonlinear emitters, and driven-dissipative many-body sensors, and demonstrate that it can be robustly implemented under realistic experimental imperfections.},

  abstract     = {High harmonic generation (HHG) has developed in recent years as a promising tool for ultrafast materials spectroscopy. At the forefront of these advancements, several works proposed using HHG as an all-optical probe for topology of quantum matter by identifying its signatures in the emission spectra. However, it remains unclear if such spectral signatures are indeed a robust and general approach for probing topology. To address this point, we perform a fully ab initio study of HHG from prototypical two-dimensional topological insulators in the Kane-Mele quantum spin-Hall and anomalous-Hall phases. We analyze the spectra and previously proposed topological signatures by comparing HHG from the topological and trivial phases and across the phase transition. We demonstrate and provide detailed microscopic explanations of why, in these systems, none of the observables proposed thus far uniquely and universally probes material topology. Specifically, we find that the (i) HHG helicity, (ii) anomalous HHG ellipticity, (iii) HHG elliptical dichroism, and (iv) temporal delays in HHG emission are all unreliable signatures of topological phases. Our results suggest that extreme care must be taken when interpreting HHG spectra for topological signatures and that contributions from the crystal symmetries and chemical nature might be dominant over those from topology. They hint that a truly universal topological signature in nonlinear optics is unlikely and raise important questions regarding possible utilization and detection of topology in out-of-equilibrium systems.},

  abstract     = {Electronic nematicity is the spontaneous loss of rotational symmetry in a metal, without breaking translational symmetry. In the cuprate superconductors, there is experimental evidence for nematicity, but its origin remains unclear. Here we investigate the onset of nematicity in the transport of charge by means of electric and thermoelectric measurements in underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O y , performed by passing the current (electrical or thermal) first along the a axis then the b axis of the orthorhombic structure in the same crystal, with a hole doping p = 0.12 . Upon cooling, we observe no additional in-plane anisotropy—beyond the background anisotropy due to the CuO chains—in either the resistivity ρ or the Seebeck coefficient S as the temperature T ⋆ for the onset of the pseudogap phase is crossed. We conclude that the pseudogap phase of cuprates is not nematic. However, at temperatures much lower than T ⋆ , a strong additional anisotropy is observed, most clearly in the Peltier coefficient α = S / ρ . We interpret it as nematicity associated with the development of charge order.},

  abstract     = {Exploring non-Hermitian phenomenology is an exciting frontier of modern physics. However, the demonstration of a non-Hermitian phenomenon that is quantum in nature has remained elusive. Here, we predict quantum non-Hermitian phenomena: the fractional quantum Zeno (FQZ) effect and FQZ-induced photon antibunching. We consider a quantum optics platform with reservoir engineering, where nonlinear emitters are coupled to a bath of decaying bosonic modes whose own decay rates form band structures. By engineering the dissipation band, the spontaneous emission of emitters can be suppressed by strong dissipation through an algebraic scaling with fractional exponents—the FQZ effect. This fractional scaling originates uniquely from the divergent dissipative density of states near the dissipation band edge, different from the traditional closed-bath context. We find FQZ-induced strong photon antibunching in the steady state of a driven emitter even for weak nonlinearities. Remarkably, we identify that the sub-Poissonian quantum statistics of photons, which has no classical analogs, stems here from the key role of non-Hermiticity. Our setup is experimentally feasible with the techniques used to design lattice models with dissipative couplings.},

  abstract     = {Understanding topological matter is an outstanding challenge across several disciplines of physical science. Programmable quantum simulators have emerged as a powerful approach to studying such systems. While quantum spin liquids of paradigmatic toric code type have recently been realized in the laboratory, controlled exploration of topological phases with non-Abelian excitations remains an open problem. We introduce and analyze a new approach to simulating topological matter based on periodic driving. Specifically, we describe a model for a so-called Floquet spin liquid, obtained through a periodic sequence of parallel quantum gate operations that effectively simulates the Hamiltonian of the non-Abelian spin liquid in Kitaev’s honeycomb model. We show that this approach, including the toolbox for preparation, control, and readout of topological states, can be efficiently implemented in state-of-the-art experimental platforms. One specific implementation scheme is based on Rydberg atom arrays and utilizes recently demonstrated coherent qubit transport combined with controlled-phase gate operations. We describe methods for probing the non-Abelian excitations, and the associated Majorana zero modes, and simulate possible fusion and braiding experiments. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of programmable quantum simulators for exploring topological phases of matter. Extensions including simulation of Kitaev materials and lattice gauge theories are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Realizing the full potential of quantum computation requires quantum error correction (QEC), with most recent breakthrough demonstrations of QEC using the surface code. QEC codes use multiple noisy physical qubits to encode information in fewer logical qubits, enabling the identification of errors through a decoding process. This process increases the logical fidelity (or accuracy) making the computation more reliable. However, most fast (efficient run-time) decoders neglect important noise characteristics, thereby reducing their accuracy. In this work, we introduce decoders that are both fast and accurate, and can be used with a wide class of QEC codes including the surface code. Our decoders, named belief-matching and belief-find, exploit all noise information and thereby unlock higher accuracy demonstrations of QEC. Using the surface code threshold as a performance metric, we observe a threshold at 0.94\% error probability for our decoders, outperforming the 0.82\% threshold for a standard minimum-weight perfect matching decoder. We also test our belief-matching decoders in a theoretical case study of codes tailored to a biased noise model. We find that the decoders lead to a much higher threshold and lower qubit overhead in the tailored surface code with respect to the standard, square surface code. Surprisingly, in the well-below-threshold regime, the rectangular surface code becomes more resource efficient than the tailored surface code due to a previously unnoticed phenomenon that we call “fragile boundaries.” Our decoders outperform all other fast decoders in terms of threshold and accuracy, enabling better results in current quantum-error-correction experiments and opening up new areas for theoretical case studies.},

The method is demonstrated for the power-law interacting long-range Ising and XY spin models with nonconserved order parameter and a Lennard-Jones particle system, all in two dimensions. The measured run times support an average complexity O ( N log N ) , where N is the number of spins or particles. Importantly, prefactors of this scaling behavior are small, which in practice manifests in speedup factors larger than 10 4 . The method is general and will allow the treatment of large systems that were out of reach before, likely enabling a more detailed understanding of physical phenomena rooted in long-range interactions.},

Based on previous work that allows us to maintain the in-plane polarization of a stored deuteron beam for a few hundred seconds, we perform a first proof-of-principle experiment at the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) to scan momenta near 970 MeV / c . This entails a scan of the spin-precession frequency. At resonance between the spin-precession frequency of deuterons and the ALP-induced electric dipole moment (EDM) oscillation frequency, there is an accumulation of the polarization component out of the ring plane. Since the axion frequency is unknown, the momentum of the beam and, consequently, the spin-precession frequency are ramped to search for a vertical polarization change that occurs when the resonance is crossed. At COSY, four beam bunches with different polarization directions are used to make sure that no resonance is missed because of the unknown relative phase between the polarization precession and the axion or ALP field. A frequency window of 1.5 kHz width around the spin-precession frequency of 121 kHz is scanned. We describe the experimental procedure and a test of the methodology with the help of a radio-frequency Wien filter located on the COSY ring. No ALP resonance is observed. As a consequence, an upper limit of the oscillating EDM component of the deuteron as well as its axion coupling constants are provided.},

  abstract     = {Pathological morphological changes in tumor tissue enable collective cancer cell unjamming, a cellular motility transition. However, fundamental questions remain: Is unjamming essential for tumor progression? Which different unjamming states can be found in patients? Here, vital cell tracking in patient-derived solid tumor explants ( N = 16 ) reveals that states of cell unjamming can be recognized by elongated cell and nucleus shape (CeNuS) and low nucleus number density. These static variables serve as a morphodynamic link to map the broad range of morphologies and associated motility states found in histological slides of 1380 breast cancer patients to generate a comprehensive state diagram of cancer cell unjamming. An increase in predicted cell motility in primary tumors through unjamming significantly correlates with distant metastases that may even occur a decade later. Patient risk groups are quantified via a decision boundary in the state space found by machine learning. The resulting clinical prognostic potential is evaluated using a range of quantifiers, including Harrel’s concordance index. Using multivariable Cox models, we find that cell unjamming as a prognostic parameter adds a 26\% information gain in the concordance index when combined with the established prognostic criteria (tumor diameter, tumor grade, lymph node status) used in the Nottingham index. Unjamming complements the information on affected lymph nodes in patients regarding metastatic risk. The derived state diagram of cancer cell unjamming reconciles conflicting observations regarding shape- or density-induced unjamming and stresses the nuclei’s mechanical importance, which is not considered in current theories of cell unjamming. We conclude that cancer cell unjamming is part of the metastatic cascade; thus, an emergent physical phenomenon contributes to tumor progression.},

Enantiomers share most molecular properties except, for instance, the absorption of circularly polarized light. Enantiomer purification is therefore a challenging task that requires specialized equipment. Strong coupling between quantized fields and matter (e.g., in optical cavities) is a promising technique to modify molecular processes in a noninvasive way. The modulation of molecular properties is achieved by changing the field characteristics. In this work, we investigate whether strong coupling to circularly polarized electromagnetic fields is a viable way to discriminate chiral molecules. To this end, we develop a nonperturbative framework to calculate the behavior of molecules in chiral cavities. We show that in this setting the enantiomers have different energies—that is, one is more stable than the other. The field-induced energy differences are also shown to give rise to enantiospecific signatures in rotational spectra.},

  abstract     = {Cat states and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states play a key role in quantum computation and communication with continuous variables. The creation of such states relies on strong nonlinear light-matter interactions, which are widely available in microwave frequencies as in circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms. However, strong nonlinearities are hard to come by in optical frequencies, severely limiting the development and applications of quantum-information science with continuous variable in the optical range. Here we propose using the strong interaction of free electrons with light to implement the desired nonlinear mechanism, showing its implication by creating optical cat and GKP states. The key to our finding is identifying conditions on the electron for which its interaction mimics the conditional displacement quantum gate. The strong interactions can be realized by phase matching of free electrons with photonic structures such as optical waveguides and photonic crystals in an ultrafast transmission electron microscope (UTEM). Our approach enables the generation of optical GKP states with above 10 dB squeezing and fidelities above 90\% at postselection probability of 10\%, even reaching &gt; 30\% using an initially squeezed-vacuum state. We analyze the different factors that affect the fidelity, such as electron dispersion, inhomogeneity, nonideal interaction, and limited detection efficiency. Furthermore, the free-electron interaction allows two qubit gates between a pair of GKP states, which can entangle them into a GKP Bell state. We present a roadmap for realizing such experiments in a UTEM. Since electrons can interact resonantly with light across the electromagnetic spectrum, our approach could apply for a generation of cat and GKP states also in other platforms of free-electron radiation, from klystrons to free-electron lasers.},

Parity order captures the presence of microscopic particle-hole fluctuations and entanglement, whose properties depend on the underlying lattice geometry.

We benchmark the performance of our system by single-particle quantum walks in the square, triangular, kagome, and Lieb lattices. In the strongly correlated regime, we microscopically characterize the geometry dependence of the quantum fluctuations and experimentally validate brane parity as a proxy for the nonlocal order parameter signaling the superfluid–to–Mott-insulating phase transition.},

However, because chemical reactions usually have many-to-many interactions, chemical networks are described by hypergraphs, which lack a systematized algebraic treatment and a clear geometric intuition. Here, we fill this gap by building fundamental bases of chemical cycles (encoding stationary behavior) and cocycles (encoding finite-time relaxation). We interpret them in terms of circulations and gradients on the hypergraph and use them to properly identify nonequilibrium observables. As an application, we unveil hidden symmetries in linear response and, within this regime, propose a reconstruction algorithm for large metabolic networks consistent with Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws.},

We verify the quantum nonlinear behavior of this artificial chiral atom by measuring the resonance fluorescence spectrum under a strong resonant drive and observing well-resolved Mollow triplets. Further, we demonstrate chirality for the second transition energy of the artificial atom and control it with a pulse sequence to realize a qubit-state-dependent nonreciprocal phase on itinerant photons. Our demonstration puts forth a superconducting hardware platform for the scalable realization of several key functionalities pursued within the paradigm of chiral quantum optics, including quantum networks with all-to-all connectivity, driven-dissipative stabilization of many-body entanglement, and the generation of complex nonclassical states of light.},

  abstract     = {Turing patterns, arising from the interplay between competing species of diffusive particles, have long been an important concept for describing nonequilibrium self-organization in nature and have been extensively investigated in many chemical and biological systems. Historically, these patterns have been studied in extended systems and lattices. Recently, the Turing instability was found to produce topological patterns in networks with scale-free degree distributions and the small-world property, although with an apparent absence of geometric organization. While hints of explicitly geometric patterns in simple network models (e.g., Watts-Strogatz) have been found, the question of the exact nature and morphology of geometric Turing patterns in heterogeneous complex networks remained unresolved. In this work, we study the Turing instability in the framework of geometric random graph models, where the network topology is explained using an underlying geometric space. We demonstrate that not only can geometric patterns be observed, their wavelength can also be estimated by studying the eigenvectors of the annealed graph Laplacian. Finally, we show that Turing patterns can be found in geometric embeddings of real networks. These results indicate that there is a profound connection between the function of a network and its hidden geometry, even when the associated dynamical processes are exclusively determined by the network topology.},

We demonstrate that an extended atomic superfluid in the presence of a coherent coupling between two internal states exhibits a quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic state. The nature of the transition is experimentally assessed by looking at the phase diagram as a function of the control parameters, at hysteresis phenomena, and at the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization fluctuations around the critical point. We show that the observed features are in good agreement with mean-field calculations. Additionally, we develop experimental protocols to deterministically generate domain walls that separate spatial regions of opposite magnetization in the ferromagnetic state. Thanks to the enhanced coherence properties of our atomic superfluid system compared to standard condensed matter systems, our results open the way toward the study of different aspects of the relaxation dynamics in isolated coherent many-body quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Transitions between the extreme angular-momentum states of alkali D lines hold the potential for enabling accurate high-field optical magnetometry because of their very simple magnetic field dependence described only by a linear and a quadratic term, characterized by the two coefficients γ 1 and γ 2 . Here, we present very accurate measurements of these coefficients, for the cesium D 2 line, thereby overcoming a major obstacle for the realization of this future technology. By means of saturated absorption spectroscopy on a cesium gas, in 3 T and 7 T magnetic fields, we measure the linear magnetic frequency shift of the transition to be γ 1 = 13.994 301 ( 11 ) GHz / T . This measurement corresponds to an optical magnetic field determination of better than 1 ppm accuracy. From this value, we can calculate the fine-structure Landé g-factor g J ( 6 2 P 3 / 2 ) = 1.334 087 49 ( 52 ) . This result is consistent with the previous best measurement, and it improves the accuracy by more than 2 orders of magnitude. We also measure, for the first time, the quadratic diamagnetic shift as γ 2 = 0.4644 ( 35 ) MHz / T 2 . Our work opens up the field of accurate high-field optical magnetometry using atomic cesium, with possible applications in, e.g., medical MRI, fusion reactors, and particle accelerators. These high-accuracy measurements also allow for testing of advanced atomic structure models, as our results are incompatible with the Russel-Saunders coupling value and the hydrogen-constant-core-model value by 31 and 7 standard deviations, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) offer the opportunity to probe the environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) through the torques that accretion disks induce on the binary. Within a Bayesian framework, we study how well such environmental effects can be measured using gravitational wave observations from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We focus on the torque induced by planetary-type migration on quasicircular inspirals and use different prescriptions for geometrically thin and radiatively efficient disks. We find that LISA could detect migration for a wide range of disk viscosities and accretion rates, for both α and β disk prescriptions. For a typical EMRI with masses 50 M ⊙ + 10 6 M ⊙ , we find that LISA could distinguish between migration in α and β disks and measure the torque amplitude with ∼ 20\% relative precision. Provided an accurate torque model, we also show how to turn gravitational-wave measurements of the torque into constraints on the disk properties. Furthermore, we show that, if an electromagnetic counterpart is identified, the multimessenger observations of the AGN EMRI system will yield direct measurements of the disk viscosity. Finally, we investigate the impact of neglecting environmental effects in the analysis of the gravitational-wave signal, finding 3 σ biases in the primary mass and spin, and showing that ignoring such effects can lead to false detection of a deviation from general relativity. This work demonstrates the scientific potential of gravitational observations as probes of accretion-disk physics, accessible so far through electromagnetic observations only.},

  abstract     = {Fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDRs) connect the internal spontaneous fluctuations of a system with its response to an external perturbation. In this work we propose a nonlinear generalized FDR (NL FDR) as a test for Markovianity of the considered nonequilibrium system; i.e., the violation of the NL FDR indicates a non-Markovian process. Previously suggested FDRs are based on linear response and require a significant number of measurements. However, the nonlinear relation holds for systems out of equilibrium and for strong perturbations. Therefore, its verification requires significantly less data than the standard linear relation. We test the NL FDR for two theoretical model systems: a particle in a tilted periodic potential and a harmonically bound particle, each driven either by white noise (leading to Markovian test cases, which should obey the NL FDR) or by colored noise (resulting in non-Markovian systems, which may not obey the relation). The degree of violation is systematically explored for the non-Markovian variants of our theoretical models. For the particle in the harmonically bound potential, all statistical measures entering the NL FDR can be calculated explicitly and can be used to elucidate why the relation is violated in the non-Markovian case. In addition, we apply our formalism and test for Markovianity in an inherently out-of-equilibrium experimental system, a tracer particle, embedded in an active bath of self-propelled agents (bristlebots) and subject to a force applied by an external air stream. An experimental violation of the NL FDR is witnessed by introducing an additional timescale to the process, when using bristlebots with two metastable speed states.},

Photoexcited carriers and phonons are found to primarily induce spectral redshifts of core-level excitations, and a carrier relaxation time and phonon heating time of approximately 360 fs and 1.0 ps are extracted, respectively. Pronounced oscillations in delay-dependent absorption spectra are assigned to coherent excitations of the optical A 1 g phonon (6.0 THz) and the A 1 g * charge density wave amplitude mode (3.3 THz). By comparing the measured spectra with time-dependent density functional theory simulations, we determine the directions of the momentary atomic displacements of both coherent modes and estimate their amplitudes. Interestingly, the spectral fingerprint of the amplitude mode can be associated with many-body electron screening, strengthening the importance of electron-electron and simultaneous electron-phonon interaction for the stability of the charge density wave. In addition, we find that 10\% and 13\% of the absorbed energy is stored in the A 1 g and A 1 g * coherent modes, respectively.

In addition, most social networks are organized so that no individual is more than six connections apart from any other, an empirical regularity known as the six degrees of separation. Why social networks have this ultrasmall-world organization, whereby the graph’s diameter is independent of the network size over several orders of magnitude, is still unknown. We show that the “six degrees of separation” is the property featured by the equilibrium state of any network where individuals weigh between their aspiration to improve their centrality and the costs incurred in forming and maintaining connections. We show, moreover, that the emergence of such a regularity is compatible with all other features, such as clustering and scale-freeness, that normally characterize the structure of social networks. Thus, our results show how simple evolutionary rules of the kind traditionally associated with human cooperation and altruism can also account for the emergence of one of the most intriguing attributes of social networks.},

While the experiment has been realized with small quantum systems, a demonstration of the EPR paradox with massive many-particle systems remains an important challenge, as such systems are particularly closely tied to the concept of local realism in our everyday experience and may serve as probes for new physics at the quantum-to-classical transition. In this work we report an EPR experiment with two spatially separated Bose-Einstein condensates, each containing about 700 rubidium atoms. Entanglement between the condensates results in strong correlations of their collective spins, allowing us to demonstrate the EPR paradox between them. Our results represent the first observation of the EPR paradox with spatially separated, massive many-particle systems. They show that the conflict between quantum mechanics and local realism does not disappear as the system size increases to more than a thousand massive particles. Furthermore, EPR entanglement in conjunction with individual manipulation of the two condensates on the quantum level, as we demonstrate here, constitutes an important resource for quantum metrology and information processing with many-particle systems.},

  abstract     = {The fracture of materials can take place below the critical failure condition via the slow accumulation of internal damage followed by fast crack propagation. While failure due to subcritical fracture accounts for most of the structural failures in use, it is theoretically challenging to bridge the gap between molecular damage and fracture mechanics, not to mention predicting the occurrence of sudden fracture, due to the lack of current nondestructive detection methods with suitable resolution. Here, we investigate the fracture of elastomers by using simultaneously space- and time-resolved multispeckle diffusing wave spectroscopy (MSDWS) and molecular damage mapping by mechanophore. We identify a fracture precursor that accelerates the strain-rate field over a large area ( cm 2 scale), at considerably long times (up to thousands of seconds) before macroscopic fracture occurs. By combining deformation or damage mapping and finite-element simulations of the crack-tip strain field, we unambiguously attribute the macroscopic response in elastic deformation to highly localized molecular damage that occurs over a sample area of about 0.01 mm 2 . By unveiling this mechanism of interaction between the microscopic molecular damage and the minute but long-ranged elastic deformation field, we are able to develop MSDWS as a flexible, well-controlled tool to characterize and predict microscopic damage well before it becomes critical. Tested using ordinary imaging and simple image processing, MSDWS predictions are proven applicable for unlabeled and even opaque samples under different fracture conditions.},

  abstract     = {The detection of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration has, for the first time, allowed for tests of relativistic gravity in the strong, dynamical, and nonlinear regime. Outside Einstein’s relativity, spinning black holes may be different from their general relativistic counterparts, and their merger may then lead to a modified ringdown. We study the latter and, for the first time, derive a modified Teukolsky equation, i.e., a set of linear, decoupled differential equations that describe dynamical perturbations of non-Kerr black holes for the radiative Newman-Penrose scalars Ψ 0 and Ψ 4 . We first focus on non-Ricci-flat, Petrov type- D black hole backgrounds in modified gravity and derive the modified Teukolsky equation through direct decoupling and through a new approach, proposed by Chandrasekhar, that uses certain gauge conditions. We then extend this analysis to non-Ricci-flat, Petrov type-I black hole backgrounds in modified gravity, assuming they can be treated as a linear perturbation of Petrov type- D , black hole backgrounds in general relativity by generalizing Chandrasekhar’s approach, and derive the decoupled modified Teukolsky equation. We further show that our formalism can be extended beyond linear order in both modified gravity corrections and gravitational wave perturbations. Our work lays the foundation to study the gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of black hole coalescence in modified gravity for black holes of any spin. Our work can also be extended to compute gravitational waves emitted by extreme mass-ratio binary inspirals in modified gravity.},

However, strict energy conservation and phase-matching requirements constrain the converted output. To overcome these constraints and enable novel functionalities, we introduce nonlinear networks—systems of nonlinear photonic elements that observe a programmable set of conservation rules. We highlight the diverse capabilities of nonlinear networks by demonstrating an optical-frequency synthesizer, which operates at nearly arbitrary output frequency exceeding the state of the art in synthesized conversion bandwidth. Using a codesigned microresonator network, our synthesizer is based on four-wave mixing (FWM) spectral translation of a tunable laser and a frequency comb. Energy conservation in FWM provides deterministic synthesis, and it allows a nearly arbitrary frequency tuning range by the dependence of resonant FWM on group-velocity dispersion, temperature, and input laser frequency. Moreover, we take advantage of efficient parametric amplification intrinsic to nonlinear networks. We operate spectral translation across output ranges up to 200 THz, and we characterize the synthesizer through precise metrology, demonstrating &lt; 0.1 Hz absolute accuracy. Our experiments introduce nonlinear networks that perform complex functionalities, including optical synthesis with nearly limitless bandwidth.},

  abstract     = {We study theoretically how local measurements performed on critical quantum ground states affect long-distance correlations. These states are highly entangled and feature algebraic correlations between local observables. As a consequence, local measurements can have highly nonlocal effects. Our focus is on Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid ground states, a continuous family of critical states in one dimension whose structure is characterized by a Luttinger parameter K . We show that arbitrarily weak local measurements, performed over extended regions of space, can conspire to drive transitions in long-distance correlations. Conditioning first on a translation-invariant set of measurement outcomes, we show that there is a transition in the character of the postmeasurement quantum state for K &lt; 1 , and highlight a formal analogy with the effect of a static defect on transport through a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. To investigate the full ensemble of measurement outcomes, we consider averages of physical quantities which are necessarily nonlinear in the system density matrix. We show how their behavior can be understood within a replica field theory, and for the measurements that we consider we find that the symmetry of the theory under exchange of replicas is broken for K &lt; 1 / 2 . A well-known barrier to experimentally observing the collective effects of multiple measurements has been the need to postselect on random outcomes. Here we resolve this problem by introducing cross-correlations between experimental measurement results and classical simulations, which act as resource-efficient probes of the transition. The phenomena we discuss are, moreover, robust to local decoherence.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, x-ray scattering techniques have been used to detect the breaking of the structural symmetry of the lattice, which accompanies a periodic displacement of the atoms associated with charge density wave (CDW) formation in the cuprate pseudogap states. Similarly, spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has visualized the short-range CDW. However, local coupling of electrons to the lattice in the form of a short-range CDW has been a challenge to visualize; thus, a link between these measurements has been missing. Here, we introduce a novel STM-based technique to visualize the local bond-length variations obtained from topographic imaging with picometer precision. Application of this technique to the high- T c cuprate superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 + δ reveals a high-fidelity local lattice distortion of the BiO lattice as large as 2\%. In addition, analysis of local breaking of rotational symmetry associated with the bond lengths reveals modulations around four-unit-cell periodicity in both B 1 and E representations in the C 4 v group of the lattice, which coincides with the unidirectional d -symmetry CDW ( d CDW ) previously identified within the CuO 2 planes, thus providing direct evidence of electron-lattice coupling in the pseudogap state and a link between the x-ray scattering and STM measurements. Overall, our results suggest that the periodic lattice displacements in E representations correspond to a locally frozen version of the soft phonons identified by the x-ray scattering measurements, and a fluctuation of the bond length is reflected by the fluctuation of the d CDW formation near the quantum critical point.},

  abstract     = {In P T -symmetric systems, the notion of non-Abelian frame charges enables multiband topological characterization of degeneracies by examining the eigenvector-frame rotations. Interestingly, some features of these frame charges can be viewed as an analog of electric charges confined in conducting wires, only that they flow in momentum space along nodal lines. But different from electric charges, these frame charges are not integers, and non-Abelian signatures emerge when braiding between adjacent band nodal lines occurs, which flips the direction of the flow. In photonic systems, the photonic Γ point serves as the source or sink of such a frame charge flow due to a hidden braiding induced by the often-ignored electrostatic mode at zero frequency. This source naturally generates non-Abelian topological signatures in P T -symmetric photonic systems that can be identified even in ordinary dielectric media. We use biaxial photonic crystals as examples to show how complex nodal line configurations can be explained as the topological consequences of the frame charge flow from the Γ point to the Brillouin zone boundaries. Our results reveal that non-Abelian band topology is intrinsically manifested in general photonic systems, making them easily accessible platforms for exploring non-Abelian physics.},

  abstract     = {Feedback is a powerful and ubiquitous technique both in classical and quantum system control. Its standard implementation relies on measuring the state of a system, processing the classical signal, and feeding it back to the system. In quantum physics, however, measurements not only read out the state of the system but also modify it irreversibly. Coherent feedback is a different kind of feedback that coherently processes and feeds back quantum signals without actually measuring the system. Here, we report on the experimental realization and the theoretical analysis of an optical coherent feedback platform to control the motional state of a nanomechanical membrane in an optical cavity. The coherent feedback loop consists of a light field interacting twice with the same mechanical mode through different cavity modes, without performing any measurement. Tuning the optical phase and delay of the feedback loop allows us to control the motional state of the mechanical oscillator, its resonance frequency, and also its damping rate, which we use to cool the membrane close to the quantum ground state. Our theoretical analysis provides the optimal cooling conditions, showing that this new technique enables ground-state cooling. Experimentally, we show that we can cool the membrane to a state with n ¯ m = 4.89 ± 0.14 phonons ( 480 μ K ) in a 20 K environment. This lies below the theoretical limit of cavity dynamical backaction cooling in the unresolved sideband regime and is achieved with only 1\% of the optical power required for cavity cooling. Our feedback scheme is very versatile, offering new opportunities for quantum control in a variety of optomechanical systems.},

  abstract     = {The adaptive immune system constantly remodels its lymphocyte repertoire for better protection against future pathogens. Its ability to improve antigen recognition on the fly relies on somatic mutation and selective expansion of B lymphocytes expressing high-affinity antigen receptors. However, this rapid evolution inside an individual appears ineffective, hitting a modest ceiling of antigen-binding affinity. Only recently, experiments began to reveal that evolving B cells physically extract antigens from presenting cells using active forces, and that the extraction level dictates clonal fitness. These observations challenge the prevailing view that the equilibrium constant of receptor-antigen binding determines selective advantage of a B cell clone. Here, we present a theoretical framework to explore ways in which tug-of-war antigen extraction impacts the quality and diversity of an evolved B cell repertoire. We propose that the apparent “ineffectiveness” of in vivo selection can be a direct consequence of nonequilibrium antigen recognition. Our theory predicts, on the one hand, that the physical limits of antigen tether strength, under tugging forces, set the affinity ceiling. On the other hand, intriguingly, cells can use force heterogeneity to diversify binding phenotype without compromising fitness, thus remaining plastic under resource constraint. These results suggest that active probing of receptor quality—via a molecular tug of war during antigen recognition—limits the potency of response to current antigens, but confer adaptive benefit against future variants. By bridging physical mechanisms and evolved functions, this work reveals a multifaceted role of active forces in immune adaptation, which rationalizes key observations on repertoire dynamics.},

For each 0.045 Hz frequency band and every point on the sky the atlas provides gravitational wave amplitude upper limits, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and frequencies where the search measures the maximum SNR. The approximately top 1.5\% of the atlas results are reanalyzed with a series of more sensitive searches with the purpose of finding high SNR long coherence signals from isolated neutron stars. However, these searches do not reveal the presence of such signals. The results presented in the atlas are produced with the Falcon pipeline and cover nearly monochromatic gravitational-wave signals in the 500–1000 Hz band, with up to ± 5 × 10 − 11 Hz / s frequency derivative. The Falcon pipeline computes loosely coherent power estimates to search data using a succession of coherence lengths. For this search we use six months of data, started with a 12 hour coherence length and progress to six days. Compared to the most sensitive results previously published (also produced with the Falcon pipeline), our upper limits are 50\% more constraining. Neutron stars with ellipticity of 10 − 8 can be detected up to 150 pc away, while allowing for a large fraction of the stars’ energy to be lost through nongravitational channels.

As light travels at a finite speed, these cavities are optimal for enhancing signals at frequencies within the bandwidth, beyond which, however, a small amount of optical loss will significantly impact the high-frequency signals. We find an elegant interferometer configuration with an “ L resonator” as the core, significantly surpassing the loss-limited sensitivity of dual-recycled Fabry-Perot-Michelson interferometers at high frequencies. Following this concept, we provide a broadband design of a 25-km detector with outstanding sensitivity between 2 and 4 kHz. We perform Monte Carlo population studies of binary neutron-star mergers, given the most recent merger rate from the GWTC-3 catalog and several representative neutron-star equations of state. We find that the new interferometer configuration significantly outperforms other third-generation detectors by a factor of 1.7 to 4 in the signal-to-noise ratio of the postmerger signal. Assuming a detection threshold with signal-to-noise ratio &gt; 5 and for the cases we explore, the new design is the only detector that robustly achieves a detection rate of the neutron-star postmerger larger than one per year, with the expected rate between O ( 1 ) and O ( 10 ) events per year.},

  abstract     = {Numerical integrations of the Solar System reveal a remarkable stability of the orbits of the inner planets over billions of years, in spite of their chaotic variations characterized by a Lyapunov time of only 5 million years and the lack of integrals of motion able to constrain their dynamics. To open a window on such long-term behavior, we compute the entire Lyapunov spectrum of a forced secular model of the inner planets. We uncover a hierarchy of characteristic exponents that spans 2 orders of magnitude, manifesting a slow-fast dynamics with a broad separation of timescales. A systematic analysis of the Fourier harmonics of the Hamiltonian, based on computer algebra, reveals three symmetries that characterize the strongest resonances responsible for the orbital chaos. These symmetries are broken only by weak resonances, leading to the existence of quasi-integrals of motion that are shown to relate to the smallest Lyapunov exponents. A principal component analysis of the orbital solutions independently confirms that the quasi-integrals are among the slowest degrees of freedom of the dynamics. Strong evidence emerges that they effectively constrain the chaotic diffusion of the orbits, playing a crucial role in the statistical stability over the Solar System lifetime.},

  abstract     = {The theory of circuit quantum electrodynamics has successfully analyzed superconducting circuits on the basis of the classical Lagrangian, and the corresponding quantized Hamiltonian describing these circuits. In many simplified versions of these networks, the modeling involves a singular Lagrangian that employs Kirchhoff’s laws to eliminate inherent constraints of the system. In this work, we demonstrate the failure of such singular theories for the quantization of realistic, nearly singular superconducting circuits. Instead, we rigorously prove the validity of a perturbative analysis within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In particular, we find that the limiting behavior of the low-energy dynamics obtained from the regularized approach exhibits a fixed-point structure flowing to one of a few universal fixed points as parasitic capacitance values go to zero. This singular limit of the regularized analysis is, in many cases, completely unlike the singular theory. Consequently, we conclude that classical network synthesis techniques which build on Kirchhoff’s laws must be critically examined prior to applying circuit quantization.},

Spin-wave moiré edge modes are detected at an optimal twist angle and with a selective excitation frequency. At a given twist angle, the magnetic field acts as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the chiral behavior of the magnon edge modes. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the edge modes emerge within the original magnonic band gap and at the intersection between a mini flatband and a propagation magnon branch. Our theoretical estimate for the Berry curvature of the magnon-magnon coupling suggests a nontrivial topology for the chiral edge modes and confirms the key role played by the dipolar interaction. Our findings shed light on the topological nature of the magnon edge mode for emergent moiré magnonics.},

  abstract     = {The correlation functions of quantum systems—central objects in quantum field theories—are defined in high-dimensional space-time domains. Their numerical treatment thus suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which hinders the application of sophisticated many-body theories to interesting problems. Here, we propose a multiscale space-time ansatz for correlation functions of quantum systems based on quantics tensor trains (QTTs), “qubits” describing exponentially different length scales. The ansatz then assumes a separation of length scales by decomposing the resulting high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains (also known as matrix product states). We numerically verify the ansatz for various equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems and demonstrate compression ratios of several orders of magnitude for challenging cases. Essential building blocks of diagrammatic equations, such as convolutions or Fourier transforms, are formulated in the compressed form. We numerically demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the proposed methods for the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. The QTT representation provides a unified framework for implementing efficient computations of quantum field theories.},

  abstract     = {We present results from three-dimensional hybrid-kinetic simulations of Alfvénic turbulence in a high- β , collisionless plasma. The key feature of such turbulence is the interplay between local wave-wave interactions between the fluctuations in the cascade and the nonlocal wave-particle interactions associated with kinetic microinstabilities driven by anisotropy in the thermal pressure (namely, firehose, mirror, and ion cyclotron). We present theoretical estimates for, and calculate directly from the simulations, the effective collisionality and plasma viscosity in pressure-anisotropic high- β turbulence, demonstrating that, for strong Alfvénic turbulence, the effective parallel-viscous scale is comparable to the driving scale of the cascade. Below this scale, the kinetic-energy spectrum indicates an Alfvénic cascade with a slope steeper than − 5 / 3 due to the anisotropic viscous stress. The magnetic-energy spectrum is shallower than − 5 / 3 near the ion-Larmor scale due to fluctuations produced by the firehose instability. Most of the cascade energy ( ≈ 80\% – 90\% ) is dissipated as ion heating through a combination of Landau damping and anisotropic viscous heating. Our results have implications for models of particle heating in low-luminosity accretion onto supermassive black holes, the effective viscosity of the intracluster medium, and the interpretation of near-Earth solar-wind observations.},

  abstract     = {Orbital degrees of freedom play an essential role in metals, semiconductors, and strongly confined electronic systems. Experiments with ultracold atoms have used highly anisotropic confinement to explore low-dimensional physics, but they typically eliminate orbital degrees of freedom by preparing atoms in the motional ground states of the strongly confined directions. Here, we prepare multiband systems of spin-polarized fermionic potassium ( K 40 ) in the quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) regime and quantify the strength of atom-atom correlations using radio-frequency spectroscopy. The activation of orbital degrees of freedom leads to a new phenomenon: a low-energy scattering channel that has even particle-exchange parity along the q1D axis, as if the underlying interactions were s -wave. This emergent exchange symmetry is enabled by orbital singlet wave functions in the strongly confined directions, which also confer high-momentum components to low-energy q1D collisions. We measure both the q1D odd-wave and even-wave “contact” parameters for the first time and compare them to theoretical predictions of one-dimensional many-body models. The strength and spatial symmetry of interactions are tuned by a p -wave Feshbach resonance and by transverse confinement strength. Near resonance, the even-wave contact approaches its theoretical unitary value, whereas the maximum observed odd-wave contact remains several orders of magnitude below its unitary limit. Low-energy scattering channels of multi-orbital systems, such as those found here, may provide new routes for the exploration of universal many-body phenomena.},

Here we show that the symmetry group protecting the Dirac cone in such materials determines whether a Dirac band may be flattened by the tuning of a small number of parameters. We devise a criterion that, given a symmetry group, allows for the calculation of the number of parameters required to make the Dirac velocity vanish. This criterion is employed to study band flattening in twisted bilayer graphene and in surface states of 3D topological insulators. Following this discussion, we identify the symmetries under which the vanishing of the Dirac velocity implies the emergence of perfectly flat bands. Our analysis allows us to construct additional model Hamiltonians that display perfectly flat bands at certain points in the space of parameters: the first is a toy model of two coupled 3D topological insulator surfaces, and the second is a quasicrystalline generalization of the chiral model of twisted bilayer graphene.},

  abstract     = {The planted-coloring problem is a prototypical inference problem for which thresholds for Bayes-optimal algorithms, like belief propagation (BP), can be computed analytically. In this paper, we analyze the limits and performances of simulated annealing (SA), a Monte-Carlo-based algorithm that is more general and robust than BP, and thus of broader applicability. We show that SA is suboptimal in the recovery of the planted solution because it gets attracted by glassy states that, instead, do not influence the BP algorithm. At variance with previous conjectures, we propose an analytic estimation for the SA algorithmic threshold by comparing the spinodal point of the paramagnetic phase and the dynamical critical temperature. This is a fundamental connection between thermodynamical phase transitions and out-of-equilibrium behavior of Glauber dynamics. We also study an improved version of SA, called replicated SA (RSA), where several weakly coupled replicas are cooled down together. We show numerical evidence that the algorithmic threshold for the RSA coincides with the Bayes-optimal one. Finally, we develop an approximated analytical theory explaining the optimal performances of RSA and predicting the location of the transition toward the planted solution in the limit of a very large number of replicas. Our results for RSA support the idea that mismatching the parameters in the prior with respect to those of the generative model may produce an algorithm that is optimal and very robust.},

Intriguingly, we observe a broad distribution of density and valence of the minicircles, indicating heterogeneous network structure and individualism of different kDNA structures. Finally, we estimate the 2D Young modulus of the network to be orders of magnitude smaller than that of other 2D materials.

Yet, the emergence of conformal invariance in the 3D Ising transition has rarely been explored directly, mainly due to unavoidable mathematical or conceptual obstructions. Here, we design an innovative way to study the quantum version of the 3D Ising phase transition on spherical geometry, using the “fuzzy (noncommutative) sphere” regularization. We accurately calculate and analyze the energy spectra at the transition, and explicitly demonstrate the state-operator correspondence (i.e., radial quantization), a fingerprint of conformal field theory. In particular, we identify13 parity-even primary operators within a high accuracy and two parity-odd operators that were not known before. Our result directly elucidates the emergent conformal symmetry of the 3D Ising transition, a conjecture made by Polyakov half a century ago. More importantly, our approach opens a new avenue for studying 3D conformal field theories by making use of the state-operator correspondence and spherical geometry.},

We report on the observation of a sizable magneto-thermoelectric (Nernst) effect in the normal state of K 3 C 60 , which displays the characteristics of superconducting fluctuations. This nonquasiparticle Nernst effect emerges from an ordinary quasiparticle background below a temperature of 80 K, far above T c = 20 K .

The behavior at higher magnetic fields displays a symmetry between the magnetic length and the correlation length of the system.

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen remarkable development in open quantum systems effectively described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A unique feature of non-Hermitian topological systems is the skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates driven by nonreciprocal dissipation. Despite its significance for non-Hermitian topological phases, the relevance of the skin effect to quantum entanglement and critical phenomena has remained unclear. Here, we find that the skin effect induces a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition in the entanglement dynamics. We show that the skin effect gives rise to a macroscopic flow of particles and suppresses the entanglement propagation and thermalization, leading to the area law of the entanglement entropy in the nonequilibrium steady state. Moreover, we reveal an entanglement phase transition induced by the competition between the unitary dynamics and the skin effect even without disorder or interactions. This entanglement phase transition accompanies nonequilibrium quantum criticality characterized by a nonunitary conformal field theory whose effective central charge is extremely sensitive to the boundary conditions. We also demonstrate that it originates from an exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the concomitant scale invariance of the skin modes localized according to the power law. Furthermore, we show that the skin effect leads to the purification and the reduction of von Neumann entropy even in Markovian open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation. Our work opens a way to control the entanglement growth and establishes a fundamental understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena in open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Biological constraints often impose restrictions on plasticity rules such as locality and reward-based rather than supervised learning. Two learning rules that comply with these restrictions are weight (WP) and node (NP) perturbation. NP is often used in learning studies, in particular, as a benchmark; it is considered to be superior to WP and more likely neurobiologically realized, as the number of weights and, therefore, their perturbation dimension typically massively exceed the number of nodes. Here, we show that this conclusion no longer holds when we take two properties into account that are relevant for biological and artificial neural network learning: First, tasks extend in time and/or are trained in batches. This increases the perturbation dimension of NP but not WP. Second, tasks are (comparably) low dimensional, with many weight configurations providing solutions. We analytically delineate regimes where these properties let WP perform as well as or better than NP. Furthermore, we find that the changes in weight space directions that are irrelevant for the task differ qualitatively between WP and NP and that only in WP gathering batches of subtasks in a trial decreases the number of trials required. This may allow one to experimentally distinguish which of the two rules underlies a learning process. Our insights suggest new learning rules which combine for specific task types the advantages of WP and NP. If the inputs are similarly correlated, temporally correlated perturbations improve NP. Using numerical simulations, we generalize the results to networks with various architectures solving biologically relevant and standard network learning tasks. Our findings, together with WP’s practicability, suggest WP as a useful benchmark and plausible model for learning in the brain.},

  abstract     = {Cat states, with their unique phase-space interference properties, are ideal candidates for understanding fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and performing key quantum information processing tasks. However, they are highly susceptible to photon loss, which inevitably diminishes their quantum non-Gaussian features. Here, we protect these non-Gaussian features against photon loss by compressing the phase-space distribution of a cat state. We achieve this compression with a deterministic technique based on the echoed conditional displacement operation in a circuit QED device. We present a versatile technique for creating robust non-Gaussian continuous-variable resource states in a highly linear bosonic mode and manipulating their phase-space distribution to achieve enhanced resilience against photon loss. Such compressed cat states offer an attractive avenue for obtaining new insights into quantum foundations and quantum metrology, as well as for developing inherently more protected bosonic code words for quantum error correction.},

  abstract     = {A goal of unsupervised machine learning is to build representations of complex high-dimensional data, with simple relations to their properties. Such disentangled representations make it easier to interpret the significant latent factors of variation in the data, as well as to generate new data with desirable features. The methods for disentangling representations often rely on an adversarial scheme, in which representations are tuned to avoid discriminators from being able to reconstruct information about the data properties (labels). Unfortunately, adversarial training is generally difficult to implement in practice. Here we propose a simple, effective way of disentangling representations without any need to train adversarial discriminators and apply our approach to Restricted Boltzmann Machines, one of the simplest representation-based generative models. Our approach relies on the introduction of adequate constraints on the weights during training, which allows us to concentrate information about labels on a small subset of latent variables. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated with four examples: the CelebA dataset of facial images, the two-dimensional Ising model, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, and the taxonomy of protein families. In addition, we show how our framework allows for analytically computing the cost, in terms of the log-likelihood of the data, associated with the disentanglement of their representations.},

Often, each measurement conveys only the relationship between a pair of entries, and it is difficult to integrate these local interactions across a dataset to form a cohesive global picture. The classic localization problem tackles this question, transforming local measurements into a global map that reveals the underlying structure of a system. Here, we examine the more challenging bipartite localization problem, where pairwise distances are available only for bipartite data comprising two classes of entries (such as antibody-virus interactions, drug-cell potency, or user-rating profiles). We modify previous algorithms to solve bipartite localization and examine how each method behaves in the presence of noise, outliers, and partially observed data. As a proof of concept, we apply these algorithms to antibody-virus neutralization measurements to create a basis set of antibody behaviors, formalize how potently inhibiting some viruses necessitates weakly inhibiting other viruses, and quantify how often combinations of antibodies exhibit degenerate behavior.},

Assuming that axions make up all of the dark matter in the Sun’s vicinity, we find a median 95\% upper limit on the neutron-spin coupling of 2.4 × 10 − 10 GeV − 1 for most axion masses from 0.4 to 4 feV, which is about 5 orders of magnitude more stringent than previous laboratory bounds in that mass range.

  abstract     = {A central challenge in analog quantum simulation is to characterize desirable physical properties of quantum states produced in experiments. However, in conventional approaches, the extraction of arbitrary information requires performing measurements in many different bases, which necessitates a high level of control that present-day quantum devices may not have. Here, we propose and analyze a scalable protocol that leverages the ergodic nature of generic quantum dynamics, enabling the efficient extraction of many physical properties. The protocol does not require sophisticated controls and can be generically implemented in analog quantum simulation platforms today. Our protocol involves introducing ancillary degrees of freedom in a predetermined state to a system of interest, quenching the joint system under Hamiltonian dynamics native to the particular experimental platform, and then measuring globally in a single, fixed basis. We show that arbitrary information of the original quantum state is contained within such measurement data and can be extracted using a classical data-processing procedure. We numerically demonstrate our approach with a number of examples, including the measurements of entanglement entropy, many-body Chern number, and various superconducting orders in systems of neutral atom arrays, bosonic and fermionic particles on optical lattices, respectively, only assuming existing technological capabilities. Our protocol excitingly promises to overcome limited controllability and, thus, enhance the versatility and utility of near-term quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {We report on the population properties of compact binary mergers inferred from gravitational-wave observations of these systems during the first three LIGO-Virgo observing runs. The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3) contains signals consistent with three classes of binary mergers: binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star–black hole mergers. We infer the binary neutron star merger rate to be between 10 and 1700 Gpc − 3 yr − 1 and the neutron star–black hole merger rate to be between 7.8 and 140 Gpc − 3 yr − 1 , assuming a constant rate density in the comoving frame and taking the union of 90\% credible intervals for methods used in this work. We infer the binary black hole merger rate, allowing for evolution with redshift, to be between 17.9 and 44 Gpc − 3 yr − 1 at a fiducial redshift ( z = 0.2 ). The rate of binary black hole mergers is observed to increase with redshift at a rate proportional to ( 1 + z ) κ with κ = 2. 9 − 1.8 + 1.7 for z ≲ 1 . Using both binary neutron star and neutron star–black hole binaries, we obtain a broad, relatively flat neutron star mass distribution extending from 1.2 − 0.2 + 0.1 to 2.0 − 0.3 + 0.3 M ⊙ . We confidently determine that the merger rate as a function of mass sharply declines after the expected maximum neutron star mass, but cannot yet confirm or rule out the existence of a lower mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. We also find the binary black hole mass distribution has localized over- and underdensities relative to a power-law distribution, with peaks emerging at chirp masses of 8.3 − 0.5 + 0.3 and 27.9 − 1.8 + 1.9 M ⊙ . While we continue to find that the mass distribution of a binary’s more massive component strongly decreases as a function of primary mass, we observe no evidence of a strongly suppressed merger rate above approximately 60 M ⊙ , which would indicate the presence of a upper mass gap. Observed black hole spins are small, with half of spin magnitudes below χ i ≈ 0.25 . While the majority of spins are preferentially aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we infer evidence of antialigned spins among the binary population. We observe an increase in spin magnitude for systems with more unequal-mass ratio. We also observe evidence of misalignment of spins relative to the orbital angular momentum.},

Under zero magnetic field, we found a stochastic distribution of isolated anomalous vortices and antivortices with flux quanta Φ 0 . By applying a small local magnetic field under the coil of the nano-SQUID device, we observed hysteretic flipping of the vortices reminiscent of the switching of ferromagnetic domains, suggesting locally broken time-reversal symmetry. We further observed vectorial rotation of a flux line linking a vortex-antivortex pair by manipulating the local field. These unique properties of the anomalous vortices satisfy the defining criteria of QAV.

A simple toy model to study such fluctuations in an out-of-equilibrium setting is the open quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (Q-SSEP), which describes spinless fermions in one dimension hopping to neighboring sites with random amplitudes coupled between two reservoirs. Here, we show that the dynamics of fluctuations of coherences in Q-SSEP have a natural interpretation as free cumulants, a concept from free probability theory. Based on this insight, we provide heuristic arguments as to why we expect free probability theory to be an appropriate framework to describe coherent fluctuations in generic mesoscopic systems where the noise emerges from a coarse-grained description. In the case of Q-SSEP, we show how the link to free probability theory can be used to derive the time evolution of connected fluctuations of coherences as well as a simple steady-state solution.},

  abstract     = {Chirality is widespread in nature, playing a fundamental role in biochemical processes and in the origin of life itself. The observation of dynamics in chiral molecules is crucial for the understanding and control of the chiral activity of photoexcited states. One of the most promising techniques for the study of photoexcited chiral systems is time-resolved photoelectron circular dichroism (TR-PECD), which offers an intense and sensitive probe for vibronic and geometric molecular structure as well as electronic structures, and their evolution on a femtosecond timescale. However, the nonlocal character of the PECD effect, which is imprinted during the electron scattering off the molecule, makes the interpretation of TR-PECD experiments challenging. In this respect, core photoionization is known to allow site and chemical sensitivity to photelectron spectroscopy. Here we demonstrate that TR-PECD utilizing core-level photoemission enables probing the chiral electronic structure and its relaxation dynamics with atomic site sensitivity. Following UV pumped excitation to a 3 s Rydberg state, fenchone enantiomers ( C 10 H 16 O ) were probed on a femtosecond scale using circularly polarized soft x-ray light pulses provided by the free-electron laser FERMI. C 1 s binding energy shifts caused by the redistribution of valence electron density in this 3 s -valence-Rydberg excitation allowed us to measure transient PECD chiral responses with an enhanced C atom site selectivity compared to that achievable in the ground state molecule. This chemical-specific, site-specific, and enantiosensitive observation of the electronic structure of a transiently photoexcited chiral molecule is expected to pave the way toward chiral femtochemistry probed by core-level photoemission.},

  abstract     = {We consider critical one-dimensional quantum systems initially prepared in their ground state and perturbed by a smooth noise coupled to the energy density. By using conformal field theory, we deduce a universal description of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. In particular, the full time-dependent distribution of any two-point chiral correlation function can be obtained from solving two coupled ordinary stochastic differential equations. In contrast to the general expectation of heating, we demonstrate that, over the noise realizations, the system reaches a nontrivial and universal stationary distribution of states characterized by broad tails of physical quantities. As an example, we analyze the entanglement entropy production associated to a given interval of size ℓ . The corresponding stationary distribution has a 3 / 2 right tail for all ℓ and converges to a one-sided Levy stable for large ℓ . We obtain a similar result for the local energy density: While its first moment diverges exponentially fast in time, the stationary distribution, which we derive analytically, is symmetric around a negative median and exhibits a fat tail with 3 / 2 decay exponent. We show that this stationary distribution for the energy density emerges even if the initial state is prepared at finite temperature. Our results are benchmarked via analytical and numerical calculations for a chain of noninteracting spinless fermions with excellent agreement.},

  abstract     = {Optically active solid-state spin defects have the potential to become a versatile resource for quantum information processing applications. Nitrogen-vacancy defect centers (NV) in diamond act as quantum memories and can be interfaced with coherent photons as demonstrated in entanglement protocols. However, particularly in diamond nanostructures, the effect of spectral diffusion leads to optical decoherence hindering entanglement generation. In this work, we present strategies to significantly reduce the electric noise in diamond nanostructures. We demonstrate single NVs in nanopillars exhibiting a lifetime-limited linewidth on a timescale of one second and long-term spectral stability with an inhomogeneous linewidth as low as 150 MHz over three minutes. Excitation power and energy-dependent measurements in combination with nanoscopic Monte Carlo simulations contribute to a better understanding of the impact of bulk and surface defects on the NV’s spectral properties. Finally, we propose an entanglement protocol for nanostructure-coupled NVs providing entanglement generation rates up to hundreds of kHz.},

The dilute limit allows us to unravel some finite size effects and propose a mechanism for the delocalization of these impurities in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show that impurities always relax by exchanging energy with the rest of the chain. The relaxation rate only weakly depends on the impurity density and decays exponentially, up to logarithmic corrections, with the field strength. We connect the relaxation to fast operator spreading and show that the same mechanism destabilizes the recursive construction of local integrals of motion at any impurity density. In the high field limit, impurities appear to be localized, and the system is nonergodic, over a wide range of system sizes. However, this is a transient effect, and the eventual delocalization can be understood in terms of a flowing localization length.},

  abstract     = {We theoretically and experimentally investigate the formation of dissipative coherent structures in Kerr nonlinear optical microresonators, whose spectrum encompasses an integrated dispersion that exceeds the cavity free-spectral range. We are able to access this regime in low-dispersion photonic chip-based microresonators by employing synchronous pulse driving, which increases the peak power over the continuous-wave-driving regime. Exploring this dispersion-folded regime, we demonstrate that the presence of periodically varying dispersion can excite higher-order comb structures, which we explore in both the normal and anomalous dispersion regimes. In the former, we observe the coexistence of switching wave fronts with Faraday instability-induced period-doubling patterns. They manifest as strong satellite microcombs highly separated either side of the core microcomb, at an offset close to half the repetition rate but while sharing the same repetition rate. In the latter, for dissipative Kerr solitons in anomalous dispersion, we observe the formation of higher-order phase-matched dispersive waves (“Kelly-like” sidebands), where the folded dispersion crosses the frequency comb grid. We observe up to the fifth higher-order dispersive wave in our experiments and show that these higher-order dispersive waves coherently extend the soliton frequency comb bandwidth significantly. For both cases, we show that our results can be understood by considering four-wave mixing in a two-dimensional Fourier transform representation. The results demonstrate the rich novel nonlinear dynamics of driven dissipative nonlinear cavities with periodically varying dispersion in the dispersion-folded pumping regime.},

  abstract     = {Correlated electron states are at the root of many important phenomena including unconventional superconductivity (USC), where electron pairing arises from repulsive interactions. Computing the properties of correlated electrons, such as the critical temperature T c for the onset of USC, efficiently and reliably from the microscopic physics with quantitative methods remains a major challenge for almost all models and materials. In this theoretical work, we combine matrix product states (MPS) with static mean field (MF) to provide a solution to this challenge for quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) systems: two- and three-dimensional materials comprised of weakly coupled correlated 1D fermions. This MPS + MF framework for the ground state and thermal equilibrium properties of Q1D fermions is developed and validated for attractive Hubbard systems first, and further enhanced via analytical field theory. We then deploy it to compute T c for superconductivity in 3D arrays of weakly coupled, doped, and repulsive Hubbard ladders. The MPS + MF framework thus enables the quantitative study of USC and high- T c superconductivity—and potentially many more correlated phases—in fermionic Q1D systems based directly on their microscopic parameters, in ways inaccessible to previous methods. This approach further allows one to treat competing macroscopic orders, such as superconducting and insulating ones, on an equal footing. Benchmarks of the framework using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo techniques show that the overestimation of, e.g., T c due to its mean-field component, is near constant in microscopic parameters. These features of the MPS + MF approach to correlated fermions open up the possibility of designing deliberately optimized Q1D superconductors, from experiments in ultracold gases to synthesizing new materials.},

  abstract     = {The studies of disordered heterogeneous media and galaxy cosmology share a common goal: analyzing the disordered distribution of particles and/or building blocks at microscales to predict physical properties of the medium at macroscales, whether it be a liquid, colloidal suspension, composite material, galaxy cluster, or entire Universe. The theory of disordered heterogeneous media provides an array of theoretical and computational techniques to characterize a wide class of complex material microstructures. In this work, we apply them to describe the disordered distributions of galaxies obtained from recent suites of dark matter simulations. We focus on the determination of lower-order correlation functions, void and particle nearest-neighbor functions, certain cluster statistics, pair-connectedness functions, percolation properties, and a scalar order metric to quantify the degree of order. Compared to analogous homogeneous Poisson and typical disordered systems, the cosmological simulations exhibit enhanced large-scale clustering and longer tails in the void and particle nearest-neighbor functions, due to the presence of quasi-long-range correlations imprinted by early Universe physics, with a minimum particle separation far below the mean nearest-neighbor distance. On large scales, the system appears hyperuniform, as a result of primordial density fluctuations, while on the smallest scales, the system becomes almost antihyperuniform, as evidenced by its number variance. Additionally, via a finite-scaling analysis, we compute the percolation threshold of the galaxy catalogs, finding this to be significantly lower than for Poisson realizations (at reduced density η c = 0.25 in our fiducial analysis compared to η c = 0.34 ), with strong dependence on the mean density; this is consistent with the observation that the galaxy distribution contains voids of up to 50\% larger radius. However, the two sets of simulations appear to share the same fractal dimension on scales much larger than the average intergalaxy separation, implying that they lie in the same universality class. We also show that the distribution of galaxies is a highly correlated disordered system (relative to the uncorrelated Poisson distribution), as measured by the τ order metric. Finally, we consider the ability of large-scale clustering statistics to constrain cosmological parameters, such as the Universe’s expansion rate, using simulation-based inference. Both the nearest-neighbor distribution and pair-connectedness function (which includes contributions from correlation functions of all order) are found to considerably tighten bounds on the amplitude of quantum-mechanical fluctuations from inflation at a level equivalent to observing 25 times more galaxies. The pair-connectedness function in particular provides a useful alternative to the standard three-particle correlation, since it contains similar large-scale information to the three-point function, can be computed highly efficiently, and can be straightforwardly extended to small scales (though likely requires simulation-based modeling). This work provides the first application of such techniques to cosmology, providing both a novel system to test heterogeneous media descriptors and a tranche of new tools for cosmological analyses. A range of extensions are possible, including implementation on observational data; this will require further study on various observational effects, necessitating high-resolution simulations.},

The energy gap is reduced by about 0.6 eV in going from 80 to 650 K but the near Fermi level intensity remains small, classifying LaCoO 3 as a bad metal even in the metallic phase. We are able to explain the spectra in terms of incoherent sums of low-spin and high-spin Co 3 + spectra. We also find that the energy parameters for the two Co sites are very different, revealing that paramagnetic LaCoO 3 is a highly inhomogeneous system with local lattice relaxations that are spin-state-specific.

  abstract     = {Multipolar spindles are very rare in normal tissues, but they are much more prevalent in many tumors, which might be induced by the mechanical confinements from overcrowding microenvironments in tumors. However, little is known about what the difference is between various forms of mechanical confinements that cells encounter in normal tissues and tumor tissues, and how they affect multipolarity and chromosome segregation fidelity. Here, we use microchannels with different heights and widths to mimic diverse forms and degrees of mechanical constraints within the tissue architecture. We find that multipolar spindles occur frequently under two-wall confinement but that they are rare under four-wall confinement, suggesting that multipolar-spindle assembly depends on the form of the three-dimensional mechanical confinement. We reveal that two-wall confinement leads to an increased fraction of multipolar spindles by pole splitting, while four-wall confinement restrains multipolarity by the enhancement of pole clustering and the inhibition of pole splitting. We further conduct numerical simulations and develop a theoretical model to investigate how mechanical confinement influences pole splitting and clustering. By exploring the energy landscape of pole-pole interactions and pole-cortex interactions and treating pole splitting and clustering as reversible reactions, we demonstrate that mechanical confinement controls cell shape and pole-cortex interactions, which, in turn, change the energy barriers of pole splitting and clustering as well as the probability of multipolar mitosis. Further experiments confirm the theoretical prediction that the pole-cortex interaction determines the probability of the multipolar spindles under various mechanical confinements. Our findings demonstrate the extent to which extracellular microenvironments and tissue architecture can affect complex cellular behaviors, indicating that normal tissue architecture may have the ability to suppress the progress of cancers. Thus, our findings would provide essential cues for cancer therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment.},

Recent theoretical works suggest that Weyl electrons can also participate in magnetic interactions, and the Weyl-mediated indirect exchange coupling between local moments is proposed as a new mechanism to induce spiral magnetic ordering by involving chiral Weyl electrons. Here, we present evidence of Weyl-mediated spiral magnetism in SmAlSi from neutron diffraction, transport, and thermodynamic data. We show that the spiral order in SmAlSi results from the nesting between topologically nontrivial Fermi pockets and weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy, unlike related materials (Ce,Pr,Nd)AlSi, where a strong anisotropy prevents the spins from freely rotating. We map the magnetic phase diagram of SmAlSi and reveal an A phase where topological magnetic excitations may exist. Within the A phase, we find a large topological Hall effect whose variation with the magnetic field direction suggests a dominant helical instead of cycloidal character, as theoretically predicted for the Weyl-induced spiral order.},

These noninvertible chiral symmetries imply selection rules on correlation functions and arise in familiar models of massless quantum electrodynamics and models of axions (as well as their non-Abelian generalizations). When the associated bulk magnetic 1-form symmetry is broken by the propagation of dynamical magnetic monopoles, the selection rules of the noninvertible chiral symmetry defects are violated nonperturbatively.

Here, we study infinite-temperature energy transport in the kinetically constrained PXP model describing Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our state-of-the-art numerical simulations, including exact diagonalization and time-evolving block decimation methods, reveal the existence of two distinct transport regimes. At moderate times, the energy-energy correlation function displays periodic oscillations due to families of eigenstates forming different su(2) representations hidden within the spectrum. These families of eigenstates generalize the quantum many-body scarred states found in previous works and leave an imprint on the infinite-temperature energy transport. At later times, we observe a long-lived superdiffusive transport regime that we attribute to the proximity of a nearby integrable point. While generic strong deformations of the PXP model indeed restore diffusive transport, adding a strong chemical potential intriguingly gives rise to a well-converged superdiffusive exponent z ≈ 3 / 2 . Our results suggest constrained models to be potential hosts of novel transport regimes and call for developing an analytic understanding of their energy transport.},

  abstract     = {The quest for high-temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure is a central issue in physics. In this regard, the relationship between unconventional superconductivity and the quantum critical point (QCP) associated with the suppression of some form of symmetry-breaking order to zero temperature has received particular attention. The key question is how the strength of the electron pairs changes near the QCP, and this can be verified by high-field experiments. However, such studies are limited mainly to superconductors with magnetic QCPs, and the possibility of unconventional mechanisms by which nonmagnetic QCP promotes strong pairing remains a nontrivial issue. Here, we report systematic measurements of the upper critical field H c 2 in nonmagnetic FeSe 1 − x Te x superconductors, which exhibit a pure QCP of electronic nematicity characterized by spontaneous rotational-symmetry breaking. As the magnetic field increases, the superconducting phase of FeSe 1 − x Te x shrinks to a narrower dome surrounding the nematic QCP. The analysis of H c 2 reveals that the Pauli-limiting field is enhanced toward the QCP, implying that the pairing interaction is significantly strengthened via nematic fluctuations emanating from the QCP. Remarkably, this nematic QCP is not accompanied by a divergent effective mass, distinct from the magnetically mediated pairing. Our observation opens up a nematic route to high-temperature superconductivity.},

  abstract     = {Anyon collision experiments have recently demonstrated the ability to discriminate between fermionic and anyonic statistics. However, only one type of anyons associated with the simple Laughlin state at filling factor ν = 1 / 3 has been probed so far. It is now important to establish anyon collisions as quantitative probes of fractional statistics for more complex topological orders, with the ability to distinguish between different species of anyons with different statistics. In this work, we use the anyon collider to compare the Laughlin ν = 1 / 3 state, which is used as the reference state, with the more complex Jain state at ν = 2 / 5 , where low energy excitations are carried by two copropagating edge channels. We demonstrate that anyons generated on the outer channel of the ν = 2 / 5 state (with a fractional charge e * = e / 3 ) have a similar behavior compared to ν = 1 / 3 , showing the robustness of anyon collision signals for anyons of the same type. In contrast, anyons emitted on the inner channel of ν = 2 / 5 (with a fractional charge e * = e / 5 ) exhibit a reduced degree of bunching compared to the ν = 1 / 3 case, demonstrating the ability of the anyon collider to discriminate not only between anyons and fermions, but also between different species of anyons associated with different topological orders of the bulk. Our experimental results for the inner channel of ν = 2 / 5 also point toward an influence of interchannel interactions in anyon collision experiments when several copropagating edge channels are present.

  abstract     = {Recent pioneering works have set the stage for exploring anyon braiding statistics from negative current cross-correlations along two intersecting quasiparticle beams. In such a dual-source-analyzer quantum point contact setup, also referred to as “collider,” the anyon exchange phase of fractional quantum Hall quasiparticles is predicted to be imprinted into the cross-correlations characterized by an effective Fano factor P . In the case of symmetric incoming quasiparticle beams, conventional fermions result in a vanishing P . In marked contrast, we observe signatures of anyon statistics in the negative P found both for the e / 3 Laughlin quasiparticles at filling factor ν = 1 / 3 ( P ≈ − 2 , corroborating previous findings) and for the e / 5 quasiparticles in the hierarchical state ν = 2 / 5 ( P ≈ − 1 ). Nevertheless, we argue that the quantitative connection between a numerical value of P ≠ 0 and a specific fractional exchange phase is hampered by the influence of the analyzer conductance dependence on the voltages used to generate the quasiparticles. Finally, we address the important challenge how to distinguish at ν = 1 / 3 between negative cross-correlations induced by a fractional braid phase and those resulting from a different Andreev-like mechanism. Although with symmetric sources P does not exhibit signatures of a crossover when the analyzer is progressively detuned to favor Andreev processes, we demonstrate that changing the balance between sources provides a means to discriminate between the two mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {When mobile impurities are introduced and coupled to a Fermi sea, new quasiparticles known as Fermi polarons are formed. There are two interesting, yet drastically different regimes of the Fermi polaron problem: (i) the attractive polaron (AP) branch connected to pairing phenomena spanning the crossover from BCS superfluidity to the Bose-Einstein condensation of molecules and (ii) the repulsive branch (RP), which underlies the physics responsible for Stoner’s itinerant ferromagnetism. Here, we study Fermi polarons in two-dimensional systems, where many questions and debates regarding their nature persist. The model system we investigate is a doped MoSe 2 monolayer. We find the observed AP-RP energy splitting and the quantum dynamics of attractive polarons agree with the predictions of polaron theory. As the doping density increases, the quantum dephasing of the attractive polarons remains constant, indicative of stable quasiparticles, while the repulsive polaron dephasing rate increases nearly quadratically. The dynamics of Fermi polarons are of critical importance for understanding the pairing and magnetic instabilities that lead to the formation of rich quantum phases found in a wide range of physical systems including nuclei, cold atomic gases, and solids.},

The non-Abelian statistics of the latter is predicted to display a striking interferometric signature, the even-odd effect. By measuring resistance oscillations as a function of the magnetic field in Fabry-Pérot interferometers using new high-purity heterostructures, we for the first time report experimental evidence for the non-Abelian nature of excitations at ν = 7 / 2 . At both ν = 5 / 2 and 7 / 2 , we also examine, for the first time, the fermion parity, a topological quantum number of an even number of non-Abelian quasiparticles. The phase of observed e / 4 oscillations is reproducible and stable over long times (hours) near both filling factors, indicating stability of the fermion parity. At both fractions, when phase fluctuations are observed, they are predominantly π phase flips, consistent with either fermion parity change or change in the number of the enclosed e / 4 quasiparticles. We also examine lower-frequency oscillations attributable to Abelian interference processes in both states. Taken together, these results constitute new evidence for the non-Abelian nature of e / 4 quasiparticles; the observed lifetime of their combined fermion parity further strengthens the case for their utility for topological quantum computation.},

  abstract     = {When two-dimensional van der Waals materials are stacked to build heterostructures, moiré patterns emerge from twisted interfaces or from a mismatch in the lattice constant of individual layers. Relaxation of the atomic positions is a direct, generic consequence of the moiré pattern, with many implications for the physical properties. Moiré-driven atomic relaxation may be naively thought to be restricted to the interfacial layers and thus irrelevant for multilayered heterostructures. However, we provide experimental evidence for the importance of the three-dimensional nature of the relaxation in two types of van der Waals heterostructures: First, in multilayer graphene twisted on graphite at small twist angles ( θ ≈ 0.14 ° ), we observe propagation of relaxation domains even beyond 18 graphene layers. Second, we show how for multilayer PdTe 2 on Bi 2 Se 3 the moiré lattice constant depends on the number of PdTe 2 layers. Motivated by the experimental findings, we develop a continuum approach to model multilayered relaxation processes based on the generalized stacking fault energy functional given by ab initio simulations. Leveraging the continuum property of the approach enables us to access large-scale regimes and achieve agreement with our experimental data for both systems. Furthermore, it is well known that the electronic structure of graphene sensitively depends on local lattice deformations. Therefore, we study the impact of multilayered relaxation on the local density of states of the twisted graphitic system. We identify measurable implications for the system, experimentally accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy. Our multilayered relaxation approach is not restricted to the discussed systems and can be used to uncover the impact of an interfacial defect on various layered systems of interest.},

  abstract     = {The rheology of dense colloidal suspensions, which may undergo discontinuous shear thickening or shear jamming, is particularly difficult to analyze with conventional rheometers. Here, we develop a rheometer adapted to colloidal suspensions: the “capillarytron,” which uses the air-suspension capillary interface to impose particle (or osmotic) pressure during shear. The main virtues of this new device are that (i) it gives direct access to the suspension friction coefficient, (ii) it operates for very dense suspensions up to jamming, and, most importantly, (iii) it decouples the stresses developed within the suspension from the applied shear rate. We can, thus, smoothly move through the different frictional states of the system, precisely in the range of volume fractions where discontinuous shear thickening or shear jamming occur under volume-imposed conditions. Our results obtained with the capillarytron provide the first complete characterization of the dual frictional behavior of a model shear-thickening suspension, in agreement with the recently proposed frictional transition scenario. Based on a new concept in rheometry, the capillarytron unlocks the path to pressure-imposed rheology on colloidal and Brownian suspensions. Moreover, its fine control of the particle pressure via the soft capillary interface opens the possibility to explore the flow of “fragile” particles close to jamming, such as Brownian colloids, active particles, and living cells.},

Fast high-fidelity readout enables midcircuit measurements, a necessary feature for many dynamic algorithms and quantum error correction, while a small footprint facilitates the design of scalable, highly connected architectures with the associated increase in computing performance. Here, we present two complementary demonstrations of fast high-fidelity single-shot readout of spins in silicon quantum dots using a compact, dispersive charge sensor: a radio-frequency single-electron box. The sensor, despite requiring fewer electrodes than conventional detectors, performs at the state of the art achieving spin readout fidelity of 99.2\% in less than 6 μ s fitted from a physical model. We demonstrate that low-loss high-impedance resonators, highly coupled to the sensing dot, in conjunction with Josephson parametric amplification are instrumental in achieving optimal performance. We quantify the benefit of Pauli spin blockade over spin-dependent tunneling to a reservoir, as the spin-to-charge conversion mechanism in these readout schemes. Our results place dispersive charge sensing at the forefront of readout methodologies for scalable semiconductor spin-based quantum processors.},

Here, we report the first complete thermodynamic determination of the phase diagram for fields applied along the three crystallographic directions. For field along the easy a axis, we uncover a strong negative curvature of the upper critical field very close to T c , revealing a strong suppression of the pairing strength at low magnetic fields. By contrast, measurements performed up to 36 T along the hard magnetization b axis confirm a bulk field-reinforced superconducting phase. Most of all, they also reveal the existence of a phase transition line within the superconducting phase. Drastic differences occur between the low-field and high-field phases pointing to different pairing mechanisms.

While the interfacial structure and chemistry have been intensively explored, the potential coupling between liquid flows and the solid’s electronic degrees of freedom has been broadly overlooked up till now. Despite several reports of electronic currents induced by liquids flowing in various carbon nanostructures, the mechanisms at stake remain controversial. Here, we unveil the molecular mechanisms of interfacial liquid-electron coupling by investigating flow-induced current generation at the nanoscale. We use a tuning fork atomic force microscope to deposit and displace a micrometric liquid droplet on a multilayer graphene sample, and observe an electronic current induced by the droplet displacement. The measured current is several orders of magnitude larger than previously reported for water on carbon, and further boosted by the presence of surface wrinkles on the carbon surface. Our results point to a peculiar momentum transfer mechanism between the fluid molecules and graphene charge carriers, mediated mainly by the solid’s phonon excitations. These findings open new avenues for active control of nanoscale liquid flows through the solid walls’ electronic degrees of freedom.},

Similar phenomena have been reported at the interface between a moving fluid and a conductor, but their interpretation has remained elusive. Here, we develop a quantum-mechanical theory of the intertwined fluid and electronic flows, taking advantage of the nonequilibrium Keldysh framework. We predict that a globally neutral liquid can generate an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This hydrodynamic Coulomb drag originates from both the Coulomb interactions between the liquid’s charge fluctuations and the solid’s charge carriers and the liquid-electron interaction mediated by the solid’s phonons. We derive explicitly the Coulomb drag current in terms of the solid’s electronic and phononic properties, as well as the liquid’s dielectric response, a result which quantitatively agrees with recent experiments at the liquid-graphene interface. Furthermore, we show that the current generation counteracts momentum transfer from the liquid to the solid, leading to a reduction of the hydrodynamic friction coefficient through a quantum feedback mechanism. Our results provide a roadmap for controlling nanoscale liquid flows at the quantum level and suggest strategies for designing materials with low hydrodynamic friction.},

  abstract     = {The quest for ultrahigh- Q nanomechanical resonators has driven intense study of strain-induced dissipation dilution, an effect whereby vibrations of a tensioned plate are effectively trapped in a lossless potential. Here, we show for the first time that torsion modes of nanostructures can experience dissipation dilution, yielding a new class of ultrahigh- Q nanomechanical resonators with broad applications to quantum experiments and precision measurement. Specifically, we show that torsion modes of strained nanoribbons have Q factors scaling as their width-to-thickness ratio squared (characteristic of “soft clamping”), yielding Q factors as high as 10 8 and Q -frequency products as high as 10 13 Hz for devices made of Si 3 N 4 . Using an optical lever, we show that the rotation of one such nanoribbon can be resolved with an imprecision 100 times smaller than the zero-point motion of its fundamental torsion mode, without the use of a cavity or interferometric stability. We also show that a strained nanoribbon can be mass loaded without changing its torsional Q . We use this strategy to engineer a chip-scale torsion pendulum with an ultralow damping rate of 7 μ Hz and show how it can be used to sense micro- g fluctuations of the local gravitational field. Our findings signal the potential for a new field of imaging-based quantum optomechanics, demonstrate that the utility of strained nanomechanics extends beyond force microscopy to inertial sensing, and hint that the landscape for dissipation dilution remains largely unexplored.},

  abstract     = {Photons and nuclear spins are two well-known building blocks in quantum information science and technology. Establishing an efficient interface between optical photons and nuclear spins, while highly desirable for hybridizing these two quantum systems, is challenging, because the interactions between nuclear spins and the environment are usually weak in magnitude, and there is also a formidable gap between nuclear spin frequencies and optical frequencies. In this work, we propose an optonuclear quadrupolar (ONQ) effect, whereby optical photons can be efficiently coupled to nuclear spins, similar to Raman scattering. Compared to previous works, ancilla electron spins are not required for the ONQ effect. This leads to advantages such as applicability in defect-free nonmagnetic crystals and longer nuclear spin coherence time. In addition, the frequency of the optical photons can be arbitrary, so they can be fine-tuned to minimize the material heating and to match telecom wavelengths for long-distance communications. Using perturbation theory and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the ONQ effect is stronger by several orders of magnitude than other nonlinear optical effects that could couple to nuclear spins. Based on this rationale, we propose promising applications of the ONQ effect, including quantum memory, quantum transduction, and materials isotope spectroscopy. We also discuss issues relevant to the experimental demonstration of the ONQ effect.},

  abstract     = {The resource theory of quantum thermodynamics has been a very successful theory and has generated much follow-up work in the community. It requires energy-preserving unitary operations to be implemented over a system, bath, and catalyst as part of its paradigm. So far, such unitary operations have been considered a “free” resource in the theory. However, this is only an idealization of a necessarily inexact process. Here, we include an additional auxiliary control system which can autonomously implement the unitary by turning an interaction “on or off.” However, the control system will inevitably be degraded by the backaction caused by the implementation of the unitary. We derive conditions on the quality of the control device so that the laws of thermodynamics do not change and prove—by utilizing a good quantum clock—that the laws of quantum mechanics allow the backreaction to be small enough so that these conditions are satisfiable. Our inclusion of nonidealized control into the resource framework also raises interesting prospects, which were absent when considering idealized control. Among other things, the emergence of a third law without the need for the assumption of a light cone. Our results and framework unify the field of autonomous thermal machines with the thermodynamic quantum resource-theoretic one, and lay the groundwork for all quantum processing devices to be unified with fully autonomous machines.},

We show that a linear relation holds between atomic and molecular isotopes shifts, thus extending the King-plot analysis to molecular isotope shifts. Optical isotope shifts in YbF and ZrO and infrared isotope shifts in SnH are analyzed with a molecular King-plot approach utilizing Yb + and Zr + ionic isotope shifts and charge radii of Sn obtained with nonoptical methods. The changes in the mean-squared nuclear charge radii δ ⟨ r 2 ⟩ of Yb 170 – 174 , 176 and Zr 90 – 92 , 94 , 96 extracted from the molecular transitions are found to be in excellent agreement with the values from the spectroscopy of Yb + and Zr + , respectively. On the contrary, in the case of the vibrational-rotational transition in SnH, no sensitivity to the nuclear volume can be deduced within the experimental resolution, which makes it unsuitable for the extraction of nuclear charge radii but provides insights into the molecular electronic wave function not accessible via other methods. The new opportunities offered by the molecular King-plot analysis for research in nuclear structure and molecular physics are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Networks of intermediate filaments (IFs) need to constantly reorganize to fulfil their functions at different locations within the cell. The mechanism of IF assembly is well described and involves filament end-to-end annealing. By contrast, the mechanisms involved in IF disassembly are far less understood. In vitro , IFs are assumed to be very stable and their disassembly negligible. IF fragmentation has been observed in many cell types, but it has been suggested to be associated with active processes such as IF post-translational modifications. In this article, we uncover the contribution of filament spontaneous fragmentation in the assembly dynamics of type III vimentin IF using a combination of in vitro reconstitution probed by fluorescence imaging and theoretical modeling. We first show that vimentin assembly at low concentrations results in an equilibrium between filament annealing and fragmentation at times ≥ 24 h . At higher concentrations, entanglements kinetically trap the system out of equilibrium, and we show that this trapping is reversible upon dilution. Taking into account both fragmentation and entanglement, we estimate that the mean bond breaking time is ∼ 18 h . This translates into a mean breaking time of ∼ 5 h for a 1 − μ m -long filament, which is a relevant timescale for IF reorganization in live cells. Finally, we provide direct evidence through dual-color imaging that filament fragmentation and annealing coexist during assembly. By showing that IF fragmentation can occur without cofactors or post-translational modifications, our study provides new insights into the physical understanding of the IF length regulation.},

  abstract     = {Thermodynamics serves as a universal means for studying physical systems from an energy perspective. In recent years, with the establishment of the field of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics, the ideas of thermodynamics have been generalized to small fluctuating systems. Independently developed in mathematics and statistics, the optimal transport theory concerns the means by which one can optimally transport a source distribution to a target distribution, deriving a useful metric between probability distributions, called the Wasserstein distance. Despite their seemingly unrelated nature, an intimate connection between these fields has been unveiled in the context of continuous-state Langevin dynamics, providing several important implications for nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we elucidate an analogous connection for discrete cases by developing a thermodynamic framework for discrete optimal transport. We first introduce a novel quantity called dynamical state mobility, which significantly improves the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and provides insights into the precision of currents in nonequilibrium Markov jump processes. We then derive variational formulas that connect the discrete Wasserstein distances to stochastic and quantum thermodynamics of discrete Markovian dynamics described by master equations. Specifically, we rigorously prove that the Wasserstein distance equals the minimum product of irreversible entropy production and dynamical state mobility over all admissible Markovian dynamics. These formulas not only unify the relationship between thermodynamics and the optimal transport theory for discrete and continuous cases, but also generalize it to the quantum case. In addition, we demonstrate that the obtained variational formulas lead to remarkable applications in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics, such as stringent thermodynamic speed limits and the finite-time Landauer principle. These bounds are tight and can be saturated for arbitrary temperatures, even in the zero-temperature limit. Notably, the finite-time Landauer principle can explain finite dissipation even at extremely low temperatures, which cannot be explained by the conventional Landauer principle.},

Here, we study the magnon dynamics in thin films of AFM S = 5 2 α − Fe 2 O 3 by combining resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, Anderson impurity model plus dynamical mean-field theory, and Heisenberg spin model. Below 100 meV, we observe the thickness-independent (down to 15 nm) acoustic single-magnon mode. At higher energies (100–500 meV), an unexpected sequence of equally spaced, optical modes is resolved and ascribed to Δ S z = 1 , 2, 3, 4, and 5 magnetic excitations corresponding to multiple, noninteracting magnons. Our study unveils the energy, character, and momentum dependence of single and multimagnons in α − Fe 2 O 3 thin films, with impact on AFM magnon transport and its related phenomena. From a broader perspective, we generalize the use of L -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a multispin-excitation probe up to Δ S z = 2 S . Our analysis identifies the spin-orbital mixing in the valence shell as the key element for accessing excitations beyond Δ S z = 1 , and up to, e.g., Δ S z = 5 . At the same time, we elucidate the novel origin of the spin excitations beyond the Δ S z = 2 , emphasizing the key role played by the crystal lattice as a reservoir of angular momentum that complements the quanta carried by the absorbed and emitted photons.},

Recently, laser-driven neutron sources (LDNS) have attracted the attention of different communities, from science to industry, in a variety of applications, including radiography, spectroscopy, security, and medicine. However, the laser-driven ion acceleration mechanism for neutron generation and for establishing the scaling law on the neutron yield is essential to improve the feasibility of LDNS. In this paper, we report the mechanism that accelerates ions with spectra suitable for neutron generation. We show that the neutron yield increases with the fourth power of the laser intensity, resulting in the neutron generation of 3 × 10 11 in 4 π at a maximum, with 1.1 × 10 19 W cm − 2 , 900 J, 1.5 ps lasers. By installing a “hand-size” moderator, which is specially designed for the LDNS, it is demonstrated that the efficient generation of epithermal (0.1–100 eV) neutrons enables the single-shot analysis of composite materials by neutron resonance transmission analysis (NRTA). We achieve the energy resolution of 2.3\% for 5.19-eV neutrons 1.8 m downstream of the LDNS. This leads to the analysis of elements and isotopes within sub- μ s times and allows for high-speed nondestructive inspection.},

  abstract     = {Electron-lattice interactions play a prominent role in quantum materials, making a deeper understanding of direct routes to phonon-mediated high-transition-temperature ( T c ) superconductivity desirable. However, it has been known for decades that weak electron-phonon coupling gives rise to low values of T c , while strong electron-phonon coupling leads to lattice instability or formation of bipolarons, generally assumed to be detrimental to superconductivity. Thus, the route to high- T c materials from phonon-mediated mechanisms has heretofore appeared to be limited to raising the phonon frequency as in the hydrogen sulfides. Here we present a simple model for phonon-mediated high- T c superconductivity based on superfluidity of light bipolarons. In contrast to the widely studied Holstein model where lattice distortions modulate the electron’s potential energy, we investigate the situation where lattice distortions modulate the electron hopping. This physics gives rise to small-size, yet light bipolarons, which we study using an exact sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo approach demonstrating a new route to phonon-mediated high- T c superconductivity. We find that T c in our model generically and significantly exceeds typical upper bounds based on Migdal-Eliashberg theory or superfluidity of Holstein bipolarons. The key ingredient in this bipolaronic mechanism that gives rise to high T c is the combination of light mass and small size of bipolarons. Our work establishes principles for the design of high- T c superconductors via functional material engineering.},

  abstract     = {Attractor networks are an influential theory for memory storage in brain systems. This theory has recently been challenged by the observation of strong temporal variability in neuronal recordings during memory tasks. In this work, we study a sparsely connected attractor network where memories are learned according to a Hebbian synaptic plasticity rule. After recapitulating known results for the continuous, sparsely connected Hopfield model, we investigate a model in which new memories are learned continuously and old memories are forgotten, using an online synaptic plasticity rule. We show that for a forgetting timescale that optimizes storage capacity, the qualitative features of the network’s memory retrieval dynamics are age dependent: most recent memories are retrieved as fixed-point attractors while older memories are retrieved as chaotic attractors characterized by strong heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations. Therefore, fixed-point and chaotic attractors coexist in the network phase space. The network presents a continuum of statistically distinguishable memory states, where chaotic fluctuations appear abruptly above a critical age and then increase gradually until the memory disappears. We develop a dynamical mean field theory to analyze the age-dependent dynamics and compare the theory with simulations of large networks. We compute the optimal forgetting timescale for which the number of stored memories is maximized. We found that the maximum age at which memories can be retrieved is given by an instability at which old memories destabilize and the network converges instead to a more recent one. Our numerical simulations show that a high degree of sparsity is necessary for the dynamical mean field theory to accurately predict the network capacity. To test the robustness and biological plausibility of our results, we study numerically the dynamics of a network with learning rules and transfer function inferred from in vivo data in the online learning scenario. We found that all aspects of the network’s dynamics characterized analytically in the simpler model also hold in this model. These results are highly robust to noise. Finally, our theory provides specific predictions for delay response tasks with aging memoranda. In particular, it predicts a higher degree of temporal fluctuations in retrieval states associated with older memories, and it also predicts fluctuations should be faster in older memories. Overall, our theory of attractor networks that continuously learn new information at the price of forgetting old memories can account for the observed diversity of retrieval states in the cortex, and in particular, the strong temporal fluctuations of cortical activity.},

Here, we operate a hybrid qubit-oscillator circuit quantum electrodynamics simulator and model nonadiabatic molecular dynamics through a conical intersection. We identify dephasing of the electronic qubit as the mechanism that drives wave-packet branching when the corresponding oscillator undergoes large amplitude motion. Furthermore, we directly observe enhanced branching when the wave-packet passes through the conical intersection. Thus, the forces that influence a chemical reaction can be viewed from the perspective of measurement backaction in quantum mechanics—there is an effective measurement-induced dephasing rate that depends on the position of the wave packet relative to the conical intersection. Our results set the groundwork for more complex simulations of chemical dynamics using quantum simulators, offering deeper insight into the role of dissipation in determining macroscopic quantities of interest such as the quantum yield of a chemical reaction.},

  abstract     = {Competing and intertwined orders including inhomogeneous patterns of spin and charge are observed in many correlated electron materials, such as high-temperature superconductors. Introducing a new development of the constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method, we study the interplay between thermal and quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model. We obtain an accurate and systematic characterization of the evolution of the spin and charge correlations as a function of temperature T and how it connects to the ground state, at three representative hole doping levels δ = 1 / 5 , 1 / 8 , and 1 / 10 . We find increasing short-range commensurate antiferromagnetic correlations as T is lowered. As the correlation length grows sufficiently large, a modulated spin-density wave (SDW) appears. At δ = 1 / 5 and U / t = 6 , the SDW saturates and remains short-ranged as T → 0 . In contrast, at δ = 1 / 8 , 1 / 10 and U / t = 8 , this evolves into a ground-state stripe phase. We study the relation between spin and charge orders and find that formation of charge order appears to be driven by that of the spin order. We identify a finite-temperature phase transition below which charge ordering sets in and discuss the implications of our results for the nature of this transition.},

  abstract     = {The distant projection of high-peak and average-power laser beams in the atmosphere is a long-standing goal with a wide range of applications. Our early proof-of-principle experiments [ Phys. Rev. X 4 , 011027 (2014) ] presented one solution to this problem, employing the energy deposition of femtosecond filaments in air to sculpt millisecond-lifetime sub-meter-length air waveguides. Here, we demonstrate air waveguiding at the 50-m scale, 60 × longer , making many practical applications now possible. We employ a new method for filament energy deposition: multifilamentation of Laguerre-Gaussian LG 01 “donut” modes. We first investigate the detailed physics of this scheme over a shorter 8-m in-lab propagation range corresponding to 13 Rayleigh lengths of the guided pulse. We then use these results to demonstrate optical guiding over 45 m in the hallway adjacent to the lab, corresponding to 70 Rayleigh lengths. Injection of a continuous-wave probe beam into these waveguides demonstrates very long lifetimes of tens of milliseconds.},

  abstract     = {Color centers are point defects in crystals that can provide an optical interface to a long-lived spin state for distributed quantum information processing applications. An outstanding challenge for color center quantum technologies is the integration of optically coherent emitters into scalable thin-film photonics, a prerequisite for large-scale photonics integration of color centers within a commercial foundry process. Here, we report on the integration of near-transform-limited silicon vacancy ( V Si ) defects into microdisk resonators fabricated in a CMOS-compatible 4 H -silicon carbide-on-insulator platform. We demonstrate a single-emitter cooperativity of up to 0.8 as well as optical superradiance from a pair of color centers coupled to the same cavity mode. We investigate the effect of multimode interference on the photon scattering dynamics from this multiemitter cavity quantum electrodynamics system. These results are crucial for the development of quantum networks in silicon carbide and bridge the classical-quantum photonics gap by uniting optically coherent spin defects with wafer-scalable, state-of-the-art photonics.},

  abstract     = {Quantum networks play an indispensable role in quantum information tasks such as secure communications, enhanced quantum sensing, and distributed computing. Among the most mature and promising platforms for quantum networking are nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and other color centers in solids. One of the challenges in using these systems for networking applications is to controllably manipulate entanglement between the electron and the nuclear spin register despite the always-on nature of the hyperfine interactions, which makes this an inherently many-body quantum system. Here, we develop a general formalism to quantify and control the generation of entanglement in an arbitrarily large nuclear spin register coupled to a color center electronic spin. We provide a reliable measure of nuclear spin selectivity, by exactly incorporating into our treatment the dynamics with unwanted nuclei. We also show how to realize direct multipartite gates through the use of dynamical decoupling sequences, drastically reducing the total gate time compared to protocols based on sequential entanglement with individual nuclear spins. We quantify the performance of such gate operations in the presence of unwanted residual entanglement links, capturing the dynamics of the entire nuclear spin register. Finally, using experimental parameters of a well-characterized 27 nuclear spin register device, we show how to prepare with high-fidelity entangled states for quantum error correction. While in this analysis we focus on a particular NV-diamond-based register, our framework is completely general and applicable to other defects in diamond and in SiC.},

One of the striking new options is the dynamical generation of space-synthetic dimensions, transcending the confines of static crystalline solid-state physics. We apply this principle to propose protocols allowing for the engineered realization of topological surface states in isolation. As a concrete example, we consider 3 D topological surface states of a 4 D quantum Hall insulator via a ( 1 + 2 syn ) -dimensional protocol. We present first-principle analytical calculations demonstrating that no supporting 4 D bulk phase is required for a 3 D topological surface phase. We back the analytical approach by numerical simulations and present a detailed blueprint for the realization of the synthetic surface phase with existing quantum linear optical network device technology. We then discuss generalizations, including a proposal for a quantum simulator of the ( 1 + 1 syn ) -dimensional surface of the common 3 D topological insulator.},

  abstract     = {For over 80 years of research, the conventional description of free-electron radiation phenomena, such as Cherenkov radiation, has remained unchanged: classical three-dimensional electromagnetic waves. Interestingly, in reduced dimensionality, the properties of free-electron radiation are predicted to fundamentally change. Here, we present the first observation of Cherenkov surface waves, wherein free electrons emit narrow-bandwidth photonic quasiparticles propagating in two dimensions. The low dimensionality and narrow bandwidth of the effect enable us to identify quantized emission events through electron energy loss spectroscopy. Our results support the recent theoretical prediction that free electrons do not always emit classical light and can instead become entangled with the photons they emit. The two-dimensional Cherenkov interaction achieves quantum coupling strengths over 2 orders of magnitude larger than ever reported, reaching the single-electron–single-photon interaction regime for the first time with free electrons. Our findings pave the way to previously unexplored phenomena in free-electron quantum optics, facilitating bright, free-electron-based quantum emitters of heralded Fock states.},

  abstract     = {Intense debate has recently arisen regarding the photoinduced changes to the iron-chalcogenide superconductors, including the enhancement of superconductivity and a metastable state. Here, by employing high-energy resolution, we directly observe the melting of superconductivity on ultrafast timescales. We demonstrate a distinctly nonequilibrium response on short timescales, where the gap fills in prior to the destruction of the superconducting peak, followed by a metastable response. We propose that the former is due to pair phase decoherence and speculate that the latter is due to the increase in double-stripe correlations that are known to compete with superconductivity. Our results add to exciting new developments on the iron-based superconductors, indicating that the photoinduced metastable state possibly competes with superconductivity.},
