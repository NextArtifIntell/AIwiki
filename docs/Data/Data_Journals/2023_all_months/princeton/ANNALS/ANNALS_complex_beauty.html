These groups are close relatives of the classical wreath products and arise naturally in the context of group theoretic Dehn filling. Unlike ordinary wreath products, many wreath-like products have Kazhdan’s property (T). In this paper, we prove that any group $G$ in a natural family of wreath-like products with property (T) is W$^*$-superrigid: the group von Neumann algebra $\text{L}(G)$ remembers the isomorphism class of $G$. This allows us to provide the first examples (in fact, $2^{\aleph _0}$ pairwise non-isomorphic examples) of W$^*$-superrigid groups with property (T).},

The results are valid away from thermal equilibrium, but only for short times.

In this paper we prove that if a stationary integral $n$-varifold $M$ in the unit ball $B_1 \subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$ lies sufficiently close to a minimizing quadratic cone (for example, the Simons’ cone $\mathbf {C}^{3,3}$), then $\mathrm {spt}\, M \cap B_{1/2}$ is a $C^{1,\alpha }$ perturbation of either the cone itself, or some leaf of its associated foliation. In particular, we show that singularities modeled on these cones determine the local structure not only of $M$, but of any nearby minimal surface. Our result also implies the Bernstein-type result of Simon-Solomon, which characterizes area-minimizing hypersurfaces asymptotic to a quadratic cone as either the cone itself, or some leaf of the foliation.},

Our proofs proceed by locally coupling a uniformly random lozenge tiling with a model of Bernoulli random walks conditioned to never intersect, whose convergence of local statistics has been recently understood by the work of Gorin-Petrov. Central to implementing this procedure is to establish a local law for the random tiling, which states that the associated height function is approximately linear on any mesoscopic scale.},

We show that the naive counts of rational curves in $U$ uniquely determine a commutative associative algebra equipped with a compatible multilinear form. This proves a variant of the Frobenius structure conjecture by Gross-Hacking-Keel in mirror symmetry, and the spectrum of this algebra is supposed to give the hypothetical mirror family. Although the statement of our theorem involves only elementary algebraic geometry, our proof employs Berkovich non-archimedean analytic methods. We construct the structure constants of the algebra via counting non-archimedean analytic disks in the analytification of $U$. We establish various properties of the counting, notably deformation invariance, symmetry, gluing formula and convexity. In the special case when $U$ is a Fock-Goncharov skew-symmetric X-cluster variety, we prove that our algebra generalizes, and gives a direct geometric construction of, the mirror algebra of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich. The comparison is proved via a canonical scattering diagram constructed from counts of infinitesimal non-archimedean analytic cylinders, without using the Kontsevich-Soibelman algorithm. Several combinatorial conjectures of GHKK, as well as the positivity in the Laurent phenomenon, follow readily from the geometric description.},

A key element is our introduction of a new type of self-similarity for the Einstein vacuum equations. Connected to this is a new geometric twisting phenomenon which plays the leading role in singularity formation. Prior to this work, the only known examples of naked singularities were the solutions constructed by Christodoulou for the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar-field system, as well as other solutions explored numerically for either the spherically symmetric Einstein equations coupled to suitable matter models or for the Einstein equations in higher dimensions.},

We also establish partial results on super-rigidity in dimension four and regularity of branched covers, and briefly discuss the outlook for bifurcation analysis.

  abstract     = {A fundamental theorem of P. Deligne (2002) states that a pre-Tannakian category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero admits a fiber functor to the category of supervector spaces (i.e., is the representation category of an affine proalgebraic supergroup) if and only if it has moderate growth (i.e., the lengths of tensor powers of an object grow at most exponentially). In this paper we prove a characteristic $p$ version of this theorem. Namely, we show that a pre-Tannakian category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;0$ admits a fiber functor into the Verlinde category $\mathrm {Ver}_p$ (i.e., is the representation category of an affine group scheme in $\mathrm {Ver}_p$) if and only if it has moderate growth and is Frobenius exact. This implies that Frobenius exact pre-Tannakian categories of moderate growth admit a well behaved notion of Frobenius-Perron dimension. It follows that any semisimple pre-Tannakian category of moderate growth has a fiber functor to ${\rm Ver}_p$ (so in particular Deligne’s theorem holds on the nose for semisimple pre-Tannakian categories in characteristics $2,3$). This settles a conjecture of the third author from 2015. In particular, this result applies to semisimplifications of categories of modular representations of finite groups (or, more generally, affine group schemes), which gives new applications to classical modular representation theory. For example, it allows us to characterize, for a modular representation $V$, the possible growth rates of the number of indecomposable summands in $V^{\otimes n}$ of dimension prime to $p$.},

Thus the question is settled, with a strong affirmative, as to whether there can be “gaps” or even fractional dimensional parts in the singular set. Such questions, for both stable and unstable minimal submanifolds, remain open in all dimensions in the case of real analytic metrics and, in particular, for the standard Euclidean metric. \par The construction used here involves the analysis of solutions $u$ of the symmetric minimal surface equation on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb {R}^{n}$ whose symmetric graphs (i.e., $\{(x,\xi )\in \Omega \times \mathbb {R}^{m}: |\xi |=u(x)\}$) lie on one side of a cylindrical minimal cone including, in particular, a Liouville type theorem for complete solutions (i.e., the case $\Omega =\mathbb {R}^{n}$).},

In fact, we are able to replace the polynomial phases $e(-P(n))$ by degree $k$ nilsequences $\overline{F}(g(n) \Gamma)$. By the inverse theory for the Gowers norms this implies the higher order asymptotic uniformity result $$ \int_{X}^{2X} \| \lambda \|_{U^{k+1}([x,x+H])} dx = o ( X ) $$ in the same range of $H$. We present applications of this result to patterns of various types in the Liouville sequence. Firstly, we show that the number of sign patterns of the Liouville function is superpolynomial, making progress on a conjecture of Sarnak about the Liouville sequence having positive entropy. Secondly, we obtain cancellation in averages of $\lambda$ over short polynomial progressions $(n+P_1(m),\ldots, n+P_k(m))$, which in the case of linear polynomials yields a new averaged version of Chowla’s conjecture. We are in fact able to prove our results on polynomial phases in the wider range $H\geq \exp((\log X)^{5/8+\varepsilon})$, thus strengthening also previous work on the Fourier uniformity of the Liouville function.},

The Brumer–Stark conjecture states that the Stickelberger element $\Theta ^{H/F}_{S, T}$ annihilates the $T$-smoothed class group $\mathrm {Cl}^T(H)$. We prove this conjecture away from $p=2$, that is, after tensoring with ${\bf Z}[1/2]$. We prove a stronger version of this result conjectured by Kurihara that gives a formula for the 0th Fitting ideal of the minus part of the Pontryagin dual of $\mathrm {Cl}^T(H) \otimes {\bf Z}[1/2]$ in terms of Stickelberger elements. We also show that this stronger result implies Rubin’s higher rank version of the Brumer–Stark conjecture, again away from 2. \par Our technique is a generalization of Ribet’s method, building upon on our earlier work on the Gross–Stark conjecture. Here we work with group ring valued Hilbert modular forms as introduced by Wiles. A key aspect of our approach is the construction of congruences between cusp forms and Eisenstein series that are stronger than usually expected, arising as shadows of the trivial zeroes of $p$-adic $L$-functions. These stronger congruences are essential to proving that the cohomology classes we construct are unramified at $p$.},

  abstract     = {We prove a dimension formula for the weight-$1$ subspace of a vertex operator algebra $V^{\mathrm {orb}(g)}$ obtained by orbifolding a strongly rational, holomorphic vertex operator algebra $V$ of central charge $24$ with a finite-order automorphism $g$. Based on an upper bound derived from this formula we introduce the notion of a generalised deep hole in $\mathrm {Aut}(V)$. Then we show that the orbifold construction defines a bijection between the generalised deep holes of the Leech lattice vertex operator algebra $V_\Lambda $ with non-trivial fixed-point Lie subalgebra and the strongly rational, holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge $24$ with non-vanishing weight-$1$ space. This provides a uniform construction of these vertex operator algebras and naturally generalises the correspondence between the deep holes of the Leech lattice $\Lambda $ and the $23$ Niemeier lattices with non-vanishing root system found by Conway, Parker, Sloane and Borcherds.},

  abstract     = {Let $\Gamma \subset \mathrm {PU}(1,n)$ be a lattice and $S_\Gamma $ be the associated ball quotient. We prove that, if $S_\Gamma $ contains infinitely many maximal complex totally geodesic subvarieties, then $\Gamma $ is arithmetic. We also prove an Ax–Schanuel Conjecture for $S_\Gamma $, similar to the one recently proven by Mok, Pila and Tsimerman. One of the main ingredients in the proofs is to realise $S_\Gamma $ inside a period domain for polarised integral variations of Hodge structure and interpret totally geodesic subvarieties as unlikely intersections.},

  abstract     = {We show that there is no family of Enriques surfaces over the ring of integers. This extends non-existence results of Minkowski for families of finite étale schemes, of Tate and Ogg for families of elliptic curves, and of Fontaine and Abrashkin for families of abelian varieties and more general smooth proper schemes with certain restrictions on Hodge numbers. Our main idea is to study the local system of numerical classes of invertible sheaves. Among other things, our result also hinges on counting rational points, Lang’s classification of rational elliptic surfaces in characteristic two, the theory of exceptional Enriques surfaces due to Ekedahl and Shepherd-Barron, some recent results on the base of their versal deformation, Shioda’s theory of Mordell–Weil lattices, and an extensive combinatorial study for the pairwise interaction of genus-one fibrations.},
