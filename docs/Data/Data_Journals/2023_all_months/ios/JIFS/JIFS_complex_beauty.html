  abstract     = {To solve the problem that the operation state of transformer is difficult to quantify, a method of quantitative evaluation and prediction of transformer operating state is proposed, which combines the information entropy of matter element and Support Vector Machine. In the evaluation, various hydro gen gases in the transformer operation are taken as the evaluation indexes and the three-dimensional cross compound element is constructed. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the theoretical weight of the evaluation index, and the entropy method is used to determine the objective weight of the evaluation index, and the final weight is the joint weight of the theoretical weight and the objective weight. Transformer Health index is calculated by using complex element correlation entropy. In prediction, the grid search, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to optimize the parameters of Support Vector Machine. and the prediction model of Health index is established by SVM. Experiment results show that the Support Vector Machine based on Gauss kernel function and genetic algorithm has a prominent effect on the prediction of health index.},

It is difficult to manage the edge resources in a consistent way that promotes cooperation and sharing of res ources across the devices because of the heterogeneity of the Internet of Things devices and the dynamic nature of the surroundings in which edge computing takes place. In this research, we offer Intelligent techniques for resource optimization for Internet of Things devices. This is a full-stack system architecture to support across heterogeneous Internet of Things devices that have limited resources. The paradigm that is being suggested is made up of several edge servers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices have the qualities of being heterogeneity-compatible, high performing, and intelligently adaptable. In order to do this, a clustered environment is generated in heterogeneous Internet of Things devices, and a routing method called Search and Rescue Optimization is used to set up connections between the CH nodes. After that, the edge nodes that are closest to the source of the data are chosen for transmission. Overall, what was suggested Multi-Edge-IoT accomplishes superior efficiency in terms of consumption of energy, latency, communication overhead, and packet loss rate than existing approaches to attaining energy efficiency in the Internet of Things.},

  abstract     = {The energy consumption of mechanical products in China is enormous, and the energy utilization rate is low, which is increasingly receiving people’s attention. Conducting product design for energy optimization is of great significance for improving energy utilization efficiency. The scheme design o f a product is the key to achieving innovation in product design, and the evaluation and decision-making of the design scheme directly affect the results of the later stage of the design. Therefore, correctly evaluating and making reliable decisions on product design schemes that are oriented towards fuzzy decision optimization is an important aspect of product innovation conceptual design. The product modeling design quality evaluation is a multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems. Recently, the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method and information entropy method has been employed to cope with MAGDM issues. The interval neutrosophic sets (INSs) are employed as a tool for portraying uncertain information during the product modeling design quality evaluation. In this paper, the CoCoSo method is designed for MAGDM under INSs. Then, the interval neutrosophic numbers CoCoSo (INN-CoCoSo) method based on the Hamming distance and Euclidean distance is built for MAGDM. The information Entropy method is employed to produce the weight information based on the Hamming distance and Euclidean distance under INNSs. Finally, a practical numerical example for product modeling design quality evaluation is supplied to show the INN-CoCoSo method. The main contributions of this paper are constructed: (1) This paper builds the novel MAGDM based on CoCoSo model under INSs; (2) The information Entropy method is employed to produce the weight information based on the Hamming distance and Euclidean distance under INNSs; (3) The new MAGDM method is proposed for product modeling design quality evaluation based on INN-CoCoSo.},

  abstract     = {Veneer is the critical raw material for manufacturing man-made board products, therefore the quality of the veneer determines the level of the man-made board. However, defects in the veneer may significantly lower its grade. Currently, identifying veneer defects requires manual inspection and subse quent inpainting using a veneer digging machine. Unfortunately, this method only removes the defects of the veneer but ignore the consistency of its texture. To address this issue, we propose a feasible veneer defect reconstruction method that utilizes a texture-aware-multiscale-GAN architecture. Our method performs texture reconstruction of veneer defects to increase the texture information of the reconstructed image while improving the model efficiency, so that generates natural-looking textures in the reconstructed defect areas. The model is trained by end-to-end updating of four cascades of efficient generators and discriminators. We also employed a loss function based on local binary patterns (LBP) to ensure that the restored images contain sufficient texture information. Finally, region normalization is used in the model to enhance the accuracy of the model. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) are used to evaluate the effectiveness of image restoration, the results show that PSNR of the method reacheds 35.32 and SSIM reaches 0.971. By minimizing the difference between the generated texture and that of the original image, our model produces high-quality results.},

  abstract     = {Investigation of human face images forms an important facet in affective analysis. The work, a DL-based ensemble is proposed for this purpose. Seven pre-trained models namely Facenet, Facenet2018, VGG16, Resnet-50, Senet-50, Arcface and Openface that have been developed for face verification have b een exploited and customized for emotion identification. To each of these models, each all over interaction with softmax method to classification groups are augmented and entire network is then trained completely for emotion recognition. After training all the models individually, the probabilities for each of the class by each of the model are summed to derive at the final value. The class that holds the highest of this value is finalized as the predicted emotion. Thus, the proposed methodology involves image collection, image pre-processing comprising of contrast enhancement, face detection and extraction, face alignment, image augmentation facilitating rotation, shifting, flipping and zooming transformations and appropriate resizing and rescaling, feature extraction and classification through ensemble of customized afore-mentioned pre-trained convolutional neural networks, evaluation and evolving of best weights for emotion recognition from face images with enhanced accuracy. The proposed methodology is evaluated on the well-established FER-2013 dataset. The methodology achieves a validation accuracy of 74.67% and test accuracy of 76.23%. Further, similar images of another dataset (Face Expression Recogniton dataset) are included for training the models and the impact of extra training is assessed to see if there is improvement in performance. The experiments reveal marked improvement in face emotion identification performance reaching values of 94.98% for both validation and test set of FER-2013 dataset and 94.99% on validation set of Face Expression Recognition dataset.},

The information gained from this model could be useful in designing exercise apparel for different climates and in generating thermal stress protocols for treating infections and providing physical activity guidelines for healthy living. The model uses Pennes’ bio-heat equation and finite difference method to examine the temperature distribution in skin layers while accounting for both physiological and clothing parameters. The numerical findings were compared to existing studies, and the model’s accuracy was found to be in good agreement with previous research. The proposed model can be used to predict how much rest and acclimation are needed to cope with thermal stress and could also be modified to obtain thermal information for patients with skin diseases. Additionally, the thermal profile obtained from this model could be helpful in designing exercise clothes for patients with skin diseases.},

  abstract     = {As the size and complexity of projects grows, estimates are increasingly used, especially in the agile community. Software development cannot begin without first conducting thorough planning and estimation. Estimating how much work a project will take is a common first step in the software developm ent life cycle. By employing ensemble techniques, we integrate multiple learning algorithms to build a more accurate predictive model. The core elements of our proposed stacked ensemble strategy include Decision Tree, Principal Components Regression, Random Forest, NeuralNet, GLMNET, XGBoost, Earth, and Support Vector Machine. Moreover, we augment the model’s performance by incorporating a blend of these foundational algorithms with other ensemble regression methods. Extensive testing in the suggested research work with a number of Super Learners demonstrates that Regression is the best technique for judging effort. The evaluation of the different estimators involved the use of various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Squared Error, Percentage of Close Approximations within 25% of the True Values (PRED (25)), R-Squared Coefficients, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The proposed method yields more trustworthy predicted performance than either single-model approaches or stacked ensembles.

The major cause is the presence of distorted and weak edges due to noise. Hence, this paper proposes new Expression Descriptor c alled as Weighted Edge Local Directional Pattern (WELDP) which can discriminate the weak and strong edges. Unlike the conventional local descriptors, WELDP searches for the support of neighbor pixels in the determination of Facial expression attributes such as Edges, Corners, Lines, and Curved Edges. WELDP encodes only Strong edge responses and discards weaker edge responses after extracting them through edge detection masks. This work adapted two masks for edge detection: they are Robinson Compass Mask and Kirsch Compass Mask. Moreover, the WELDP aims at code redundancy and encode each pixel only with seven bits (one sign bit and six directional bits). Then the WELDP image is described by a histogram and then processed through SVM (Support Vector Machine) for expression identification. From the simulation experiments, the proposed WELDP is found as better than several existing methods.},

T he model employs single-valued neutrosophic sets to handle uncertain data, which enhances the descriptive ability of information. The maximum deviation method is used to calculate attribute weight factors, which highlights the importance of each attribute. The final target threat ranking is obtained based on the relative closeness coefficient of each target. Furthermore, the proposed model constructs a multi-attribute aggregation loss function matrix for each target, sets the risk avoidance coefficient under the knowledge of the battlefield condition, and calculates the decision threshold of each target using three-way decision theory. This method produces the classification of the target choice. The numerical examples and comparison analysis demonstrate that the suggested model can handle ambiguous scenario information effectively and reasonably, transform traditional decision-making ranking results into three-way classification findings, and provide a rationale for choosing an attacking target.},

However, most existing classifiers are better at exploring majority classes, resulting in that classification results are unfair. To address this i ssue of binary classification for imbalance data, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy support vector machine. The thought is that we trained two support vector machines to learn the majority class and the minority class, respectively. Then, the proposed fuzzy is used to estimate the assistance provided by instance points for the training of the support vector machines. Finally, it can be judged for unknown instance points through evaluating that they provided the assistance to the training of the support vector machines. Results on the ten UCI datasets show that the class accuracy of the proposed method is 0.747 when the imbalanced ratio between the classes reaches 87.8. Compare with the competitors, the proposed method wins over them in classification performance. We find that aiming at the classification of imbalanced data, the complexity of data distribution has negative effects on classification results, while fuzzy can resist these negative effects. Moreover, fuzzy can assist those classifiers to gain superior classification boundaries.},

  abstract     = {Renewable energy sources play an influential role in the world’s climate and reduce the rate of harmful gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and many other greenhouse gasses that contribute to global warming. The theoretical concept of the T-spherical fuzzy (T-SF) set (T-SFS) is t he most suitable model to evaluate energy resources under uncertainty. This article illustrates appropriate operations based on Dombi triangular norm and t-conorm. We derived a series of new aggregation approaches, such as T-SF Dombi Hamy mean (T-SFDHM) and T-SF weighted Dombi Hamy Mean (T-SFDWHM) operators. Further authors illustrated a list of new approaches such as T-SF Dual Dombi Hamy mean (T-SFDDHM), and T-SF Dombi weighted Dual Hamy mean (T-SFDWDHM) operators. Some exceptional cases and desirable properties of our derived approaches are also studied. We illustrate an application of renewable energy resources to be evaluated using a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method. A case study was also studied to choose appropriate energy resources using our proposed methodology of the T-SFDWHM and T-SFDWDHM operators. To show the effectiveness and validity of our current methods, we compared the existing results with currently developed aggregation operators (AOs).},

  abstract     = {Within the new era of artificial intelligence (AI), education industry should develop in the direction of intelligence and digitalization. For evaluating learners’ academic performances, English high-stakes test is not only a mere means for measuring what English as a Foreign Language (EFL) stakeho lders know or do not know but also likely to bring life-changing consequences. Hence, effective test preparation for English high-stakes test is crucial for those who futures depend on attaining a particular score. However, traditional corpus-based approaches cannot simultaneously take words’ frequency and range variables into consideration when evaluating their importance level, which makes the word sorting results inaccurate. Thus, to effectively and accurately extract critical words among English high-stakes test for enhancing EFL stakeholders’ test performance, this paper integrates a corpus-based approach and a revised Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) method to develop a novel frequency-range analysis (FRA) method. Taiwan College Entrance Exam of English Subject (TCEEES) from the year of 2001 to 2022 are adopted as an empirical case of English high stake test and the target corpus for verification. Results indicate that the critical words evaluated by FRA method are concentrated on Quadrant I including 1,576 word types that account for over 60% running words of TCEEES corpus. After compared with the three traditional corpus-based approaches and the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method, the significant contributions include: (1) the FRA method can use a machine-based function words elimination technique to enhance the efficiency; (2) the FRA method can simultaneously take words’ frequency and range variables into consideration; (3) the FRA method can effectively conduct cluster analysis by categorizing the words into the four quadrants that based on their relative importance level. The results will give EFL stakeholders a clearer picture of how to allocate their learning time and education resources into critical words acquisition.},

Therefore, this study suggests an improved risk evaluation method based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM). This method determines the decision-maker weight for the risk criterion according to the levels of professionalism of the decision-makers in the risk criterion and uses the VIse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to rate the risk of the alternative agricultural products live-streaming e-commerce platforms. The viability and dependability of the approach described in this work are demonstrated using a case study. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are illustrated by a comparative analysis. With the help of this paper, agricultural product merchants will be able to identify the live-streaming e-commerce platform that carries the least amount of overall risk and work toward the paper’s stated objectives of sustainable development in addition to developing and enhancing theoretical research findings in the field.},

  abstract     = {Due to the vast amount of patient health data, automated healthcare systems still struggle to classify and diagnose various ailments. Learning redundant data also reduces categorization accuracy. A Deep Belief Network (DBN) has been used to precisely extract the most important aspects from clinical data by ignoring irrelevant/redundant features. Due of many learning variables, training is complicated. Similarly, the hybrid model has been employed by ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to categorize diseases. But, its efficiency depends on the proper choice of kernels and hyper-parameters. Therefore, this paper develops an efficient feature extraction and classification model for healthcare systems. First, several medical data related to the patient’s health are collected. Then, an Optimized DBN (ODBN) model is presented for maximizing the accurateness of DBN by optimizing the learning variables depends on the Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) algorithm. With learning ODBN, the most relevant features are extracted with reduced computational complexity. After that, the CNN-LSTM with Unsupervised Fine-tuned Deep Self-Organizing Map (UFDSOM)-based classifier model is designed to categorize the extracted features into categories of illnesses. In this novel classifier, dropout normalization and parameter tuning processes are applied to avoid overfitting and optimize the hyper-parameters, which results in a less training period. In the end, studies utilizing publically accessible datasets show that the ODBN with CNN-LSTM-UFDSOM system outperforms classical models by 98.23%.},

  abstract     = {The foundation of textile machinery digitization and intelligence is condition monitoring and identification. Online condition monitoring of looms is of great significance to ensure their long-term stable operation and improve their digital management level. However, the existing loom condition mon itoring methods have problems such as insufficient depth of information mining, low condition recognition rate and poor system versatility. As a result, the loom on-board condition monitoring technology based on fuzzy rough set and improved DSmT theory is studied. To begin, we examine the loom operation mechanism, loom state characterization, and loom state feature data composition. Then, using the fuzzy rough set method, we analyze and make decisions on the loom state feature data, apply the theory of uncertainty and importance improvement DSmT fusion to solve the uncertainty problem of the rough set method’s decision rules, and build the loom state feature decision network on the embedded terminal using the decision rules. Meanwhile, to collect, communicate, display, and alarm loom characteristic data, this paper employs the STM32F407ZET6 microcontroller and designs a loom system status data collection platform with the AD7730 as the core, as well as tests loom status monitoring data collection and loom status data analysis and decision method based on this platform. The experimental findings show the usefulness of attribute data gathering as well as data analysis and decision-making processes. The technology enhances the precision of loom condition identification and decision making, as well as the safety and quality of manufacturing.

  abstract     = {In addition to existing cryptographic systems, watermarking technologies have been developed to add extra security. Digital watermarking utilizes embedding or hiding techniques to protect multimedia files from copyright violations. Fundamental procedures of digital watermarking techniques are embed ding and extraction. Singular value decomposition (SVD) based Image watermarking schemes become popular owing to its better trade-off among robustness and imperceptibility. Nevertheless, false positive problem (FPP) is a major issue of SVD-based watermarking schemes. The singular value that is a fixed value and does not contain structural information about image is the primary cause of FPP problem. Therefore, Message Digest algorithm image watermarking scheme based on Funk Singular Value Decomposition and Fractional-Order Polar Harmonic Transform (FSVD-FOPHT) is proposed in this paper to address this problem. The MD-5 algorithm is used to extract data from the host and watermark imageries and then create secret key. The FSVD-FOPHT method is utilized to hide watermark information in host image. The secret keys are extracted from hided image using inverse process of Fractional-Order Polar Harmonic Transforms with Funk Singular Value Decomposition algorithm. By using the extraction procedure, watermark image is extracted, and then reconstructs original watermarked image. During extraction procedure, the secret key is used for authentication to address FPP. Then, the proposed method is implemented in MATLAB and performance is analyzed with evaluation metrics, such as Embedding capacity, MSE, PSNR, and NC. The proposed method provide 14.6%, 17.34%, 19.53%, 21.46% and 23.89% high PSNR for cold-snow-landscape-water test image, 14.29%, 16.47%, 18.39%, 20.16% and 21.93% high PSNR for landscape-nature-sky-blue Test image, 16.85%, 19.99%, 22.70%, 27.22% and 29.16% high Embedding Capacity for cold-snow-landscape-water test image 22.83%, 24.64%, 27.92%, 29.60% and 31.77% high Embedding Capacity for landscape-nature-sky-blue Test image 35.38%, 32.63%, 30.95%, 28.61% and 26.08% low extraction time compared with existing methods SVD-CMSF-SIW, FE-IWS-DNN, AR-IWS-DNN, BBET-SHA1-SIW and LSB-DWT-SIW respectively.},

  abstract     = {Online knowledge distillation breaks the pre-determined strong and weak teacher-student models, it provides a new way of thinking about knowledge distillation. However, the current online methods often use the Logits-based prediction distribution, and the features containing rich semantic informati on are rarely used. Even if the feature-based methods are used, they only operate on the last layer of the network, without further exploring the representation knowledge of the middle layer feature map. To address the above issues, we propose an innovative feature early fusion and reconstruction (FEFR) method for online knowledge distillation which entails four essential components: multi-scale feature extraction and intermediate layer feature early fusion, reconstruction of features, dual-attention and overall fusion module in this paper. We propose early fusion by “sum” operation for feature matrices between different layers and advance fusion to improve the feature map representation. In order to enhance the communication ability between groups to obtain features, the features were reconstructed. We create a dual-attention to enhance the critical channel and spatial regions adaptively in order to collect more accurate information. The previously processed feature maps are combined and fused using feature fusion, which also aids in student models training. A study of the network architectures of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10 and ImageNet 2012 shows that FEFR provides more useful characterization knowledge for refinement and improves accuracy by about 0.5% compared to other methods.},

To increase the precision of identifying anomalies, Chebyshev’s theorem was used to estimate the upper of the number of abnormal features. Meanwhile, the dot product operation was implemented in order to strengthen the learning of the model for class labels. Experiment results show that the detected accuracy of the proposed method is 0.766 when the data dimensionality is 5408, and also wins over competitors in detected performance for the considered cases. We also demonstrate that the strengthened learning of class labels can improve the ability of the model to detect anomalies.

  abstract     = {Crowd counting aims to estimate the number, density, and distribution of crowds in an image. The current mainstream approach, based on CNN, has been highly successful. However, CNN is not without its flaws. Its limited receptive field hampers the modeling of global contextual information, and it st ruggles to effectively handle scale variation and background complexity. In this paper, we propose a Multi-scale Hybrid Attention Network called MHANet to solve crowd counting challenges more effectively. To address the issue of scale variation, we have developed a Multi-scale Aware Module (MAM) that incorporates multiple sets of dilated convolutions with varying dilation rates. The MAM significantly improves the network’s ability to extract information at multiple scales. To tackle the problem of background complexity, we have introduced a Hybrid Attention Module (HAM) that combines spatial attention and channel attention. The HAM effectively directs attention to the crowd region while suppressing background interference, resulting in more accurate counting. MHANet has been extensively experimented on four benchmark datasets and compared against state-of-the-art algorithms. It consistently achieves superior performance in terms of the MAE evaluation metric. MHANet outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by margins of 1.9%, 5.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% on the ShanghaiTech Part_A, ShanghaiTech Part_B, UCF-QNRF, and UCF_CC_50 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments targeting MAM and HAM were conducted in this paper, and the experimental results fully demonstrate that MAM and HAM can effectively address the challenges of scale variation and background complexity, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and robustness of the network.},

  abstract     = {Load balancing in cloud computing refers to dividing computing characteristics and workloads. Distributing resources among servers, networks, or computers enables enterprises to manage workload demands. This paper proposes a novel load-balancing method based on the Two-Level Particle Swarm Optimiza tion (TLPSO). The proposed TLPSO-based load-balancing method can effectively solve the problem of dynamic load-balancing in cloud computing, as it can quickly and accurately adjust the computing resource distribution in order to optimize the system performance. The upper level aims to improve the population’s diversity and escape from the local optimum. The lower level enhances the rate of population convergence to the global optimum while obtaining feasible solutions. Moreover, the lower level optimizes the solution search process by increasing the convergence speed and improving the quality of solutions. According to the simulation results, TLPSO beats other methods regarding resource utilization, makespan, and average waiting time.},

While current research has extensively investigated various syntactic dependency tree structures, the optimization of GCN alg orithms has often been overlooked, leading to suboptimal efficiency in practical applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-feature method that utilizes feature vector multiplication to construct non-linear combinations of GCN features and enhance the model’s capability to extract complex feature correlations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, with our models outperforming state-of-the-art methods and achieving significant improvements on three standard benchmark datasets. These results suggest that the cross-feature method can effectively extract potential connections between features, highlighting its potential for improving the performance of GCN-based models in real-world applications.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a precision part image preprocessing method based on histogram equalization algorithm and an improved convolutional neural network (i.e. Region Proposal Network(RPN), Visual Geometry Group(VGG)) model for precision recognition of tiny parts. Firstly, the image is restricted to adaptive histogram equalization for the problem of poor contrast between part features and the image background. Second, a custom central loss function is added to the recommended frame extraction RPN network to reduce problems such as excessive intra-class spacing during classification. Finally, the local response normalization function is added after the nonlinear activation function and pooling layer in the VGG network, and the original activation function is replaced by the Relu function to overcome the problems such as high nonlinearity and serious overfitting of the original model. Experiments show that the improved VGG model achieves 95.8% accuracy in precision part recognition and has a faster recognition speed than most existing convolutional networks trained on the same test set.},

  abstract     = {In order to better evaluate and promote human health, this paper analyzes the influence of different inertial-measurement-unit signals, different sensor locations, different activity intensities and different signal fusion schemes on the accuracy of physical strength consumption estimation during w alking and running activities. Different pattern recognition methods, such as the Counts-based linear regression model, the typical non-linear model based on decision tree and artificial neural network, and the end-to-end convolutional neural network model, are analyzed and compared. Our findings are as follows: 1) For the locations of sensors during walking and running activities, the physical strength consumption prediction accuracy at the ankle location is higher than that at the hip location. Therefore, wearing an inertial-measurement-unit at the ankle can improve the accuracy of the model. 2) Regarding the types of activity signals during walking and running activities, the impact of accelerometer signals on hip and ankle prediction accuracy is not significantly different, while the gyroscope model is more sensitive to the location, with higher prediction accuracy at the ankle than at the hip. In addition, the physical strength consumption prediction accuracy of accelerometer signals is higher than that of gyroscope signals, and fusion of accelerometer and gyroscope signals can improve the accuracy of physical strength consumption prediction. 3) For different data analysis models during walking and running activities, the artificial neural network model that integrates different sensor locations and inertial-measurement-unit signals with different activity intensities has the lowest mean squared error for the measurement of physical strength consumption. The non-linear models based on decision tree and artificial neural network have better physical strength consumption prediction capabilities than the Counts-based linear regression model, especially for high-intensity activity energy consumption prediction. In addition, feature engineering models are generally better than convolutional neural network model in terms of overall performance and prediction results under the three different activity intensities. Furthermore, as the activity intensity increases, the performance of all physical strength consumption calculation models decreases. We recommend using the artificial neural network model based on multi-signal fusion to estimate physical strength consumption during walking and running activities because this model exhibits strong generalization ability in cross-validation and test results, and its stability under different activity intensities is better than that of the other three models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to delve deeply and in detail into methods for estimating physical strength consumption. Undoubtedly, our paper will have an impact on research related to topics such as intelligent wearable devices and subsequent methods for estimating physical strength consumption, which are directly related to physical health.},

  abstract     = {Having one’s life threatened by a disease like ovarian cancer is the single most crucial thing in the whole world. It is difficult to achieve high performance without sacrificing computational efficiency; the results of the denoising process are not as good as they could be; the proposed models are nonconvex and involve several manually chosen parameters, which provides some leeway to boost denoising performance; the methods generally involve a complex optimisation problem in the testing stage; Here at DnCNN, we’ve developed our own version of the deep ii learning model, a discriminative learning technique. The goal was to eliminate the need for the iterative optimisation technique at the time it was being evaluated. The goal was to avoid having to go through testing altogether, thus this was done. It is highly advised to use a Deep CNN model, the efficacy of which can be evaluated by comparing it to that of more traditional filters and pre-trained DnCNN. The Deep CNN strategy has been shown to be the best solution to minimise noise when an image is destroyed by Gaussian or speckle noise with known or unknown noise levels. This is because Deep CNN uses convolutional neural networks, which are trained using data. This is because convolutional neural networks, which are the foundation of Deep CNN, are designed to learn from data and then use that learning to make predictions. Deep CNN achieves a 98.45% accuracy rate during testing, with an error rate of just 0.002%.},

  abstract     = {Visual art was originally measured by viewing and appreciating graphic works, and there was no previous research into ways to improve the quality of visual art. With the rapid development of visual arts and technology, the question of how to improve quality has become an urgent one. As the most cut ting-edge and hottest concept in the international arena today, the development and application of metaverse technology has widely drawn the close attention of various industries, including management, economy, education, and art. However, there is no in-depth and clear research on the concept of metaverse in the field of art, especially in the field of visual art. We believe that the creation of visual art in the context of metaverse will be an important direction for art development in the future, and can also greatly contribute to the improvement of the quality of metaverse visual art presentation. Therefore, we focus on the issue of visual art quality assessment in our research, and propose a theory and method of metaverse-oriented future visual art quality assessment. The method focuses on the G1-entropy value method to calculate the weights in visual arts, combines qualitative research with quantitative research, and proposes the improvement path and countermeasures for visual arts. In summary, our research aims to address the theoretical approaches to the design of the metaverse field architecture and the assessment of art quality for the future introduction of the metaverse. The main contributions of our research are focused on the following three aspects: 1. The construction of the visual art field architecture draws on the functional requirements analysis method of system science simulation, considering that the entire visual art metaverse field architecture is constructed at three levels: the bottom data support layer, the middle technical support layer and the upper technical application layer. 2. The G1-entropy combination weighting method is used to derive the importance ranking of visual art quality indicators and identify key factors, and to derive suggestions for quality improvement based on the key indicator factors. More importantly, we also build a field architecture for future-oriented visual arts in this study, which bridges the gap in the structural design of visual arts after the introduction of the future concept. Our present study makes a great contribution to the application of visual art quality enhancement, focusing on the analysis of new concepts and the improvement of old methods, building a new scene of organic combination of new technologies and traditional visual art, with practical research theoretical support for the promotion and progress of the disciplinary field.},

Centrality measures that consider different scales of neighborho od are commonly utilized for ranking node influence. The 2-hop neighborhood of the target node is deemed a suitable evaluation metric. However, as the network scale expands, only considering 2-hop neighborhood is overly restrictive. Furthermore, the interconnections among nodes are often disregarded. In this article, a new method named Limited Spreading Domain (LSD) is proposed to identify influential spreaders. LSD defines the target node’s 2-hop neighborhood as basic domain and takes the neighbors who are 3–6 hops away from target node as extended domain. The influence of target node is modeled as diffusion along the paths with limited length in basic domain and extended domain. A series of experiments are conducted in eight real complex networks and results demonstrate that LSD outperforms common centralities in terms of accuracy, stability,distinguishability and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Multilingual pre-trained language models have achieved impressive results on most natural language processing tasks. However, the performance is inhibited due to capacity limitations and their under-representation of pre-training data, especially for languages with limited resources. This has led t o the creation of tailored pre-trained language models, in which the models are pre-trained on large amounts of monolingual data or domain specific corpus. Nevertheless, compared to relying on multiple monolingual models, utilizing multilingual models offers the advantage of multilinguality, such as generalization on cross-lingual resources. To combine the advantages of both multilingual and monolingual models, we propose KDDA - a framework that leverages monolingual models to a single multilingual model with the aim to improve sentence representation for Vietnamese. KDDA employs teacher-student framework and cross-lingual transfer that aims to adopt knowledge from two monolingual models (teachers) and transfers them into a unified multilingual model (student). Since the representations from the teachers and the student lie on disparate semantic spaces, we measure discrepancy between their distributions by using Sinkhorn Divergence - an optimal transport distance. We conduct experiments on two Vietnamese natural language understanding tasks, including machine reading comprehension and natural language inference. Experimental results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models and yields competitive performances.},

  abstract     = {High-quality development of socio-economic, ecological environment, tourism industry and natural resources in the Yellow River Basin is a major strategic task for national development. High-quality development in the Yellow River Basin still has a lot of room for improvement, so it is important for the coupled and coordinated development of water resources-socio-economic-ecological environment-tourism industry in the Yellow River Basin region. In this study, we focus on the major strategic issues of high quality development in the Yellow River Basin in the context of the above-mentioned background and the current forms and policies of sustainable development in China, and conduct research on the theory and methods of assessing the sustainable development of regional water resources-socio-economic-ecological environment-tourism industry. However, by analyzing the existing research literature on sustainable development assessment, we find that most of them focus on a single area or two combinations of modal development studies, and focus on exploring micro-coupling mechanisms, so the generality of macro policy support is rather mediocre, which we fill this gap through this study. The study relies on an innovative macroscopic research perspective that draws pioneeringly on the quality function deployment (QFD) theory in the field of product quality management in marketing, which, it is worth stating, allows for a framework of research perspectives from a systematic and holistic perspective. In this framework, we will propose a G1-entropy value method for indicator importance (weight) assessment. It is worth stating that the G1 method used in this paper is different from the traditional G1 method in that we will introduce the identity information weights of experts to improve the reliability of the subjective assignment method. We will also construct an indicator system for studying the regional sustainable development issues in the Yellow River Basin on this basis, so as to complete the ranking and analysis of the nine provinces and the importance of indicators in the Yellow River Basin. This study will provide a comprehensive theoretical basis for Chinese government and related departments to formulate policies for the high-quality development of water resources, socio-economic, ecological environment and tourism industry in the Yellow River Basin, and also provide theoretical and empirical references for the analysis and assessment of similar international regional sustainability cases.},

  abstract     = {The survey propagation algorithm is the most effective information propagation algorithm for solving the 3-SAT problem. It can effectively solve the satisfiability problem when it converges. However, when the factor graph structure is complex, the algorithm often does not converge and the solution fails. In order to give a theoretical explanation to this phenomenon and to analyze the convergence of the survey propagation algorithm effectively, a connected treewidth model of the propositional formula was constructed by using the connected tree decomposition method, and the connected treewidth of the factor graph was calculated. The relationship between the connected treewidth and the convergence of the survey propagation algorithm is established, and the convergence judgment condition of the survey propagation algorithm based on the connected tree width is given. Through experimental analysis, the results show that the method is effective, which is of great significance for analyzing the convergence analysis of other information propagation algorithms.},

Non-maximum suppression algorithm is used to determine the position of the target between different adjacent video image sequences, and SVM classifier is used to train a large number of target behaviors. According to the hierarchical structure of dataset annotation, the hierarchical structure of tennis video for deep learning is optimized. The reconstruction algorithm is used to enhance the video image in the input VOC data set and improve the fine segmentation effect of the image.

  abstract     = {The classification problem is a key area of research in machine learning. The Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is an important classifier that is commonly used to solve classification problems. Its widespread use stems from its replacement of the inequality constraint in the Support Vec tor Machine (SVM) with the equality constraint, which transforms the convex quadratic programming (QP) problem of SVM into the solution of linear equations. However, when dealing with multi-class classification problems, LSSVM faces the challenges of lack of sparsity and sample noises, which can negatively impact its performance. Based on the modeling characteristics and data distribution of the multi-class LSSVM model, this paper proposes two improvements and establishes an improved fuzzy sparse multi-class least squares support vector machine (IF-S-M-LSSVM). The first improvement adopts a non-iterative sparse algorithm, which can delete training sample points to different degrees by adjusting the sparse ratio. The second improvement addresses the impact of sample noise on determining the optimal hyperplane by adding a fuzzy membership degree based on sample density. The advantages of the new model, in terms of training speed and classification accuracy, are verified through UCI machine learning standard data set experiments. Finally, the statistical significance of the IF-S-M-LSSVM model is tested using the Friedman and Bonferroni-Dunn tests.},

Therefore teaching quality evaluation periodically is performed internally and exte rnally through skill validation and joint training. This article introduces a Regressive Fuzzy Evaluation Model (RFEM) for analyzing the quality of college classroom English teaching quality. This evaluation model operates over the teaching quality metrics such as performance, student understandability, and application. The understandability and English application to the real world is modeled by referring to the performance as the regressive factor. The regressive factor is analyzed for two fuzzification outputs: high and low, by analyzing the individual factors over cumulative teaching grades. The regression for low fuzzy outputs is analyzed using mean understandability and application score from the previous assessment instance. This is required for training the fuzzification from the mean score rather than the low level. Therefore the quality improvements from the lagging features are addressed by providing a new teaching method. Further fuzzy regression is initiated from the mean to the high level reducing the computation time and errors.},

This paper proposes a solution of features reduction collaborative fuzzy c-means clustering (FR-CFCM) for hyperspectral remote sensing image analysis using random projection. The dimensional reduction technique is based on the Johnson Lindenstrauss lemma algorithm, preserving the relative distance between data samples. This can make clustering easier without affecting the clustering results. Moreover, by reducing dimensionality and sharing information among sub-data in collaborative clustering, it is possible to improve the performance and accuracy of hyperspectral remote sensing image analysis results. The experiments conducted on two hyperspectral image data sets with five validity indexes show that the proposed methods perform better compared with the other methods.},

In this study, the time series clustering method was adopted, and the learning behavior of college students in an English vocabulary learning app in China was selected for data mining. Firstly, taking the “single-day memorization amount” as the measurement index, the memorization records of college students in the whole use cycle were extracted and processed into trajectory data, and the KmL algorithm was used to cluster the trajectory of the memorization amount in the time series. According to the intra-class average trajectory, the characteristics of learning behavior changes among the different college students are summarized, and two learning modes are depicted.

Therefore, in this work, a novel Taymon Optimized Deep Learning network (TODL net) for recommending top best movies based on their past choices, behaviour and movie contents. The deep neural network is a combination of Dilated CNN with Bi-directional LSTM. The DiCNN-BiLSTM model eliminates the functionality pooling operations and uses a dilated convolution layer to address the issue of information loss. The DiCNN is employed to learn the movie contents by mining user behavioral pattern attributes. The BiLSTM is applied to recommend the best movies on basis of the extracted features of the movie rating sequences of users in other social mediums. Moreover, for providing better results the DiCNN-BiLSTM is optimized with Taymon optimization algorithm to recommend best movies for the users. The proposed TODL net obtains the overall accuracy of 97.24% for best movies recommendation by using TMDB and MovieLens datasets.},

In order to make full use of external information to ass ist recommendation, deeply mine the semantic information of review text and further improve the performance of recommendation system, a deep recommendation system based on knowledge graph and review text (Drs-kgrt) is proposed in this paper. In Drs-kgrt, knowledge graph, review text and the social records between users are used as auxiliary information to improve recommendation performance. Firstly, the review text is divided into user review text and item review text. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) is used to accurately understand semantic information in user review text and the social records between users. The trust relationship between users and user preferences are fully mined to form user feature vectors. Secondly, BERT and knowledge graph entity recognition link technology are combined to extract item attribute feature entities and their associated entities. The fine-grained features of the items are analyzed to form item feature vectors. Thirdly, based on the scoring matrix, latent vectors of users and items are obtained by matrix decomposition. The deep features of users and items are generated based on user feature vectors, item feature vectors, latent vectors of users and items, the deep recommendation system is established to predict user scores for items. Finally, experiments are conducted on the Douban dataset and Amazon Movie Review dataset, the results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance compared with other benchmark recommendation algorithms.},

Furthermore, manual visual evaluation is a time-consuming operation that relies on subjective judgment, resulting in variations in RBC recognition and counts. Mature If there is a blood problem, RBCs suffer morphological alterations. There are both automated and manual systems available on the market for counting the number of RBCs. Manual counting entails collecting blood cells with a Hemocytometer. The traditional procedure of exposing the smear below a microscope and physically measuring the cells yields inaccurate findings, putting clinical laboratory staff under stress. Automatic counters are incapable of detecting aberrant cell. The computer-aided method will assist in achieving accurate outcomes in minimum time. In this study presents an image processing method for separating red blood cells from several other blood products. Its goal is to analyze and interpret blood smear images to aid in the categorizing of red blood cells across 11 categories. The WBCs are extracted from the image using the K-Medoids technique, that is resistant to exterior disturbance. Granulometric assessment has been used to distinguish between red and WBCs. Feature extraction is used to obtain important features that aid in categorization. The categorization outcomes aid in a rapid diagnosis of disorders such as Normochromic, Iron Deficiency, Hypochromic, Sickle Cell, and Megaloblastic.},

  abstract     = {Existing research on Chinese text classification primarily focuses on classifying data information at different granularities, such as character, word, sentence, and chapter. However, this approach often fails to capture the semantic information embedded in these different levels of granularity. To enhance the extraction of the text’s core content, this study proposes a text classification model that incorporates an attention mechanism to fuse multi-granularity information. The model begins by constructing embedding vectors for characters, words, and sentences. Character and word vectors are generated using the Word2Vec training model, allowing the data to be converted into these respective vectors. To capture contextual semantic features, a bidirectional long and short-term memory network is employed for character and word vectors. Sentence vectors, on the other hand, are processed using the FastText model to extract the features they contain. To extract further important semantic information from the different feature vectors, they are fed into an attention mechanism layer. This layer enables the model to prioritize and emphasize the most significant information within the text. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms both single-granularity classification and combinations of two or more granularities. The model exhibits improved classification accuracy across three publicly available Chinese datasets.},

E-commerce is offering the opportunities for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) with limited resources to decrease the operating costs and improve the profitability by overcoming the operational problems. In addition, SMEs use e-commerce websitesas sales channels between the businesses, their competitor, and consumers. Between the success of e-commerce and manufacturing SMEs, however, the moderating influence of entrepreneurial competencies does not seem to be as significant. Hence, in this paper, Deep Convolutional Neural Network based onSales Prediction Model (DCNN-SPM) has been suggested for analyzing SME enterprises’ e-commerce utilization and development. Consistent with the user decision-making requirements of online product sales, united with the impelling factors of online product sales in different SME industries and the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI), this study builds a sales prediction model appropriate for online products. Furthermore, it evaluates the model’s adaptability to different types of online products. Our model can automatically extract the useful features from raw log data and predict the sales utilizing those extracted features by DCNN. The experimental outcomes show that our suggested DCNN-SPM has achieved a high customer satisfaction ratio of 98.7% and a customer is buying behaviour analysis of 97.6%.},

  abstract     = {Because of the two sequenced methods stated above, SG and AMP, are being used in different ways, present a deep learning methodology for taxonomic categorization of the metagenomic information which could be utilized for either. To place the suggested pipeline to a trial, 1000 16 S full-length geno mes were used to generate either SG or AMP short-reads. Then, to map sequencing as matrices into such a number space, used a k-mer model. Our analysis of the existing approaches revealed several drawbacks, including limited ability to handle complex hierarchical representations of data and suboptimal feature extraction from grid-like structures. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DBNs for feature learning and dimensionality reduction, and CNNs for efficient processing of grid-like metagenomic data. Finally, a training set for every taxon was obtained by training two distinct deep learning constructions, specifically deep belief network (DBN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). This examined the proposed methodology to determine the best factor that determines and compared findings to the classification abilities offered by the RDP classifier, a standard classifier for bacterium identification. These designs outperform using RDP classifiers at every taxonomic level. So, at the genetic level, for example, both CNN and DBN achieved 91.4% accuracy using AMP short-reads, but the RDP classifier achieved 83.9% with the same information. This paper, suggested a classification method for 16 S short-read sequences created on k-mer representations and a deep learning structure, that every taxon creates a classification method. The experimental findings validate the suggested pipelines as a realistic strategy for classifying bacterium samples; as a result, the technique might be included in the most commonly used tools for the metagenomic research. According to the outcomes, it could be utilized to effectively classify either SG or AMP information.},

  abstract     = {Bonferroni mean (BM) is an important aggregation operator in decision making. The desirable characteristic of the BM is that it can capture the interrelationship between the aggregation arguments or the individual attributes. The optimized weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (OWGBM) and the generali zed optimized weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (GOWGBM) proposed by Jin et al in 2016 are the extensions of the BM. However, the OWGBM and the GOWGBM have neither the reducibility nor the boundedness, which will lead to the illogical and unreasonable aggregation results and might make the wrong decision. To overcome these existing drawbacks, based on the normalized weighted Bonferroni mean (NWBM) and the GOWGBM, we propose the normalized weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (NWGBM) and the generalized normalized weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (GNWGBM), which can not only capture the interrelationship between the aggregation arguments, but also have the reducibility and the boundedness. Further, we extend the NWGBM and the GNWGBM to the intuitionistic fuzzy decision environment respectively, and develop the intuitionistic fuzzy normalized weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (IFNWGBM) and the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy normalized weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (GIFNWGBM). Subsequently, we prove some properties of these operators. Moreover, we present a new intuitionistic fuzzy decision method based on the IFNWGBM and the GIFNWGBM. Two application examples and comparisons with other existing methods are used to verify the validity of the proposed method.},

Amongst the various approaches of grey theory, the fractional-order grey model is fundamental and extends the cumulative generation method used in grey theory. Fractional-order cumulative generating operator offers numerous significant benefits, especially in educational funding that is often influenced by economic policies. However, their computational complexity complicates the generalization of fractional-order operators in real-world scenarios. In this paper, an enhanced fractional-order grey model is proposed based on a new fractional-order accumulated generating operator. The newly introduced model estimates parameters by utilizing the method of least squares and determines the order of the model through the implementation of metaheuristic algorithms. Our results show that, after conducting both Monte Carlo simulations and practical case analyses, the newly proposed model outperforms both existing grey prediction models and machine learning models in small sample environments, thus demonstrating superior forecast accuracy. Moreover, our experiments reveal that the proposed model has a simpler structure than previously developed grey models and achieves greater prediction accuracy.},

The proposed system mainly focused on data confidentiality and the authentication process. For data security, the hybrid Attribute-Based Encryption and Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ABE-ECC) algorithm is presented. Besides, for authentication, trust-based access control is introduced. The trust of the user is calculated using three parameters: the number of successful/failed interactions, the service satisfaction index, and the level of dishonesty. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed based on different metrics, namely throughput, latency, successful rate, service utilization, encryption time, decryption time, and retrieval time.},

As the first base for cultivating college students, major universities should not only guide them in their correct employment and entrepreneurship, but also help them find employment and entrepreneurship faster and better. However, in the context of the new era, universities still face some problems in the process of carrying out employment and entrepreneurship education, which hinder the progress of employment and entrepreneurship education. The probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets (PHFSs), as an extension of hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs), can more effectively and accurately describe uncertain or inconsistent information during the quality evaluation of college student employment and entrepreneurship education. TODIM and TOPSIS methods are two commonly used multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages. The quality evaluation of college student employment and entrepreneurship education is regarded as the defined multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM). This paper proposes a novel method based on TODIM and TOPSIS to cope with multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems under PHFSs environment. After introducing the related theory of PHFSs and the traditional TODIM and TOPSIS methods, the novel method based on a combination of TODIM and TOPSIS methods is designed. And then, an illustrative example for quality evaluation of college student employment and entrepreneurship education proved the feasibility and validity of the proposed method. Finally, the result has been compared with some existing methods under the same example and the proposed method’s superiority has been proved.},

Due to historical development and administrative division, the economic strength of Beijing and Tianjin is strong, while the economic strength of Hebei Province is weak. The economic development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is severely uneven. The “Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Coordinated Development Strategy” is proposed and elevated to a national strategy in this context, aiming to explore the path of coordinated economic development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, promote economic cooperation, balance economic differences, and enhance the overall economic strength of the Beijing Tianjin Hebei region through national leadership. The economic collaborative development evaluation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is a classical multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems. Recently, the TODIM and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method has been used to cope with MADM issues. The hesitant triangular fuzzy sets (HTFSs) are used as a tool for characterizing uncertain information during the economic collaborative development evaluation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.

Despite a delayed inception, China’s sports industry has experienced a swift evolution a nd has established a unique developmental framework, thereby establishing a firm groundwork for the prospective growth of China’s sports industry. The sports industry of China is currently encountering fresh prospects for growth in the contemporary era. However, it is also confronted with formidable obstacles and strains that necessitate careful handling. To attain novel breakthroughs and advancements, it remains imperative to explore innovative perspectives and avenues. The assessment of the sports industry’s high-quality development in the new era is a classic Multiple Attribute Group Decision Making (MAGDM) problem. The TODIM and VIKOR methodologies have been employed in addressing Multiple Attribute Group Decision Making (MAGDM) challenges in current times.

  abstract     = {To enhance profitability of production cycle, any manufacturer needs effective product design and evaluation procedures. This study proposed a novel approach combining fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and multi-layer fuzzy inference system (MFIS). It is based on consumer online comments to improve product design. This method possesses several advantages over traditional design evaluation methods. It can quickly acquire consumer preferences, effectively handle multi-criteria decision problems and integrate uncertain and fuzzy information. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process–Multi-layer Fuzzy Inference System (FAHP-MFIS) involves the following steps: screening of factors, hierarchical modeling, quantification of qualitative factors, and conversion of these factors into quantitative values. It is a knowledge-based system that uses logical rules. The quantity and levels of input variables directly correlates with the quantity of logical rules. However, with multi-factor and multi-level inference, the establishment of a rule base becomes impractical due to the overwhelming number of rules. To address this issue, the Taguchi orthogonal table is applied to reduce the number of logical rules. Taking a household oxygen generator for medical devices as an example, the proposed model is applied in real-time. In the first stage, web crawlers are used to collect user reviews of the household oxygen generators on large e-commerce platforms. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models are used to screen for principal and sub-factors in the second stage. Then, sub-factors of the FAHP screening are used as inputs, and the principal factors are used as outputs. In the third stage, priority indicators are established based on principal factors such as Appearance, Basic Function, and Advanced Function. Established evaluation models are then used to rank the selected designs. The results show that the higher the priority index value of the product design scheme, the better the scheme, and vice versa. This study holds significant reference value in aiding enterprises to enhance the efficiency of their manufacturing cycle and determining the direction of product design and innovation with improved pace and accuracy. Moreover, it can be applied to other fields such as supply chain management, risk assessment, and investment decisions.},

This study proposes a new method for identifying the day instar of adult silkworms based on deep learning and computer vision. Images from the first day of instar 3 to the seventh day of ins tar 5 were photographed using a mobile phone, and a dataset containing 7, 000 images was constructed. An effective recognition network, called CSP-SENet, was proposed based on CSPNet, in which the hierarchical kernels were adopted to extract feature maps from different receptive fields, and an image attention mechanism (SENet) was added to learn more important information. Experiments showed that CSP-SENet achieved a recognition precision of 0.9743, a recall of 0.9743, a specificity of 0.9980, and an F1-score of 0.9742. Compared to state-of-the-art and related networks, CSP-SENet achieved better recognition performance with the advantage of computational complexity. The study can provide theoretical and technical references for future work.},

First, to obtain complementary information of different features, we e xtract the local and global features of one-dimensional multi-resolution local binary patterns (1DMRLBP) and multi-scale differential feature (MSDF). Then, to extract robust discriminant feature information from the 1DMRLBP and MSDF features, a novel two-branch U2-net framework is constructed. In addition, a multi-scale extraction module is designed to capture the transition information. It consists of multiple convolution layers with different receptive fields for capturing multi-scale transition information. At last, a two-level attention module is used to adaptively capture valuable information for ECG biometrics. DMFUDM can obtain the average subject recognition rates of 99.76%, 98.31%, 98.97% and 98.87% on four databases, respectively, and experiment results show that it performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods on all four databases.},

  abstract     = {To shorten the operating time of the high-dimensional problems on fuzzy systems, we proposed the width residual neuro fuzzy system (WRNFS) before, but the discussion on the structure of WRNFS was insufficient, especially on the divide-and-conquer strategies of the input dimensions. In previous research, the optimization methods for WRNFS were not discussed. In this paper we proposed the first optimization method for WRNFS, which is an improved scheme for grouping the input dimensions of WRNFS, using random feature selection(RFS) to find a better solution, so as to improve the overall capability of the system. We call the width residual neuro fuzzy system based on random feature-selection as RFS-WRNFS. In this paper, the exhaustive experiment analysis and practical test of WRNFS and RFS-WRNFS are carried out on the reconstructed MG dataset, and the following conclusions are obtained: ding172 The performance of WRNFS is generally consistent when the structure of the WRNFS sub-systems and the input-output pairs are fixed; ding173 When searching for the optimal solution on the WRNFS, the time cost of exhaustive search is acceptable when the system remains in a small scale; ding174 In most cases, RFS-WRNFS carries out several random tests and produces better results than WRNFS. Furthermore, assuming that the input dimension is N and the times of attempts used to random feature selection for a better solution of WRNFS is M, we found:1) when M = 1 N, there is a certain probability to get an acceptable solution, and the system takes the shortest time; 2) When M = 2 N, there is a great chance to get an acceptable solution in a limited time; 3) When M = 3 N, best solution can be obtained with the longest search time. We suggest M = 2 N for the RFS-WRNFS for the comprehensive performance. Comparing the experiment results of exhaustive search and random feature selection, WRNFS always reaches the optimal solution by exhaustive search through a finite set in a limited time, while RFS-WRNFS in most time keeps a good balance between prediction precision and time efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a rise in interest in face anti-spoofing (FAS) owing to the critical function it plays in protecting face recognition systems against presentation assaults (PAs). Early-stage FAS approaches relying on handmade characteristics become inaccurate when steadily realistic PAs of unique sorts emerge. Thus, face anti-spoofing algorithms are gaining increasing relevance in such setups. A very innovative method called deep learning has shown remarkable success in difficult computer vision problems. The proposed method uses deep acquisition and transfer of learning to extract characteristics from people’s faces. This is why the authors of this study recommend using the Faster RCNN classifier with a face-liveness detection approach. Two distinct components— the data augmentation module for assessing sparse information as well as the faster RCNN classifier module— make up the anti-spoofing approach. We may use any publicly accessible dataset to train our quicker RCNN classifier. We successively fused these two components and used the Android platform to create a basic face recognition app. The results of the tests demonstrate that the developed module can identify several types of face spoof assaults, such as those carried out with the use of posters, masks, or cell phones. Testing the proposed architecture both across and inside databases using three benchmarking (Idiap Replay Attack, CASIA- FASD, &amp; 3DMAD) demonstrate its ability to deliver outcomes on par with cutting-edge techniques.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) have received increasing attention from many researchers. In such problems, there are situations where two or more Pareto Sets (PSs) correspond to the same Pareto Front (PF). It is crucial to obtain as many PSs as possible without compromising the performance of the objective space. Therefore, this paper proposes an enhanced multimodal multi-objective genetic algorithm with a novel adaptive crossover mechanism, named AEDN_NSGAII. In the AEDN_NSGAII, the special crowding distance strategy can provide potential development opportunities for individuals with a larger crowding distance. An adaptive crossover mechanism is established by combining the simulated binary crossover (SBX) operator and the Laplace crossover (LP) operator, which adaptively improves the ability to obtain Pareto optimal solutions. Meanwhile, an elite selection mechanism can efficiently get more excellent individuals as parents to enhance the diversity of the decision space. Then, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the CEC2019 test suite by the Friedman method and discussed for its feasibility through ablation experiments and boxplot analysis of PSP indicators. Experimental results show that AEDN_NSGAII can effectively search for more PSs without weakening the diversity and convergence of objective space. Finally, the performance of AEDN_NSGAII on the multimodal feature selection problem is compared with that of the other four algorithms. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm has great potential for resolving this issue.},

Within this framework, an examination has been made by considering both data mining and fuzzy decision-making techniques. In the analysis process, N-gram methodology is implemented to the abstracts of 1711 studies in the “Sciencedirect” platform and five different indicators are selected. In the proposed decision-making model, firstly, selected criteria are weighted by Spherical fuzzy CRITIC. Secondly, E7 economies are ranked with RATGOS. Thirdly, a sensitivity analysis is performed, and a comparative evaluation is conducted by MAIRCA technique. The most important originality of this proposed model is generating a new technique named RATGOS. In the literature, there are various decision-making models to rank the alternatives. However, lots of researchers criticized these approaches due to some reasons, such as using Euclidean distance by calculating the distances to the negative ideal solutions. Thus, it is seen that there is a need for a new technique that considers geometric mean in proportional concepts. To reach this objective, the RATGOS technique is introduced so that it can be possible to reach more accurate results. The findings indicate that renewable energy usage is the most critical item to overcome carbon emission problem. Therefore, some measures should be taken to increase renewable energy investments. First, governments can offer incentives for renewable energy investments. These incentives may include various incentives such as tax exemptions and low interest loans. Moreover, more research and development works are required for the development of renewable energy technologies. In this way, it can make renewable energy technologies more effective and efficient. For future research directions, an evaluation can be carried out for developed countries because carbon emissions problem also plays a crucial role for the social and economic improvements of these economies.},

Second, the attractiveness characteristics of the products and customer demand dimension information were analyzed by evaluation grid method. Third, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was used to assign weight values to the 3 users’ perceptual evaluation vocabularies. Fourth, the artificial neural network algorithm was incorporated into the fitness evaluation stage of the interactive algorithm to reduce information distortion caused by evaluation fatigue. Finally, after training the samples using the back propagation neural network, 8 design schemes with a fitness value exceeding 4.5 were obtained. The iterative curve indicated that after the 51st generation, the error accuracy approached 0.09. The experimental results verified that the system could help to improve the efficiency of product design, and design products that are more in line with user needs.},

  abstract     = {Dense passage retrieval is a popular method in information retrieval recently, especially in open domain question answering. It aims to retrieve related articles from massive passages to answer the question. Retriever can increase retrieval speed with less loss of accuracy compared to other methods . However, the pretrained language models used in recent research are often ineffective in semantic embedding, which will reduce accuracy. In addition, we find that contrastive learning will diverge the representation space, and Siamese models with independent parameters on both sides will decrease generalization performance. Therefore, we propose span prompt dense passage retrieval (SPDPR) based on span mask prompt tuning and parameter sharing in Chinese open-domain dense retrieval. This model can generate more efficient representation embeddings and effectively counteract the separation tendency between positive samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of SPDPR in DYKzh, as well as two Chinese datasets. SPDPR surpasses all SOTAs implemented in DYKzh and achieves a competitive result in other datasets.},

  abstract     = {Sports news is a type of discourse that is characterized by a specific vocabulary, style, and tone, and it is typically focused on conveying information about sporting events, athletes, and teams. Thematic context-based deep learning is a powerful approach that can be used to analyze and interpret various forms of natural language, including the discourse expression of sports news. An application model of sign language and lip language recognition based on deep learning is proposed to facilitate people with hearing impairment to easily obtain sports news content. First, the lip language recognition system is constructed; next, MobileNet lightweight network combined with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is used to extract lip reading features. ResNet-50 residual network structure isadopted to extract the features of sign language; finally, the convergence, accuracy, precision and recall of the model are verified respectively. The results show that the loss of training set and test set converges gradually with the increase of iteration times; the lip language recognition model and the sign language recognition model basically tend to be stable after 14 iterations and 12 iterations, respectively, suggesting a better convergence effect of sign language recognition. The accuracy of sign language recognition and lip language recognition is 98.9% and 87.7%, respectively. In sign language recognition, the recognition accuracy of numbers 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 can reach 100%. In lip language recognition, the recognition accuracy of numbers 2, 3 and 9 is relatively higher. This exploration can facilitate hearing-impaired people to quickly obtain the relevant content in sports news videos, and also provide help for their communication.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical structures of the rapier loom are strongly coupled, resulting in faults that are characterized by strong coupling, hierarchy, phase dynamics, and a transient nature. However, current fault diagnosis methods using a single approach are not satisfactory. Additionally, fault diagnosis of the entire operation cycle of the rapier loom equipment is lacking. This paper proposes a fault tree diagnosis method with probabilistic neural network optimization to build a complete fault diagnosis system for rapier looms and improve their intelligent diagnosis capability. The method has strong fault tolerance and self-adaptive capability, allowing for accurate location of the root cause of the fault from multiple fault sources. By accumulating fault samples and continuously improving the diagnosis network, the accuracy of diagnosis can be further enhanced. Initially, the failure mechanism of key subsystems of rapier loom is analyzed. A fault tree model is established for each subsystem based on expert experience and historical data. The model identifies the characteristic sign quantities of typical fault types and serves as the basic input for fault identification. A probabilistic neural network is used to train the fault sample set and complete the diagnosis of the cause of the fault. According to field experiments, the proposed method has demonstrated a significant improvement in the efficiency of locating and identifying fault signs in rapier looms. This improvement allows for accurate and quick identification of faults.},

  abstract     = {Pre-trained Visual Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown great potential in the multimodal domain. Among this, using different modal contexts and interaction features to construct prompt can stimulate the model’s prior knowledge circuit more accurately, thus generating better outputs. Howeve r, in CLIP, the formal mismatch of textual descriptions between the pre-training and inference phases results in a suboptimal representation ability of prompt, which is detrimental to model alignment learning. Therefore, Region-Attention Prompt (RAP) is proposed, which introduces region features to enrich the semantic representation of prompt. RAP is acquired by the Cross-Attention mechanism between images and texts, and it is essentially a region-level prompt with category-sensitive properties. For each category, RAP adaptively assigns greater attention weight to image regions that are more semantically relevant to the category. Besides, CLIP is equipped with RAP (called RA-CLIP) to improve image classification performance in generalization scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RA-CLIP outperforms the current SOTA CoCoOp 0.4% - 4.16% on base classes and 0.25% - 11.34% on new classes, across 7 datasets. In addition, we show that focusing on category-related regions to construct prompt can further improve the model’s alignment ability.},

The entropy weight method (EWM) can reflect the objectivity of decision information, while the best-worst method (BWM) can reflect the subjectivity of decision-makers. The interactive multi-criteria decision-making (TODIM) method can describe the different preferences of decision-makers for gains and losses. In this paper, EWM, BWM, and TODIM are combined and applied to LPFS for the first time. First, we calculate the objective weight and subjective weight of each criterion through EWM and BWM and combine them to get the final weight to balance subjectivity and objectivity. Then, this paper selects the best scheme through TODIM sorting. In conclusion, the LPFS-EWM-BWM-TODIM model is established in this paper. Finally, the paper applies this model to the selection of corporate investment strategy and green mine, verifies the effectiveness of the method, and carries out comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis, proving the rationality and robustness of the model.},

First, the method selec ts the normal process data with a high similarity to the test samples as training data of the local model, and continuously updates the local model according to the test samples to build an accurate time-varying model. Second, by weighting the data of different importance, the role of data similar to test samples in the modeling process is strengthened. Third, the LWPKPCA model is applied to process monitoring, the monitoring indicators are established in a high-dimensional space and used to detect faults. Finally, on the basis of LWPKPCA, the penicillin fermentation process (PFP) is taken to evaluate the monitoring performance of the proposed methods. According to the comparison of the experiment results, the detection rate and accuracy rate of the LWPKPCA method is considerably better than those of probabilistic principal component analysis and probabilistic kernel principal component analysis methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for processing time-varying data with nonlinear characteristics, and the LWPKPCA process monitoring method is effective for improving the performance of fault detection.},

  abstract     = {In recent years multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) has been devoted to developing effective fusion mechanisms and has made advances, however, there are several challenges that have not been addressed adequately: the models make insufficient use of important information (inter-modal relevance and i ndependence information) resulting in additional noise, and the traditional ternary symmetric architecture cannot well solve the problem of uneven distribution of task-related information among modalities. Thus, we propose Mutual Information Maximization and Feature Space Separation and Bi-Bimodal Modality Fusion (MFSBF)framework which effectively alleviates these problems. To alleviate the problem of underutilization of important information among modalities, a mutual information maximization module and a feature space separation module have been designed. The mutual information module maximizes the mutual information between two modalities to retain more relevance (modality-invariant) information, while the feature separation module separates fusion features to prevent the loss of independence(modality-specific) information during the fusion process. As different modalities contribute differently to the model, a bimodal fusion architecture is used, which involves the fusion of two bimodal pairs. The architecture focuses more on the modality that contains more task-ralated information and alleviates the problem of uneven distribution of useful information among modalities. The experiment results of our model on two publicly available datasets (CUM-MOSI and CUM-MOSEI) achieved better or comparable results than previous models, which demonstrate the efficacy of our method.},

It is not reasonable to explain the phenomenon that individuals solve the same item but have different knowledge structures behind it. This paper introduces the concept of skill inclusion degree and constructs the variable precision α-models to delineate knowledge structures. The skill inclusion degree takes into account an individual’s mastery of the number of skills assigned to each item. Firstly, the concept of the skill inclusion degree is given, and some of its properties are discussed. Then, the variable precision α-model is constructed. Moreover, the relationship between knowledge structures delineated via the variable precision α-models by a skill map is studied, and the algorithm of knowledge structures delineated via these models by a skill map is designed.

Secondly, based on “organization is bounded rational”, we established an evolutionary game model to analyze the influencing factors of technology sharing. Finally, we used the numerical simulation method to verify the model. Research shows that affective trust facilitates technology acquisition and cognitive trust facilitates technology sharing. The synergetic benefit distribution coefficient influences the evolutionary equilibrium strategy of technology sharing, and there is an optimal synergistic benefit distribution coefficient that maximizes the willingness of both enterprises to share technology. Technology transfer cost and technology leakage risk negatively affect technology-sharing behavior. The degree of technology complementarity, trust coefficient, incentive coefficient, and the ability of shared technologies to transform into synergistic benefits positively influence technology-sharing behavior.

How to carry out multimedia teaching of college English is indeed an important topic that needs further research. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of multimedia teaching effectiveness in college English is a classical multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems. Recently, the TODIM and GRA method has been used to cope with MADM issues. The double-valued neutrosophic sets (DVNSs) are used as a tool for characterizing uncertain information during the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of multimedia teaching effectiveness in college English. In this manuscript, the double-valued neutrosophic number Exponential TODIM-GRA (DVNN-ExpTODIM-GRA) method is built to solve the MADM under DVNSs. In the end, a numerical case study for fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of multimedia teaching effectiveness in college English is given to validate the proposed method.},

The aircraft targets in the images were detected rapidly and located through YOLOv3-tiny, and after image denoising, shadow detection, and positioning, then we used the Sobel operator to calculate the edge gradient of the target; the image of the aircraft target was segmented by using the region growth method, and then the principal component analysis (PCA)was used to obtain the central axis of the aircraft target. The projected distance from the edge contour to the central axis was sampled at equal intervals along the direction of the central axis, and its ratio to the length of the central axis was calculated to construct the feature vector. Finally, the Spearman rank correlation method was used to match the feature vectors to realize the recognition of the aircraft type. Experiments showed that the proposed method had strong adaptability and small computation and could quickly detect and accurately recognize aircraft targets in aerial images.},

  abstract     = {The evaluation of physical education teaching effectiveness is an important component of physical education teaching, and plays a multifaceted role in the process of physical education teaching. The information provided by it can control and regulate the progress of physical education teaching acti vities as a whole, ensuring that physical education teaching activities develop towards predetermined goals. With the development of the popularization of physical education, people’s requirements for the quality of physical education continue to improve, and the role and position of evaluation in teaching has become increasingly evident. Evaluation of physical education teaching effectiveness has become an indispensable process in teaching activities. The college physical education teaching effect evaluation can be regarded as a multiple attribute decision making (MADM). Thus, this paper collected information in probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets (PHFSs) and using CRITIC method to obtain the unknown weight among attributes. Further, a novel probabilistic hesitant fuzzy QUALIFLEX (PHF-QUALIFLEX) method was constructed for MADM. Finally, a numerical case for college physical education teaching effect evaluation was illustrated with this proposed model and other methods were utilized to compare with PHF-QUALIFLEX method to verify the feasibility and applicability.},

Entity nesting is an important challenge in relational extraction. The main reason of entity nesting problem is that the boundary information between entities is not clear. In order to solve the entity nesting problem at the fragment level, while preserving the relationship between fragments with the same characteristics and improving efficiency, we proposed a brand new fragment annotation method. On the basis of traditional fragment annotation method, combined with pointer annotation method, we designed an annotation method of &quot;ergodic enumeration + group mapping&quot;. On the basis of this method, an entity extraction model is designed: Span-Extraction Based Entity Extraction Model (LMA). Our model underwent a series of validations in the English data sets New York Times(NYT) and WEBNLG, showing significant improvements over the baseline model F1.

This paper proposes a temporal prediction model based on LSTM. Firstly, the SMART data of the disk is analyzed, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to analyze the correlation between the monitoring time series data of the faulty disk and the normal disk, and the monitoring index with the lowest correlation is selected as the fault feature; secondly, for the problem of serious imbalance of positive and negative samples in the SMART dataset, the SMOTEENN algorithm is introduced for oversampling to obtain a balanced dataset of positive and negative samples. The proposed method improves accuracy by 8.268% and F1-score by 8.657% compared to the conventional method.},

Firstly, the elite backward learning strategy is introduced to initialize the sparrow population, t o generate high-quality initial solutions. Secondly, the leader position is updated by fusing multi-strategy mechanisms. On one hand, the high distributivity of arithmetic optimization algorithm operators are used to deflate the target position, and enhance the ability of SSA to jump out of the local optimum. On the other hand, the leader position is perturbed by adopting the golden levy flight method and the t-distribution perturbation strategy to improve the shortcoming of SSA in the late iteration when the population diversity decreases. Further, a probability factor is added for random selection to achieve more effective communication among leaders. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of EGLTA-SSA, CEC2005 and CEC2019 functions are tested and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, and the experimental results show that EGLTA-SSA has a better performance in terms of convergence rate and stability. EGLTA-SSA is also successfully applied to three practical engineering problems, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of EGLTA-SSA in solving project optimization problems.},

This study aims to develop a cyclical learning rate optimized stacked generalization computational models (CLR-SGCM) for predicting Covid-19 pandemic outbreaks. Stacked generalization framework performs hierarchical two-phase prediction. In the first phase, deep learning models namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and statistical model Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) are used as sub models to create pooled datasets (PDS). Cyclical learning rate (CLR) optimizer is used to enhance learning rate of ensemble deep learning models namely LSTM and GRU. In the second phase, meta learner is trained on dataset PDS using four different regression algorithms such as linear regression, polynomial regression, lasso regression and ridge regression to perform the final predictions. Time series data from India, Brazil, and the United States were utilized to forecast the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.

It has gained increasing attention in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, successful modeling and accurate localization for robot in indoor env ironment is still a challenge, where the environment factors are complex and unpredictable, such as signal noise, obstacles and spare fingerprints. Existing studies usually employ data driven and learning based models to capture spatial and temporal features for robot location estimation, modeling dynamics of robot and make robot decision. However, the modeling and localization performance is not satisfied. In this paper, to address above challenges, a novel deep learning framework called multi-faceted deep learning based dynamics modeling and robot localization learning (DMLoc) method is proposed. Specifically, a localization attention module is designed to capture the features from original fingerprints and optimized fingerprints information. Then, a multi-faceted localization module is proposed, which integrates extraction model and optimized model with long short-term memory (LSTM) and gate recurrent unit (GRU). Moreover, a multi-feature fusion layer is designed to fuse the extracted features and generate localization results. Extensive simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed DMLoc.},

However, they have faced opposition from various organizations that argue it is challenging to respond to instances involving unavoidable personal injury. In situations involving deadly collis ions, self-driving cars must make decisions that balance life and death. This paper investigates the ethical and moral decision-making challenges for self-driving cars from an algorithmic perspective. To address this issue, we introduce the accident-prioritized replay mechanism to the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm based on early humanities research. The mechanism quantifies a reward function that takes priority into account. RGB (red, green, blue) images obtained by the camera installed in front of the self-driving cars are fed into the Xception network for training. To evaluate our approach, we compare it to the conventional DQN algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the Rawlsian DQN algorithm has superior stability and interpretability in decision-making. Furthermore, the majority of respondents to our survey accept the final decision made by our algorithm. Our experiment demonstrates that it is possible to incorporate ethical considerations into self-driving car decision-making, providing a solution for rational decision-making in emergency and dilemma circumstances.},

  abstract     = {In recent generations of the digital world medical data in Recommender Systems. Health Care Recommender System (HCRS) analyses the medical data and then predicts the user’s or patient’s illness. Nowadays, healthcare data is used by various users or patients in recommendation systems which are usefu l for everyone. Analysing and predicting medical data provides awareness to users and these data predictions may be enriched using various techniques of RS. Machine learning techniques are used to make sure that health data is reliable and of high quality. In every RS the issues are targeted such as scalability, sparsity and cold start problems. In many social networking applications, these issues are resolved using ML algorithms. However, there is a significant gap between IT systems and medical diagnosis. The fuzzy genetic method is used in HCRS in order to bridge the gap between IT and healthcare applications. Through the use of the mutation and crossover operators, a real-value genetic method is used in this to compute similarity. With the user’s extra personalized information, fuzzy rules are later generated for the database. The Hybrid fuzzy-genetic method, also known as this situation, combines both techniques to improve recommendation quality. Utilizing this method will improve the quality of the recommendation process by discovering the most precise similarity measures among different users. Six factors are subjected to fuzzification, including age, gender, employment, height, weight, and region. Genre-interesting measure weights are then used, including Very Light, Light, Average, Heavy, and Very Heavy. Finally, the evaluation metrics used MAE and RMSE to evaluate the recommendation accuracy which showed the best results in comparison with baseline approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Restricted Boltzman Machine.},

  abstract     = {In the emergency decision-making process, decision-makers usually cannot give rational evaluations, and existing decision-making methods do not adequately consider the risk attitude of decision-makers either. To solve these problems, a combined method based on the prospect theory and the multi-attr ibutive ideal-real comparative analysis (MAIRCA) method is put forward in the picture fuzzy environment. Firstly, the optimal aggregation (OA) model is proposed to obtain the ideal evaluations with the least disagreement among decision-makers. Regarding the evaluations as reference systems, the OA-based prospect theory is put forward, which could calculate the prospect matrix more reasonably. Secondly, considering the prospect matrix and alternative preference, the improved MAIRCA method is proposed, which overcomes the defects of theory and has the better ranking ability. Then, the OA-based prospect theory-MAIRCA method is further put forward to effectively complete the decision-making process with risk attitudes. Finally, an illustrative example of earthquake emergency assessment and a series of comparative experiments are presented. The analyses of results show that the proposed method has great guiding significance in the field of emergency decision-making management.},

  abstract     = {WSNs(Wireless Sensor Networks) has been developed with applications in many domains including agriculture, telecommunication, manufacturing industry, healthcare, and surveillance. More specifically, WSN plays a pivotal role in IoT (Internet of Things). The IoT sensors provide information about the physical phenomena in the deployed fields. As the sensors contain only limited resources, the factors like data processing, power consumption, transmission, and storage capabilities adversely affect the efficiency. Thus, the process of routing is necessary for network longevity. The data from IoT-based sensors is routed to the destination through a multi-hop routing system. The Energy aware Routing is motivated by the nature inspired Fuzzy Butterfly Optimization (E2RFBOA). Further a new data aggregation method is introduced in this article customized for IoT based WSN to acquaint higher crop yield in precision farming. Nevertheless, the scalability becomes a primary concern when deployed in larger and denser networks. This is due to the fact that all nodes in IoT and WSN are mostly alive depending on higher usage of bandwidth and power. The primal aim is to build a novel routing protocol developed for IoT-WSN. Apart from this, an Energy aware Clustered Routing that is motivated by Adaptive Elephant Herding Optimization (E2CR-AEHO) is proposed, which sensors collect data and find a group of Cluster Heads (CHs). In the AEHO Algorithm, the formed CH is rotated depending on power consumption. This also prevents frequent re-clustering; at the same time it can effectively adapt to the changes in network topology. According to the AEHOA, the node population comprises of nodes that can choose its CHs among the other nodes. This algorithm takes into account a number of criteria, including power consumption, residual power of Sensor Nodes (SN), network reliability, and data reliability. The suggested approach can efficiently represent the network environment, allowing the routing algorithm to avoid passing over marked zones. Network-specific performances measures including PDRs (Packet Delivery Ratios), NLs (Network Lifetimes), PLRs (Packet Loss Ratios), and AE2E (Average End To End) delay are used to evaluate simulation outcomes. This proposed framework aggregates IoT, which can gradually reduce the amount of data, hence extending network lifetime.},

  abstract     = {Demand forecasting of auto parts is an essential part of inventory control in the automotive supply chain. Due to non-stationarity, strong randomness, local mutation, and non-linearity in short-term auto parts demand data, and it is difficult to predict accurately. In this regard, this paper propos es a combination prediction model based on EEMD-CNN-BiLSTM-attention. First, the model uses the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method to decompose the original data into a series of eigenmode functions and a residual item to extract more feature information. And then uses the CNN-BiLSTM-attention model to analyze each mode separately. The components are predicted, and the prediction results are summed to obtain the final prediction result. The attention mechanism is introduced to automatically assign corresponding weights to the BiLSTM hidden layer states to distinguish the importance of different time load sequences, which can effectively reduce the loss of historical information and highlight the input of critical historical time points. Finally, the final auto parts demand prediction results are output through the fully connected layer. Then, we conduct an experimental analysis of the collected short-term demand data for auto parts. Finally, the experimental results show that the prediction model proposed in this paper has more minor errors, higher prediction accuracy, and the model prediction performance is better than the other nine comparison models, thus verifying the EEMD-CNN-BiLSTM-attention model for short-term parts demand forecasting effectiveness.},

With the development of IoT devices, securing device-to-device communication has attracted more and more attention and we need to ensure the privacy and security of data amongst these IoT devices. User authentication has emerged as a major security concern while connecting IoT devices and the cloud.

Therefore, the accurate and automatic identification of pests is crucial for the agricultural industry. However, traditional methods of pest classification are limited, as they face diffi culties in identifying pests with subtle differences and dealing with sample imbalances. To address these issues, we propose a pest classification model based on data enhancement and multi-feature learning. The model utilizes Mobile Inverted Residual Bottleneck Convolutional Block (MBConv) modules for multi-feature learning, enabling it to learn diverse and rich features of pests. To improve the model’s ability to capture fine-grained details and address sample imbalances, data enhancement techniques such as random mixing of pictures and mixing after region clipping are used to augment the training data. Our model demonstrated excellent performance not only on the large-scale pest classification IP102 dataset but also on smaller pest datasets.},

Thes e challenging tasks are considered as a motivation of this research and the Multi-Objective - Trust Aware Average Inertia Weighted Cat Swarm Optimization (MO-TAIWCSO) is proposed for achieving secure reliable transmission over the WSN. Due to an effective velocity update of searching process, the AIWCSO is selected for discovering an optimal solutions. The developed MO-TAIWCSO is optimized by using the trust, energy ratio, communication cost, and degree of SCH. This MO-TAIWCSO performs optimal Secure Cluster Head (SCH) and secure path discovery for the secure transmission of data under malicious attacks. The main objective of this MO-TAIWCSO is to improve the data delivery while minimizing the energy usage of the nodes. The performance of the MO-TAIWCSO method is analyzed by using the throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), energy consumption, network lifetime, Normalized Routing Load (NRL) and End to end delay (EED). The existing researches namely ETOR and TBSEER are used to evaluate the MO-TAIWCSO. The PDR of MO-TAIWCSO for 100 nodes is 99.97%, which is high when compared to the ETOR and TBSEER.},

This big data need some intelligent technique to analyze and classify hear t disease from the considerable volume of data; it is a challenging task. Many deep learning techniques are introduced earlier for heart disease diagnosis in the literature study. Still, all other classification techniques failed to achieve the minimum loss in heart disease classification with the highest accuracy and faster performance. This research introduces a new classification approach to overcome these issues: elephant herding optimizer turned restricted Boltzmann machine EHO-RBM network. The optimizer is used in this network to optimize the number of neuron utilization during the learning process by updating the network weight without compromising the loss. The previous research proves that the optimizer is performed well in reaching global minima efficiently. Therefore, the new classifier incorporates the optimizers instead of the classical stochastic gradient descent optimizer to improve the network performance by minimizing the global minima faster with less loss in predicting heart disease. The simulation result of the new heart disease classification framework shows that the elephant herding optimizer-trained classification model has reduced the loss rate and maximized the accuracy rate up to 0.0027 then the comparison method. As a result, the new classifier has obtained a maximum accuracy of up to 99.96% .},

We regard the novel Aczel Alsina aggregation operators (AOs) as the most addition to fuzzy mathematics that can deal with uncertainties significantly. We suggest a few PF AOs based on Aczel Alsina t-norm and t-conorm, including the PF-prioritized Aczel Alsina averaging (PFPAAA) and PF-prioritized Aczel Alsina geometric (PFPAAG) operators. It is proven that these AOs fulfil the aggregation criteria by investigating the properties of monotonicity, boundedness, and idempotency. The weights for prioritization are derived from the knowledge of experts, and the proposed operators can capture the phenomenon of prioritization among the aggregated arguments. The proposed AOs are then applied to assess fire extinguishers using a MAGDM technique. The importance of PFPAAA and PFPAAG operators is verified by comparing the proposed AOs with other well-known AOs.},

In this setting, businesses start to plan how they will use IoT technology. But some critical factors can prevent the successful deployment of IoT, and businesses must get beyond these cr itical factors if they want to do so. The literature review, system literature review, and Delphi technique are used to identify 15 critical factors. These critical factors are then divided into four categories: organization, technology, process, and environment. The PFN-weighted power harmonic operator is proposed with the aim of more effectively obtaining assessment data from experts and lessening the inaccuracy of outcomes caused by information loss. The best and worst method (BWM) is used to determine the ideal weight of critical factors. Results indicate that the primary critical factors to the effective adoption of the Internet of Things are talent, resource limitations, integration complexity, technical operations, equipment power consumption, technical dependability, and data governance. This research will benefit corporate managers in recognizing the significance of the effective deployment of the Internet of Things, identifying major critical factors to this achievement, and making decisions to remove these factors.

Since the new curriculum reform, the art curriculum has been implemented for nearly twen ty years, and it has made great breakthroughs and gains. However, at the same time, there are many problems in the process of implementing the art curriculum. The art teaching effectiveness evaluation of primary schools is viewed as the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). In this paper, the triangular fuzzy neutrosophic number cross-entropy (TFNN-CE) method is designed with help of cross-entropy and triangular fuzzy neutrosophic sets (TFNSs). Furthermore, Then, TFNN-CE method is built to solve the MADM. Finally, a numerical example for art teaching effectiveness evaluation of primary schools is given and some comparisons are conducted to r illustrate advantages of the designed method.},

  abstract     = {Scientific research management is an important component of university management and an important guarantee for the sustainable operation of universities. A mature scientific research management system is a sharp tool to promote the discipline construction and comprehensive strength improvement of universities. Therefore, colleges and universities should actively explore new concepts, models, and mechanisms for scientific research management while continuously improving their own educational quality. Based on the analysis of the current situation of university scientific research management in China, it is of great significance to explore effective ways to improve the quality of university scientific research management in the new era. The quality evaluation of higher education scientific research management in entrepreneurship undergraduate colleges is a classical MAGDM problems. Recently, the TODIM and VIKOR method has been used to cope with MAGDM issues. The interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets (IVPFSs) are used as a tool for characterizing uncertain information during the quality evaluation of higher education scientific research management in entrepreneurship undergraduate colleges. In this manuscript, the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM-VIKOR (IVPF-TODIM-VIKOR) method is built to solve the MAGDM under IVPFSs. In the end, a numerical case study for quality evaluation of higher education scientific research management in entrepreneurship undergraduate colleges is given to validate the proposed method.},

The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its progressive development have promised the way for the development of IoT-enabled healthcare with impressive data processing and big data storage capabilities. Intelligent medical healthcare intends to offer a framework to remotely monitor users’ health-related data as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) develops. Because they are stored on a cloud server, the data are still susceptible to manipulation and privacy breaches. The Keras Xception Deep Learning System (KX-DLS) with Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) scheme is a revolutionary IoT-based deep learning intelligent privacy-preserving system that is advantageous for digital healthcare and its functionalities to handle security-related challenges. The dataset is being used to pre-train the system, and users’ personal information is kept separate in a secure location. Without knowing any personal information about the users, we analyse health-related data stored in the cloud and build a sophisticated security framework based on a deep learning model. With the most extensive collection of security features, our framework for learning intelligent privacy preservation optimizes the system to guarantee high data integrity and few privacy breaches. As a result, it may be useful in situations where users employ mobile devices with limited resources to engage a healthcare cloud system for extensive virtual health services, and the results of this research show that it has been a better-secured model in comparison with state-of-the-art previous techniques.},

There are few researches on applicant credit risk assessment due to not easy to obtain of vehicle leasing data. Further, the difficulty in vehicle leasing risk assessment is increased due to class imbalance problems in vehicle leasing data. In order to address such issue, a research on credit risk assessment in vehicle leasing industry was conducted in this study. The great disparity in the ratio of high risk and low risk data was addressed by applying synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). Then, classification effect of risk assessment model was improved by applying logistic regression in a two-phase manner. In the section of empirical analysis, the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach proposed in this study was validated by using data of actual vehicle leasing application cases provided by a financial institution in Taiwan. It is found that the proposed approach provided a simple yet effective way to build a credit risk assessment model for companies that provide vehicle leasing.},

The obtained feature set was used as input for various machine learning algorithms, and their performance was compared. Additionally, statistical features were calculated using the Hilbert Transform and compared to the proposed method. The study found that when the TKEO features were used as input for the classifier in the acoustic signal, the CART model achieved the highest accuracy of 99.62% compared to the raw and Hilbert transform signal features. In the case of vibration signals, the TKEO signal feature outperformed the raw signal feature with 100% accuracy for all artificial intelligence models.

  abstract     = {The vast usage of concrete made it the second most used material after water. This volume of concrete consumes an enormous number of natural sources and chronically enhances environmental pollution by CO2 emission. Cementitious supplementary materials such as fly ash and micro silica help decrease the usage of cohesive materials in the concrete and improve concrete’s properties, specifically compressive strength. In addition, due to being the by-product materials of other industries, applying these materials contribute to the decline of environmental pollution. On the other hand, fly ash and micro silica decrease the ratio of water to cement and increase the compressive strength (CS) of concrete. High-Performance Concrete (HPC) is one of the types of concrete used in dams, bridges, etc. In order to achieve the compressive strength of HPC, it is necessary to conduct laboratory tests, which are not economical in terms of time and cost. For this reason, in the present study, the prediction of the CS of the mentioned concrete can be done based on soft-based and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, various mixed designs of HPC, such as fly ash and silica fume coupled with different percentages of plasticizers, are considered the base dataset for developing the prediction models. Neural network-based model hybridized with antlion optimization algorithm and biography-based optimization algorithm developed for compressive strength estimation. The result showed that the AMLP-I model with R2 and RMSE values of 0.9879 and 1.9003 accurately predicted compressive strength and can be referred to as the most qualitative prediction model compared to the BMLP model.},

It is essential to diagnose chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and kidney diseases in the early stage. In recent times, ensembled-based approaches giving effective predictive performance than individual classifiers and gained attention in assisting doctors with early diagnosis. But one of the challenges in these approaches is dealing with class-imbalanced data and improper configuration of ensemble classifiers with optimized parameters. In this paper, a novel 3-level stacking approach with ADASYN oversampling technique with PSO Optimized SVM meta-model (Stacked-ADASYN-PSO) is proposed. Our proposed Stacked-ADASYN-PSO model uses base models such as Logistic regression(LR), K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in layer-0. In layer-1 three meta classifiers namely LR, KNN, and Bagging DT are used. In layer-2 PSO optimized SVM used as the final meta-model to combine the previous layer predictions. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed model It is tested on five benchmark disease datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. These results are compared with state-of-the-art ensemble models and non-ensemble models. Results demonstrated that the proposed model performance is superior in terms of AUC, accuracy, specificity, and precision. We have performed statistical analysis using paired T-tests with a 95% confidence level and our proposed stacking model is significantly differs when compared to base classifiers.},

  abstract     = {This paper uses two optimizers (Improved Gray Wolf Optimizer (I_GWO) and Dragonfly Optimization Algorithm (DA)) for the sensitivity and robustness of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely radial basis functions (RBFs). The purpose is to evaluate and analyze the predictive strength of high -performance concrete (HPC). 170 samples were collected for this purpose. This includes eight input parameters, cement, silica fume, fly ash, water, coarse aggregate, total aggregate, high water reducing agent, concrete age, and one output parameter, the compressive strength, to produce Increase learning and validation data sets. The proposed AI model was validated against several standard criteria: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), scatter index (SI), RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR), and coefficient of persistence (CP), n10_index. Many runs were performed to analyze the sensitivity and robustness of the model. The results show that I_GWO using RBF performs better than DA. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis indicated that cement content and HPC test age are the most essential and sensitive factors for predicting the compressive strength of HPC, according to the evaluations performed on the models, it was seen that the IGWO_RBF model provided better results compared to other models and can be introduced as the practical model for the prediction of HPC’s CS. In conclusion, this study can help to select appropriate AI models and suitable input parameters to accurately and quickly estimate the compressive strength of HPC.},

  abstract     = {Pedagogic systems are gaining traction in the provision of training, learning, and continuing professional development (often required to maintain professional qualifications). An essential element in pedagogic systems is the matching of teachers (mentors) and students (mentees). In this paper we present an intelligent context-aware learning system based on profile criteria developed using big data analytic solutions. The proposed system is designed to provide systematic support for mentors based on student profiles. The goal of the proposed system is to match the mentor profiles with the type of pedagogic system, the student profile, the student requirements, and the student’s goals and expectations. The proposed system is predicated on the use of fuzzy logic definitions with a maximal length matching algorithm using expert knowledge. The proposed system implements a mentor (teacher) and mentee (student) matching algorithm based on their profile criteria. The proposed system has been successfully tested by matching mentor and mentee profiles and preferences. Experimental results show that the proposed system can access multi-factorial mentor and mentee profiles, effectively match suitable mentors (teachers) with appropriate mentees (students), and meet the mentee expectations.},

In this study, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) problem for coastal PV system is addressed and a novel MPPT methodology based on deep neural network (DNN) integrated with the corrosion evaluation index (CE-index) and dynamic training-sample (DTS) mechanism is developed. To be specific, the detailed effect of corrosion and aging for the PV modules installed in coastal areas is comprehensively analysed, and a composite indicator for evaluating the PV parameter drift, namely CE-index, is proposed. Then, a novel DNN-based offline MPPT methodology for the large-scale coastal PV system is developed, in which the DTS mechanism is also introduced for overcoming the effect caused by PV module corrosion and aging phenomenon. Finally, the optimal length of DTS for different degrees of CE-index is comprehensively verified by case studies. Experimental result shows that the developed DNN-based MPPT methodology can accurately forecast the maximum power point (MPP) voltage for large-scale coastal PV-system with robust performance, and cooperation of the developed DTS-mechanism and CE-index corrosion evaluation strategy can also effectively overcome the disturbance caused by the harsh oceanic environment.},

  abstract     = {The method for document image classification presented in this paper mainly focuses on six different Malayalam palm leaf manuscripts categories. The proposed approach consists of three phases: dataset analysis, building a bag of words repository followed by recognition and classification using a voting approach. The palm leaf manuscripts are initially subject to pre-processing and subjective analysis techniques to create a bag of words repository during the dataset analysis phase. Next, the textual components from the manuscripts are extracted for recognition using Tesseract 4 OCR with default and self-adapted training sets and a deep-learning algorithm. The Bag of Words approach is used in the third phase to categorize the palm leaf manuscripts based on textual components recognized by OCR using a voting process. Experimental analysis was done to analyze the proposed approach with and without the voting techniques, varying the size of the Bag of Words with default/self-adapted training datasets using Tesseract OCR and a deep learning model. Experimental analysis proves that the proposed approach works equally well with/ without voting with a bag of words technique using Tesseract OCR. It is noticed that, for document classification, an overall accuracy of 83% without voting and 84.5% with voting is achieved with an F-score of 0.90 in both cases using Teserract OCR. Overall, the proposed approach proves to be high generalizable based on trial wise experiments with Bag of Words, offering a reliable way for classifying deteriorated Malayalam handwritten palm manuscripts.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence image processing has been of interest to research investigators in tumor identification and determination. Magnetic resonance imaging for clinical detection is the technique of choice for identifying tumors because of its advantages such as accurate localization with tomography in any orientation. Nevertheless, owing to the complexity of the images and the heterogeneity of the tumors, existing methodologies have insufficient field of view and require expensive computations to capture semantic information in the view, rendering them lacking in universality of application. Consequently, this thesis developed a medical image segmentation algorithm based on global field of view attention network (GVANet). It focuses on replacing the original convolution with a transformer structure and views in a larger field-of-view domain to build a global view at each layer, which captures the refined pixel information and category information in the region of interest with fewer parameters so as to address the defective tumor edge segmentation problem. The dissertation exploits the pixel-level information of the input image, the category information of the tumor region and the normal tissue region to segment the MRI image and assign weights to the pixel representatives. This medical image recognition algorithm enables to undertake the ambiguous tumor edge segmentation task with low computational complexity and to maximize the segmentation accuracy and model property. Nearly four thousand MRI images from the Monash University Research Center for Artificial Intelligence were applied for the experiments. The outcome indicates that the approach obtains outstanding classification capability on the data set. Both the mask (IoU) and DSC quality were improved by 7.6% and 6.3% over the strong baseline.},

  abstract     = {In comparison to intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) and Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS), the Fermatean Fuzzy Set (FFS) is more efficacious in dealing ambiguous and imprecise data when making decisions. In this paper, we propose unique operations on Fermatean fuzzy information based on prioritized attributes, as well as Einstein’s operations based on adjusting the priority of characteristics in the Fermatean fuzzy environment. We use Einstein’s operations with prioritized attributes to propose new operations on Fermatean fuzzy numbers (FFNs), and then introduce basic aspects of these operations. Motivated by Einstein operations on FFNs, we develop Fermatean fuzzy Einstein prioritized arithmetic and geometric aggregation operators (AOs). In the first place, the concepts of a Fermatean fuzzy Einstein prioritized average (FFEPA), Fermatean fuzzy Einstein prioritized weighted average (FFEPWA), and Fermatean fuzzy Einstein prioritized ordered weighted average (FFEPOWA)-operators are introduced. Then, Fermatean fuzzy Einstein prioritized geometric (FFEPG) operator, Fermatean fuzzy Einstein prioritized weighted geometric (FFEPWG) operator, Fermatean fuzzy Einstein prioritized ordered weighted geometric (FFEPOWG) operator, and Fermatean fuzzy Einstein hybrid geometric (FFEHG) operator are given. We also go through some of the key characteristics of these operators. Moreover, using these operators, we establish algorithm for addressing a multiple attribute decision-making issue using Fermatean fuzzy data and attribute prioritizing. The case of university faculty selection is taken as a scenario to analyze and demonstrate the applicability of our suggested model. In addition, a comparison of the proposed and current operators is conducted, and the impact of attribute priority on the ranking order of alternatives is explored.},

The ability of service suppliers to deal with uncertainty is critical. Considering complex uncertainty, evaluating the service suppliers of sports events is reasonable. This study proposes a new framework for selecting sports suppliers, which combines a hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) and Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution (MARCOS) method. MARCOS is based on determining the reference values of alternatives about the ideal and is a comprehensively rational and reasonable application methodology. HFS has the advantage of expressing fuzzy and hesitant evaluation information, which is seldom used in the MARCOS framework. A case study of a sports supplier selection for the 2022 China National Youth U Series Floorball Championship is given to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed approach. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed to verify the proposed methodology’s stability and effectiveness.},

Taking the experimental prototype vehicle driven by four-wheel hub motor as the research object, an eight-degree-of-freedom dynamic simulation model of the whole vehicle is established. Compared with the traditional PID controller, the braking time is shortened by 0.2 s and the braking distance is shortened by 2.3 m, which shows the feasibility of the designed controller.

Many studies have found a high correlation between the occurrence of cholera and environmental issues such as geographical location and climate c hange. Developing a cholera forecasting model might be possible if a relationship exists between the cholera epidemic and meteorological elements. Given the auto-regressive character of cholera as well as its seasonal patterns, a seasonal-auto-regressive-integrated-moving-average (SARIMA) model was utilized for time-series study from 2017 to 2022 cholera datasets obtained from the NCDC. Cholera incidence correlates positively to humidity, precipitation, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature with r = 0.1045, r = 0.0175, r = 0.0666, and r = 0.0182 respectively. Improving a SARIMA model, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Long short-term memory (LSTM) with the k-means clustering and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for feature selection, the improved model is known as MODIFIED SARIMA Outperforms the LSTM, ARIMA, and SARIMA and also outperformed both the modified LSTM and ARIMA with an RSS = 0.502 and an accuracy = 97%.},

  abstract     = {The picture fuzzy set (PFS) is a more frequent platform for describing the degree of positive, neutral, and negative membership functions that generalizes the concept of fuzzy sets (FSs) and intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). Neutrality is a crucial component of PFS, and the score function plays a c rucial role in ranking the alternatives in decision-making situations. In the decision-making process, some researchers concentrate on the various aggregation operators’ development while ignoring the development of score functions. This factor causes several errors in the existing score function. If there are two separate picture fuzzy numbers (PFNs), there should be two different scores or accuracy values. Some researchers failed to rank the alternatives when the score and accuracy values for various PFNs were equal. To overcome the shortcomings, we proposed the perfect score function in this paper for ranking PFNs and introduced strong and weak PFSs. The shortcoming of the existing score function in PFNs has been highlighted in this paper.

  abstract     = {With the continuous extension and deepening of college education reform, the research on the future employment of college students and the evaluation of employment quality has become a major focus topic. The traditional evaluation system for the employment quality of college graduates is relatively outdated and unitary, lacking a vision of the future development status of college graduates, as well as an effective understanding and mastery of the overall feedback and evaluation of the entire employment market for college graduates. Moreover, most colleges and universities mainly focus on the level of competence that college graduates should achieve five years after graduation from college in terms of talent cultivation goals, The lack of specific evaluation work for long-term employment tracking of graduates has resulted in universities being unable to grasp and understand the degree of fit and matching between the comprehensive abilities of university graduates and the future employment market, and thus unable to provide effective feedback and summary of talent cultivation and innovation strategies. Therefore, it is imperative to comprehensively innovate the employment quality evaluation system and methods for college graduates. The employment quality evaluation of college graduates is a classical multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems. Recently, the TODIM and VIKOR method has been used to cope with MAGDM issues. The probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) are used as a tool for characterizing uncertain information during the employment quality evaluation of college graduates. In this manuscript, the probabilistic linguistic TODIM-VIKOR (PL-TODIM-VIKOR) method is built to solve the MAGDM under PLTSs. In the end, a numerical case study for employment quality evaluation of college graduates is given to validate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Early detection and classification of breast cancer can be facilitated to initiate the most effective treatment. As the second leading cause of death among women, early breast cancer screening is essential for reducing mortality rates. In this context, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the ideal candidate for increasing the rate of identification and classification of tumours with efficiency, particularly in medical imaging. This research proposes a hybridised CNN with the Orca Predation Optimization Algorithm (OPOA) as a novel classification model for the effective detection of abnormalities in breast cancer diagnosis. Specifically, the OPOA technique is used to determine the optimal hyperparameter values for the hybrid CNN architecture being deployed. As the pretrained CNN model, the suggested model utilizeds a ResNet50 residual network. It merged OPOA with the ResNet50 residual network to construct the OPOA-ResNet-50 Architecture. The experimental validation of the proposed OPOA-ResNet-50 model utilising the datasets of curated breast imaging subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) shown improved classification accuracy of 99.04%, specificity of 98.56%, and sensitivity of 97.78% in comparison to the baseline techniques. The results also revealed that the proposed under mammographic image analysis society (MIAS) OPOA-ResNet-50 model demonstrated superior classification accuracy of 98.64%, specificity of 98.79%, and sensitivity of 98.82% compared to the benchmarked methods. The adopted OPOA algorithm is determined to achieve more optimal hyperparameter values for the ResNet50 architecture than the comparative algorithms Improved Marine Predator Optimization Algorithm (IMPOA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Harris hawk’s optimization (HHO), and gravitational search algorithm (GSA).},

  abstract     = {The failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is an effective tool to analyze risks and potential effects of complex systems, and it is one of the most widely used risk analysis methods for complex systems as there often exists various factors that could affect the operation of the complex systems. Conventional FMEA methods have been limited to using crisp values to represent the assessments, which has been criticized for having many deficiencies. Marine diesel fuel injection system is an important part of marine diesel engine, and its failure could directly affect the performance of the marine diesel engine and even impact the safe operation of the ship. However, little attention has been paid to the FMEA of the marine diesel fuel injection system. To this end, this paper presents a novel FMEA method based on the best-worst method (BWM) and TOPSIS method with probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS). Firstly, the PLTS is used to represent the uncertain and linguistic judgments of experts. Then, the BWM is extended with PLTS to determine the weights of different elements for FMEA, and the TOPSIS is extended with PLTS to assess and rank different failure modes. Finally, a case study on marine diesel fuel injection is presented, and the most critical failures are identified for improvement measures. The results show that the proposed method could help managers and engineerings identify the most important failure modes for marine diesel fuel injection system.},

Automatic Sign Language Recognition (ASLR) translates sign language gestures into text and spoken words. Several researchers are focusing either on manual gestures or non-manual gestures separately; a rare focus is on concurrent recognition of manual and non-manual gestures. Facial expression and other body movements can improve the accuracy rate, as well as enhance signs’ exact meaning. The current paper proposes a Multimodal –Sign Language Recognition (MM-SLR) framework to recognize non-manual features based on facial expressions along with manual gestures in Spatio temporal domain representing hand movements in ASLR. Our proposed architecture has three modules, first, a modified architecture of YOLOv5 is defined to extract faces and hands from videos as two Regions of Interest. Second, refined C3D architecture is used to extract features from the hand region and the face region, further, feature concatenation of both modalities is applied. Lastly, LSTM network is used to get spatial-temporal descriptors and attention-based sequential modules for gesture classification. To validate the proposed framework we used three publically available datasets RWTH-PHONIX-WEATHER-2014T, SILFA and PkSLMNM. Experimental results show that the above-mentioned MM-SLR framework outperformed on all datasets.},

Firstly, LDA model and snowNLP tools extract consumer perception attributes and their emotional inclination. After that, FCM and improved Bonferroni mean (BM) operator are used to accurately analyze the interrelationships between different attributes and comprehensively evaluate the brand authenticity of different enterprises under the same characteristic agricultural product. Finally, the model comparison experiment results show that the model proposed can reflect the “attribute importance” and “emotional inclination” of the e-commerce brand authenticity perception of territorial characteristic agricultural products. Among them, “platform logistics” and “product benefits” are essential in promoting the authenticity of brand-consumer relationships. Meanwhile, “e-commerce aftersales service” is closely related to the positive evaluation of “platform logistics” and “product benefits.” This study expands the methodical approach to brand authenticity perception research; it provides a valuable reference for developing modern fine granularity management of e-commerce brand authenticity for characteristic agricultural products.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous deepening of higher education management reform, university leaders have realized that the merger of universities, annual expansion of enrollment, and expansion of educational scale have broadened the development space for universities. At the same time, many management problems have also emerged, and education management problems are particularly prominent, such as some decisions, plans, instructions, etc. of the school level education management department not being well implemented in various departments, and the channels for the school level education management department to understand the true situation of each department are not smooth. Therefore, deepening reform provides a good opportunity for universities to strengthen management and streamline relationships. Teaching and scientific research must be upgraded, and the quality of teaching management must be improved. Establishing an education management quality evaluation system and emphasizing the quality of education management work are the key. The higher education management quality evaluation is affirmed as multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM). Interval-valued neutrosophic sets (IVNSs) have been widely used and researched in MCGDM. The interval-valued neutrosophic sets (IVNSs) could depict the uncertain information within the higher education management quality evaluation. The purpose of this article is to proposed a new improved grey relation analysis (GRA) method based on prospect theory (PT-GRA) to solve the MCGDM under IVNSs. At the end of this paper, an example for higher education management quality evaluation is illustrated through the built method and the comparison. Thus, the main contribution of this study is: (1) the PT-GRA method is used to deal with the MCGDM problems under IVNSs; (2) the weight information is obtained through entropy method; (3) an empirical example for higher education management quality evaluation has been given. (4) some comparative algorithms are given to show the rationality of PT-GRA method with IVNSs.},

For the input sentence, the model fuses the spacial and sequential character representation using autoencoder to get the local character representation; extracts the global character representation according to the corresponding domain words; integrates the local and global representation through gating mechanism to obtain the enhanced character representation, which has better ability to perceive medical entities. Finally, the model sent the enhanced character representation to the Bi-LSTM and CRF layers for context encoding and tags decoding respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a significant improvement over the best baseline, increasing the F1 values by 1.04% and 0.62% on the IMCS21 and CMeEE datasets, respectively. In addition, we verify the effectiveness of each component of our model by ablation experiments.},

In this study, how the engines should be selected in the design of a rotary wing UAV system is considered a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This MCDM problem has not yet been encountered in the literature. Therefore, a hybrid MCDM approach based on the fuzzy Best Worst Method (BWM) and Multi Attributive Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis (MAIRCA) is proposed to solve this problem. In the proposed approach, the decision makers determine 6 criteria (KV value, thrust, weight, efficiency, battery, electronic speed controller (ESC)) and 6 different engine ( A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 , A 5 , A 6 ) alternatives. The fuzzy BWM was used to calculate the weights of criteria, while the MAIRCA was used for the selection of alternatives. According to the results obtained, the three most effective criteria were thrust, KV value, and weight, respectively. The three best engine options were found as A 3 , A 1 , and A 6 . Moreover, sensitivity analysis was performed to observe the change in the ranking of alternatives according to different weights of criteria. MABAC, MARCOS, and COPRAS methods were used to compare the alternative rankings found with the MAIRCA.},

  abstract     = {Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) caters to an essential role in verifying the different categories of circuits ranging from small-scale chips to complex system-on-chip architectures. Constrained random simulations are an indispensable part of UVM and are often used for design verification. However, the effort and time spent manually updating and analyzing the design input constraints result in high time complexity, which typically impacts the coverage goal and fault verification ratio. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel hybrid optimized verification framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for automatically optimizing the input constraints, accelerating faster verification with a high coverage ratio. The proposed algorithm uses reinforcement learning to generate all possible vector sequences needed for testing the target devices and corresponding outputs of the target devices and potential design errors. Furthermore, the framework intends to use high-speed deep-feedforward neural networks to automate and optimize the constraints during runtime. The proposed framework was developed using Python interfaced with the TCL environment. Extensive experimentation was carried out using several circuits, including multi-core designs, and performance parameters such as coverage accuracy, speed, and computational complexity were calculated and analyzed. The experiment demonstrated the proposed framework remarkable results, showing its superior performance in faster coverage and fewer misclassification errors. Furthermore, the proposed framework is compared with existing verification frameworks and other classical learning models. Good results demonstrate that the proposed framework increases the 4.5x speed for verifying multi-core designs and the 99% accuracy of detection and coverage.},

  abstract     = {The Darknet is a section of the internet that is encrypted and untraceable, making it a popular location for illicit and illegal activities. However, the anonymity and encryption provided by the network also make identifying and classifying network traffic significantly more difficult. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in methods used for classifying darknet network traffic. The authors explored various techniques and methods used to classify traffic, along with the challenges and limitations faced by researchers and practitioners in this field. The study found that current methods for traffic classification in the Darknet have an average classification error rate of around 20%, due to the high level of anonymity and encryption present in the Darknet, which makes it difficult to extract features for classification. The authors analysed several quantitative values, including accuracy rates ranging from 60% to 97%, simplicity of execution ranging from 1 to 9 steps, real-time implementation ranging from less than 1 second to over 60 seconds, unknown traffic identification ranging from 30% to 95%, encrypted traffic classification ranging from 30% to 95%, and time and space complexity ranging from O(1) to O(2 n ). The study examined various approaches used to classify traffic in the Darknet, including machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid methods. The authors found that deep learning algorithms were effective in accurately classifying traffic on the Darknet, but the lack of labelled data and the dynamic nature of the Darknet limited their use. Despite these challenges, the study concluded that proper traffic classification is crucial for identifying malicious activity and improving the security of the Darknet. Overall, the study suggests that, although significant challenges remain, there is potential for further development and improvement of network traffic classification in the Darknet.},

  abstract     = {Evaluating the performance of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems is a challenging and intricate task, even for experts in the field. The literature presents a vast array of CBIR systems, each applied to various image databases. Traditionally, automatic metrics employed for CBIR evaluation have been borrowed from the Text Retrieval (TR) domain, primarily precision and recall metrics. However, this paper introduces a novel quantitative metric specifically designed to address the unique characteristics of CBIR. The proposed metric revolves around the concept of grouping relevant images and utilizes the entropy of the retrieved relevant images. Grouping together relevant images holds great value from a user perspective, as it enables more coherent and meaningful results. Consequently, the metric effectively captures and incorporates the grouping of the most relevant outcomes, making it highly advantageous for CBIR evaluation. Additionally, the proposed CBIR metric excels in differentiating between results that might appear similar when assessed using other metrics. It exhibits a superior ability to discern subtle distinctions among retrieval outcomes. This enhanced discriminatory power is a significant advantage of the proposed metric. Furthermore, the proposed performance metric is designed to be straightforward to comprehend and implement. Its simplicity and ease of use contribute to its practicality for researchers and practitioners in the field of CBIR. To validate the effectiveness of our metric, we conducted a comprehensive comparative study involving prominent and well-established CBIR evaluation metrics. The results of this study demonstrate that our proposed metric exhibits robust discrimination power, outperforming existing metrics in accurately evaluating CBIR system performance.},

  abstract     = {Image dehazing is a revolutionary technique for restoring images with hazy or foggy landscapes, that has gotten a lot of focus in recent years since it gained importance in a surveillance system. However, the image processing by the traditional defogging algorithm has difficulties in integrating th e depth of image detail and the color of the image. Therefore, in this paper, a novel framework based on wavelet decomposition and optimized gamma correction is proposed for efficaciously retrieving the fog-free image. The foggy image is first divided into low and high frequency sub-images using SWT (Stationary Wavelet Transform), which has the advantages of preserving temporal features so that information loss can be stopped. Then the low frequency and high frequency images are processed with defogging and denoising modules to remove fog and noise respectively. The DOGC (Dragonfly optimal Gamma Correction) algorithm in dehazing module dynamically enhanced the color detail information without human intervention so that observed scene contrast and visibility are well preserved. Lastly, fog-free image is reconstructed from sub-enhanced images. The experimental findings show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative assessment criteria using the established dataset. Furthermore, the proposed method efficiently removes fog while preserving the naturalness of fog images.},

  abstract     = {In India, around 7 million people depend on fishing for their livelihoods. They are assisted with a reliable and fast brief forecast for the areas of fish aggregations. Habitat mapping is critical in supporting strategic choices on fish usage and protection. In conjunction with techniques for machine learning, remote control has made comprehensive fish mapping on relevant scales possible. In machine learning, supervised algorithms are utilized to make forecasts from datasets, when data is accessible without relating output factors. In this research work, Ocean Surface Temperature (OST) and Satellite derived Chlorophyl material are the basic inputs to generating the information of Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ). The 16 features and additional financial derivative features are used for accurate future prediction of PFZ. The unwanted and missing data are removed using effective pre-processing techniques. Among the various methods available for forecasting nonlinear phenomena, the Neural Network is the best and the efficient method to get a forecast. Therefore, the Function Fitting Neural Network (FFNN) technique is mainly used to predicting the Integrated Potential Fishing Zone (IPFZ). The practical analyses are performed by analysing the 80% -20%, 60% -40% and future data in terms of various parameters. From the results, it is proved that the suggested FFNN achieved 90% of accuracy, where the existing neural network achieved 86% of accuracy by implementing with financial derivative features for the 80% -20% of available dataset.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of manufacturing industry, the application range of NC machining technology has been further expanded. The contour accuracy is strongly related to the NC machining quality as a key machine tool performance indicator. Its application efficiency is plainly low as the majority of offline compensation-based contour accuracy adjustments rely heavily on manual experience. Moreover, the isolated research on automatic error compensation and its combination with algorithms does not start with the characteristics of contour accuracy in data processing. Therefore, based on the advantages of strong the robustness of the fuzzy algorithm and the high effectiveness of parameter adjustment, an automatic compensation method for NC machining contour error based on fuzzy control is proposed. The contour error prediction model is designed according to the machining path, and then the automatic compensation strategy for contour error under fuzzy control is designed based on the feed speed. The results showed that under this method, the contour error can reach a maximum of 0.06 and a minimum of 0.025, which was 0.015 lower than the minimum contour error of genetic algorithm. This indicated that the method greatly reduced the CNC machining contour error and improved the contour accuracy, as well as reducing the time cost of contour error compensation, improving the efficiency of contour error compensation, and realizing the automation of error compensation control capability. This is helpful for advancing CNC machining automation technology and supporting the intelligent development of machinery manufacturing.},

In the present study, we investigated identifying moldy cores using near-infrared transmittance spectra. First, input spectral features selected by noise adjusted principal component analysis (NA PCA) for back propagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) was used to reduce the dimensions of the original data. Then, four factors and five levels uniform design of the input nodes, training functions, transfer layer functions and output layer functions for NAPCA-BP ANN optimization is proposed. And the original data were input into NAPCA-BP ANN to obtain the recognition accuracy and NAPCA-support vector machine (SVM) was as a comparative recognition model. The results showed that through the uniform design-based NAPCA-BP ANN optimization, the NAPCA method had higher identification accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, than either full spectrum or principal component analysis. Being assessed by different ratio of model test, functions in the hidden layer and output layer of NAPCA-BP ANN, the proposed method achieved the best accuracy to 98.03%. The accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score based on NAPCA-BP ANN were 3.92%, 2.86%, 2.78% and 2.82% higher than those based on NAPCA-SVM, respectively.

Previous object detection models have mainly focused on general scenarios. However, existing object detection models have mainly fo cused on general scenarios, while images captured by UAVs in vast ocean scenarios often contain numerous small objects that significantly degrade the performance of the original models. To address this challenge, we propose a model that can automatically detect objects in images captured by UAVs during maritime search and rescue missions. Our approach involves designing a new detection head with higher resolution feature maps and more comprehensive feature information to improve the detection of small objects. Additionally, we integrate Swin Transformer blocks into the small object detection head, which can improve the model’s ability to obtain abundant contextual information and thus improves the model’s ability to detect small objects. Moreover, we fuse the Convolutional Block Attention Model into the small object detection head to help the model focus on important features. Finally, we adopt a model ensemble strategy to further improve the mean average precision (mAP). Our proposed model achieves a 4.05% improvement in mAP compared to the baseline model. Furthermore, our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model on the SeaDronesSee dataset in terms of fewer parameters, lower training costs, and higher mAP.},

These IDS must be compatible with the characteristics of MANETs and competent in discovering the biggest number of potential security threats. In this work, a specialized dataset for MANET is implemented to identify and classify three types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: Blackhole, Grayhole and Flooding Attack. This work utilized a cluster-based routing algorithm (CBRA) in MANET.A simulation to gather data, then processed to create eight attributes for creating a specialized dataset using Java. Mamdani fuzzy-based inference system (MFIS) is used to create dataset labelling. Furthermore, an ensemble classification technique is trained on the dataset to discover and classify three types of attacks. The proposed ensemble classification has six base classifiers, namely, C4.5, Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm (FURIA), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results demonstrate that MFIS with the Ensemble classification technique enables an enhancing security in MANET’s by modeling the interactions among a malicious node with number of legitimate nodes.

  abstract     = {Hydropower station is vital for the stable growth of the national economy. How to timely warn the possible faults of hydropower stations has become an increasingly popular research topic. The traditional detection model is difficult to detect the small abnormal changes in the data, and these abnorm al changes are often the precursor of faults. To improve the sensitivity of the traditional detection model, this study introduced a weight factor into the traditional LSTM detection model. By using the correction mechanism, the LSTM correction model makes the prediction model never deviate from the normal track following the appearance of abnormal data. This ensures that the model can generate large residuals after abnormal data occur so that we can detect these abnormal data in time. Finally, this paper puts forward two factors related to equipment health and integrates these two factors to form a health index. The results show that the LSTM correction model based on the health index can not only detect small changes that cannot be detected by traditional detection models but also knows the wear and tear of equipment during operation based on the changes in health indicators.},

This article proposes a badminton racket-mounted data gathering system with a single inertial sensor and proposes a real-time motion data flow-based window segmentation technique to capture motion data. On this basis, a two-layer classifier recognition model based on C4.5 Decision Tree (C4.5 T) algorithm and Random Forest (RF) method is constructed to recognize swing technical actions. Using the C4.5 T to identify the swing style of athletes; The RF method is used to recognize the swing technical action. The final experiment showed that the method studied achieved a recognition accuracy of 95.36% for six common swing movements. The proposed model has good application prospects in the recognition of badminton swing movements. However, due to the limitations of the experimental conditions, the recognition effect of this method on more complex swing movements needs to be further verified.},

In this paper, experiments were conducted and experimental data were collected on galvanized steel sheets using the LSW process, and mathematical models were developed using response surface methodology (RSM) and genetic algorithm (GA) to verify the specific effects of each process parameter on the weld and to perform process optimization. Laser power, welding speed, gap and focal length were selected as the influencing factors, and melt depth, melt width and concave as the output results. In the RSM model we found that the laser power was positively correlated with the weld depth and width, while the welding speed was inversely correlated with the weld depth and width, the gap was positively correlated with the amount of concave, and the focal length had no significant effect on the weld. In the GA model we use a large amount of experimental data for BP neural network training and iterative optimization using a genetic algorithm. Validation experiments were conducted on two models, and the results indicated that the two models had higher accuracy in predicting the welding depth and width compared to predicting the concave. The GA model had an 8% increase in tensile strength and a 25% increase in plasticity of the weld joint obtained from the optimal process compared to the RSM model. The GA model has higher accuracy in optimizing the LSW process.},

  abstract     = {The motivation for this paper is to consider that in recent years, the concept of metaverse, as the latest and most popular concept in the world, has been widely applied and studied in various industries, including economic management, art design, education and teaching. However, the academic and s cientific circles have not reached a consensus on whether to define the metaverse as a technology or an intelligent scene. We believe that the metaverse should be a key concept and emerging theory for constructing the future wisdom field. Therefore, in this study, our research objective is to focus on the visual art evaluation in digital works, and propose a visual art quality evaluation method in future metaverse digital works. This method is based on the quality function deployment theory and fuzzy mathematics theory in marketing. The second core point of this study is to build a field framework for the visual art evaluation of future digital works based on the metaverse by combing the current international and domestic understanding of the concept of metaverse. In addition, taking visual art quality evaluation as the research object, we have constructed a visual art quality evaluation index system for digital works under the background of metaverse. The index system is composed of one first-class index, three second-class indexes and nine third-class indexes. At the same time, we proposed a new fuzzy mathematics evaluation method in the research, called G1 entropy method. This algorithm combines subjective weighting method: G1 method and objective weighting method: entropy method as an important method of quality evaluation, and carries out the final rating through the combination weight of G1 entropy method. This study makes up for the concept of the future metaverse, introduces the gaps in the theory of visual art evaluation of future digital works, innovates the analysis of new concepts and the improvement of old methods, builds a new scene of organic combination of new technology and traditional visual art, and provides new ideas for the improvement of art quality at home and abroad in the future. In general, we sorted out the contributions of this research, including the following three aspects: (1) we constructed the metaverse field structure of digital works. By analyzing the current international and domestic research literature on the application of metaverse technology, especially the concept of metaverse in art scenes, we proposed to construct the field structure of online visual art after introducing the concept of metaverse, including blockchain technology, artificial intelligence technology Interaction technology and Internet of things technology as the four characteristics; (2) Method theoretical contribution: we further take the visual art quality evaluation as the research object, construct the index system of visual art quality evaluation of digital works under the background of metaverse, and propose an evaluation method of G1 entropy method, which is actually a method of subjective weighting by experts; (3) We use the method proposed in (2) to complete the calculation and ranking of the importance of 9 indicators in a practical case, and give some countermeasures for the calculation results of the importance of indicators. In conclusion, this study has realized the construction of new application scenarios of concepts and the new improvement of methods, and can provide theoretical and practical case experience support for the quality improvement of international and domestic metaverse visual art.},

  abstract     = {Background:Image semantic segmentation can be understood as the allocation of a predefined category label to each pixel in the image to achieve the region segmentation of the image. Different categories in the image are identified with different colors. While achieving pixel classification, the pos ition information of pixel points of different categories in the image is retained. Purpose:Due to the influence of background and complex environment, the traditional semantic segmentation methods have low accuracy. To alleviate the above problems, this paper proposes a new real-time image semantic segmentation framework based on a lightweight deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for robotic environment sensing. Methodology:This new framework is divided into three stages: encoding stage, decoding stage and dimension reduction stage. In the coding stage, a cross-layer feature map fusion (CLFMF) method is proposed to improve the effect of feature extraction. In the decoding stage, a new lightweight decoder (LD) structure is designed to reduce the number of convolutional layers to speed up model training and prediction. In the dimension reduction stage, the convolution dimension reduction method (CDR) is presented to connect the encoder and decoder layer by layer to enhance the decoder effect. Results:Compared with other state-of-the-art image semantic segmentation methods, we conduct comparison experiments on datasets Cityscapes, SUN RGB-D, CamVid, KITTI. The Category iIoU combined with the proposed method is more than 70%, and the Category IoU is as high as 89.7%. Conclusion:The results reflect that the new method can achieve the better semantic segmentation effect.},

  abstract     = {Interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy (IT2TrF) number is a powerful tool to depict fuzzy information. Information measures methods have received more and more attention in recent years as they play an important role in decision-making theory. A new multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method supported by IT2TrF information measures is investigated in this paper under the IT2TrF information environment. Firstly, three axiomatic definitions of IT2TrF information measures are introduced, which include information entropy, similarity measure and cross-entropy. Secondly, with the help of the exponential function, we formulate some information measure formulas, which are followed by the proofs that the exponential entropy, exponential similarity measure and exponential cross-entropy fit the three axiomatic definitions. Subsequently, a novel IT2TrF MADM method is designed, in which the IT2TrF exponential entropy and cross-entropy are utilized to generate the attribute weights, the IT2TrF exponential similarity measure is employed to obtain the closeness degree of the ideal solution and derive the most satisfying solution. Lastly, we provide a numerical example of corporate investment to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of the proposed MADM method. The robustness and merits of the developed MADM method are highlighted by the comparative analysis.},

To solve this problem, this paper presents a multi-scale one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Multi-scale 1D CNN) prediction model using time series data of temperature and axial force as inputs to realize the online prediction of tensile strength of welded joints. Firstly, FSW experiments are carried out to obtain time series data of temperature and axial force. Tensile strength values of the welded joints is obtained by tensile tests. The time series data and tensile strength values are fused as a dataset. Then Multi-scale 1D CNN, traditional 1D CNN and Multi-channel 1D CNN prediction models are established and trained with the dataset, respectively. Finally, by comparing the prediction performance of the three models, Multi-scale 1D CNN is proved to be more suitable for analyzing time series data to feedback the dynamic change of tensile strength of the joints during welding.},

In addition, this study provides specific decision-making methods and implementation steps for optimizing the stripping path of non-performing assets. The empirical analysis results verify and demonstrate the feasibility, operability, accuracy, and applicability of the established model. The results show that the model designed in the study exhibits strong stability in sensitivity testing. When the parameter vectors are taken as (1,0,0,0), (1,1,0,0), (1,1,0,0), and (1,1,1,1), respectively, the ranking results corresponding to the first three parameter vectors are stable, all of which are A2 &gt; A4 &gt; A1 &gt; A3. At the same time, the applied decision-making result of the model is A4 &gt; A1 &gt; A2 &gt; A3, which is consistent with the best scheme evaluated by experts and superior to most comparative models. At the same time, in the analysis of decision-making characteristics, the research and design model has the most comprehensive review of decision-making elements, which is superior to other comparative models. It can be seen that the model designed by the research can lead to higher quality NPL divestiture schemes, which can help manufacturing enterprises improve asset quality and weaken the negative impact of the quality and safety crisis in manufacturing enterprises.},

  abstract     = {A new concept of vertices in a fuzzy graph known as defective vertices is introduced here. A vertex in a fuzzy network is called defective if no edges incident with it are strong. Defective vertex cannot be ignored when determining dominance in a fuzzy network because they are a part of the network . Finding defective vertices in a network is not much difficult when the adjacency matrix is given. In this paper, the novel concept of defective vertices of a fuzzy graph is introduced. Based on this idea a stable domination set and a stable domination number are defined. This also optimised the network by establishing minimal connectivity. We have proposed three algorithms for finding the defective vertices, establishing stable connectivity, and determining the stable domination number for a given graph. An application of stable domination in the diagnosis of chickenpox disease is demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer is a dangerous tumor that requires accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional diagnosis involves invasive and time-consuming histologic examination, and radiologists face challenges in localizing lung tumors. Deep neural convolutional networks are frequently used to locate lung cancer, but this is still difficult when not accounting for surrounding lung tissue. Despite progress in research, healthcare still uses deep learning models to improve the precision and sensitivity of large datasets. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) accuracy standards are adequate, but image properties such as flips, construction, and other uncommon alignments diminish its efficiency. CNN also does not store the geometric distribution between scanned picture features. CT (Computed Tomography) and PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans require a method that takes into consideration the spatial information of picture characteristics, as they are vulnerable to alignment problems during the perusing process. To address these issues, the authors propose MCNet (MobileNetV2 with Capsule Network), a hybrid network that adopts feature extraction and categorization from MobileNetV2, and capsule network is used to overcome the limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when it comes to processing images with abnormal orientations, such as tilting or rotation. Although CNNs are effective in processing images presented in a standard orientation, they have difficulty handling variations in image orientation. In this work, MobileNetV2 serves as a backbone network for Capsule Networks in lung cancer diagnosis. The lung image collection dataset verifies the effectiveness of MCNet, and experimental results show that MCNet technology performs better than previous state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed hybrid MCNet architecture achieves the clinical goal of lung cancer diagnosis with a lower computational cost, reducing processing time complexity and false positive rates compared to current techniques.},

  abstract     = {Let N = (V, E) be a simple graph and let X be a subset of V (N). If every node not in X lies on a geodesic path between two nodes from X then it is called a geodetic set. The geodetic number g (N) is the minimum cardinality of such set X. The subset X is called a dominating set if every node not i n X has at least one neighbour in X. The minimum number of nodes of a dominating set is known as domination number γ (N). If the subset X is a geodetic set as well as a dominating set then it is called a geodetic dominating set. The minimum cardinality of a geodetic dominating set is known as geodetic domination number γg (N). The geodetic domination integrity of N is defined to be DIg (N) = min {|X| + m (N - X) : X is a geodetic dominating set of N}, where m (N - X) denotes the order of the largest component of N - X. Uncertain networks can be modelled using fuzzy graphs. In a graph, each vertex and each edge are equally significant. However, in fuzzy graphs, each vertex and each edge is important in terms of fuzziness in their own right. In this study, the concepts of geodetic dominating sets in fuzzy graphs and geodetic domination number are defined and bounds are obtained. Moreover, the vulnerability parameter Geodetic domination integrity is introduced in fuzzy graphs. Further, the geodetic domination integrity for complete fuzzy graphs, complete bipartite fuzzy graphs, Cartesian product of two strong fuzzy graphs and bounds are also discussed. The applications of this parameter are applied to a telecommunication network system model to identify the key persons in the system and applied in a fuzzy social network to find the most influential group within the network.},

A sample of 150 Chinese consumers was examined using the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) technique. The fsQCA outcomes illustrate that five different and effective configurations of functionality, social, and consumer personality factors exist to attain apex level intention of using 5G technology products. This article extends the existing literature by espousing a new procedural attitude to divulge the intricacy of 5G products adoption.

Packaging design, as a comprehensive discipline that integrates commerce, culture, and art, diverse cultural forms and elements will run through the entire process of brand packaging design. Good products need to be sold through good channels in order to achieve greater value. As a bridge connecting products and the market, the role of packaging design is even more evident. It can not only improve the recognition of products, but also help enterprises stand out among many similar products, thereby increasing product value. The brand packaging design effect evaluation is a classical multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problem. This paper extends the EDAS method to the 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy sets (2TLPFSs). On the basis of the original EDAS method, 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy EDAS (2TLPF-EDAS) method is built for MAGDM.

Firstly, The algorithm maps the transaction dataset as a Boolean matrix, and changes the storage mode of the matrix(that is, adding two columns and a row vector); Secondly, the matrix is compressed many times during the generation of frequent k- itemset; After that, the items in the matrix are sorted incrementally according to the support degree of the itemset; Finally, the original string comparison operation is replaced by the vector product of each column of the matrix. Experimental results and analysis show that the FBSCM algorithm has higher temporal performance than the traditional FUP algorithm in different incremental dataset sizes, different minimum support thresholds and different feature datasets, especially when the incremental transaction volume is large or the minimum support degree is small.},

In order to solve this problem, a new SVM model is proposed in this paper by combining the uncertainty theory with the SVM theory. The uncertainty theory was proposed by Liu in 2007, and it is often used to describe the uncertainty of things. The uncertain set in uncertainty theory is often used to model unsharp concepts. Therefore, this paper regards each uncertain data as an uncertain set and establishes a SVM model with uncertain chance constraints. However, the uncertain chance constraints are non-convex. Therefore, this paper gives the equivalent transformation process of constraint conditions when the input data are triangular uncertain sets. Finally, the non-convex constraint conditions are transformed into the linear constraint conditions, so that the model is transformed into a nonlinear programming model. In the numerical experiment, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve the problem, which proves the feasibility of the model.},

The main contribution and originality of this research are adding the non-membership term to the definition of a complex fuzzy subfield that assigns for any element a complex-valued grade. We expand the complex fuzzy subfield and obtain a new structure called CIFSF. This new concept is innovative in that it may attain a wider range of values for both membership and non-membership functions where these functions are expanded to the unit disc in the complex plane. Furthermore, we discuss that the direct product of two CIFSFs is CIFSF, and some related properties are investigated. In addition, we present the definition of necessity and possibility operators on the direct product of CIFSF, and some associated theorems are given.

In addition, an adaptive weighted matrix combined with total variation is a key technique for well restoring local features of image. Considering these two factors, in this paper, we propose an adaptive Euler’s elastica model for Poisson image restoration so as to well preserve both image features in smooth regions and local features of image. To solve this non-smooth and non-convex model efficiently, we design an alternating direction method of multipliers. Experiments on both natural and synthetic images illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in Poisson restoration and denoising, respectively. In particular, for Poisson restoration, our proposed method improves the TV method up to 2.46 about PSNR for dealing with the Peppers image with Gaussian blur and noise level σ = 1. In addition, the proposed method for Poisson denoising gets higher PSNR and SSIM values than the TAC method, while costing less CPU time.},

Existing MLTC methods have increasingly focused on improving classification effectiveness by fusing the correlations of labels. Still, the research suffers from difficulties in comprehensively extracting text features and distinguishing similar labels. This paper proposed a multi-label text classification model based on keyword extraction and attention mechanism. The model proposed using keywords to represent labels, adopting both self-attention and interactive attention mechanisms (between labels and text) to extract text features and create text vectors. Finally, fusing text vectors as the classifier’s input. Experiments were conducted on two public datasets and a self-built dataset of illegal advertisements.

  abstract     = {Reducing the dimensions of the original data set while preserving the information as much as possible is conducive to improving the accuracy and efficiency of the model. To achieve this, this paper presents a multi-strategy African vulture optimization algorithm that is the chaotic and elite opposition-based African vulture optimization with the simplex method and differential evolution strategy(CESDAVO). Three main improvements are introduced into African vultures optimization(AVO) to improve its capabilities in this study. Firstly, the chaotic elite opposition-based learning strategy is used to initialize and diversify individual positions of vultures. Secondly, the simplex method is used to optimize those poor individuals so as to further improve the local exploitation ability of the algorithm. Thirdly, the differential evolution strategy is used to make the algorithm escape from the local optimum and improve the global optimization capability of the algorithm. The results of the ablation experiments show that mixing the three strategies greatly improves the optimization performance of the algorithm. In addition, Nine algorithms are compared with CESDAVO on 15 benchmark functions, and this experimental result shows that its optimization capability is superior to the others. Then, the proposed CESDAVO is employed for feature selection, and 12 standard datasets are used for experiments. According to the experimental results, CESDAVO obtained the highest average classification accuracy on 11 datasets and the highest feature selection rate on 8 datasets, which is significantly better than other algorithms. Finally, CESDAVO is also applied to feature reduction for essays, removing 24 features and significantly improving the classification accuracy on multiple classifiers.},

  abstract     = {The point features of low-texture images are insufficient and unreliable, so it is difficult to achieve good alignment and easy to damage the image structure. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a new image stitching method by using the sigmoid function to create perception mask. Firstly, the point features and line features are used to improve the accuracy of image registration and the naturalness of distortion. Secondly, an energy function is used to optimize the alignment model. Finally, we propose to use sigmoid function to create perception mask image to reduce artifacts and retain image structure. The gradient domain fusion algorithm is combined to achieve image fusion. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to some previous methods in reducing artifacts and maintaining image structure.},

  abstract     = {With the development of convolutional neural networks, many improved algorithms have been successively proposed to promote the accuracy of dense crowd counting. However, these algorithms are deployed with expensive computing resources, which is unbearable for small devices such as embedded systems with limited computing resources. To realize the real-time counting on the small devices, it is of great significance how to trade off the computation cost and processing accuracy of the dense crowd-counting algorithm. Thus, we propose a lightweight dense crowd-counting algorithm (LCNNet) to improve this issue. Specifically, the proposed LCNNet consists of two subnetworks, a feature extraction subnetwork, and a regression subnetwork, with a bottleneck depth-separable convolution with a residuals module as the basic module. The LCNNet effectively improves computational efficiency and reduces the computational cost, which can be performed on small devices. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LCNNet for dense crowd-counting models. Meanwhile, the proposed LCNNet can maintain a comparable level of computational accuracy and computational cost on Vehicle counting datasets.},

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of topic modeling methods for short texts from a novel perspective. Firstly, it discusses short text probabilistic topic models and outlines the directions in which they can be improved. Secondly, it explores short text neural topic models, which can be categorized into three groups based on their underlying structures. In addition, this paper provides a detailed investigation of embedding methods in topic modeling. Moreover, various applications and corresponding works are surveyed, with a focus on short texts. The commonly used public corpora and evaluation indicators for topic modeling are also summarized.

First, it constructs a new hierarchy for movie ticketing App networks via the Modified Delphi Method (MDM), which consists of 5 criteria and 20 sub-criteria. Second, we apply the Analytic Network Process (ANP) to calculate the weight of the criteria and sub-criteria, finding that information is the most important, followed by system, trust, service, and word-of-mouth (WOM) in that order. Finally, three movie ticketing Apps are utilized as alternatives, and the best alternative is selected by Techniques for Order Preference Similarity Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to verify the model’s feasibility. The results herein offer theoretical and practical insights for the development and promotion of movie ticketing Apps and provide a reference for investors to formulate relevant financing strategies.},

In particular, deep reinforcement learning, as a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning, stands out among many approaches in the field of decision-making because of its high performance, strong generalization, and high fitting ability. In this paper, we attempt to propose a hybrid method of recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) and deep learning to figure out the algorithmic trading problem of determining the optimal trading position in the daily trading activities of the stock market. We adopt deep neural network (DNN), long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), and bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (BiLSTM) to automatically extract higher-level abstract feature information from sequential trading data, respectively, and then generate optimal trading strategies by interacting with the environment in a reinforcement learning framework. In particular, the BiLSTM consisting of two LSTM models with opposite directions is able to make full use of the information from both directions in attempting to capture more effective information. In experiments, the daily data of Dow Jones, S&amp;P500, and NASDAQ (from Jan-01, 2005 to Dec-31, 2020) are applied to verify the performance of the newly proposed DNN-RL, LSTM-RL, and BiLSTM-RL trading systems. Experimental results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the benchmark methods, such as RRL and Buy and Hold, with higher scalability and better robustness. Especially, BiLSTM-RL performs better than other methods.},

  abstract     = {Data driven deep learning methods have become the mainstream method of building extraction from remote sensing images. In this paper, deep learning algorithm is used to classify and extract buildings from remote sensing images of rural areas around the Great Wall in the suburbs of Beijing captured by unmanned aerial vehicles. Aiming at the shortcomings of the current mainstream instance segmentation algorithm Mask R-CNN in feature fusion and poor prediction of instance mask boundaries, this paper proposes a boundary optimization algorithm for building instance segmentation based on discrete wavelet transform. Firstly, the discrete wavelet transform is introduced into the segmentation task branch of Mask R-CNN algorithm to extract the low-frequency and high-frequency information of the real mask, in which the high-frequency information includes the boundary information. Secondly, the pixel by pixel prediction of the mask turns into the learning of the low-frequency and high-frequency information of the real mask. The learning of the high-frequency information helps the segmentation network to learn the boundary features better. Finally, using the reversibility of discrete wavelet transform, the low-frequency and high-frequency information of the learned mask is inversely transformed to reconstruct the final mask. The improved algorithm is evaluated on the dataset COCO, and applied to the automatic extraction of buildings. The DWT Mask R-CNN algorithm model achieved 70.2% segmentation accuracy and 71.4% detection accuracy, which were improved by 1% and 0.7% respectively compared with the Mask R-CNN and Cascade Mask R-CNN models. The experimental results show that the instance segmentation edge optimization algorithm combined with wavelet transform has achieved better results on the segmentation boundary, improved the poor effect of mask edge detection and achieved higher detection accuracy, and can accurately extract village buildings.},

The objective of this work is to control a nonlinear process by using a one-dimensional input rule variable, instead of error and error variation. The initial limits of the fuzzy logic membership functions are mostly depen d on experiments and previous knowledge of the dynamic process behaviors. Generally, the membership function parameters have a significant impact on control signal amplitude and, consequently on the convergence and stability of the controller-plant system. The proposed technique determines the limits of the antecedent membership functions online using the kth and k - 1th outputs of the controlled plant and reference model, respectively. Meanwhile, the limits of the consequent membership functions are calculated using error and error variation. This approach ensures: (i) that the input/output variables have the required fuzzy space, (ii) the controlled plant follows the desired reference model, and (iii) the control signal amplitude is within acceptable limits. Additionally, (iiii) it takes into account the dynamic variability of the process and the existence of an overshoot. The membership function parameters are updated continuously through a self-adapting procedure, ensuring improved control performance. Ultimately, the proposed approach is improved using two nonlinear systems.},

We define a pair of fuzzy upper/lower approximation operators and investigate their properties and interrelations. These two operators have nice logical descriptions by using the related Lukasiewicz logical systems. We show that upper definable sets, lower definable sets and definable sets are equivalent, and they form an Alexandrov fuzzy topology.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the construction industry, people’s requirements for the construction quality continue to improve, and the supervision and management of the construction project quality has been paid more and more attention. The perfect quality supervision and management system is not only an important guarantee for the whole construction project implementation process, but also provides support for the smooth implementation of the construction project. With the increasing number of high-rise buildings in cities and the increasing difficulty of construction, it has posed great challenges to the construction industry, which also means that the quality supervision and management of construction projects are facing new challenges. Therefore, the project quality supervision and management department should review the situation, optimize the quality supervision and management work according to the current situation and needs of the construction project development, effectively improve the system guarantee and content optimization, maximize the role of quality supervision and management, and provide assistance for the high-quality and sustainable development of the construction industry. The quality evaluation of construction project is a classical multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM). In this paper, we extended multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method for MAGDM with Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic sets (P2TLSs). Firstly, a brief review of the definition of P2TLSs is given. Next, two aggregation operators of P2TLSs are used to fuse overall evaluation information. Moreover, combining traditional MABAC model with P2TLSs, Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic number MABAC (P2TLN-MABAC) is built with all computing steps depicted in detail. Furthermore, a numerical example related to quality evaluation of construction project is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, some comparisons with P2TLWA and P2TLWG operators are also carried out.},

  abstract     = {The compressive strength and slump of concrete have highly nonlinear functions relative to given components. The importance of predicting these properties for researchers is greatly diagnosed in developing constructional technologies. Such capacities should be progressed to decrease the cost of expensive experiments and enhance the measurements’ accuracy. This study aims to develop a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) to model the hardness features of High-Performance Concrete (HPC) mixtures. In this function, optimizing the predicting process via RBFNN will be aimed to be accurate, as the aim of this research, conducted with metaheuristic approaches of Henry gas solubility optimization (HGSO) and Multiverse Optimizer (MVO). The training phase of models RBHG and RBMV was performed by the dataset of 181 HPC mixtures having fly ash and superplasticizer. Regarding the results of hybrid models, the MVO had more correlation between the predicted and observed compressive strength and slump values than HGSO in the R 2 index. The RMSE of RBMV (3.7 mm) was obtained 43.2 percent lower than that of RBHG (5.3 mm) in the appraising slump of HPC samples, while, for compressive strength, RMSE was 3.66 MPa and 5 MPa for RBMV and RBHG respectively. Moreover, to appraise slump flow rates, the R 2 correlation rate for RBHG was computed at 96.86 % while 98.25 % for RBMV in the training phase, with a 33.30% difference. Generally, both hybrid models prospered in doing assigned tasks of modeling the hardness properties of HPC samples.},

This paper rigidly follows the assumptions introduced in conventional ZSL and proposes a visual feature filtering method based on a semantic mapping model, namely, filtering visual features through class-specific filters to effectively remove class-agnostic information.

For China at this stage, finance is in a period of rapid development, and its role has penetrated into all aspects of social and economic life. Especially after China’s entry into the WTO, the pace of opening up the financial market has been further accelerated, and comprehensive evaluation and analysis of financial competitiveness is of great significance for comprehensively understanding and accurately grasping China’s national conditions, national strength, and international competitiveness, promoting the long-term growth of China’s financial competitiveness, and the sustainable development of the financial industry. The competitiveness evaluation of regional financial centers is looked as the multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problem.

  abstract     = {Breast cancer can be successfully treated if diagnosed at its earliest, though it is considered as a fatal disease among women. The histopathology slide turned images are the gold standard for tumor diagnosis. However, the manual diagnosis is still tedious due to its structural complexity. With the advent of computer-aided diagnosis, time and computation intensive manual procedure can be managed with the development of an automated classification system. The feature extraction and classification are quite challenging as these images involve complex structures and overlapping nuclei. A novel nuclei-based patch extraction method is proposed for the extraction of non-overlapping nuclei patches obtained from the breast tumor dataset. An ensemble of pre-trained models is used to extract the discriminating features from the identified and augmented non-overlapping nuclei patches. The discriminative features are further fused using p-norm pooling technique and are classified using a LightGBM classifier with 10-fold cross-validation. The obtained results showed an increase in the overall performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The proposed framework yielded an accuracy of 98.3% for binary class classification and 95.1% for multi-class classification on ICIAR 2018 dataset.},

Dissimilar indications or traits are extremely difficult to identify in HF patients. IoT solutions are becoming increasingly commonplace as smart wearable gadgets become more popular. Sudden heart attacks have a short life expectancy, which is terrible. As a result, a patient monitoring of heart patients based on IoT-centered Machine Learning (ML) is presented to help with HF prediction, and treatment is administered as necessary. Verification, Encryption, and Categorization are the three phases that make up this developed model. Initially, the datasets from the IoT sensor gadget are gathered by authenticating with a specific hospital through encryption. The patient’s integrated IoT sensor module then transfers sensing information to the cloud. The Improved Blowfish Encryption (IBE) approach is used to protect the sensor data transfer to the cloud. Then the encrypted data is decrypted, and the classification is performed using the Adaptive Fuzzy-Based Long Short-Term Memory with Recurrent Neural Network (AF-LSTM-RNN) algorithm. The results are classed as malignant or benign. It assesses the patient’s cardiac state and sends an alert text to the doctor for treatment. The AF-LSTM-RNN-based HF prediction outperforms the existing techniques. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-measure and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are compared to existing procedures to ensure the planned research is genuine. Using the Origin tool, these metrics are shown as research findings.},

  abstract     = {Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a crucial life-threatening condition due to impaired kidney functionality and renal disease. In recent studies, Kidney disorder is considered one of the essential and deadliest issues that threaten patients’ survival with the lack of earlier prediction and classification. The earlier prediction process and the proper diagnosis help delay or stop the chronic disease progression into its final stage, where renal transplantation or dialysis is a known way of saving the patient’s life. Global studies reveal that nearly 10% of the population is affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and millions die because of non-affordable treatment. Early detection of CKD from the biological parameters would save people from this crisis. Machine Learning algorithms are playing a predominant role in disease diagnosis and prognosis. This work generates compound features from CKD indicators by two novel algorithms: Correlation-based Weighted Compound Feature (CWCF) and Feature Significance based Weighted Compound Feature (FSWCF). Any learning algorithm is as good as its features. Hence, the features generated by these algorithms are validated on different machine learning algorithms as a test for generality. The simulation is done in MATLAB 2020a environment where various metrics like prediction accuracy gives superior results compared to multiple other approaches. The accuracy of CWCF over different methods like LR is 97.23%, Gaussian NB is 99%, SVM is 99.18%, and RF is 99.89%, which is substantially higher than the approaches without proper methods feature analysis. The results suggest that generated compound features improve the predictive power of the algorithms.},

A large number of solution algorithms for this problem are mainly based on completeness algorithms and heuristic algorithms. Intelligent optimization algorithms with heuristic policies run significantly more efficiently on large-scale instances compared to completeness algorithms.

  abstract     = {Radial distribution system is an important link connecting power supply and users, and its power supply reliability is directly related to users. Radial distribution network reconfiguration can transform the network structure by changing the switching state of the distribution network lines, and achieve the goals of reducing network operational losses, improving power quality, and power supply reliability while meeting various constraints such as radial operation, power supply and demand balance, capacity, and voltage. Radial distribution systems have the characteristics of multiple components and complex structures. How to quickly and accurately evaluate the health performance of radial distribution systems and find an optimal solution for network reconfiguration are important issues in distribution network analysis. The network health performance evaluation of radial distribution system is classical multiple attributes group decision making (MAGDM). The probabilistic hesitancy fuzzy sets (PHFSs) are used as a tool for characterizing uncertain information during the network health performance evaluation of radial distribution system. In this paper, we extend the classical grey relational analysis (GRA) method to the probabilistic hesitancy fuzzy MAGDM with unknown weight information. Firstly, the basic concept, comparative formula and Hamming distance of PHFSs are briefly introduced. Then, the definition of the score values is employed to compute the attribute weights based on the information entropy method. Then, probabilistic hesitancy fuzzy GRA (PHF-GRA) method is built for MAGDM under PHFSs. Finally, a practical case study for network health performance evaluation of radial distribution system is designed to validate the proposed method and some comparative studies are also designed to verify the applicability.},

This study deals with the problem of selecting an ergonomic risk-evaluation method with Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFSs) based Pythagorean Fuzzy AHP (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean Fuzzy WASPAS (PF-WASPAS) methodology. The method selection criteria were obtained by consulting five different anonymous experts on the candidate criteria obtained from the literature review. The final four main criteria and ten sub-criteria were then decided. After the determination of the decision criteria, five experts were asked to evaluate the criteria and to express their opinions on criteria-alternative scoring by means of a questionnaire for method selection. A two-step method is suggested for the selection of the ergonomic risk-evaluation method. In the first step, PF-AHP is utilized in order to identify the weight of criteria used in the method selection. In the second step, the PF-WASPAS method is proposed in order to OWAS, RULA, and REBA methods. The accuracy and validity of the suggested hybrid model is tested with real data in İstanbul Ambulance Service stations. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to test the reliability of the model. Moreover a comparative analysis is carried out with AHP and Fuzzy AHP methods to identify criteria weights. Study results show that REBA is the most appropriate ergonomic risk-evaluation method in EMS.},

  abstract     = {Feature Selection (FS) for Sentiment Analysis (SA) becomes a complex problem because of the large-sized learning datasets. However, to reduce the data dimensionality, researchers have focused on FS using swarm intelligence approaches that reflect the best classification performance. Crocodiles Hunting Strategy (CHS), a novel swarm-based meta-heuristic that simulates the crocodiles’ hunting behaviour, has demonstrated excellent optimization results. Hence, in this work, two FS algorithms, i.e., Binary CHS (BCHS) and Improved BCHS (IBCHS) based on original CHS were applied for FS in the SA field. In IBCHS, the opposition-based learning technique is applied in the initialization and displacement phases to enhance the search space exploration ability of the IBCHS. The two proposed approaches were evaluated using six well-known corpora in the SA area (Semeval-2016, Semeval-2017, Sanders, Stanford, PMD, and MRD). The obtained result showed that IBCHS outperformed BCHS regarding search capability and convergence speed. The comparison results of IBCHS to several recent state-of-the-art approaches show that IBCHS surpassed other approaches in almost all used corpora. The comprehensive results reveal that the use of OBL in BCHS greatly impacts the performance of BCHS by enhancing the diversity of the population and the exploitation ability, which improves the convergence of the IBCHS.},

The processing unit in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system performs reading the images followed by primary image enhancement to suppress distortions thereby enhancing the feature quality in terms of its intensity, augmenting the resolution by image segmentation, post-processing by thresholding based on grayscale values and performing several morphological operations. With the existing methodologies, extracting the Region Of Interest (ROI) with the overlapping intensity values lead to inaccurate results. A novel method in which the input image that is anisotropically diffused and blurred is converted into a sharp image. Further, fuzzy partitioning of pixels deployed on Global Thresholding –Clustering Methodology (GT-CM) based segmentation takes 4 clusters into account hence forth seperating the exterior portion of the skull, the border region of the skull, the ventricles which may include the lesion and the noise. Statistical results based on several metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, F measure, Jaccord Index, Dice Coefficient and precision show that the proposed method is far more effective. An accuracy of 99.26% is obtained in exactly locating and extracting the lesion along with its attributes.},

  abstract     = {Modern industrial processes often have nonlinearity, multivariate, time-delay, and measurement outliers, which make accurate data-driven modeling of key performance indicators difficult. To address these issues, a robust and regularized long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for soft sensors in complex industrial processes was proposed. First, a conventional LSTM architecture was used as the basic model to deal with nonlinearity and time delay. Thereafter, a novel LSTM loss function that combines the excellent resistance to outliers of Huber M-Loss with the superior model reduction capability of ℓ 1 regularization was designed. Subsequently, a backpropagation through time training algorithm for the proposed LSTM was developed, including the chain derivative calculation and updating formulas. The adaptive moment estimation was applied to perform the gradient update, while the grid search and moving window cross-validation were used to find the optimal hyperparameters. Finally, nonlinear artificial datasets with time series and outliers, as well as an industrial dataset of a desulfurization process, were applied to investigate the performance of the proposed soft sensor. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art soft sensors in terms of predictive accuracy and training time. The causal relationship of the data-driven soft sensor trained by the proposed algorithm is consistent with the field operation and chemical reactions of the desulfurization process.},

On Q-NSMs, we define the fundamental set operations and some algebraic operations, i.e., complement, union, intersection, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scalar multiplication, and prove related properties of these operations. Moreover, these operations are illustrated via several numerical examples. Then, two algorithms are proposed to tackle group decision making (GDM) problems: The first depends on the score function of Q-NSMs, and the second is based on the aggregation operator of Q-NSMs. Finally, this study is supported by a brief comparison with some relevant previous models.},

  abstract     = {The three-way decision model based on linguistic term sets has been extensively investigated since decision makers frequently utilize natural language to evaluate in an actual decision-making process. The existing models require decision makers to select appropriate linguistic terms from a given linguistic term set. However, making such a choice is not always simple, and decision makers occasionally choose words that are related to their own experience. In order to deal with this kind of decision problem, we appeal to the theory of computing with words pioneered by Zadeh and establish a three-way decision model based on computing with words in this paper. The paper focuses on how to deal with more general linguistic information using the theory of computing with words. Initially, using the concept of computing with words, we translate more broad linguistic information into a linguistic distribution assessment on a balanced linguistic term set in order to better analyze linguistic information. The three-way decision based on computing with words is then discussed. Decision-theoretic rough fuzzy sets take into account the ambiguity of the decision target as a generalization of the classical decision-theoretic rough sets. This is what motivated us to develop a three-way decision based on decision-theoretic rough fuzzy sets using computing with words. Additionally, a fabricated example demonstrates that our three-way decision model is more adaptable in processing linguistic information and can handle more general linguistic information provided by decision makers.},

This paper deals with this problem, whose objective is to minimize the total travel distance while satisfying the capacity and maximum route length constraints. We proposed a hybrid iterated local search metaheuristic (HILS) algorithm to solve it. In the framework of iterated local search, the current solution was improved iteratively by five neighborhood operators. For every obtained neighborhood solution after the local search procedure, a large neighborhood search-based perturbation method was executed to explore larger solution space and get a better neighborhood solution to take part in the next iteration. In addition, the worse solutions found by the algorithm were accepted by the nondeterministic simulated annealing-based acceptance rule to keep the diversification of solutions. Computation experiments were conducted on 28 benchmark instances and the experimental results demonstrate that our presented algorithm finds 17 new best solutions, which significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art MCVRP methods.},

The unconfined compressive strength of stabilized soil is strongly affected by numerous factors such as the soil properties, the binder content, etc. Machine Learning (ML) approach can take into account these factors to predict the unconfined compressive strength (Qu) with high performance and reliability. The aim of this paper is to select a single ML model to design Qu of stabilized soil containing some chemical stabilizer agents such as lime, cement and bitumen. In order to build the single ML model, a database is created based on the literature investigation. The database contains 200 data samples, 12 input variables (Liquid limit, Plastic limit, Plasticity index, Linear shrinkage, Clay content, Sand content, Gravel content, Optimum water content, Density of stabilized soil, Lime content, Cement content, Bitumen content) and the output variable Qu. The performance and reliability of ML model are evaluated by the popular validation technique Monte Carlo simulation with aided of three criteria metrics including coefficient of determination R2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Square Error (MAE). ML model based on Gradient Boosting algorithm is selected as highest performance and highest reliability ML model for designing Qu of stabilized soil. Explanation of feature effects on the unconfined compressive strength Qu of stabilized soil is carried out by Permutation importance, Partial Dependence Plot (PDP 2D) in two dimensions and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) local value.

The model introduces the error parameter and can improve the tolerance of noise data. Then the related properties of the model are also proved.

  abstract     = {The correlation coefficient (CC) is a well-known functional information measures used to measure the interrelationship between uncertain, fuzzy sets. The use of neutrosophic sets (NS) in decision making has been increasing in recent times. Many studies have been considered to calculate the CC of NSs. These approaches assess only the strength of relationship between PNSs, and are described within the interval [0, 1]. However, the inclusion of the reliability level of the data in the process is very important for the final decision. Therefore, neutrosophic Z-Number sets (NZNS) has been defined for this purpose, which are not only provide an assessment of the data but also take into account their confidence level. In this study, we define a correlation coefficient for NZNSs (CCNZNS) by employing the notions of mean, variance and covariance, and discuss some of its properties. This new approach defines correlation in the interval [–1, 1] similar to classical statistics, and indicates whether the NZNSs are either positively or negatively correlated. Then, two decision models are developed for the NZNS universe. In order to determine the partial known attribute weights, a maximizing optimization technique is derived which is taking into account both the objective and subjective aspects of assessments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models, the first model is applied for solving a medical diagnostic problem. Then the performance evaluation process is chosen to demonstrate the application of the second model. Finally, the superior aspects of the developed models over other existing models are presented with a comparison and discussion analysis. The study is concluded with the conclusion part.},

  abstract     = {A jamming attack is a special case of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that completely blocks the data transmission in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). When sensor nodes are distributed in the field, numerous attacks, such as collision, black hole, selective forwarding, jamming, etc., caused by the presence of malicious nodes have the potential to cause network damage. Jamming is a highly risky attack that completely blocks data transmission within the wireless network. The existing technique for detecting jamming attacks are based on predetermined hopping-sequence, cryptographic, or random frequency hopping techniques. However, these mechanisms are more complex and frequently have energy constraints and high overhead. A novel jamming detection method based on a statistical approach that provides high network performance measures is proposed. It is a technique that uses energy-based clustering with a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). The selection of thresholds used for the detection of jamming is analyzed. The proposed approach employs three detection performance metrics for investigating the jamming attack, namely, Packet to Delivery Ratio (PDR), ENERGY, and RSSI. The jamming node is identified using the Optimal Decision Rule (ODR), which is determined by the hypothesis rule. If the hypothesis is not satisfied, then jamming exists; otherwise, there is no jamming. The novel technique is implemented using a Network Simulator, and various performance metrics such as PDR, Energy consumption, Network throughput, Routing overhead, network, and node lifetime are evaluated to conclude that the statistical approach outperforms the timestamp and IEWMA approaches.},

  abstract     = {Some subtle features of planting structures in irrigation areas could only be visible on high-resolution panchromatic spectral images. However, low spatial resolution multispectral image makes it hard to recognize them. It is challenging to accurately obtain crop planting structure when using traditional methods. This paper proposes an extraction method of crop planting structure based on image fusion and U-Net depth semantic segmentation network, which can automatically and accurately extract multi-category crop planting structure information. This method takes Landsat8 commercial multispectral satellite data set as an example, chooses RGB pseudo-color synthetic image which highlights vegetation characteristics, and uses HLS(Hue, Luminance, Saturation), NND(Nearest-Neighbor Diffusion) and G-S(Gram-Schmidt) methods to fuse panchromatic band to obtain 15m high-resolution fusion image to obtain training set and test set, six types of land features including cities and rivers were labeled by manual to obtain the verification set. The training and validation sets are cut and enhanced to train the U-Net semantic segmentation network. Taking the Xiaokaihe irrigation area in Binzhou City, Shandong Province, China, as an example, the planting structure was classified, and the overall accuracy was 87.7%, 91.2%, and 91.3%, respectively. The accuracy of crop planting structures (wheat, cotton, woodland) was 74.2%, 82.5%, 82.3%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.832, 0.880, and 0.881, respectively. The results showed that the NND-UNet method was suitable for large-scale continuous crop types (wheat, cotton), and the GS-UNet method had a better classification effect in discrete areas of cash crops (Jujube and many kinds of fruit trees).},

According to the contour of the injured part of college students’ long-distance running, the image is segmented, and the wavelet function is used to decompose the image signal into different frequency bands. The strong correlation rules between the wavelet function and the image signal are analyzed, so that the total energy of the time domain waveform can replace the wavelet transform coefficient; Secondly, the laser harmonic imaging points which have strong correlation with the damage points are regarded as the damage points; Finally,construct the perspective image acquisition platform, collect the sports injury image data of College Students’ long-distance runners in sports school, and set up comparative experiments.

  abstract     = {Multi-agent collaborative manufacturing, high energy consumption and pollution, and frequent operation outsourcing are the three main characteristics of large complex equipment manufacturing enterprises. Therefore, the production scheduling problem of large complex equipment to be studied is a distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem involving operation outsourcing (Oos-DFJSP). Besides, the influences of each machine on carbon emission and job scheduling at different processing speeds are also involved in this research. Thus the Oos-DFJSP of large complex equipment consists of the following four sub-problems: determining the sequence of operations, assigning jobs to manufactories, assigning operations to machines and determining the processing speed of each machine. In the Oos-DFJSP, if a job is assigned to a manufactory of a group manufacturing enterprise, and the manufactory cannot complete some operations of the workpiece, then these operations will be assigned to other manufactories with related processing capabilities. Aiming at solving the problem, a multi-objective mathematical model including costs, makespan and carbon emission was established, in which energy consumption, power generation of waste heat and treatment capacity of pollutants were considered in the calculation of carbon emission. Then, a multi-objective improved hybrid genetic artificial bee colony algorithm was developed to address the above model. Finally, 45 groups of random comparison experiments were presented. Results indicate that the developed algorithm performs better than other multi-objective algorithms involved in the comparison experiments not only on quality of non-dominated solutions but also on Inverse Generational Distance and Error Ratio. That is, the proposed mathematical model and algorithm were proved to be an excellent method for solving the multi-objective Oos-DFJSP.},

In this paper, an Interpretable Web Service Recommendation model based on Disentangled Representation Learning (WSR-DRL) is proposed. First of all, to make full use of the service description information to improve the accuracy of Web service recommendation, the features representation of service name is obtained by using BERT model, and the local and global features representation of service description information is further obtained by combining 2-D CNN and Bi-LSTM. Then the disentangled convolution neural network is used to generate the high-order interaction features between users and services, and the neighborhood routing algorithm is used to mine the latent factors in these features. That improves the accuracy of Web service recommendation and make it interpretable. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of the model, several groups of experiments are carried out on real data sets. The experimental results show that compared with latest models such as DMF, DeepFM, DKN, GCMC, NDCG model and WSR-MGAT model, the WSR-DRL model proposed in this paper shows better performance on Precision@10, Recall@10, F1@10 and NDCG@10 evaluation metrics.},

For low-resource language pairs, the amount of parallel data is insufficient, resulting in poor translation quality. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes an efficient data augmentation (DA) method named STA. Firstly, the pseudo-parallel sentence pairs are generated by translating sentence trunks with the target-to-source NMT model. Furthermore, two strategies are introduced to merge the original data and pseudo-parallel corpus to augment the training set. Experimental results on simulated and real low-resource translation tasks show that the proposed method improves the translation quality over the strong baseline, and also outperforms other data augmentation methods. Moreover, the STA method can further improve the translation quality when combined with the back-translation method with the extra monolingual data.},

Pretrained models and the networks trained from scratch have obtained near-ideal accuracy on various public and self-collected datasets. However, symptoms of many diseases found on various plants look similar, which still poses an open challenge. This work takes on the task of dealing with classes with similar symptoms by proposing a trained-from-scratch shallow and thin convolutional neural network employing dilated convolutions and feature reuse. The proposed architecture is only four layers deep with a maximum width of 48 features. The utility of the proposed work is twofold: (1) it is helpful for the automatic detection of plant leaf diseases and (2) it can be used as a virtual assistant for a field pathologist to distinguish among classes with similar symptoms. Since dealing with classes with similar-looking symptoms is not well studied, there is no benchmark database for this purpose. We prepared a dataset of 11 similar-looking classes and 5, 108 images for experimentation and have also made it publicly available. The results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other recent and state-of-the-art models in terms of the number of parameters, training &amp; inference time, and classification accuracy.},

To this end, this paper proposes an innovative approach that employs a wind power regression model which leverages external environmental information to predict the output power of wind turbines. The effectiveness of technological improvements can be evaluated by comparing the predicted output power with the measured output power. In this paper, a model called stacked LSTM networks with attention mechanisms is designed. In the proposed model, the stacked LSTM networks are used to enhance the nonlinear fitting ability and capture deeper features of the input sequence. Furthermore, temporal attention mechanisms are employed to make the model focus on important time-series information of the data. In addition, a hierarchical attention mechanism is designed to explore the correlation among the outputs of the stacked LSTM networks and enrich the model’s output information. The experiments on the data from a wind farm show that the proposed method outperforms various wind power prediction benchmarks, achieving lower RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of 142.82, 104.2, and 4.85%, respectively.},

Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are being used in a growing body of work on automated cyberbullying detection. Different machine learning methods, however, are unable to converge to the requisite accuracy. Thus, numerous classifier systems known as “ensemble learning” are proposed in order to improve predictive performance by aggregating the predictions from various models. In our proposed system, we use a novel method of detecting online harassment (cyberbullying) on the Instagram dataset. The attributes of abusive words are initially analyzed from feature selection and pre-trained word embedding language models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Embeddings from Language Models (ELMO). A knowledge-based frequent pattern method is used to find the intention of the harasser and is created by the Knowledge-BERT (K-BERT). The unsupervised approaches such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Frequent pattern growth (FP-Growth), and a clustering technique K-Means. The results from the detection models are ensembled using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classifying the categories of online harassment. The performance of the ensemble model is then cross-validated using machine learning metrics and compared with various existing techniques. An ensemble model performs better with a higher F1 score of 92.04% with less error rate in the classification of harassment categories.},

  abstract     = {In today’s digital age, log files are crucial. However, the conversion of text log files into images has only recently been developed. The security of log files is a major source of concern, and the security of the systems in which the logs are stored determines the safety of the log file in process mining. This calls for the first conversion of a text log file into an image file. Thus, this research aims to convert the log files into images in a mugshot database and detect illegal activity and criminals from the converted images employing a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The developed model has three stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, and detection and matching. The pre-processing was performed by min-max normalization, and in feature extraction, the deep learning method was used. Moreover, in the detection phase, CNN is employed for detecting illegal activities, and the matching process is performed for detecting illegal activities from converted images and criminals in the mugshot database. The model’s performance is evaluated in terms of precision, F1-score, recall, and accuracy values of 99.6%, 98.5%, 98.7%, and 99.8%, respectively. A further comparison has been performed to show the effectiveness of the suggested model over other methods.},

In this research work, a novel recommendation system called the Deep Knowledge Graph based Attribute Preserving Recommendation (DKG-APR) is presented to analyze massive data and provide personalized recommendations to users. The Deep Knowledge Graph for Recommendation System (DKG-RS) uses Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and attention mechanism to explicitly model high-order connections in knowledge graphs. According to empirical findings, Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) performs better than other state-of-the-art recommendation techniques like RippleNet and Neural FM. Additional research demonstrates the effectiveness of embedding propagation for high-order relation modeling and the advantages of the attention mechanism for interpretability.The results also show that user information is crucial in the recommendation system, as seen from the optimal node-drop-out ratio of 0.2, which led to the best recall value of 0.2 for all datasets.},

We firstly introduce the cognitive interval information and then naturally propose the cognitive uncertain information as an extension. The featured acceptance area provides more flexibility in uncertain information handling and it can be regarded as some specified uncertain range (versus the certainty degree in basic uncertain information). The new proposals have advantages in some uncertain decision making scenarios where intersubjectivity and interaction of decision makers play important roles. Besides, some basic structural properties are briefly discussed. Moreover, some motivational examples are presented to show its usage in group decision making to help automatically obtain consistency or consensus in aggregating the different individual evaluations.},

However, due to the complexity of the decision-making circumstance and individual subjectivity of DMs, they often provide inconsistent MP LPRs which often lead to unreasonable decision results. To solve this problem, this paper investigates a novel approach to GDM with MPLPRs based on consistency improvement and upgraded multiplicative data envelopment analysis (DEA) cross-efficiency. First, the concept of sequential consistency of MPLPR is defined. Then, a consistency improvement algorithm is proposed, which can convert any unacceptable consistent MPLPR into an acceptable one. Furthermore, we use geometric averages to transform MPLPR into multiplicative preference relation (MPR). Meanwhile, considering the conservative psychology of DMs, an upgraded multiplicative DEA cross-efficiency model based on the pessimistic criterion is constructed, which can derive the priority vector of MPLPR. Therefore, we can obtain the rational ranking results for all alternatives. Finally, a case analysis of emergency logistics under COVID-19 is provided to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {A smart city is a phenomenon that combines information technology with physical and social infrastructure to regulate a city’s cooperative intelligence. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are the fundamental technology that smart cities use to administer and sustain their service offerings. To decrease the network’s energy consumption, clustering and multihop routing algorithms have been suggested, verified, and put into practice in the literature. This inspiration led to the development of the “energy-aware clustered route approach” in the current study, which is suggested for WSNs in smart cities. The presented method focuses on choosing the right cluster heads (CHs) and the best pathways in a WSN. The presented model includes a fitness value-based clustering scheme for efficient CH selection to achieve this. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm is then used to carry out the routing operation. The suggested approach technique calculates a fitness function (FF) that consists of three variables, including node degree, base station distance, and residual energy. This fitness function aids in the WSN’s best route selection. Simulations were run to verify the presented model’s superiority in terms of network lifespan and energy efficiency, and the results demonstrated the model’s outstanding performance.},

A secure and effective technique is needed to prevent breaches and detect malicious applications. Through deep learning methods and neural networks, the earliest detection and classification of malware can be performed. Detection of Android malware is the process to identify malicious attackers and through the classification method of malware, the type is categorized as adware, ransomware, SMS malware, and scareware. Since there were several techniques employed so far for malware detection and classification, there were some limitations like a reduced rate of accuracy and so on. To overcome these limitations, a deep learning-based automated process is employed to identify the malware. In this paper, initially, the datasets are collected, and through the preprocessing method, the duplicate and noisy data are removed to improve accuracy. Then the separated malware and benign dataset from the preprocessing phase is dealt with in feature selection. The reliable features are extracted in this process by Meta-Heuristic Artificial Jellyfish Search Optimizer (MH-AJSO). Further by the process of classification, the type of malware is categorized. The classification method is performed by the proposed Dense Dilated ResNet101 (DDResNet101) classifier. According to the type of malware the breach is prevented and secured on the android device. Although several methods of malware detection are found in the android platform the accuracy is effectively derived in our proposed system. Various performance analysis is performed to compare the robustness of detection. The results show that better accuracy of 98% is achieved in the proposed model with effectiveness for identifying the malware and thereby breaches and intrusion can be prevented.},

First, the Drilling PMSM using Failure Mode Analysis (FMA) method is combined with the Risk Matrix (RM) approach to analyse the risk levels of risk factors individually. Next, the Borda number is introduced to compare the risk levels exactly. To execute a Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) of the system failure risk, a fuzzy relation matrix of risk factors is generated, and the weight of each risk component is calculated using importance analysis. The failure rate is then determined using fuzzy inference, and the Fault Tree (FT) is then built based on the risk variables. Fault tree analysis is used to compute the system failure rate, and the significance of the bottom event is evaluated. The Bayesian network (BN) is used to depict the Fuzzy Fault Tree (FFT) analysis. By utilizing Bayesian forward causal inference and reverse diagnostic inference to calculate the leaf node failure rate and root node posterior probability, the system’s weak points and potential failure causes are determined.},

During the process of product failure risk assessment, evaluated risk factors belong to the group of multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, including severit y, occurrence, and detection when failure occurs. However, the traditional risk ranking method does not consider the subjective and objective weights of the assessment factors, and during risk prediction, assessment, and control, some unknown information in many practical situations is included. These reasons may cause the risk assessment results to be biased. In order to effectively deal with the problem of risk assessment, this paper proposes a D numbers risk ranking method by considering subjective and objective weights between assessment factors under incomplete linguistic information. An illustrative example of screening unit failure risk assessment is used to explain and prove the rationality and correctness of the proposed method. Some risk ranking methods are compared with the proposed D numbers risk ranking method, and the simulation results present that the proposed ranking method handles the issue of incomplete information and provides more reasonable risk ranking results.},

  abstract     = {Coal is a vital basic energy source for any economy in the world, and our country is no exception. Our coal resources are abundant, with high production and demand, not comparable to oil and natural gas. The coal supply chain plays an equally important role in economic production, but unfortunately, the current coal supply chain is not focused on greening while creating profits. Unfortunately, the current coal supply chain does not focus on green production and energy conservation and emission reduction while creating profits, which has caused irreversible harm and loss to resources and environment. This has caused irreversible damage and loss to resources and the environment. The green supplier selection for coal enterprises is affirmed as multiple attribute decision making (MADM). In such paper, motivated by the idea of cosine similarity measure (CSM), the CSMs are extended to DVNSs and four CSMs are created under DVNSs. Then, two weighted CSMs are built for MADM under DVNSs. Finally, a numerical example for Green supplier selection for coal enterprises is affirmed and some comparative algorithms are produced to affirm the built method.},

Meanwhile, the covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is utilized to optimize the parameters of belief rule base model.

  abstract     = {Unexpected failure of production equipment may lead to fatal accidents and economic losses of the enterprise. It is important to find out the cause and reason as soon as possible and take appropriate maintenance measures. Condition monitoring is often applied to predict equipment failures based on certain parameters. Moreover, when the parts of the rotating machinery fail, the vibration signals collected by the sensors are often mixed with a large amount of noise, which will cause difficulties for the accuracy and generalization of traditional fault diagnosis models. How to extract more effective feature information from complex vibration signals is of indescribable importance for optimizing fault diagnosis models. In order to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis in manufacturing system, a deep neural network model was proposed, which was validated on a blower. First, the vibration signal was collected using the sensors mounted on the blower. Then, wavelet packet decomposition and fast fourier transform were applied for feature extraction. Deep learning model was built using keras to diagnose the blower. The stacked Autoencoder is adopted in the DNN for dimension reduction. The extracted features are fed into the Multilayer Perceptron for fault diagnosis. Experimental results show that the proposed deep neural network model is able to predict the degradation of the mechanical equipment with high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Fault diagnosis of rapier loom is an inevitable requirement to meet the demand of intelligent manufacturing. Facing the strong noise interference caused by complex working environment, accurate and reliable vibration signal detection of blade loom spindle is the key to realize the rapier loom fault diagnosis. This paper proposes a method to extract the spindle vibration signal of the rapier loom by Adaptive Piecewise Hybrid Stochastic Resonance (APHSR) after the Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN). Firstly, ICEEMDAN is used to pre-process the weak vibration signal containing noise, decompose the signal into multiple IMF components and display the high and low frequency signal characteristics of the original signal. Then, the energy density method and the correlation coefficient method are used to remove high and low noise, respectively, to filter the optimal IMF components, and then the signal containing valid information is reconstructed. Finally, the reconstructed signal is input to APHSR for noise-assisted enhancement after scale transformation to restore the faint vibration signal feature frequencies and achieve effective feature extraction. Through the simulation experiment and the engineering fault experiment analysis, comparing ICEEMDAN-APHSR with CEEMDAN-SR, ICEEMDAN-SR, CEEMDAN-APHSR methods. The difference between the spectrum amplitude, the spectrum amplitude and the maximum noise and the maximum signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the fault feature frequency of the rapier loom spindle bearing increased by 3.3668 dB,1.7205 dB,2.3952 dB, respectively. The results show that ICEEMDAN-APHSR method can accurately extract the fault feature frequency of the spindle bearing of rapier loom, and effectively solves the problem of extracting the weak vibration signal feature of rapier loom in the background of strong noise. This method is beneficial to the future research of rapier loom fault diagnosis, and is of great significance to promote the maintenance of loom equipment and production safety and quality.},

  abstract     = {DoS, GH, Sybil, Masquerading, Spoofing, Man in the Middle, etc. constantly attack IoT networks. Internal or external attacks reduce end-to-end delay, throughput, energy use, and other metrics. To counter these attacks, researchers have proposed a number of security &amp; privacy mechanisms with varying computational complexity and security levels. Immutability, traceability, transparency, and distributed nature make blockchain-based models secure. QoS depends on blockchain length, so these models aren’t scalable. Researchers say sidechaining improves QoS while remaining secure. Splitting or merging complex sidechains requires machine learning. Low-power IoT networks can’t use models. This text suggests a lightweight MGWO Model that helps establish initial routes by choosing high-trust nodes, reducing sidechaining power consumption, and incorporating fault-aware trust establishment. MGWO Model determines blockchain piece count for high QoS. MGWO Model uses Q-Learning to detect network faults. Fault identification is controlled by a stochastically modelled and activated Intrinsic Genetic Algorithm (IGA). Q-Learning, MGWO, and IGA can mitigate Sybil, Masquerading, Grey Hole, DDoS, and MITM attacks. Even when attacked, the proposed model maintains high QoS, improving real-time deployment efficiency. The proposed model improves energy efficiency by 15.9%, throughput by 10.6%, communication speed by 8.3%, and packet delivery by 0.8% for different network scenarios.},

In this method, the notion of Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic sets (PFLSs) is first introduced by combining the linguistic fuzzy sets (LFSs) and the Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs). Then, the axiomatic definitions of Pythagorean fuzzy entropy and Pythagorean fuzzy similarity measure are developed to measure the degree of uncertainty and similarity between two Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic values (PFLVs). The PFLVs can be expressed by the linguistic membership degree (LMD) and linguistic non-membership degree (LNMD). In addition, we construct two new information measure formulas based on exponential function. Through a series of proofs, we verify that they satisfy the axiomatic conditions of entropy and similarity measure of Pythagorean fuzzy language respectively. On this basis, we research the relationship between the two information measures. Finally, we present a novel Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic MADM model. An example for evaluating performance of new energy battery supplier is given to explain the effectiveness of the newly-developed approach. The stability and validity of the newly-developed approach is performed by sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis.},

The research methodology discusses classical and modified SVM polynomial methods by R programming, and uses performance profiles to create the most preferable methods. It offers a new algorithm called an accurate evaluating algorithm as the way to construct the modified SVM polynomial method. The classical SVM polynomial method is also represented as the main idea in finding the modified polynomial SVM method. Model Performance Evaluation (MPE), Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs) Curve, Area Under Curve (AUC), partial AUC (pAUC), smoothing, confidence intervals, and thresholds are further named an accurate evaluating algorithm, employed to build the modified SVM polynomial method.

Performance profiles show numerical comparisons based on both methods involving insurance data also displayed in this paper. It can be concluded that applying an accurate evaluating algorithm on the modified SVM polynomial method will improve the data accuracy up to 86% via computing time and iterations compared to the classical SVM polynomial method, which is only 79%. This accurate evaluating algorithm can be applied to various large-sized data by utilizing R programming with changing any suitable kernels for that data.

  abstract     = {Owing to the lack of information, it is more realistic that the sum of probabilities is less than or equal to one in the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements (P-HFEs). Probabilistic-normalization method and cardinal-normalization method are common processing methods for the P-HFEs with incomplete information. However, the existed probabilistic-normalization method of sharing the remaining probabilities will lose information and change the information integrity of the P-HFEs. The first existed cardinal-normalization method of adding maximum or minimum membership degree with probability zero are influenced by the subjectivity of the decision makers. And the second existed cardinal-normalization method named as reconciliation method only applicable to the P-HFEs with complete information. Aiming at solving those shortcomings, we propose a possibility degree method based on a novel cardinal-normalization method for the sake of comparing the P-HFEs in pairs. In the process of comparison, the information integrity remains unchanged. Then, we propose a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, where the attribute weight is determined by entropy measures of the integration results. Finally, an application case in green logistics area is given for the sake of illustrating the efficiency of the proposed method, where the evaluation values are given in the P-HFEs form with incomplete information. Numerical and theoretical results show that a MCDM problem based on the proposed cardinal-normalization method and possibility degree method have a wide range of application.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series anomaly detection has made significant progress and has been studied in many fields. One of the difficulties in time-series data analysis is the complex nonlinear dependencies between multiple time steps and multiple variables. Therefore, detecting anomalies in these data is challenging. Although many studies used classical attention mechanisms to model the temporal patterns of data, few have combined multiple attention mechanisms and analyzed the data’s temporal characteristics and feature correlations. Therefore, we propose an autocorrelation and attention mechanism-based anomaly detection (ACAM-AD) framework that combines an autocorrelation model based on the Autoformer model, which is superior to the self-attention mechanism, a multi-head graph attention network, and a dot-product attention mechanism to model the complex dependencies of data considering temporal and feature dimensions. The autoregressive model is parallelized with the neural network, and a sparse autocorrelation mechanism and sparse graph attention network are used to reduce model complexity. Experiments on public datasets show that the model is effective and performs better than the baseline model.},

The recent advances in DL technologies contribute towards improved performance for carrying out computer aided medical image analysis and disease diagnosis. The key benefit of AI in processing of medical big data offers spectacular insights into the hierarchal relationships that exist among data which can be algorithmically explored thus replacing the tedious manual processes to extract and localize specific areas of interests in medical images thus considerably changing the way medicine has been practiced so far. In bio medical related clinical applications, there is a constant demand pertaining the research and development with respect to deploying AI as a mainstream tool to perform several medical imaging activities like analysis, diagnosis, segmentation as well as classification. The increased usage of electronic health records and medical images being its integral component the need for appropriate and efficient AI assisted medical image analysis system that takes care of accurate and automated decision making could be of great help to radiologists and medical practitioners. Molecular image analysis is a dynamic field that makes use of ML and DL algorithms that utilizes labeled and structured information which also proves to be helpful to the patients as they serve as an initial interface before further diagnosis and treatments. Thus our research aims to offer a novel and efficient AI based medical analysis system that can assist clinical practitioners to focus on enhancing the disease diagnosis through DL based medical image analysis and decision making. In addition, we also address specific challenges related to disease diagnosis and propose novel GAN model for improved diagnosis and implementation.

At present, the basic pension insurance system for urban and rural residents is not perfect, and there is still a great lag in the formulation of cross-system and cross-regional policies. There are differences in treatment between groups, between regions and between urban and rural areas. The coverage is not comprehensive enough and there are still some people who are not included in the basic protection system, etc. People urgently need a social pension insurance system that can provide reliable and sustainable protection in their old age. The operational efficiency evaluation of urban and rural residents’ basic pension insurance systems is viewed as the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). In this paper, the triangular fuzzy neutrosophic numbers grey relational analysis (TFNN-GRA) method is built based on the traditional grey relational analysis (GRA) and triangular fuzzy neutrosophic sets (TFNSs). Finally, a numerical example for operational efficiency evaluation of urban and rural residents’ basic pension insurance systems has been given and some comparisons are used to illustrate advantages of 2TLNN-GRA method.},

The former head coach of Chinese men’s basketball team diagnosed the biggest problem of Chinese men’s basketball team and Chinese youth men’s basketball team is the poor quality of endurance. It is especially important to strengthen the endurance training of our basketball players and improve their endurance level. However, from the current situation, the teams in the training due to the lack of standards for endurance quality training has led to a great blindness in endurance quality training. The endurance quality level evaluation of young male basketball players is a classic multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) issue with vague, inconsistent, and indeterminate information. The 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic sets (2TLNSs) is an appropriate form to express the indeterminate decision-making information in the endurance quality level evaluation of young male basketball players. Therefore, in this paper, the 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic numbers CLVA (2TLNN-CLVA) is built based on traditional close value (CLVA) method and applies it to evaluate the endurance quality level of young male basketball players. Finally, a numerical example for evaluating the endurance quality level of young male basketball players has been given and some decision comparisons are also conducted to further illustrate the advantages of the 2TLNN-CLVA method.},

  abstract     = {The security defenses that are not comparable to sophisticated adversary tools, let the cloud as an open environment for attacks and intrusions. In this paper, an intelligent protection framework for intrusion detection in a cloud computing environment based on a covariance matrix self-adaptation evolution strategy (CMSA-ES) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is proposed. The proposed framework constructs an optimal intrusion detector by using CMSA-ES algorithm which adjusts the best parameter set for the attack detector. Moreover, the proposed framework uses a MEREC-VIKOR, a hybrid standardized evaluation technique. MEREC-VIKOR generates the own performance metrics (S, R, and Q) of the proposed framework which is a combination of multi-conflicting criteria. The proposed framework is evaluated for attack detection by using CICIDS 2017 dataset. The experiments show that the proposed framework can detect cloud attacks accurately with low S (utility), R (regret), and Q (integration between S and R). The proposed framework is analyzed with respect to several evolutionary algorithms such as GA, IGASAA, and CMA-ES. The performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed framework that depends on CMSA-ES converges faster than the other evolutionary algorithms such as GA, IGASAA, and CMA-ES. The outcomes also demonstrate that the proposed model is comparable to the state-of-the-art techniques.},

To address this, a Transformer-based multi-scale attention and boundary enhancement with long-range dependency (MSBE) network is proposed in this paper. A multi-scale attention enhancement module (MSAEM) is designed to reduce the redundant or noisy features and generate a high-quality feature representation by integrating multiple attentional features with diverse perspectives. The high-quality features are then fed into the triple Transformer encoder embedding module (TEM) to enhance high-level semantic features by learning long-range dependencies across layers. In the decoder part, a cross-layer feature fusion module (CLFFM) and boundary enhancement module (BEM) are designed to improve the effect of feature fusion and get accurate prediction results.

Their comparison faces big challenges: 1) with different complexity; 2) with significant phase shift in one series or shift∖on the time axis. Existing methods work well for periodic time-series data, but fail to produce satisfactory results in complex time-series. In this paper, we introduce a novel distance function based on the evolution rule for complex time series comparison. Here, the evolution rule, as the innate generative mechanism of time series, is creatively used to characterize complicated dynamics from complex time series. The comparison includes different level comparisons: the coarse level is to compare the difference in complexity, and the fine level is to compare the difference in actual evolution behavior. The proposed method is inspired by the observation that similar sequences come from the same source, e.g. a person’s heart, in the case of ECG, thus two similar series will have the same innate generative mechanism. The performance has been verified by the conducting experiments, and the experiment results show that the proposed method is superior to the previously existing methods in clustering and classification on some real data sets.},

Firstly, an algorithm of centralized pathfinding is utilized to plan the optimal paths of all agents. Afterwards, each of the agents updates the local motion pattern to tracks its own planned waypoints with the obstacle avoidance in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, to resolve unavoidable egoistic conflicts occurring in the decentralized scheme, a centralized intervener with the route replanning is invoked to coach the involved agents to abort the existing deadlocks. Bounded by an amount of time, the performances of the proposed and benchmarked algorithms are simulated on the same instance, from the evaluated testbeds that consists of various maps and scenarios. In the simulations, it is proved that this work outperforms other benchmarked algorithms for all presented instances in the term of the success rate.

Nevertheless, the traditional FMEA approach has been extensively criticized for many deficiencies in coping with risk evaluation and prioritization problem s under inter-uncertain environments. To overcome the limitations, in this paper, a synthesized risk priority calculation framework is proposed for FMEA by combining the gained and lost dominance score (GLDS) method, the combination ordered weighted averaging (C-OWA) operator, and Fermatean fuzzy set (FFS). Firstly, we use FFS to express the experts’ uncertain risk evaluation information which can depict the fuzziness and ambiguity of the information. Secondly, the C-OWA operator combined with FFS is introduced to build the group risk matrix which can provide a more reasonable risk analysis result. Then, the developed GLDS method with FFS is presented to calculate the risk priority of each failure mode which takes both individual and group risk attitudes into consideration. Finally, a medical device risk analysis case is introduced to demonstrate the proposed FMEA framework. We also perform comparison analyses to confirm the effectiveness and rationality of the hybrid risk prioritization framework for FMEA under a complex and uncertain situation.},

In anonymous platforms such as the dark web or deep web of Tor, detecting the attacker or phishing attacks is a much more complicated practice. Generic phishing attacks can be easy to spot. Today’s challenge is detecting the various attacks in the anonymous network is very hard. The intelligent factor of attacks can bypass traditional detection solutions. To solve the problem of complications in the Tor Network, this work focuses on the development of automated detection of vulnerable attacks in phishing-based Tor hidden services. The proposed model initially divides the attack parameters into three categories into Class A, Class B, and Class C based on technical perspectives and some defined threshold values. Next, the class A attacks (i.e. top level domain and protocol similarity) attacks are detected by a random forest (RF) classifier. Then, the class B attacks can be identified by the convolutional neural network (CNN). Finally, the LSTM model is applied for the accurate classification of multiple attacks in the Tor network. The experimental validation of the proposed model is tested using the CIRCL and AIL datasets. The experimental values highlighted the promising performance of the proposed model over other methods with a maximum overall detection accuracy of 95.60% and 95.77% on CIRCL and AIL datasets respectively. Therefore, the proposed model effectively detects multiple attacks in the Tor network under dynamic and real-time environments.},

The goal of the venture to be concentrating because of working parameters of EDM for machining of silicon nitride-titanium nitride in the machining qualities with copper electrode, for example input Spark on time (S on ), current (I p ), Spark off time (S off ), spark gap and dielectric pressure on the metal removal rate (MRR) and Electrode Wear Rate (EWR) were analyzed. Subsequently, using Taguchi analysis of various plots like Mean effect plots, Interaction plots, and contour plots, performance characteristics are looked at in relation to multiple process factors. Fuzzy logic and Regression analysis is utilized to combine various reactions into a solitary trademark record known as the Multi Response Performance Index (MRPI).The trial and anticipated qualities were in a decent programming instrument for discovering the MRPI esteem. For numerous performance aspects, such as material removal rate, electrode wear rate and so on, the optimal process parameter combination was established using fuzzy logic analysis. The key process factors, which included spark off time and current, were found using an ANOVA based on a fuzzy algorithm. Topography on machined surface and cross-sectional view of conductive Si 3 N 4 -TiN composite and surface characteristics of machined electrode is examined by SEM analysis and identified the best hole surface and worst hole surface. Sensitivity analysis is being utilized to determine how much the input values, such as Ip, S on and S off , will need to alter in order to get the desired, optimal result. In the complexity analysis, each constraint of the machine, composite and process is addressed. Future researches might look into various electrodes to assess geometrical tolerances including angularity, parallelism, total run out, flatness, straightness, concentricity, and line profile employing other optimization methodologies to achieve the best outcome. The findings of the confirmatory experiment have been established, indicating that it may be feasible to successfully strengthen the spark eroding technique.},

Hence, in this study, authors made an attempt to develop an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) based classification model that aims to predict the usefulness of product reviews with higher accuracy on two different types of data sets (i.e., search product and experienced product). In our proposed study, to determine the usefulness of a review in terms of structural, linguistic, sentimental, lexical, and voting feature sets, we build a deep learning model to predict the review helpfulness as a binary classification problem. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, F1 score etc. and had been compared against the various leading machine learning (ML) state of art models viz., K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Linear regression (LR), Gaussian Naive Bays (GNB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) etc. The results demonstrate that CNN achieved better classification performance in comparison to other state of art models, with highest accuracy of 99.26% and 98.97%, precision of 99% and 99.01%, F1 score of 99% and 99.89%, AUC of 0.9999 and 0.9998, Average Precision (AP) of 0.9999 and 0.9997 and recall of 100% and 100% for two different amazon product datasets.},

  abstract     = {The fault diagnosis of vessel power equipment is established by the manual work with low efficiency. The knowledge graph(KG) usually is applied to extract the experience and operation logic of controllers into knowledge, which can enrich the means of fault judgment and recovery decision. As an important part of KG building, the performance of named entity recognition (NER) is critical to the following tasks. Due to the challenges of information insufficiency and polysemous words in the entities of vessel power equipment fault, this study adopts the fusion model of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), revised Convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and conditional random field (CRF). Firstly, the adjusted BERT and revised CNN are respectively adopted to acquire the multiple embeddings including semantic information and contextual glyph features. Secondly, the local context features are effectively extracted by adopting the channel-wised fusion structures. Finally, BiLSTM and CRF are respectively adopted to obtain the semantic information of the long sequences and the prediction sequence labels. The experimental results show that the performance of NER by the proposed model outperforms other mainstream models. Furthermore, this work provides the foundation of the tasks of intelligent diagnosis and NER in other fields.},

  abstract     = {A spectrum-image based representation of machine vibration signals with deep convolution neural network is proposed for machine fault classification in which the convolution layer is used for automatic feature extraction as an alternate to the conventional feature-based methods. Two different forms of spectrum representations are proposed, one based on the short time Fourier transform of the original signals and the other based on the short time Fourier transform of the intrinsic mode functions acquired by empirical mode decomposition. Empirical mode decomposition has its own merits in discriminating non stationary signals and the novelty of the work is to use the short time Fourier transform of intrinsic mode functions with deep convolution neural network model. The classification and validation accuracy of the model are investigated with respect to epochs. It is demonstrated that both spectrum-based techniques perform good with 100% model accuracies in a numerical experiment of binary classification on a bearing dataset that comprises of normal and faulty signals. In another experiment using milling data set, short time Fourier transform of intrinsic mode functions representation performs better with 100% training accuracy, F1 score of 0.8933 which is better than that of using short time Fourier transform of raw signals whose training accuracy is 64% and F1 score of 0.7486. The numerical study shows that the empirical mode decomposition based spectrum representation delivers the highest accuracy in the learning model obviating the necessity for independent feature extraction, feature selection, and dimension reduction. The numerical experiment is extended using empirical mode decomposition based spectrums for multiple class classification problems in bearing dataset. The confusion matrix obtained for 10 classes, shows that validation accuracy is 100% for all classes. The performance comparison throws light on the merits of empirical mode decomposition spectrum method over other state of the art methods.},

  abstract     = {Considering the heterogeneity, diffusive shape, and complex background of tumors, automatic segmentation of hepatic lesions in computed tomography (CT) images has been considered a challenging task. The performance of existing methods remains subject to segmentation uncertainties, especially in tumor boundary regions. The pixel information in these regions will be affected by both sides, thereby exposing the segmentation results to missing marks. To this end, a new network architecture named Two Direction Segmentation U-Net (TDS-U-Net) is hereby designed based on the classic Attention U-Net to tackle this problem. As the most important blocks of the Attention U-Net network, attention gates (AGs) focus on the target structures of different shapes and sizes. In the last layer of TDS-U-Net, two dichotomous convolutional networks are applied to obtain the segmentation maps of the liver and the tumor respectively. Superimposing two segmented maps to obtain the final image addresses the above problems. The entire structure has been verified on two widely accepted public CT datasets, LiTS17 and KiTS19. Compared with the state of the art, this method exhibits superior performance and excellent shape extractions with high detection sensitivity, perfectly demonstrating its effectiveness in medical image segmentation.},

Several methods like wavelet filter banks, time series methods, Neural networks was developed for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, still the accuracy can be improved. Less works is carried out for hardware implementation for syndrome detectors. This proposed work represents the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) implementation of the hybrid method using Convolutional Recurrent neural network and Independent Components Analysis (ICA). The architecture extracts the ccomplex features from ECG (Electrocardiogram) samples. The hybrid Statistical and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Architecture implementation in a real time hardware detects the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome presented. The proposed method can be implemented in MATLAB, Embedded and DSP (Digital Signal Processor). But, the FPGAs consume less power computationally efficient. Since, ICA is an efficient method due to its blind source separation property accumulate the extraction of features accurate described. The mathematical model for the analysis of ECG signal using RNN is analyzed and based on that the proposed model is selected. On investigation the hybrid method using the statistical and neural network model is efficient in the analysis of biomedical signal especially ECG.

Stereo image quality assessment (SIQA) has gained more attention to guarantee that customers have a positive watching experience. In order to provide the highest level of experience, it is necessary to develop a quality evaluation mechanism for stereoscopic content that is both dependable and precise. A full-reference method for SIQA is presented in this paper. Compared to previous measures, this method gives users more freedom to use distorted pixel metrics and edge similarity. The binocular summation map is calculated by adding the left and right images for a stereo pair. Improved gradient similarity based distorted pixel measure (SGSDM) is used to calculate the quality of binocular summation. The scored 3D LIVE IQA database is used to evaluate the correlation of the proposed metric with the DMOS subjective score given by the database.

The autoencoder is used for features extraction of linear separability in the reconstructed feature space. Experiment results on real datasets show that the proposed method reaches up 0.9777 and 0.7112 on the low-dimensional and high-dimensional datasets in extracted accuracies, respectively, and also outperforms competitors. Results also confirm that compared with feature metric-based methods and deep network architectures-based method, the linear separabilities of those features extracted by distance metric-based methods win over them. More importantly, the linear separabilities of those features obtained by evaluating distance similarity of the data are better than those obtained by evaluating feature importance of data. We also demonstrate that the data distribution in the feature space reconstructed by a homeomorphic transformation can be closer to the original data distribution.},

The existing IoT authentication schemes either using two-factor(Username, password) or multi-factor (username, password, biometric) to authenticate a user. Typically the structural characteristics-based biometric trait like Face, Iris, Palm print or finger print is used as a additional factor. There are chances that these biometrics can be fabricated.

Secondly, K-means method was applied to determine the value ranges of the selected parameters. The selected parameters and corresponding value ranges were combined to input into Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System for obtaining predicted PPV. Totally, 280 samples were collected from a blasting site. 260 out of them were used to train the proposed method and 20 were assigned for test. The proposed method was tested in the comparison with empirical equation USBM, multiple linear regression analysis, pure Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System in terms of the difference between predicted PPV and measured PPV, coefficient of correlation, root-mean-square error, and mean absolute error.

However, most of the existing SLAM algorithms have low localization accuracy in dynamic scenes. Therefore, a visual SLAM algorithm combining semantic segmentation and motion consistency detection is proposed. Firstly, the RGB images are segmented by SegNet network, the prior semantic information is established and the feature points of high-dynamic objects are removed; Secondly, motion consistency detection is carried out, the fundamental matrix is calculated by the improved Random Sample Consistency (RANSAC) algorithm, the abnormal feature points are output by the epipolar geometry method, and the feature points of low-dynamic objects are eliminated by combining the prior semantic information. Thirdly, the static feature points are used for pose estimation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested on the TUM dataset, the algorithm in this paper reduces the average RMSE of ORB-SLAM2 by 93.99% in highly dynamic scenes, which show that the algorithm can effectively improve the localization accuracy of the visual SLAM system in dynamic scenes.},

  abstract     = {Skin disease is currently considered to be one of the most common diseases in the globe. Most of the human population has experienced it at some point but not all skin illnesses are as severe as others. There are some diseases that are symptomless or show fewer symptoms. Skin cancer is a potentially fatal outcome of serious skin illnesses that might develop if they are not detected in time. Due to the fact that medical professionals aren’t always quick or reliable enough to make a proper diagnosis. There is a hefty price tag attached to employing sophisticated equipment. Therefore, we propose a system capable of classifying skin diseases using deep learning approaches, such as CNN architecture and six preset models including MobileNet, VGG19, ResNet, EfficientNet, Inception, and DenseNet. Acne, blisters, cold sores, psoriasis, and vitiligo are some of the most often seen skin conditions, thus we scoured the web resources for relevant photographs of these conditions. We have applied data augmentation methods to extend the size of the dataset and include more image variations. In the validation dataset, we achieved an accuracy rate of approx 99 percent, while in the test dataset; we achieved an accuracy rate of approx 90 percent. Our proposed method would help to diagnose skin diseases in a faster and more cost-effective way.},

The model utilizes the strong global optimization capability of GA for tuning the ensemble structure. Compared with the traditional ensemble learning model, GAEEM has three main advantages: 1) It is set to address the problems of information leakage in the traditional Stacking strategy and overfitting in the Blending strategy. 2) It uses a GA to optimize the combination of base learners and determine the sub. 3) The feature dimension of the data used in this layer is extended based on the optimal base learner combination prediction information data, which can reduce the risk of underfitting and increase prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the R 2 performance of the model in the six cities data set is higher than all the comparison models by 0.18 on average. The MAE and MSE are lower than 42.98 and 42,689.72 on average. The fitting performance is more stable in each data set and shows good generalization, which can predict the epidemic spread trend of each city more accurately.},

  abstract     = {Security, secrecy, and authenticity problems have arisen as a result of the widespread sharing of medical images in social media. Copyright protection for online photo sharing is becoming a must. In this research, a cutting-edge method for embedding encrypted watermarks into medical images is propo sed. The proposed method makes use of fuzzy-based ROI selection and wavelet-transformation to accomplish this. In the first step of the process, a fuzzy search is performed on the original picture to locate relevant places using the center region of interest (RoI) and the radial line along the final intensity. The suggested method takes a digital picture and divides it into 4×4 non-overlapping blocks, with the intent of selecting low information chunks for embedding in order to maximize invisibility. By changing the coefficients, a single watermark bit may be inserted into both the left and right singular SVD matrices. The absence of false positives means the suggested technique can successfully integrate a large amount of data. Watermarks are encrypted using a pseudorandom key before being embedded. Discrete wavelet transform saliency map, block mean method, and cosine functions are used to construct an adaptively-generated pseudo-random key from the cover picture. Images uploaded to social media platforms must have a high degree of invisibility and durability. These watermarking features, however, come with a price. The optimal scaling factor is used to strike a balance between the two in the proposed system. Furthermore, the suggested scheme’s higher performance is confirmed by comparison with the latest state-of-the-art systems.},

In the present communication, a new way of defining Picture Fuzzy Hypersoft Set (PFHSS) has been presented which contains an additional capacity of accommodating the components of neutral membership (abstain) and refusal compared to Intuionistic Fuzzy Hypersoft Set (IFHSS). The main objective of the present study is to establish the novelty of PFHSS with some of the basic operations and introduce various important aggregation operators. Some of the important properties and operational laws related to the introduced picture fuzzy hypersoft weighted average/ordered weighted average operator (PFHSWA/PFHSOWA) and weighted geometric/ordered weighted geometric operator (PFHSWG/PFHSOWG) have been proved in detail. On the basis of these aggregation operators and obtained results, a new algorithm for solving a decision-making problem, involving the multi-sub attributes and their parametrization in the shade of abstain and refusal feature, has been proposed. A numerical example of the selection process of employees for a company has been solved in order to suitably ensure and validate the implementation of the proposed methodology. Some of the advantageous features of the proposed notions and algorithm have been listed along with the comparative analysis in contrast with the existing literature. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed notion and methodology has been duly concluded with the scope for future work.},

  abstract     = {Aluminum electrolytic capacitor (AEC) is one of the most pivotal components that affect the reliability of power electronic systems. The electrolyte evaporation and dielectric degradation are the two main reasons for the parametric degradation of AEC. Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction for AEC is beneficial for obtaining the health state in advance and making reasonable maintenance strategies before the system suffers shutdown malfunction, which can increase the reliability and safety. In this paper, a hybrid machine learning (ML) model with GRU and PSO-SVR is proposed to realize the RUL prediction of AEC. The GRU is used for the recursive multi-step prediction of AEC to model the times series of AEC, SVR optimized by PSO for hyper-parameters is applied for error compensation caused by recursive GRU. Finally, the proposed model is validated by two kinds of data sets with accelerated degradation experiments. Compared with the other methods, the results show that the proposed scheme can obtain greater prediction performance index of RUL under different prediction time points, which can support the technology of health management for power electronic system.},

In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Attentive Graph Convolutional Network for Cross-Domain Recommendation (DAG4CDR). Specifically, we integrate the source and target domain’s interaction data to construct a unified user-item bipartite graph and then perform GCN propagation on the graph to learn user and item embeddings. Over the unified graph, the interaction data from both domains can be leveraged to learn user and item embeddings via information propagation. In the embedding aggregation phase, the messages passed from different items of two domains to users are weighted by a designed dual attention mechanism, which considers the contributions of different items from both node- and domain-level. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method on several publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model on preference modeling for both common and non-common users.},

Reinforcement learning learns by interacting with the environment, which is a good way to realize the independent management of the data center. In this paper, a overall energy consumption method for data center based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to achieve collaborative energy saving of data center task scheduling and refrigeration equipment. A new multi-agent architecture is proposed to separate the training process from the execution process, simplify the interaction process during system operation and improve the operation effect. In the deep learning stage, a hybrid deep Q network algorithm is proposed to optimize the joint action value function of the data center and obtain the optimal strategy.

  abstract     = {Traffic speed prediction is a crucial task of the intelligent traffic system. However, due to the highly nonlinear temporal patterns and non-static spatial dependence of traffic data, timely and accurate traffic forecasting remains a challenge. The existing methods usually use a static adjacency matrix to model spatial dependence while ignoring the spatial dynamic characteristics of the road network.Meanwhile, the dynamic influence of different time steps on the prediction target is ignored. Thus, we propose a dynamic multi-graph convolution recurrent neural network (DMGCRNN), which models the dynamic correlations of road networks over time based on various information of road network. Dynamic correlation is an essential factor for accurate traffic prediction, because it reflects the change of the traffic conditions in real-time. In this model, we design a dynamic graph construction method, which utilizes the local temporal and spatial characteristics of each road segment to construct dynamic graphs. Then, a dynamic multi-graph convolution fusion module is proposed, which considers the dynamic characteristics of spatial correlations and global information to model the dynamic trend of spatial dependence. Moreover, by combing the global context information, temporal attention is provided to capture the dynamic temporal dependence among different time steps. The experimental results from two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Image semantic learning techniques are crucial for image understanding and classification. In social networks, image data is widely disseminated thanks to convenient acquisition and intuitive expression characteristics. However, due to the freedom of users to publish information, the image has apparent context dependence and semantic fuzziness, which brings difficulties to image representation learning. Fortunately, social attributes such as hashtags carry rich semantic relations, which can be conducive to understanding the meaning of images. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method named Social Heterogeneous Graph Networks (SHGN) for image semantic learning in social networks. First, a heterogeneous graph is built to expand image semantic relations by social attributes. Then the consistent semantic space is reconstructed through cross-media feature alignment. Finally, an image semantic extended learning network is designed to capture and integrate the social semantics and visual feature, which obtains a rich semantic representation of images from a social context. The experiments demonstrate that SHGN can achieve efficient image representation, and favorably against many baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {One of the most essential factors in classifying and qualitatively evaluating mangoes for various industrial uses is weight. To meet grading requirements during industrial processing, this paper presents an orientation-independent weight estimation method for the mango cultivar “Alphonso.” In this study, size and geometry are considered as key variables in estimating weight. Based on the visual fruit geometry, generalized hand-crafted local and global features, and conventional features are calculated and subjected to the proposed feature selection methodology for optimal feature identification. The optimal features are employed in regression analysis to estimate the predicted weight. Four regression models –MLR, Linear SVR, RBF SVR, and polynomial SVR—are used during the experimental trials. A self-collected mango database with two orientations per sample is obtained using a CCD camera. Three different weight estimation techniques are used in the analysis concerning orientation 1, orientation 2, and combining both orientations. The SVR RBF kernel yields a higher correlation between predicted and actual weights, and experiments demonstrate that orientation 1 is symmetric to orientation 2. By exhibiting a correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0.99 with SVR-RBF for weight estimation using both orientations as well as individual orientations, it is observed that the correlation between predicted and estimated weights is nearly identical},

Studying fire accidents in high-rise buildings is crucial because they can result in harm to people’s health, fatalities, property damage, and pollution. The number of accidental fires in buildings is very large since it is difficult to isolate a single cause and all processes and control measures are not appropriately implemented. This paper proposes a fuzzy-bow tie approach to evaluating the risk of fire accidents by taking into account the various fire sources and effects. The fourteen-floor high-rise residential building is used as a case study for the proposed fuzzy bow tie approach. The fuzzy fault tree approach estimates that there is a 0.0968% risk of a fire accident occurring in that high-rise building, with a possibility for 9 out of 100 accidental fires annually. The fuzzy event tree model predicts that loss of life and loss of property are the most likely consequences of an accidental fire. Accordingly, mitigation strategies can be developed by building officials and fire safety practitioners.},

  abstract     = {Embedding similarity-based methods obtained good results in unsupervised anomaly detection (AD). This kind of method usually used feature vectors from a model pre-trained by ImageNet to calculate scores by measuring the similarity between test samples and normal samples. Ultimately, anomalous regions are localized based on the scores obtained. However, this strategy may lead to a lack of sufficient adaptability of the extracted features to the detection of anomalous patterns for industrial anomaly detection tasks. To alleviate this problem, we design a novel anomaly detection framework, MFFA, which includes a pseudo sample generation (PSG) block, a local-global feature fusion perception (LGFFP) block and an anomaly map compensation (AMC) block. The PSG block can make the pre-trained model more suitable for real-world anomaly detection tasks by combining the CutPaste augmentation. The LGFFP block aggregates shallow and deep features on different patches and inputs them to CaiT (Class-attention in image Transformers) to guide self-attention, effectively interacting local and global information between different patches, and the AMC block can compensate each other for the two anomaly maps generated by the nearest neighbor search and multivariate Gaussian fitting, improving the accuracy of anomaly detection and localization. In experiments, MVTec AD dataset is used to verify the generalization ability of the proposed method in various real-world applications. It achieves over 99.1% AUROCs in detection and 98.4% AUROCs in localization, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The fraud problem has drastically increased with the rapid growth of online lending. Since loan applications, approvals and disbursements are operated online, deceptive borrowers are prone to conceal or falsify information to maliciously obtain loans, while lenders have difficulty in identifying fraud without direct contacts and lack binding force on customers’ loan performance, which results in the frequent occurrence of fraud events. Therefore, it is significant for financial institutions to apply valuable data and competitive technologies for fraud detection to reduce financial losses from loan scams. This paper combines the advantages of statistical methods and ensemble learning algorithms to design the grouped trees and weighted ensemble algorithm (GTWE), and establishes fraud prediction models for online loans based on mobile application usage behaviors(App behaviors) by logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory (LSTM) and the GTWE algorithm, respectively. The experimental results show that the fraud prediction model based on the GTWE algorithm achieves outstanding classification effect and stability with satisfactory interpretability. Meanwhile, the fraud probability of customers detected by the fraud prediction model is as high as 84.19%, which indicates that App behaviors have a considerable impact on predicting fraud in online loan application.},

In order to improve the utilization of health management knowledge, an ontology-based knowledge representation method is proposed to describe knowledge in a unified and standardized way, and the classical ontology is extended to express the uncertain knowledge in the field of health management. In addition, to improve the maintenance and knowledge updating efficiency, a global ontology model and a hierarchy, time and activity (HTA) ontology model are constructed.

Chaos theory provides a practical approach to analyzing financial systems. The chaotic systems have unpredictable random characteristics that help to analyze the financial systems better. Recently, type-3 (T3) fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) have been developed for high-uncertain systems. T3-FLSs provide a reliable tool to cope with high-noisy environments. In T3-FLSs, the upper/lower bounds of uncertainties are fuzzy values. This property results in a strong tool to model more levels of uncertainties. Control, modeling, and forecasting accuracy in financial systems are so important. Then, better systems with higher accuracy are required. In this paper, a new T3-FLS based controller is introduced for chaotic financial systems. By solving a Riccati equation, sufficient conditions are concluded for optimality and robustness. T3-FLSs are learned to minimize the error and stabilize the whole system. A new optimal learning rules are extracted for T3-FLSs. Various benchmark chaotic model of financial systems are considered for examining the efficacy of the introduced approach, and the excellent response and superiority of the suggested approach is verified. Also, a comparison with other methods demonstrates the better efficiency of the suggested scheme.},

  abstract     = {The generalized neighborhood system-based rough set is an important extension of Pawlak’s rough set. The rough sets based on generalized neighborhood systems include two basic models: optimistic and pessimistic rough sets. In this paper, we give a further study on pessimistic rough sets. At first, to regain some properties of Pawlak’s rough sets that are lost in pessimistic rough sets, we introduce the mediate, transitive, positive (negative) alliance conditions for generalized neighborhood systems. At second, some approximation operators generated by special generalized neighborhood systems are characterized, which include serial, reflexive, symmetric, mediate, transitive, and negative alliance generalized neighborhood systems and their combinations (e.g. reflexive and transitive). At third, we discuss the topologies generated by the upper and lower approximation operators of the pessimistic rough sets. Finally, combining practical examples, we apply pessimistic rough sets to rule extraction of incomplete information systems. Particularly, we prove that different decision rules can be obtained when different neighborhood systems are chosen. This enables decision makers to choose decisions based on personal preferences.},

  abstract     = {The minimal energy sensor nodes are critical to the long-term viability of any wireless sensor network WSN). Clustering is used for this purpose. Choosing an efficient Cluster Head (CH) is critical in such cluster-based networks, as they are accountable for aggregating and transmitting data from their associate nodes to the base station (BS). A Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is proposed in this work to improve the selection of CH. As part of the fitness function, nodes’ residual energy, average energy, and inter-cluster distance are all considered. In an effort to further reduce energy consumption, a GAN routing method is proposed for use at the base station level for Efficient Energy. Simulations are used to evaluate the proposed ideal.The WSNs which require long life time with minimum cost sensors demand the proposed work. The research about the human unattainable places can be fit to necessitate this work. This method supports the maintenance of mines and petroleum refineries. In terms of energy consumption and network life expectancy, the results demonstrate a substantial improvement. And also, the proposed technique is analyzed and compared along with the existing approaches as Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (Security based (S-LEACH), Cluster based (C-LEACH, More Energy Efficient-LEACH) (ME-LEACH) schemes. The proposed method detects the best location of storage-nodes for the sensor network. There is no need of agitation on battery drain up of storage-nodes (because of wireless recharge) which is a highly energy spending unit. The proposed method improves the network lifetime by a significant level. The proposed method is best fit to mines, petroleum refineries, forest department and military. The proposed method behaves as not only better storage scheme but also best fit to retrieval schemes.},

First, some basic theories related to FNIFS are briefly introduced. In addition, the weights of the attributes are obtained objectively using the CRITIC weighting method. Then, the traditional TODIM method is extended to FNIFS to obtain the final order of alternatives. As a result, all alternatives can be ranked and the best one for the competitiveness assessment of regional financial centers can be identified.

The results show that the established algorithmic approach is useful.

  abstract     = {COVID-19 is a rapidly proliferating transmissible virus that substantially impacts the world population. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for fast testing, diagnosis, and treatment. However, there is a growing need for quick testing, diagnosis, and treatment. In order to treat infected individuals, stop the spread of the disease, and cure severe pneumonia, early covid-19 detection is crucial. Along with covid-19, various pneumonia etiologies, including tuberculosis, provide additional difficulties for the medical system. In this study, covid-19, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other specific diseases are categorized using Sharpened Cosine Similarity Network (SCS-Net) rather than dot products in neural networks. In order to benchmark the SCS-Net, the model’s performance is evaluated on binary class (covid-19 and normal), and four-class (tuberculosis, covid-19, pneumonia, and normal) based X-ray images. The proposed SCS-Net for distinguishing various lung disorders has been successfully validated. In multiclass classification, the proposed SCS-Net succeeded with an accuracy of 94.05% and a Cohen’s kappa score of 90.70%; in binary class, it achieved an accuracy of 96.67% and its Cohen’s kappa score of 93.70%. According to our investigation, SCS in deep neural networks significantly lowers the test error with lower divergence. SCS significantly increases classification accuracy in neural networks and speeds up training.},

  abstract     = {Approximate accuracy is an important concept in rough set theory, which is defined by upper and lower approximations. Generally speaking, the higher precision means the better application performance. The approximation accuracy can be improved by minimizing the upper approximation and maximizing the lower approximation. Recently, Zhou [ 52 ] introduced two types of fuzzy-covering based rough set models by using inclusion relation between fuzzy sets. In this paper, by replacing inclusion relation with implication degree, we investigate two new fuzzy covering-based rough set models. Compared with inclusion relationship, the inclusion degree can describe the contained relation between fuzzy sets in more detail. This makes our upper approximation smaller than Zhou’s upper approximation, while the lower approximation is larger than Zhou’s. Therefore, the approximate accuracy of our model is higher than that of Zhou. Furthermore, we apply the new model to the study of multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). Combined with the car buying problem, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and compare it with other methods. The results show that we can get the same optimal choice as other methods. However, according to Zhou’s model, we cannot get the optimal choice.},

First, the original a rtificial gorilla troop optimization algorithm is improved, which effectively improves the convergence speed and optimization accuracy of the algorithm. Secondly, the conventional Stochastic Configuration Networks (SCN) learning methodology is modified when the fault diagnosis model is constructed. The original SCN adopts point incremental approach to gradually add hidden nodes, while BSCN adopts block increment approach to learn features. It significantly accelerates training. MGTO algorithm is used to jointly optimize regularization parameter and scale factor in BSCN model, and the fault diagnosis model with the highest accuracy is constructed. The experimental results show that the accuracy of MGTO-BSCN for transformer fault diagnosis reaches 95.9%, which is 3.5%, 9.9% and 11.7% higher than BSCN fault diagnosis models optimized by GTO, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) respectively, reflecting the superiority of MGTO algorithm.

Various optimization techniques for avoiding obstacles and path planning problems have been proposed recently. But, the computation time for executing these techniques is comparatively higher and has lesser accuracy. In this paper, the State Estimation Obstacle Avoidance (SEOA) algorithm has been proposed for estimating the position and velocity of both of the wheels of the AMR. Moreover, this algorithm has been also applied in path planning for reaching the destination point in minimum computational time. Five different positions of static obstacle are demonstrated in a real time static environment where the proposed SEOA algorithm has been compared with state-of-the-art path planning algorithms such as A* and VFH. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm takes lesser computational time to generate the collision free path when compared to other mentioned algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series anomaly detection has been investigated extensively in recent years. Capturing long-term time series information is one of the challenges in this field. We propose a novel multivariate time series anomaly detection framework MTAD-TCGA comprising several modules that efficiently and accurately capture dependencies in long-term multivariate time series. The proposed model contains a temporal convolutional module and uses two parallel graph attention layers to learn the complex dependencies of time series in both the temporal and feature dimensions. A Gated Recurrent Unit layer, based on an improved attention mechanism, and an auto-regressive model is used for prediction, and the prediction model and reconstruction model are jointly optimized. Finally, the threshold is selected by extreme value theory, and then anomalies are identified. The experimental results on three public datasets show our framework is superior to other state-of-the-art models, achieving F1 scores uniformly at levels above 0.9, verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the MTAD-TCGA method.},

Not only is collusion an illegal act, but it may also lead to learning and imitation by non-colluding parties. Therefore, to control collusion and ensure the quality of government investment projects, investigating the spread of collusion in the bidding process of such projects is important. This study presents a simulation of the diffusion process of collusion among multiple entities through NetLogo, drawing on a contagious disease model. The effectiveness of the hypothesised control tools is validated through the changing trend of collusion in bidding in China. The findings provide a new approach to controlling collusion based on the perspective of the proliferation of bidding behaviour and have some reference value for the government to formulate policies.},

  abstract     = {As data collection increases, more and more sensitive data is being used to publish query results. This creates a significant risk of privacy disclosure. As a mathematically provable privacy theory, differential privacy (DP) provides a tool to resist background knowledge attacks. Fuzzy differential privacy (FDP) generalizes differential privacy by employing smaller sensitivity and supporting multiple similarity measures. Thus the output error can be reduced under FDP. Existing FDP mechanisms employ sliding window strategy, which perturb the true query value to an interval with this value as the midpoint to maintain similarity of outputs from neighboring datasets. It is still possible for an attacker to infer some sensitive information based on the difference between the left and right endpoints of the output range. To address this issue, this article present two solutions: fixed interval perturbation and infinite interval perturbation. These strategies perturb the true query values of two neighboring datasets to the same interval and provide fuzzy differential privacy protection for the dataset. We apply the proposed method to the privacy-preserving problem of bipartite graph subgraph counting and verify the effectiveness by experiments.},

  abstract     = {Group decision-making is that individuals collectively make a choice from a set of alternatives. Then, in complex decision-making problems, the decision-making process is no longer subject to a single individual, but group decision-making. Hence, the decision reliability and credibility of the collective evaluation information become more critical. However, current decision-making methods lack the confidence level and credibility measure of group evaluation information. To ensure the confidence level and credibility measure of small-scale group decision-making problems, the aim of this paper is to propose a Multi-Attribute Group Decision-Making (MAGDM) approach using a hyperbolic sine similarity measure between Confidence Neutrosophic Number Credibility Sets (CNNCSs) in the circumstance of Fuzzy Credibility Multi-Valued Sets (FCMVSs). To achieve this aim, this paper contains the following works. First, we present FCMVS to represent the mixed information of fuzzy sequences and credibility degree sequences with different and/or identical fuzzy values. Second, according to the normal distribution and confidence level of fuzzy values and credibility degrees in FCMVS, FCMVS is transformed into CNNCS to avoid the operational issue between different fuzzy sequence lengths in FCMVSs and to ensure the confidence neutrosophic numbers/confidence intervals of fuzzy values and credibility degrees. Third, a hyperbolic sine similarity measure of CNNCSs is established in the circumstance of FCMVSs. Fourth, a MAGDM approach is developed based on the weighted hyperbolic sine similarity measure in the circumstance of FCMVSs. Fifth, the proposed MAGDM approach is applied to an actual example of the equipment supplier choice problem to illustrate the efficiency and rationality of the proposed MAGDM approach in a FCMVS circumstance. In general, this study reveals new contributions in the representation, transformation method, and similarity measure of small-scale group assessment information, as well as the proposed MAGDM method subject to the normal distribution and confidence levels in small-scale MAGDM scenarios.},

In this research, the Posterior Probabilistic Weighted Average Based Ensemble voting (PPWAE)ensemble method is proposed with various classifier for effective prediction of kinases activity. The PPWAE model selects the most probable class from the classification method for prediction. The co-train model has two advantages: Features are trained together to increases the learning rate of model and probability is measured for each model to select the efficient classifier. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Nave Bayes were among the classifiers employed. The results suggest that the Probabilistic Co-train ensemble technique performs well in kinase activity prediction.

  abstract     = {Interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy number (IVq-ROFN) is a popular tool for modeling complex uncertain information and has gained successful applications in the field of comprehensive evaluation. However, most of the existing studies are based on the absolute values of evaluation data but fail to take incentive effects into account. Reasonable and appropriate incentive can guide the evaluated objects to better achieve the decision goals. Therefore, this study develops an incentive mechanism-based interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy dynamic comprehensive evaluation method. Firstly, new interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy measures including deviation measure and correlation coefficient are proposed for managing IVq-ROFNs data. To overcome the limitations of the existing aggregating operators that are not suitable for scenarios with need of many times of data aggregation, we introduce two new interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy aggregating operators. Furthermore, a new interval-valued orthopair fuzzy CRITIC method is developed to objectively determine the importance of the evaluated criteria. More importantly, the horizontal incentive effects within a single period and the vertical incentive effects during multiple periods under IVq-ROFNs environments are proposed to reward (or punish) the evaluated objects in the evaluation process. The evaluated results are determined based on the full compensatory model and the multiplicative form model. The main advantage of the developed method is that the expectations of decision-makers and the dynamic characteristics during multiple periods are taken fully into account, which can make the evaluation results more reasonable and reliable. Finally, this developed comprehensive evaluation method is applied to evaluate the green development level of Jiangxi province within eleven cities from 2016 to 2020. We observe that the cities x 2 , x 3 , x 4 , x 5 , x 7 , x 8 are rewarded within positive incentive values and the cities x 1 , x 6 , x 9 , x 10 , x 11 are punished within negative incentive values. Especially, the positive incentive value for the city x 3 is the biggest and the negative incentive value for the city x 9 is the biggest. The best city in term of GDL is x 3 . The evaluated results with consideration of incentive effects are in line with the expectation of the decision-maker.},

  abstract     = {A unique approach for assessing the compressive strength (CS) of high-performance concrete (HPC) incorporating blast furnace slag (BFS) and fly ash (FA) has been created using support vector regression (SVR) analytics. In order to identify crucial SVR methodology variables that could be adjusted fo r improved performance, the Henry gas solubility optimization (HGSO) and Cuckoo search optimization (CSO) algorithms were both employed in this study. The recommended methods were developed utilizing 1030 experiments and eight inputs, including the CS as the forecasting objective, admixtures, aggregates, and curing age as the main mix design component. The results were then contrasted with those from related literature. The estimate results suggest that combined HGSO-SVR and CSO-SVR analysis might perform extraordinarily well in estimating. The Root mean square error value for the HGSO - SVR decreased remarkably when compared to the CSO - SVR. As can be seen from the comparisons, the HGSO - SVR that was built beats anything previously published. In conclusion, the suggested HGSO - SVR analysis might be determined as the proposed system for forecasting the CS of HPC improved with FA and BFS.},

This new method takes into account the decision-makers’ mind and the uncertainty of decision-making, and is more in line with the real decision-making environment. First, this paper briefly reviews some necessary theories related to PFS, as well as the calculation rules and comparison methods of 2TLPFNs. Then, since there is often subjective randomness when determining the weight, the entropy method is utilized to objectively determine the weight. After that, give the specific calculation steps of the new method. In order to show the effectiveness of the new method, apply it into a specific numerical example about evaluating airline business operations capability, and compare it with the other four different methods. The ranking results depict that the new method designed is effective and reasonable, and has good application value of MAGDM problems.},

An automated monitoring system that can find animal breaches and deter them from foraging fields is essential to solve this conflict. However, automatically forefending the intruding animals is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for elephant identification using YOLO lite with knowledge distillation which could be easily deployed in edge devices. We also propose an elephant re-identification system using Siamese network which is helpful in tracking the number of times the elephant tries to forage the field. This re-encounter information about the same elephant can be used to decide the averting sound for the particular elephant. The proposed system is found to show an accuracy of 89%, which is provides good performance improvement when compared to the state of art models proposed for animal identification. Thus the proposed lite weight knowledge distillation based animal identification model and deep learning based animal re-identification model can be employed in edge devices for real time monitoring and animal deterring to safe guard the farm fields.},

Software testing as a whole is an expensive and tedious task due to resource constraints. Using the prioritization te chnique implies regression testing to re-test software after it has been modified. In this situation, the prioritization technique can use information acquired about earlier test case executions to generate test case orderings. The approaches for test case prioritization arrange them all in such a sequence that maximizes their efficacy in accomplishing specific goals. This paper presents a hybrid technique for change-testing or regression testing through test case prioritization. The suggested method first generates the test cases, then clustered in untested and unimportant groups using kernel-based fuzzy c-means clustering technique. The appropriate test cases are then considered for prioritization using the grey wolf optimizer. The results compared with the approaches such as ant colony, particle swarm, and genetic algorithm optimization method, and it is observed that the proposed approach efficiency increased by 91% of fault detection rate.},

  abstract     = {Data pre-processing is one of the crucial phases of data mining that enhances the efficiency of data mining techniques. One of the most important operations performed on data pre-processing is missing values imputation in incomplete datasets. This research presents a new imputation technique using K-means and samples weighting mechanism based on Grey relation (KWGI). The Grey-based K-means algorithm applicable to all samples of incomplete datasets clusters the similar samples, then an appropriate kernel function generates appropriate weights based on the Grey relation. The missing values estimation of the incomplete samples is done based on the weighted mean to reduce the impact of outlier and vague samples. In both clustering and imputation steps, a penalty mechanism has been considered to reduce the similarity of ambiguous samples with a high number of missing values, and consequently, increase the accuracy of clustering and imputation. The KWGI method has been applied on nine natural datasets with eight state-of-the-art and commonly used methods, namely CMIWD, KNNI, HotDeck, MeanI, KmeanI, RKmeanI, ICKmeanI, and FKMI. The imputation results are evaluated by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criteria. In this study, the missing values are generated at two levels, namely sample and value, and the results are discussed in a wide range of missingness from low rate to high rate. Experimental results of the t -test show that the proposed method performs significantly better than all the other compared methods.},

However, existing metric learning based methods suffer from over-fitting problem. To solve this problem, a resampled linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method was proposed based on the statistical and topological characteristics of pedestrian images. This method utilized the k-nearest neighbours to form potential positive sample pairs. The potential positive pairs are used to improve the metric model and generalize the metric model to the test data. By minimizing the inter-class divergence of potential positive sample pairs, a semi-supervised re-sampling LDA person re-identification algorithm was established. It was then tested on the VIPeR, CUHK01 and Market 1501datasets. The results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance compared to some available methods. Especially, the proposed method outplays the best comparison method by 0.6% and 5.76% at rank-1 identification rate on the VIPeR and CUHK01 datasets respectively. At the same time, the improved LDA algorithm has improved the rank-1 identification accuracy of traditional LDA method by 9.36% and 32.11% on these two datasets respectively. Besides, the proposed method is limited to Market-1501 dataset when the test data is of large size.},

The lung tissues have been segmented using Otsu’s thresholding method. The Regions of Interest (ROI) considered in this work were edema lesions and covid-19 lesions. For each ROI, the edema lesions and covid-19 lesions were elucidated by an expert radiologist, followed by texture and shape extraction. The extracted features were stored as feature vectors. The feature vectors were split into train and test set in the ratio of 80 : 20. A wrapper based feature selection approach using Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier’s accuracy as the fitness function was used to select the optimal features. The selected features were trained using the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) classifier. This framework was tested on a real-time PE and covid-19 dataset. The BPNN classifier’s accuracy with SSA yielded 88.02%, whereas, without SSA it yielded 83.80%. Statistical analysis, namely Wilcoxon’s test, Kendall’s Rank Correlation Coefficient test and Mann Whitney U test were performed, which indicates that the proposed method has a significant impact on the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the novel dataset considered. Comparative experimentations of the proposed system with existing benchmark ML classifiers, namely Cat Boost, Ada Boost, XGBoost, RBF SVM, Poly SVM, Sigmoid SVM and Linear SVM classifiers demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the benchmark classifiers’ results.},

The multi-granularity data is typically the multi-view cognition obtained by different granularity of the data, and its distinctive feature is that the data can be presented in different granularity spaces. In this paper, we integrate the idea of multi-granularity and propose four new models of “optimistic,” “pessimistic,” “optimistic-pessimistic,” and “pessimistic-optimistic” decision-theoretic rough sets based on the fuzzy T-equivalence relation for the first time, followed by a preliminary analysis of the intrinsic relations and properties of these new decision-theoretic rough set models by a concrete example.

  abstract     = {Many smart mobile devices, including smartphones, smart televisions, smart watches, and smart vacuums, have been powered by Android devices. Therefore, mobile devices have become the prime target for malware attacks due to their rapid development and utilization. Many security practitioners have adopted different approaches to detect malware. However, its attacks continuously evolve and spread, and the number of attacks is still increasing. Hence, it is important to detect Android malware since it could expose a great threat to the users. However, in machine learning intelligence detection, too many insignificant features will decrease the percentage of the detection’s accuracy. Therefore, there is a need to discover the significant features in a minimal amount to assist with machine learning detection. Consequently, this study proposes the Pearson correlation coefficient (PMCC), a coefficient that measures the linear relationship between all features. Afterwards, this study adopts the heatmap method to visualize the PMCC value in the color of the heat version. For machine learning classification algorithms, we used a type of fuzzy logic called lattice reasoning. This experiment used real 3799 Android samples with 217 features and achieved the best accuracy rate of detection of more than 98% by using Unordered Fuzzy Rule Induction (FURIA).},

This study aimed to appraise the usefulness of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technique for forecasting the compressive strength of UGWC and enhancing the accuracy of the literature. To outline the forecasting process, two improved ANFIS were suggested, in which determinative variables of them were determined by metaheuristic algorithms named imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and multi-verse optimizer (MVO) algorithms. For this purpose, 170 data samples were collected from published literature separated accidentally for the train and test phase. The calculated performance criteria for proposed ANFIS models demonstrate that both ICA-ANFIS and MVO-ANFIS models can result in justifiable workability for f c of the UGWC prediction procedure. The MVO-ANFIS model could outperform ICA-ANFIS regarding all criteria. For instance, the value of R 2 and VAF for the ICA-ANFIS model are roughly smaller than the MVO-ANFIS model, at 0.9012 and 90% in the training dataset and 0.8973 and 89% in the testing stage, respectively. While the best values of criteria have belonged to the MVO-ANFIS model, with R 2 at 0.937 and 0.944 for the train and test phases, respectively. Overall, the hybrid MVO-ANFIS model can obtain higher workability than ICA-ANFIS and literature (R 2 at 0.801), where causes are recognized as the proposed model.},

Physiological changes of breast tissue can be observed and measured through medical electrical impedance, and the results can be used as a preliminary diagnosis by doctors before treatment. In this paper, quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) and support vector machine (SVM) were combined to classify breast tissues to help clinicians in diagnosis. The algorithm uses QGA to optimize the parameters of SVM and improve the classification performance of SVM. In this experiment, the electrical impedance data measured from breast tissue provided by UCI [ 58 ] was used as the data set. Objectively speaking, the data volume of the data set is small and the representativeness is not strong enough. However, the experimental results show that QGA-SVM shows better classification performance, and it is better than SVM.},

  abstract     = {Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a very common autoimmune disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality, and therefore early diagnosis and treatment are important. Early diagnosis of RA and knowing the severity of the disease are very important for the treatment to be applied. The diagnosis of RA usually requires a physical examination, laboratory tests, and a review of the patient’s medical history. In this study, the diagnosis of RA was made with two different methods using a fuzzy expert system (FES) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which were designed and implemented with the help of a specialist in the field, and the results were compared. For this purpose, blood counts were taken from 286 people, including 91 men and 195 women from various age groups. In the first method, an FES structure that determines the severity of RA disease has been established from blood count using the laboratory test results of CRP, ESR, RF, and ANA. The FES result that determines RA disease severity, the Anti-CCP level that is used to distinguish RA disease, and the patient’s medical history were used to design the Decision Support System (DSS) that diagnoses RA disease. The DSS is web-based and publicly accessible. In the second method, RA disease was diagnosed using kNN, SVM, LR, DT, NB, and MLP algorithms, which are widely used in machine learning. To examine the effect of the patient’s history on RA disease diagnosis, two different models were used in machine learning techniques, one with and one without the patient’s history. The results of the fuzzy-based DSS were also compared with the diagnoses made by the specialist and the diagnoses made according to the 2010 ACR / EULAR RA classification criteria. The performed DSS has achieved a diagnostic success rate of 94.05% on 286 patients. In the study of machine learning techniques, the highest success rate was achieved with the LR model. While the success rate of the model was 91.25 % with only blood count data, the success rate was 97.90% with the addition of the patient’s history. In addition to the high success rate, the results show that the patient’s history is important in diagnosing RA disease.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy becomes an increasingly popular cause of vision loss in diabetic patients. Deep learning has recently received attention as one of the most popular methods for boosting performance in a range of sectors, including medical image analysis and classification. The proposed system comprises three steps; they are image preprocessing, image segmentation, and classification. In preprocessing, the image will be resized, denoising the image and enhancing the contrast of the image which is used for further processing. The lesion region of diabetic retinopathy fundus image is segmented by using Feature Fusion-based U-Net architecture. A blood vessel of a retinal image is extracted by using the spatial fuzzy c means clustering (SFCM) algorithm. Finally, the diabetic retinopathy images are classified using a modified capsule network. The convolution and primary capsule layers collect features from fundus images, while the class capsule and softmax layers decide whether the image belongs to a certain class. Using the Messidor dataset, the proposed system’s network efficiency is evaluated in terms of four performance indicators. The modified contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization technique enhanced the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), mean square error, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) have average values of 36.18, 6.15, and 0.95, respectively. After enhancing the image, segmentation is performed to segment the vessel and lesion region. The segmentation accuracy is measured for the proposed segmentation algorithm by using two metrics namely intersection over union (IoU) and Dice similarity coefficient. Then modified capsule network is constructed for classifying the stages of diabetic retinopathy. The experimental result shows that the proposed modified capsule network got 98.57% of classification accuracy.},

This paper develops an independent medical imaging technique using Self-Attention Adaptation Generative Adversarial Network (SAAGAN). The entire processing model involves the process of pre-processing, feature extraction using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and finally, classification using SAAGAN. The simulation is conducted on ISIC 2016/PH2 datasets, where 10-fold cross-validation is undertaken on a high-end computing platform. The simulation is performed to test the model efficacy against various images on several performance metrics that include accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure, percentage error, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Jaccard Index. The simulation shows that the proposed SAAGAN is more effective in detecting the test images than the existing GAN protocols.},

  abstract     = {Multi-source information fusion is a sophisticated estimating technique that enables users to analyze more precisely complex situations by successfully merging key evidence in the vast, varied, and occasionally contradictory data obtained from various sources. Restricted by the data collection technology and incomplete data of information sources, it may lead to large uncertainty in the fusion process and affect the quality of fusion. Reducing uncertainty in the fusion process is one of the most important challenges for information fusion. In view of this, a multi-source information fusion method based on information sets (MSIF) is proposed in this paper. The information set is a new method for the representation of granularized information source values using the entropy framework in the possibilistic domain. First, four types of common membership functions are used to construct the possibilistic domain as the information gain function (or agent). Then, Shannon agent entropy and Shannon inverse agent entropy are defined, and their summation is used to evaluate the total uncertainty of the attribute values and agents. Finally, an MSIF algorithm is designed by infimum-measure approach. The experimental results show that the performance of Gaussian kernel function is good, which provides an effective method for fusing multi-source numerical data.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, speech processing resides a major application in the domain of signal processing. Due to the audibility loss of some speech signals, people with hearing impairment have difficulty in understanding speech, which reintroduces a crucial role in speech recognition. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) development is a major challenge in research in the case of noise, domain, vocabulary size, and language and speaker variability. Speech recognition system design needs careful attention to challenges or issues like performance and database evaluation, feature extraction methods, speech representations and speech classes. In this paper, HDF-DNN model has been proposed with the hybridization of discriminant fuzzy function and deep neural network for speech recognition. Initially, the speech signals are pre-processed to eliminate the unwanted noise and the features are extracted using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). A hybrid Deep Neural Network and Discriminant Fuzzy Logic is used for assisting hearing-impaired listeners with enhanced speech intelligibility. Both DNN and DF have some problems with parameters to address this problem, Enhanced Modularity function-based Bat Algorithm (EMBA) is used as a powerful optimization tool. The experimental results show that the proposed automatic speech recognition-based hybrid deep learning model is effectively-identifies speech recognition more than the MFCC-CNN, CSVM and Deep auto encoder techniques. The proposed method improves the overall accuracy of 8.31%, 9.71% and 10.25% better than, MFCC-CNN, CSVM and Deep auto encoder respectively.},

  abstract     = {The MULTIMOORA (multiple multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis) method is useful for multiple criteria decision-making method. It is based on expected utility theory and assumes that decision makers are completely rational. However, some studies show that human beings are usually bounded rational, and their regret aversion behaviors play an important role in the decision-making process. Interval neutrosophic sets can more flexibly depict uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent information than single-valued neutrosophic sets. Therefore, this paper improves the traditional MULTIMOORA method by combining the regret theory under interval neutrosophic sets. Firstly, the regret theory is used to calculate the utility value and regret-rejoice value of each alternatives. Secondly, the criteria weights optimization model based on the maximizing deviation is constructed to obtain the weight vector. Then, the MULTIMOORA method is used to determine the order of the alternatives. Finally, an illustrative example about school selection is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Sensitivity analysis shows the validity of the regret theory in the proposed method, and the ranking order change with different regret avoidance parameter. Comparisons are made with existing approaches to illustrate the advantage of the proposed method in reflecting decision makers’ psychological preference.},

Student dropout from MOOCs is a big worry in higher education and policy-making circles, as it occurs frequently in colleges that offer these types of courses. The majority of student dropouts are caused by causes beyond the institution’s control. Using an IF-DEMATEL (Intuitive Fuzzy Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) approach, the primary factors and potential causal relationships for the high dropout rate were identified. The most effective aspects of massive open online courses (MOOCs) are identified using IF-DEMATEL and CIFCS. Moreover, it explains the interconnectedness of the various MOOC components. As an added measure, a number of DEMATEL techniques are used to conduct a side-by-side comparison of the results. Decisions made by the educational organisation could benefit from the findings. According to the research, there are a total of twelve indicators across four dimensions that are related to online course withdrawal amongst students. Then, experienced MOOC instructors from various higher education institutions were invited to assess the level of influence of these characteristics on each other. Academic skills and talents, prior experience, course design, feedback, social presence, and social support were identified as six primary characteristics that directly influenced student dropout in MOOCs. Interaction, course difficulty and length, dedication, motivation, and family/work circumstances have all been found to play a secondary part in student dropout in massive open online courses (MOOCs). The causal connections between the major and secondary factors were traced and discussed. The results of this study can help college professors and administrators come up with and implement effective ways to reduce the high number of students who drop out of massive open online courses (MOOCs).},

  abstract     = {The development of natural language processing promotes the progress of general linguistic studies. Based on the selected features and the extracted rules for word sense disambiguation (WSD), some valuable knowledge of the relations between linguistic features and word sense classes may be discovered, which may provide theoretical and practical evidence and references for lexical semantic study and natural language processing. However, many available approaches of feature selection for WSD are in the end to end operation, they can only select the optimal features for WSD, but not provide the rules for WSD, which makes knowledge discovery impossible. Therefore, a new Filter-Attribute partial ordered structure diagram (Filter-APOSD) approach is proposed in this article to fulfill both feature selection and knowledge discovery. The new approach is a combination of a Filter approach and an Attribute Partial Ordered Structure Diagram (APOSD) approach. The Filter approach is designed and used for filtering the simplest rules for WSD, and the APOSD approach is used to provide the complementary rules for WSD and visualize the structure of the datasets for knowledge discovery. The features occurring in the final rule set are selected as the optimal features. The proposed approach is verified by the benchmark data set from the SemEval-2007 preposition sense disambiguation corpus with around as the target word for WSD. The test result shows that the accuracy of WSD of around is greatly improved comparing with the one by the state of the art, and 17 out of 22 features are finally selected and ranked according to their contribution to the WSD, and some knowledge on the relations between the word senses and the selected features is discovered.},

The problem of persistent hikes in oil costs, climate threats and soaring energy demand has pleased the worldwide interest to exploiting and investment in renewable sorts of energy (RE), alternative energy specially. A electrical phenomenon, PV system is simple to put in, has no moving components, is sort of freed from maintenance, reduced vulnerability to power loss and is expandable. Despite these benefits, PV energy prices significantly on top of fossil fuels. This can be because of its lower effectiveness and better prices. In PV systems tracking MPPT in effective manner is still the problem. In this paper, the 1000 W grid connected PV system has been taken for analysis of various MPPT techniques.

In this paper, k-means and semantic clo sed natural matting algorithm is combined for image segmentation, the style and content in the image are extracted based on neural network, and the resulting image is synthesized by image reconstruction technology to realize the migration of national costume styles. Due to the serious artifacts of the output image, an improved image style transfer algorithm is adopted to constrain the transformation from the input image to the output image in the local affine transformation of the color space, and this constraint is expressed as a completely differentiable parameter term, image distortion is suppressed effectively. In the process of real photo style transfer, there is also space inconsistency. Smoothing is done to ensure that the space style is consistent after style processing, it greatly speeds up the operation speed. On NVIDIA GTX1080TI graphics card, algorithm is tested with 256×256 resolution images. It includes three indicators of average running time, memory usage and the number of styles generated by a single model, which are 0.06 s, 136.06 MB and 1 respectively.

  abstract     = {The spectrum scarcity problem in today’s wireless communication network is addressed through the use of a cognitive radio network (CRN). Detection in the spectrum is made easier by cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), which is a tool developed by the military. The fusion centre receives the sensing information from each secondary user and uses it to make a global conclusion about the presence of the principal user. Literature has offered several different methods for decision making that lack scalability and robustness. CSS censoring is inspected in the attendance of faded settings in the current study. Rayleigh fading, which affects reporting channels (R), is examined in detail. Multiple antennae and an energy detector (ED) are used by each secondary user (SU). A selection combiner (SC) combines the ED outputs with signals from the primary user (PU), which are established by several antennas on SU, before the joint signal is utilised to make a local result. SUs are expurgated at the fusion centre (FC) using a hybrid Support Vector Machine (SVM) that significantly improves detection performance and reduces the number of false positives. With a minimum false alarm probability of 0.1, error rate of 0.04, spectrum utilization of 99%, throughput of 2.9kbps and accuracy of 99%, proposed model attains better performance than standard SVM and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models.},

This work proposes a fuzzy mechanism that aims to improve the convergence of this algorithm, adjusting the amplitude of the parameter that directly affects the chasing mechanism of the behavior of rats. The proposed fuzzy model uses the normalized fitness of each individual and the population diversity as input information. For evaluation criteria, the fuzzy mechanism proposed, was implemented in the optimization of third-three single objective problems. For comparison criteria, the proposed fuzzy variant is compared with other algorithms, such as GWO (Grey Wolf Optimizer), SSA (Salp Swarm Algorithm), WOA (Whale Optimization Algorithm), and also with two proposed alternative fuzzy variants. One of the simpler fuzzy variants uses only population diversity as input information, while the other uses only the normalized fitness value of each rat. The results show that the proposed fuzzy system improves the convergence of the conventional version of the rat algorithm and is also competitive with other metaheuristics. The Friedman test shows statistically the results obtained.},

  abstract     = {Everything becomes smart in the modern era, for everything we need a better plan or arrangements. In the olden days, essential information was noted as a document with the help of paper and pen or printed texts. But the intelligent world needs a paperless environment by converting handwritten or pr inted text documents into software copies. This can be achieved by the electronic data conversion concept called Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR of some documents is complex because of different writing styles and quality of scanned image issues, which can be solved by adopting a deep learning technique for better accuracy. We employed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for English Optical Character Recognition for paperless and effortless data storage and fast access in this work. Still, the records may contain the entities like names, contact details, drug details, diseases, educational qualifications, dates, etc. These entities cannot be separated by employing OCR alone; we need an entity recognition framework for deeper and faster data analysis. For efficient Named Entity Recognition, we utilize the Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) powered by the algorithms CRF and BERT to automatically label each entity by training the vast amount of unlabeled text data. The ANFIS model is equipped with both linguistic and numerical knowledge. It is more accurate than the ANN when it comes to identifying patterns and classification data. Also, it is more transparent to the user. Our proposed framework aims to improve the performance of the character recognition system by using a feed-forward network. One of the main issues that have been identified in the development of this system is noise. Through this network, we can provide a single input and one output layer. The main components of the system are the training and recognition sections. These two sections are mainly focused on image acquisition and feature extraction. Besides these, they also include training and simulation of the classifier. The first step in the process of image recognition is to extract the features from the normalized image matrix. We then train the network using a proposed training algorithm. Experimentation on medical records attains a higher accuracy value of 0.9637, recall value of 0.9627, and f1 score of 0.9627, respectively.},

On the basis of the SMOTE data sampling approach, a strategy for software defect prediction is given in this paper. To address the class imbalance, the defect datasets were initially processed using the Improved Random-SMOTE Oversampling technique. Then, using the Linear Pearson Correlation approach, the features were chosen, and using the k-fold cross validation process, the samples were split into training and testing datasets. Finally, Heuristic Learning Vector Quantization is used to classify data in order to predict software problems. Based on measures like sensitivity, specificity, FPR, and accuracy rate for two separate datasets, the performance of the proposed strategy is contrasted with the approaches to classification that presently exist.},

Screening and diagnosis of autism using conventional methods, such as interviews with parents or caregivers and observational assessments takes a long time. The accurate diagnosis of autism by physicians and healthcare professionals seems to be challenging. By analyzing data on autistic children, medical professionals can learn about autism screening assessment decision making. The present study aims to develop a parental autism screening tool termed the Indian Autism Grading Tool (IAGT) for early screening of autism. Data are collected using the Indian Autism Parental Questionnaire and assigned with grades. This dataset is employed to test five supervised machine learning models, which compare classification performance based on accuracy, precision and recall. The most effective model should be used to implement the autism screening application. MLR is known to be more robust and to support fewer data sets, so it can be employed for the implementation of ML-powered mobile applications. MLR achieves the overall accuracy of 97.85%, which equates to 0.72%, 2.37%, 0.84% and 1.54% better than SVM, DT, KNN and GNB respectively. The proposed tool is developed in both Tamil and English. The pilot study is conducted with 30 children and the predictability of the tool is compared with the clinician. Therefore, the tool consistently achieves the same level of accuracy as clinicians.},

  abstract     = {In this study, Bat algorithm (BA) is modified along with K -opt operation and one newly proposed perturbation approach to solve the well known covering salesman problem (CSP). Here, along with the restriction of the radial distances of the unvisited cities from the visited cities another restriction is imposed where a priority is given to some cities for the inclusion in the tour, i.e., some clusters to be created where the prioritised cities must be the visiting cities and the corresponding CSP is named as Prioritised CSP (PCSP). In the algorithm, 3-opt and 4-opt operations are used for two different purposes. The 4-opt operation is applied for generating an initial solution set of CSP for the BA and the 3-opt operation generates some perturbed solutions of a solution. A new perturbation approach is proposed for generating neighbour solutions of a potential solution where the exchange of some cities in the tour is made and is named as K -bit exchange operation. The proposed solution approach for the CSP and PCSP is named as the modified BA embedded with K -bit exchange and K -opt operation (MBAKEKO). It is a two-stage algorithm where in the first stage of the algorithm the clustering of the cities is done with respect to a fixed visiting city of each cluster in such a manner that the distances of the other cities of the cluster must lie with in the fixed covering distance of the problem and in the second stage the BA is applied to find the minimum cost Hamiltonian circuit by passing through the visiting cities of the clusters. MBAKEKO is tested with a set of benchmark test problems with significantly large sizes from the TSPLIB. To measure the performance of MBAKEKO, its results are compared with the results of different well-known approaches for CSPs available in the literature. It is observed from the comparison studies that MBAKEKO searches the minimum cost tour for any of the considered instances compared to all other well-known algorithms in the literature. It can be concluded from the numerical studies that the performance of MBAKEKO is better with respect to the state-of-the-art algorithms available in the literature.},

This paper considers deploying inelastic applications into the cloud and proposes an optimal resource allocation model. The deployment functions for inelastic applications are nonconvex (e.g., sigmoidal), then the resource allocation model becomes a hard nonconvex optimization problem. The traditional gradient-based resource allocation algorithm cannot effectively achieve the global optimum. Therefore, this paper applies particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to design a resource allocation scheme. This scheme can not only effectively solve the resource allocation problem of deploying inelastic enterprise applications into the cloud, but also solve the hard problem of deploying multi-class applications into the cloud when the enterprise can support both elastic and inelastic applications. We also compare the performance of the proposed PSO-based resource allocation scheme with some other methods and illustrate some numerical examples to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed resource allocation scheme.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing demand for express delivery and enhancement of sustainable logistics, the collaborative multi-depot delivery based on electric vehicles has gradually attracted the attention of logistics industry. However, most of the existing studies assumed that the products required by differ ent customers could be delivered from any homogeneous depot, ignoring the limitations in facilities and environment of depots in reality. Thus, this study proposed a novel collaborative multi-heterogeneous-depot electric vehicle routing problem with mixed time windows and battery swapping, which not only involves the multi-heterogeneous-depot to meet different customer demands, but also considers the constraints of mixed time windows to ensure timely delivery. Furthermore, a customer-oriented multi-objective optimization model minimizing both travel costs and time window penalty costs is proposed to effectively improve both delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction. To solve this model, an extended non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is proposed. This combines a new coding scheme, a new initial population generation method, three crossover operators, three mutation operators, and a particular local search strategy to improve the performance of the algorithm. Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the proposed model.},

Generally speaking, investment problems are often accompanied by high risk and uncertainty, and how to make the suitable investment decision is a difficult issue. This paper investigates an investment decision approach under the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environment. Firstly, a new probabilistic hesitant fuzzy distance and correlation coefficient are defined to overcome the defects of the existing probabilistic hesitant fuzzy information measures. Secondly, an attribute weight integrated model is constructed by combining the maximum deviation method, the CRITIC method and the maximum entropy principle, which is able to take into account the correlation between attributes and make full use of the decision information. In addition, a disappointment theory-based probabilistic hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision making (PHFMADM) method is proposed to solve the investment decision problem, which can integrate the psychological behavior of decision makers into the decision making process and make the decision results more authentic and reliable. Finally, the rationality and validity of the method are verified by comparing with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning (TL) is further investigated in computer intelligence and artificial intelligence. Many TL methodologies have been suggested and applied to figure out the problem of practical applications, such as in natural language processing, classification models for COVID-19 disease, Alzheimer’s disease detection, etc. FTL (fuzzy transfer learning) is an extension of TL that uses a fuzzy system to pertain to the vagueness and uncertainty parameters in TL, allowing the discovery of predicates and their evaluation of unclear data. Because of the system’s increasing complexity, FTL is often utilized to further infer proper results without constructing the knowledge base and environment from scratch. Further, the uncertainty and vagueness in the daily data can arise and modify the process. It has been of great interest to design an FTL model that can handle the periodicity data with fast processing time and reasonable accuracy. This paper proposes a novel model to capture data related to periodical phenomena and enhance the quality of the existing inference process. The model performs knowledge transfer in the absence of reference or predictive information. An experimental stage on the UCI and real-life dataset compares our proposed model against the related methods regarding the number of rules, computing time, and accuracy. The experimental results validated the advantages and suitability of the proposed FTL model.},

  abstract     = {Effective risk management reaction improves the absorption of critical impacts on supply chains. Supply chain risk (SCR) sources, like control, process, demand, and supply, need to be identified, assessed, and mitigated to make rational decisions immediately. Late detection of a disruptive event can cause delays in handling risk. Since SCRs consist of complex, uncertain, and incomplete information, most of the provided risk assessment mechanisms cannot handle it in real-time. Hence, in this paper, we introduce NeutroMAS4SCRM, a framework incorporating real-time Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Neutrosophic Data Analytic Hierarchy Processes to best deal with the complexity, uncertainty, and vagueness of SCR management-related issues and which can hence help decision-makers adopt less risky decisions. In addition, the MAS technology contribution to SCR management is outlined through a comparative study among the most recent studies. In contrast, the proposed MAS for the supply chain is implemented under the JADE agent platform, where the FIPA-ACL-based message content is specified using a dedicated ontology. A simulation-based decision support system is used to assess the cost risk and its harmful effects and determine how well the proposed framework can help companies manage risks efficiently. The simulation has proven to reduce risk costs by about 85%.},

Existing methods leverage the features of composing objects in a scene and overlook the adverse impacts of the common objects reoccurring in other scenes. This drawback d ecreases the feature discrimination between scenes (e.g., living room, dining room, and bedroom) due to reoccurring objects (e.g., tables, chairs, and toys). We propose a method of training convolutional networks by punishing or discounting the local object representations’ predictive ability and encouraging the network to learn global scene layout representations. To retain more vital information for the scene feature representation, we introduce an activation function (with unbounded above, bounded below, smooth, and non-monotonic properties) to allow more low-negative values to flow through the network, discarding high negative values. We evaluate the proposed methods on MIT Indoor 67 and Scene 15 datasets. The experiment findings show that the proposed methods capture global scene concepts and improve performance.},

Although some progress has indeed been documented utilizing various featurization techniques and ml techniques, conventional approaches have a number of limitations, including manual preparation and a huge dataset need. Although, these are widely being used to evaluate milling operations in terms of production efficiency &amp; work piece surface quality,.they are not suited for real applications due to their computing duration and require large data for training process. Therefore, in this study, three well-performing deep learning approaches such as LSTM, DTW, and Bi-LSTM are used to provide an effective way for monitoring and managing chatter in the milling processes with the Duplex 2205 material. Here, some of the parameters like acceleration is measured while the milling operation is taking place, and the measured acceleration value is processed using selected three DL techniques for identifying the presence of chatter and are tested to see which one performs the best.

But the large time span from patent licensing to market application makes it challenging to discern the benefits of patent competition strategy. Besides, artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging industry without ready-to-use experience to formulate patent competition strategy, and particularly current researches have not designed patent competition strategy from the micro patent management perspective of AI enterprises to solve the uncertainty caused by the lag of market application relative to patent licensing. This research builds an expert group discriminant system based on the system dynamics method to address this problem. It integrates expert tacit knowledge to determine the fuzzy variable value and the fuzzy relationship. The patent competition strategy subsystem in national dimension, industry dimension and enterprise dimension for capturing the market from the perspective of enterprise technology competitiveness are constructed. By combining the three subsystems, the enterprise patent competition strategy system dynamics model with evolution analysis is established. Finally, taking typical Chinese AI enterprise iFLYTEK as an example, the multi-scenario simulation is carried out and the results under four different scenarios can provide effective decision supports for managers to formulate reasonable patent competition strategy and gain high market share. This research sheds light on modeling and evolution analysis of the patent competition strategy which comprehensively and systematically considers the operation mechanism of patent management and contributes to dealing with the uncertainty and ambiguity in the system dynamics model effectively.},

  abstract     = {Social networks have accelerated the speed and scope of information dissemination. However, the lack of regulation and freedom of speech on social platforms has resulted in the widespread dissemination of the unverified message. Therefore, rapid and effective detection of social network rumors is e ssential to purify the network environment and maintain public security. Currently, the defects of rumor detection technology are that the detection time is too long and the timeliness is poor. In addition, the differences based on specific regions or specific fields will lead to deviations in the training dataset. In this paper, firstly, the definition of rumor is described, and the current problems and detection process of rumor detection are described; Secondly, introduce different data acquisition methods and analyze their advantages and disadvantages; Thirdly, according to the development of rumor detection technology, the existing rumor detection methods of artificial, machine learning and deep learning are analyzed and compared; Finally, the challenges of social network rumor detection technology are summarized.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease of 2019) is one of the most challenging healthcare crises of the twenty-first century. The pandemic causes many negative impacts on all aspects of life and livelihoods. Although recent developments of relevant vaccines, such as Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA, AstraZeneca, or Moderna, the emergence of new virus mutations and their fast infection rate yet pose significant threats to public health. In this context, early detection of the disease is an important factor to reduce its effect and quickly control the spread of pandemic. Nevertheless, many countries still rely on methods that are either expensive and time-consuming (i.e., Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) or uncomfortable and difficult for self-testing (i.e., Rapid Antigen Test Nasal). Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed as a potential solution for COVID-19 analysis. However, previous works usually focus on a single symptom, which can omit critical information for disease diagnosis. Therefore, in this study, we propose a multi-modal method to detect COVID-19 using cough sounds and self-reported symptoms. The proposed method consists of five neural networks to deal with different input features, including CNN-biLSTM for MFCC features, EfficientNetV2 for Mel spectrogram images, MLP for self-reported symptoms, C-YAMNet for cough detection, and RNNoise for noise-canceling. Experimental results demonstrated that our method outperformed the other state-of-the-art methods with a high AUC, accuracy, and F1-score of 98.6%, 96.9%, and 96.9% on the testing set.},

  abstract     = {Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack detection and monitoring has attracted a lot of attention recently when this type of cyber-attacks is growing in both number and dangerous levels. In this paper, a new APT attack model, which is the combination of three different neural network layers includi ng: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Inference (I), and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is proposed. The new model is named MIG for short. In this model, the MLP layer is in charge of aggregating and extracting properties of the IPs based on flow network in Network traffic, while the Inference layer is responsible for building IP information profiles by grouping and concatenating flow networks generated from the same IP. Finally, the GCN layer is used for analyzing and reconstructing IP features based on the behavior extraction process from IP information records. The APT attacks detection method based on network traffic using this MIG model is new, and has yet been proposed and applied anywhere. The novelty and uniqueness of this method is the combination of many different data mining techniques in order to calculate, extract and represent the relationship and the correlation between APT attack behaviors based on Network traffic. In MIG model, many meaningful anomalous properties and behaviors of APT attacks are synthesized and extracted, which help improve the performance of APT attack detection. The experimental results showed that the proposed method is meaningful in both theory and practice since the MIG model not only improves the ability to correctly detect APT attacks in network traffic but also minimizes false alarms.},

Currently, researchers have introduced “entity trigger” to improve the cost-effectiveness of the model. However, it still required the annotator to attach additional trigger label, which increases the w orkload of the annotator. Moreover, this trigger applies only to English text and lacks research into other languages. Based on this problem, we have proposed a more cost-effective trigger tagging method and matching network. The approach not only automatic tagging entity triggers based on the characteristics of Chinese text, but also adds mogrifier LSTM to the matching network to reduce context-free representation of input tokens. Experiments on two public datasets show that our automatic trigger is effective. And it achieves better performances with automatic trigger than other state-of-the-art methods (The F1-scores increased by 1∼4).},

For the problem of uneven random initialization of mayflies, the variable definition method of Circle chaotic mapping is used to make the initial position of the population uniformly distributed in the solution space, and the mayfly fitness value and the optimal fitness value are incorporated into the calculation of the weight coefficient, which better balances the global exploration and local exploitation of the algorithm. For the problem that the algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimum at the later stage, a multi-subpopulation cooperative strategy is proposed to improve the global search ability of the algorithm. Finally, the performance of the improved mayfly algorithm is tested with two parallel pumping system cases, and the stability and time complexity of the algorithm are verified. The experiments show that the algorithm can get a better operation strategy in solving the parallel water pump energy saving optimization problem, and can achieve energy saving effect of 0.72%  8.68% compared with other optimization algorithms, and the convergence speed and stability of the algorithm have been significantly improved, which can be better applied to practical needs.},

  abstract     = {Clustering plays a fundamental task in the process of data mining, which remains more demanding due to the ever-increasing dimension of accessible datasets. Big data is considered more populous as it has the ability to handle various sources and formats of data under numerous highly developed technologies. This paper devises a robust and effective optimization-based Internet of Things (IoT) routing technique, named Student Psychology Based Optimization (SPBO) -based routing for the big data clustering. When the routing phase is done, big data clustering is carried out using the Deep Fractional Calculus-Improved Invasive Weed Optimization fuzzy clustering (Deep FC-IIWO fuzzy clustering) approach. Here, the Mapreduce framework is used to minimizing the over fitting issues during big data clustering. The process of feature selection is performed in the mapper phase in order to select the major features using Minkowski distance, whereas the clustering procedure is carried out in the reducer phase by Deep FC-IIWO fuzzy clustering, where the FC-IIWO technique is designed by the hybridization of Improved Invasive Weed Optimizer (IIWO) and Fractional Calculus (FC). The developed SPBO-based routing approach achieved effective performance in terms of energy, clustering accuracy, jaccard coefficient, rand coefficient, computational time and space complexity of 0.605 J, 0.935, 0.947, 0.954, 2100.6 s and 72KB respectively.},

Opinions on any given product, issue, service, or idea are contained in data, making them a valuable resource in their own right. Popular social networkin g services like Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ allows expressing views on a variety of topics, participating in discussions, or sending messages to a global user. Twitter sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention recently.Sentiment analysis is finding how a person feels about a topic from their written response about it and it can be separated into positive and negative through its use. Doing so enables to classify the tweets made by a user in to appropriate classification category based on which some decisions can be made. The literature proposed approaches to develop the classifiers on the Twitter datasets. Operations, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming will be performed. NLP converts the text to a machine-readable representation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) combines NLP data to evaluate if a situation is positive or negative. The document’s subjectivity can be identified using ML and NLP techniques to categorize them in to positive, neutral, or negative. Performing sentiment analysis in Twitter data can be tedious due to limited size, unstructured nature, misspellings, slang, and abbreviations. For this task, a Tweet Analyzing Model for Cluster Set Optimization with Unique Identifier Tagging (TAM-CSO-UIT) was built using prospects to determine positive or negative sentiment in tweets obtained from Twitter. This approach assigns a +ve/-ve value to each entry in the Tweet database based on probability assignment using n-gram model. To perform this effectively the tweet dataset is considered as a sliding window of length L. The proposed model accurately analyses and classifies the tweets.},

To reduce the number of model parameters and improve the detection speed, the backbone feature extraction network is replaced from the Resnet101 network to the lightweight GhostNet network. Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is used to increase the receptive field to enhance the semantics of the output network. Compared with Resnet101, the parameter quantity of the model is reduced by 90.90%, the detection speed is increased from 5 frames/s to 10 frames/s, and the detection speed is increased by 100%. The detection result is that the accuracy rate is 91.67%, the recall rate is 97.82%, and the mAP value is 91.68%. To solve the repeated detection of fruits due to the movement of the camera, the Deepsort algorithms was used to solve the multi-tracking problems. Experiments show that the algorithm can effectively detect the edge position information and categories of apples in different scenes. It can be an automated apple-picking robot.

  abstract     = {Most methods for evaluating a company’s financial performance currently focus on scoring, when there is a large amount of data, it is difficult to distinguish the company’s financial status. To cluster and predict the financial performance of companies, a hybrid model based on the fuzzy C-means clu stering algorithm (FCM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this paper. Pearson correlation analysis was first performed on the indicators to ensure that they are not correlated with each other and to avoid indicator redundancy. The entropy method determined the weight of each index and ensured the high validity of the selected indicators. Then, FCM clustering was carried out, and the performance of each company was clustered according to the indexes after data preprocessing with clustering labels. The processed data and labels were introduced into CNN to predict the level. The empirical study showed that the FCM-CNN model was superior to other machine learning models, which proved that this model has better clustering and forecasting ability, and could be applied to the prediction of corporate financial performance.},

  abstract     = {Bamboo furniture is made of green and environmentally friendly bamboo, there is a unique hand temperature and weaving beauty in addition to bamboo texture and characteristics. In the past, making bamboo furniture relied on the traditional experience of craftsmen, which had less change in appearance and lack of communication with customers, and could not meet the fashion and aesthetic needs of modern people. Therefore, this paper connects deep convolution neural network (DCNN) and deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to generate bamboo furniture design that meets customers’ emotional needs. First, based on collecting 17856 bamboo furniture in the market, DCNN builds product image recognition models and enhances image recognition performance, thereby optimizing computational efficiency and obtaining high-quality output. The optimal recognition rate of emotional data set throughout the chair product is 98.7%, of which the modern chair has a recognition rate of 99.2%, and the recognition rate of fashion bamboo chairs is 98.2%. Second, DCGAN learns a good intermediate feature from a large quantity of non-marked images and automatically generates product styling that arouses the emotional resonance of customers. Finally, the fashion designers use this creative picture as the source of inspiration, cooperate with individual characteristics and trends of the times, then design green sustainable bamboo chairs. These design plans have increased the variety of product modalities, which greatly enhances customers’ emotional satisfaction and increases product sales. The collaborative design method proposed in this paper provides new ideas for generating the emotional design of bamboo furniture, which can also expand to other industrial product designs.},

With the aim of increasing the benefits of all parties in the platform, this paper focusing on not only increasing the effectiveness of the recommender platform but also the evaluation system of measuring the interests of consumer, retailers and platform. In this paper, the interests of the third-party platform are added into the evaluation system, the profit of the third-party platform as an evaluation index is taken and a 0–1 integer programming model is established which sets the profit of the platform as the objective function. The result of the proposed model and algorithm indicate that: (1) The relevance of products has a significant impact on platform recommendation when the consumers are selecting products. When the correlations of the products are high, the algorithms of selecting the products will have a lower capacity of 1% compared with the algorithm without products correlations. (2) The evaluation of the target products from the target consumers is quite different from the heterogeneity assumptions. When the consumer presentation is taken into consideration, it is hard to evaluate the consumer presence because of the strictly requirement of data for the platform recommendation system. (3) The proposed two-stage solution for the platform recommendation system is optimized in time and space complexity. Total optimization of the proposed method is 30% higher than the greedy algorithms. The two stages are combined together to obtain the approximate solution, and finally provide a reasonable and feasible recommendation for the third-party platform.},

The interdependent and mutually restrictive relationship between these two sub-problems brings new challenges to the heuristic optimization algorithm for solving the TTP problem. This paper first analyzes the performance of three sub-component combined iterative algorithms: Memetic Algorithm with the Two-stage Local Search (MATLS), S5, and CS2SA algorithms, which all employ the Chained Lin-ighan (CLK) algorithm to generate the circumnavigation path. To investigate the influence of different traveling routes on the performance of TTP solving algorithms, we propose a combinatorial iterative TTP solving algorithm based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS). Finally, the experimental investigations suggest that the traveling route generation method dramatically impacts the performance of TTP solving algorithms. The sub-component combined iterative algorithms based on the MMAS algorithm to generate the circumnavigation path has the best practical effect.},

Our paper mainly works for systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art technologies in IRQA. And then, this paper further discusses image registration algorithms for matching the original image and the retargeted image. Next, we investigate the feature measurement methods for image retargeting quality evaluation. To facilitate the quantitative assessment of the IRQA methods, this paper gives a list of publicly open datasets and the performance of the mainstream methods. Finally, some promising research directions towards IRQA are pointed out.

Smart contracts (SC) are like normal computer programs which are written mostly in solidity high-level object-oriented programming language. Smart contracts allow completing trans actions directly between two parties in the network without any middle man or mediator. Modification of the smart contracts are not possible once deployed into the Blockchain. Thus smart contract has to be vulnerable free before deploying into the Blockchain. In this paper, Bayesian Network Model was designed and constructed based on Bayesian learning concept to detect smart contract security vulnerabilities which are Reentrancy, Tx.origin and DOS. The results showed that the proposed BNMC (Bayesian Network Model Construction) design is able to detect the severity of each vulnerability and also suggest the reasons for the vulnerability. The accuracy of the proposed BNMC results are improved (accuracy 8% increased for both Reentracy and Tx.origin, 6% increased for DOS), compared with traditional method LSTM. This proposed BNMS design and implementation is the first attempt to detect smart contract vulnerabilities using Bayesian Networks.},

Then, a novel combination weighting method that combines the advantages of entropy weight (EW) method and improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is constructed to calculate the weight of criteria. Further, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method is utilized to generate a ranking order of providers and recommend the optimal provider. Finally, the illustrative example and comparison analysis are provided to prove the validity and feasibility of the approach. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is presented to discuss the stability of the proposed method. In conclusion, this paper innovatively constructs an index system of cold chain LSPs evaluation and selection, and the process of evaluation and selection is also objective.},

  abstract     = {Protein Remote Homology and fold Recognition (PRHR) is the most crucial task to predict the protein patterns. To achieve this task, Sequence-Order Frequency Matrix-Sampling and Deep learning with Smith-Waterman (SOFM-SDSW) were designed using large-scale Protein Sequences (PSs), which take more time to determine the high-dimensional attributes. Also, it was ineffective since the SW was only applied for local alignment, which cannot find the most matches between the PSs. Hence, in this manuscript, a rapid semi-global alignment algorithm called SOFM-SD-GlobalSW (SOFM-SDGSW) is proposed that facilitates the affine-gap scoring and uses sequence similarity to align the PSs. The major aim of this paper is to enhance the alignment of SW algorithm in both locally and globally for PRHR. In this algorithm, the Maximal Exact Matches (MEMs) are initially obtained by the bit-level parallelism rather than to align the individual characters. After that, a subgroup of MEMs is obtained to determine the global Alignment Score (AS) using the new adaptive programming scheme. Also, the SW local alignment scheme is used to determine the local AS. Then, both local and global ASs are combined to produce a final AS. Further, this resultant AS is considered to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize the PRH and folds. Finally, the test results reveal the SOFM-SDGSW algorithm on SCOP 1.53, SCOP 1.67 and Superfamily databases attains an ROC of 0.97, 0.941 and 0.938, respectively, as well as, an ROC50 of 0.819, 0.846 and 0.86, respectively compared to the conventional PRHR algorithms.},

Dealing with the mentioned problem, an innovative weighting fuzzy cluster ensemble framework is proposed according to cluster dependability approximation. For combining the fuzzy clusters, a fuzzy co-association matrix is extracted in a weighted manner out of initial fuzzy clusters according to their dependabilities.

Many researchers have described the additional advantage of inverter control challenges such as voltage imbalance, increasing the number of voltage levels, power quality issues, reducing the number of semiconductors switches and achieving higher efficiency. Under the intelligent techniques, the implementation is carried out with aid of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to calculate the modulation index (ma) and switching angles (θ) for MMI. Based on the calculation, it is trained to form a mapping between inputs and outputs for obtaining reduced Total Harmonics Distortion (THD). The objective of the intelligent controller is to control the inverter for regulating the output voltage with lowest THD. The proposed control structure has been estimated and compared for better robustness in terms of switching angle and modulation index with least THD in the inverter. Simulations and prototype models are made to analyze the controller’s performance, for inverter output voltage and harmonics. This proposed system is designed for marine lighting load application.

Interval-valued fuzzy sets change the membership function of general fuzzy sets from single value functions to inter val-valued functions, and thus describe the fuzzy attributes of things in terms of fuzzy intervals, which is more in line with the characteristics of fuzzy objectives. This paper aims to define the bipolar interval-valued fuzzy hypergraph to reveal the inner relationship of fuzzy data, and give some characterizations of it. The characteristics of bipolar interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy hypergraph and bipolar interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy hypergraph are studied. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of the bipolar interval-valued fuzzy threshold graph.

The least square method is introduced and the regularization terms b12 and b22 are added respectively. It transforms an inequality constraint problem into two simpler equality constraint problems, which not only improves the training speed and generalization ability, but also effectively improves the forecasting accuracy. In order to solve the parameter selection problem of model TPLSSVR-HGN, the particle swarm optimization algorithm with fast convergence speed and good robustness is selected to optimize its parameters. In order to verify the forecasting performance of TPLSSVR-HGN, it is compared with the classical regression models on the artificial data set, UCI data set and wind-speed data set. The experimental results show that TPLSSVR-HGN has better forecasting effect than the classical regression models.},

The tumor pixel density of meningioma tumor is high and it leads to sudden death if it is not detected timely. The meningioma images are detected us ing Modified Empirical Mode Decomposition- Convolutional Neural Networks (MEMD-CNN) classification approach. This method has the following stages data augmentation, spatial-frequency transformation, feature computations, classifications and segmentation. The brain image samples are increased using data augmentation process for improving the meningioma detection rate. The data augmented images are spatially transformed into frequency format using MEMD transformation method. Then, the external empirical mode features are computed from this transformed image and they are fed into CNN architecture to classify the source brain image into either meningioma or non-meningioma. The pixels belonging tumor category are segmented using morphological opening-closing functions. The meningioma detection system obtains 99.4% of Meningioma Classification Rate (MCR) and 99.3% of Non-Meningioma Classification Rate (NMCR) on the meningioma and non-meningioma images. This MEMD-CNN technique for meningioma identification attains 98.93% of SET, 99.13% of SPT, 99.18% of MSA, 99.14% of PR and 99.13% of FS. From the statistical comparative analysis of the proposed MEMD-CNN system with other conventional detection systems, the proposed method provides optimum tumor segmentation results.},

The radio mean number of graph G is defined as rmn ( G ) = min { span ( l ) : l isaradiomeanlabelingof G } where span ( l ) is given by max { l ( w ) : w ∈ V ( G )}. It has been proved in literature that | V ( G ) | ≤ rmn ( G ) ≤ | V ( G ) | + diam ( G ) -2. Cryptographic algorithms can exploit the unique radio mean number associated with a graph to generate keys. An exhaustive listing of all feasible radio mean labelings and their span is essential to obtain the radio mean number of a given graph. Since the radio mean condition depends on the distance between vertices and the graph’s diameter, as the order and diameter increase, finding a radio mean labeling itself is quite difficult and, so is obtaining the radio mean number of a given graph. Here we discuss the extreme values of the radio mean number of a given graph of order n . In this article we obtained bounds on the radio mean number of a graph G of order n and diameter d in terms of the radio mean number of its induced subgraph H where diam ( H ) = d and d H ( w , w ′) = d G ( w , w ′) for any w , w ′ ∈ V ( H ). The diametral path P d +1 is one such induced subgraph of G and hence we have deduced the limits of rmn ( G ) in terms of rmn ( P d +1 ). It is known that if d = 1,  2 or 3, then rmn ( G ) = n . Here, we have given alternative proof for the same. The authors of this article have studied radio mean labeling of paths in another article. Using those results, we have improved the bounds on the radio mean number of a graph of order n and diameter d ≥ 4. It is also shown that among all connected graphs on n vertices, the path P n of order n possesses the maximum radio mean number. This is the first article that has completely solved the question of maximum and minimum attainable radio mean numbers of graphs of order n .},

  abstract     = {Medical advancements are being made in order to extend the lifespan of mankind. In the medical field, the penetration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can aid doctors in diagnosing patients accurately and prescribing the medications accordingly. In recent times, several people have permanent implants such as face makers and it is threatening to life to keep altering this body enhancement as well as it is required to possess a system in place to improve the performance of the Wireless Body Sensors. Transmission loss and route loss are two important elements that will drag the battery energy and minimizes its life span. This research proposes optimal clustering and path selection protocol to enhance the lifetime of wireless body sensor networks. Initially, the data is collected from each body sensor through a clustering method called Glow-worm Swarm Optimization (GSO) and the Fruit-fly technique is applied to find the best path. Here, the cluster head is selected with the help of GSO that minimizes the energy consumption as well as enhances the lifetime of WBSN. Further, the best path is identified by the FFO using the fitness value that is measured within the nodes on the basis of the distance. Since hybrid technology is used here, the routing accomplished is shown to be better. The results reveal that the proposed model has improved the sensor life term (95 sec) while compared with other existing methods like PSO with FFO (78 sec), ACO with FFO (77 sec), GA with FFO (76 sec), and LEACH (68 sec) algorithm for 500 nodes.},

With this understanding, we have proposed a new algebraic structure, namely monogenic semigroup, to construct a digital information authentication scheme. Authentication is always completed at the beginning of the application, before any throttling or approval checks are performed, and before any other code is allowed to begin running in the background. Many authentication schemes offer a complex structure for implementation in cryptosystems and applications. The anticipated mechanism uses a simple mathematical structure having the least conditions as compared to other mathematical structures.

  abstract     = {The Belt and Road Initiative is a major Initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013. Research on the risk prevention and control of China’s financial investment in countries along the Belt and Road has become a very hot topic in the world. This research focuses on the risk evaluatio n methods and prevention and control countermeasures of China’s foreign investment under the Belt and Road Initiative. First, based on the analysis of the existing studies on economic investment evaluation, an intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute evaluation method based on entropy method and G1 method is proposed. The essence of the proposed method is to combine the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory with subjective and objective evaluation methods, which improves the disadvantage of the original evaluation method taking too much subjective factors into consideration. This study applies the proposed method to the economic risk evaluation of China’s outward foreign direct investment (OFDI), constructs a 17-indicator economic risk system, and uses this method to rank the importance of the 17 indicators. The more important contribution is that this paper not only achieves improvements at the theoretical level and innovation at the practical level, but also condenses the research conclusions into three pieces of countermeasures and suggestions on China’s investment in countries along the Belt and Road. This research can provide theoretical support for Chinese government to make financial investment decisions in countries along the Belt and Road, and can also help countries along the Belt and Road to actively integrate into the Belt and Road Initiative, and promote the high-quality social and economic development of the countries along the Belt and Road.},

  abstract     = {Agent-based combat simulation is an important research method in the field of military science and system simulation. Behaviour decision model plays the key role in the design of combat simulation agents. The behaviour tree (BT) designed by nonplayer characters (NPCs) in the game provides an efficient and concise method for the construction of combat simulation agents and has been widely used. Because the rationality of BT construction directly affects the rationality of agent decision logic, designing a reasonable BT has become a crucial step. The design of the operational agent BT not only relies on rich tactical experience but also needs to repeatedly adjust and optimize the BT according to the operational deduction and simulation results. To avoid unreasonable BT design caused by lack of experience and eliminate the process of repeated debugging, a modelling method of a combat simulation agent that combines reinforcement learning and the BT method was proposed. This method not only makes the design process of BT more automatic but also simplifies the experience requirements of the combat simulation agent designers. Experiments show that RL-BT effectively integrates the reinforcement learning method and can endow combat simulation agents with battlefield learning ability while making independent decisions. The agent based on RL-BT for decision modelling can continuously adjust and optimize the decision process through experience accumulation, and its performance in combat simulation is significantly better than that of the agent using the original BT.},

Two kinds of time optimal control models are presented where optimistic value and reaching index are chosen as the optimality criteria, respectively. Applying the proposed uncertain optimal control model to a portfolio selection problem, we obtain the uncertainty distribution of the first hitting time (the investors’ first profit time). Meanwhile, sufficient conditions of the optimal control strategy of such models are provided. Numerical simulations are provided which reveal the change for our optimal control strategy.},

The proposed topology is to recover the capacity of power system is used to restore the normal operating condition. The proposed hybrid technique is the combination of chaotic Henry gas solubility optimization (CHGSO) and recalling-enhanced recurrent neural network (RENNN) and therefore called the CHGSO-RENNN technique. The proposed technique is used to optimally predict the internal and external current loop control parameters in light and the variety of power and current parameters. The small stability is revealed through the working conditions of the whole machine. The overall stability of the small signal is investigated in a linear model so that both source and load are used to characterize the state matrix of the frame that is used for eigenvalue examination. The PI controller gain parameters are optimally tuned and the controller offers reliable frame operation. The proposed technique is performed on MATLAB/Simulink work platform.},

Fuzzy-based clustering based on cluster head selection, optimized routing using particle swarm optimization (PSO), adaptive whale optimization algorithm (AWOA) are presented in this research work. Fuzzy logic considers the parameters like the distance between base station to node, node centrality, node degree, and residual energy for cluster head selection. The optimization model obtains an optimized node for routing from the selected cluster heads. In terms of network lifetime, delay, energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, and energy efficiency, simulation analysis of the proposed model is compared to conventional routing algorithms such as bacteria foraging optimization (BFO), Tree-based data gathering (TBDG) algorithm, Immune inspired routing (IIR), Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), and Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed (HEED) protocol.

Firstly, some existing distance measures in IFS space are summarized, and some of existing shortcomings are discussed. Secondly, the concept of hesitation factor is proposed by using the centroid coordinate representation of hesitation region, and then a new distance measure between two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is defined. It is proved that the distance measure satisfies the traditional distance axioms. Then, an intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method based on the proposed distance measure is developed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Counterfeit drugs are without a doubt becoming a greater hazard to consumers and the pharmaceutical sector. As a result, real-time visibility of drug manufacturing and management is required. The proposed system uses Ethereum blockchain as the main technology. The primary advantage of blockchain te chnology is that the transactions are maintained in immutable digital ledger format and it may be read easily without jeopardizing the users’ security and privacy. In our proposed system, the admin validates and adds the manufacturers. The manufacturer after registering and logging in can perform tasks like adding the drug and seller list. The seller can place order to the manufacturer which the manufacturer can accept or reject. The seller can update status of order of accepted orders to delivered. The customer can view the order details by entering the serial number on the drug package. Any transaction or exchange that occurs in the network is recorded in the chain. It functions similarly to other networks, but blockchain technology is distinguished by the fact that no data can be removed or altered by anyone in the network. No changes to the network can be made unless it has been validated by all of the network’s authorized users. All the information stored can be read by anybody so to incorporate more security, AES has been used to store data in the blockchain. The use of AES encryption technique distinguishes this system from all the existing implementations. Thus, this makes it easy to trace to the exact point in the supply chain and detect any counterfeit drugs in movement. As an extension to the drug counterfeit prevention system a Drug Recommendation System is also performed using the ensemble model with a combination of Random Forest and Logistic Regression for sentiment analysis training. Furthermore, when compared to the existing Linear SVM model, which has an accuracy of 90.39%, the suggested model has the best accuracy of 93.31%. Using the obtained sentiment for each drug, the drug is predicted accurately for the specified medical condition.},

  abstract     = {In daily life, the decision making problem is a complicated work related to uncertainties and vagueness. To overcome this vagueness and uncertainties, many fuzzy sets and theories have been presented by different scholars and researchers. EDA𝒮 (Evaluation based on distance from average solution) me thod plays a major role in decision-making problems. Especially, when multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems have more conflicting attribute. In this paper, a new approach known as Spherical fuzzy rough-EDA𝒮 (SFR-EDA𝒮) method is used to handle these uncertainties in the MAGDM problem. The aggregation operators have the ability to combine different sources of information, which plays an essential role in decision making (DM) problem. Keeping in view the increasing complexity of the DM problem, it will be useful to combine the aggregation operators with the fuzzy sets in solving DM problem. Therefore, an aggregation operator known as SFR-EDA𝒮 method is utilized. For this propounded some new averaging and geometric aggregation is investigated.

  abstract     = {The aim of the paper is to introduce some complex Einstein aggregation operators for aggregating the different complex Pythagorean fuzzy sets (CPFSs) by considering the dependency between the pairs of its membership degrees. In the existing studies of fuzzy and its extensions, the uncertainties pre sent in the data are handled with the help of degrees of membership that are the subset of real numbers, which may also loss some valuable data and hence consequently affect the decision results. A modification to these, complex Pythagorean fuzzy set handles the uncertainties with the degree whose ranges are extended from real subset to the complex subset with unit disc and hence handle the two dimensional information in a single set. Thus motivated by this and this paper we present some novel Einstein aggregation operators, namely complex Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein weighted averaging (CPFEWA) operator, complex Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted averaging (CPFEOWA) operator, complex Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein hybrid averaging (CPFEHA) operator, induced complex Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted averaging (I-CPFEOWA) operator, and induced complex Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein hybrid averaging (I-CPFEHA) operator. Also develop some of their desirable properties. Furthermore, based on these operators a multi-attribute group decision making problems developed. An illustrative example related to the selection of the best alternative is considered to show the effectiveness, of the novel developed methods.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of cloud computing infrastructure has increased the energy demand remarkably. Energy-efficient resource management is essential for running a cost effective and environment friendly data center. Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation is a well-accepted method for reducing the energy c onsumption of the cloud data center. Quality of service is an equally important aspect of cloud services. VM migrations caused by consolidation often cause degradation in QoS. These two parameters have been dealt with individually in most research and very few addressed both energy efficiency and QoS simultaneously. We have proposed a new Energy and QoS Efficient (EQSE) VM selection and placement method for improving the energy efficiency along with quality of service (QoS). VM selection and placement are two critical steps of VM consolidation. EQSE uses Resource Gap Minimization (RGM) algorithm for VM selection and Utilization-Aware Best-Fit Decreasing (UABFD) algorithm for placement of these VMs. EQSE along with dynamic thresholds reduces energy consumption and improves the quality of service by reducing the number of VM migrations. CloudSim simulation performed on PlanetLab data establishes the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state of the art methods of VM consolidation.},

Inspired by the idea of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) robust o ptimization, a deterministic convex reformulation is proposed for tackling the chance constrained problem. The existing state-of-the-art methods usually assume that the probability density function of preference information is known a priori, such as Gaussian distribution. However, it is generally over-conservatism. On the contrary, our proposed method provides a tractable second-order cone (SOC) reformulation for the chance constrained problem with the first and second moments, which is easy to handle and calculate. We also analyze the weight acquisition problem of hesitant fuzzy preference relation with unknown distribution preference using the SOC programming method, and obtain the priority weight with its approximately equivalent computationally tractable conic optimization model. A case study is conducted which shows that the proposed method achieves a good general conclusion by comparing it with the optimization method under Gaussian distribution. In addition, this method can also get better decision support for incomplete preference information.},

The pivotal procedure of this technique is determining the specific threshold of the images. In this paper, an improved mayfly algorithm (IMA)-based color image segmentation method is proposed. Tent mapping initializes the female mayfly population to increase population diversity. Lévy flight is introduced in the wedding dance iterative formulation to make IMA jump from the local optimal solution quickly. Two nonlinear coefficients were designed to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. To better verify the effectiveness, eight benchmark functions are used to test the performance of IMA. The average fitness value, standard deviation, and Wilcoxon rank sum test are used as evaluation metrics. The results show that IMA outperforms the comparison algorithm in terms of search accuracy. Furthermore, Kapur entropy is used as the fitness function of IMA to determine the segmentation threshold. 10 Berkeley images are segmented. The best fitness value, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and other indexes are used to evaluate the effect of segmented images. The results show that the IMA segmentation method improves the segmentation accuracy of color images and obtains higher quality segmented images.},

We use entire color information on the WCE pictures and the pixel-represented clustering approach to get the clustered centers that characterize WCE pictures as words. Then we evaluate the status of a WCE framework using the nearby SVM and K methods (KNN). The classification performance is 95.75% accurate for the AUC 0.9771% and validates the exciting performance for bleeding classification provided by the suggested approach. Second, we present a two-step approach for extracting saliency maps to emphasize bleeding locations with a distinct color channel mixer to build a first-stage salience map. The second stage salience map was taken with optical contrast.We locate bleeding spots following a suitable fusion approach and threshold. Quantitative and qualitative studies demonstrate that our approaches can correctly distinguish bleeding sites from neighborhoods.},

  abstract     = {Since the BP neural network has poor performance and unstable learning rate in the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm of photovoltaic (PV) system, an adaptive particle swarm optimization BP neural network-fuzzy control PV MPPT algorithm (APSO-BP-FLC) is proposed in this paper. First, the inertia weight, learning factor and acceleration factor of particle swarm optimization (PSO) are self-updating, and the mutation operator is adopted to initialize the position of each particle. Second, the APSO algorithm is used to update the optimal weight threshold of BP neural network, where the input layer is irradiation and temperature, and the output layer is the maximum power point (MPP) voltage. Third, the fuzzy logical control (FLC) is employed to adjust the duty cycle of Boost converter. The inputs of FLC are voltage difference and duty ratio D(n-1) at the previous time, and the output is duty ratio D(n). Moreover, D(n-1) is optimized by |dP/dU| to improve the search range of FLC. The irradiation, temperature and MPP voltage of PV cell are adopted as the datasets for simulation in a city in Shaanxi province, China. Simulation results show that the proposed MPPT algorithm is superior to the APSO-BP, FLC and perturbation and observation (P&amp;O) algorithm with tracking performance, steady state oscillation rate and efficiency. In addition, the efficiency of proposed MPPT algorithm is improved by 0.37%, 6.2%, and 6.8% as compared to APSO-BP, FLC and P&amp;O algorithm.},

MATLAB software is utilized to verify the efficacy of the suggested topology. To demonstrate the practicality of this technology, experimental verification is carried out.

Indeed, GA proves efficient in terms of the computational time given th e environmental constraints and the various variables inherent to the types of users and the degree of priority allotted to each of them. However, it was revealed that some issues having to do with instability require further adjustments. In the present article the aforementioned model is revisited with the aim of addressing the high standard deviations attributed to the objective function. More specifically, the present work considers the side effects of GA in sweeping the entire space of eligible solutions. In this respect, fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated as a major component in order to orient the GA research. At the computational level, GA places the solution found by FL at the center of the solution space around which the initial population can be built. The implementation of this hybrid method reduces both the waiting time at traffic lights and the standard deviation of the results, showing a significant improvement in the management system.},

It is understood that exist so restricted studies focusing on forecasting both hardened and fresh features of self-compacting concrete (SCC).

This study aims to specify SVR method key parameters using Ant lion optimization (ALO) and Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithms. The considered properties of SCC in the fresh phase are the L-box test, V-funnel test, slump flow, and in the hardened phase is CS. Results demonstrate powerful potential in the learning section for all considered properties as well as approximating in the testing phase. It can be seen that the proposed models have R2 incredible value in the learning and testing phase. It means that the correlation between observed and predicted properties of SCC from hybrid models is acceptable so that it represents high accuracy in the training and approximating process. All in all, in most of the cases, the SVR model developed by ALO outperforms BBO-SVR, which depicts the capability of the ALO algorithm for determining the optimal parameters of the considered method.},

  abstract     = {The semantic query problem is commonly called the semantic gap and is one of the significant problems in multimedia data retrieval. In this study, we focus on multimedia data retrieval by combining semantic information with data content to solve the semantic gap problem effectively. The main idea b ehind the combination of low-level content descriptors and the concept of multimedia data is to represent the content information with the semantic information by adding a low-level content descriptor as a new dimension to the index structure. This new dimension is represented by constructing an array index structure that uses a fuzzy clustering algorithm. Thus, a new high-dimensional index structure, named MM-FOOD, supporting querying of multimedia data, including fuzzy querying, is presented in this paper. This proposed index structure’s construction and query algorithms are explained throughout this paper. Our experiments show that our indexing mechanism is considerably efficient compared to the basic indexing approach, which stores low-level content and semantic concept descriptors in separate structures when the data size is large.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and rapid prediction of the coal and gas outburst is very significant for preventing accident and protecting environment, the paper presents a novel feature selection and outburst classifier framework which can identify effective candidate features and improve the classification accuracy. First, Apriori is applied for preliminarily extracting the association rules from sample data and attribute features in coal and outburst, and it can present the effective sample data and features for outburst prediction. Second, in order to reduce the redundancy of the strong association rules obtained from Apriori, Boruta is applied for selecting all highly relevant optimal features based on the obtained strong association rules. Third, Random Forest(RF) is used to assign different weights to different features in optimal candidate features considering the importance of different features to outburst, based on the above obtained high-quality sample data and optimal features, the parameters of KNN model optimized by Bayesian Optimization(BO) is used to predict the coal and gas outburst. The experimental results show that the proposed feature selection model Apriori-Boruta can obtain significant sample data, and the proposed RF- KNN optimized classifier model can achieve higher performance in terms of the number of optimal features and prediction accuracy compared with traditional prediction models.},

The propagation of disinformation has been aided by the proliferation of social media and online forums. Allowing it to readily blend in with true information. Parody news and rumors are the most common types of misleading and unverified information, and they should be caught as soon as possible to avoid their disastrous consequences. As a result, in recent years, there has been a surge in interest in effective detection approaches. For this study, a customized dataset was built that included both real and parody tweets from Pakistan and India. This study proposes a two-step strategy for detecting parody tweets. In the first stage of the approach the unstructured data is converted into structured data set. In the second step, multiple supervised artificial intelligence algorithms were employed. An experimental assessment of the different classification methods inside a customized dataset was undertaken in this study, and these classification models were compared using evaluation metrics. Our results showed accuracy of 92%.},

  abstract     = {The selection of a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant site is the core issue that determines whether the WTE project can effectively treat municipal solid waste, reduce environmental pollution, and promote the development of a circular economy, and is often determined through group decision-making. The co mplexity of this group decision problem makes the opinions of decision makers often with uncertainty. The single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) can reduce the loss of information that contains uncertainty by quantitatively describing the information through three functions. In addition, existing studies on group decision-making for WTE plant siting suffer from the problem that decision maker weights do not change in concert with those decision makers’ decision information. Therefore, this study proposes a group decision-making method based on SVNSs. First, a group consensus strategy is proposed to improve group consensus by removing the evaluation value of the corresponding solution for decision makers who do not reach consensus and are unwilling to modify their preferences. Second, a decision maker weight determination and adjustment method is proposed to readjust the decision maker weights from the solution level according to their respective consensus degree when the decision makers’ preference information changes. This method enables the decision makers’ preferences and weights to be changed jointly. An illustrative example and a comparative analysis of WTE plant siting decisions demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the method. The experimental results show that the method is effective in helping decision makers to select the optimal WTE plant site more accurately.},

  abstract     = {Today’s healthcare sectors are driven and work to rescue patients as soon as possible by giving them the right care and treatment. A healthcare monitoring system works in two ways: by keeping track of the patient’s activities and overall health. For prompt treatment, such as giving the right and su itable medication, administering an injection, and providing additional medical help, nursing supervision is required. Wearable sensors are fixed or connected to the patient’s body and can follow their health. These IoT medical gadgets let clinicians diagnose patients and comprehend the processes from remote. However, the amount of data produced by IoT devices is so large that it cannot be handled manually. A model for automated analysis is required. Convolution Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) was therefore suggested in this study as a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework (HDLF) for a Patient Activity Monitoring System (PAMS) that brings all healthcare activities with its classes. To incorporate medical specialists from all over the world and enhance treatment outcomes, the framework offers an advanced model where patient activities, health conditions, medications, and other activities are distributed in the cloud. An effective architecture for Wearable Sensor Network-based Human Action Recognition that combines neural network Simple Recurrent Units (SRUs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). For assessing the multimodal data input sequence, deep SRUs and a variety of internal memory states is utilized in this research. Furthermore, for addressing the concerns about accuracy oscillations or instability with decreasing gradients, a deep GRUs to store and learn the knowledge is conveyed to the future state. The analysis suggests that CNN-LSTM is then contrasted with some of the currently used algorithms, and it is found that the new system has a 99.53% accuracy rate. The difference between this accuracy result and the current value is at least 4.73%.},

  abstract     = {The advent of machine learning in the recent decade has excelled in determining new potential features and non-linear relationships existing between the data derived from the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Machine learning also enhances the process of handling data with maximum predictor variable s compared to observations during the data mining process of prediction. The EHR data is often confronted with quality issues that are related to misclassification, missingness and measurement errors. In this context, ensemble classification schemes are determined to be essential for preventing the quality issues of EHR data. Moreover, the data sources like EHR include sensitive information that needs to be protected from disclosure before it is forwarded to the mining process. Further, the sensitive data of EHR must be hidden without modifying the dataset such that it does not influence the prediction accuracy of the incorporated ensemble classification mechanism. In this paper, the process of hiding EHR data is facilitated through Improved Sensitivity Drift based k-Anonymized Data Perturbation Scheme (ISD-k-ADP) that randomly perturbs the data in the dataset by including restricted amount of noise. This controlled amount of included noise is derived carefully from the Sensitivity Drift based depending on the expected privacy level before it is sent to the process of classification. This ISD-k-ADP scheme is reliable such that, it prevents the impact induced by the hidden data during the process of Two Stage Bagging Pruning based Ensemble Classification (TSBP-EC). Furthermore, the TSBP-EC uses the methods of distance and accuracy based pruning that aids in minimizing the size of the ensemble for ensuring effective and efficient classification using machine learning. The simulation results of the proposed ISD-k-ADP-TSBP-EC scheme is determined to be predominant based on Classification Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Kappa Statistic in contrast to the standard schemes.},

Shadows and edges can be used as linguistic parameters to identify vehicles in the daytime. The lamps are elevated higher than the air dams to avoid casting a shadow under the car at night. One in-sourcing vehicle and three out-sourcing vehicles are tested to determine the driver’s blind spot and a more comfortable driver’s seat and a rear-view mirror using the proposed system.

Additionally, the results of the IHSO-ANFIS are compared with HSO-ANFIS, ANFIS without any feature selection and standard bench mark datasets. IHSO-ANFIS attained 87.05% Bacc, 89.95% AUC and 0.6586 MCC on the RA dataset.

Various models can be found in the literature to determine if blockchain should be adopted and, if so, which type of blockchain should be adopted. However, these models are already becoming obsolete as they determine the usage of blockchain using simple yes or no. In order to overcome these problems, all these models are converted from binary-based selection to fuzzy-based selection, and decision matrices are created. Various multi-criteria decision analysis methods are applied, and final results are obtained. In addition, a novel model is presented, and a MATLAB application is developed to let the user determine if blockchain can be integrated with any technology or not.

There are a number of approaches discussed in the literature to support the growth of agriculture by considering different factors. But still the performance of pla nt management is not up to the expected level in terms of plant management and security concern. To handle these issues, an efficient multi view image based plant management technique which consider color and contrast features to obtain the features of fluid, plant, climate to compute different supportive measures like Fluid Specific Growth Support (FSGS), Plant Specific Growth Support (PSGS) and Climate Specific Growth Support (CSGS) measures to compute the value of Plant Growth Measure (PGM) and Crop Yield Measure (CYM). Also, using the same support measures, the presence of diseased plants is identified and fertilizers are regulated accordingly. Similarly, the wireless sensor network has been used as monitoring environment which has several routes to monitor different locations of agriculture lands. The presences of different routes are monitored for the transmission of different agriculture data. To handle the security issues, a low rate attack detection scheme is presented which finds the routes and for each route the method computes Service centric Legitimate Support (SCLS) to find low rate attacks. Similarly, the data security by controlling different smart devices in agriculture lands is enforced by using service centric data encryption (SCDE) scheme which uses different encryption scheme and keys to encrypt the data being used for controlling the devices of agricultural lands.

  abstract     = {A heart attack is a common cause of death globally. It can be treated successfully through a simple and accurate diagnosis. Getting the right diagnosis at the right time is very important for the treatment of heart failure. Currently, the conventional method of diagnosing heart disease is not relia ble. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that can be used to analyze the data collected by sensors. Data mining is another type of technology that can be utilized in the healthcare industry. These techniques help predict heart disease based on various factors. We developed a prediction and recommendation model aimed at predicting heart disease using the Optimized Deep Belief Network. It does so by taking into account the various features of the heart disease UCI and Stalog database. Finally, the proposed method classifies healthy people and people with heart illness with an accuracy of 97.91%.},

  abstract     = {Drowsiness is the inactivated state of the brain and observed during the transition from awaken state to sleepy state. This inactive state diminishes an individual’s attention and leads to accidents during professional or personal activities. The prediction of this inactive (drowsiness) state using AI plays a substantial role in the avoidance of accidents. The advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience approaches are used for the prediction of this inactive drowsy state. In order to prevent these devastating accidents, the state of drowsiness of the driver has to be be monitored. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a predominant tool adopted to examine various states of the brain effectually. It is generally known as Brain-Computer Interface System. The EEG channels are used for predicting the inactive state while implementing the real-time applications. However, the researchers face various challenges during execution based on the classification and channel selection process. This research concentrates on modelling and efficient drowsiness prediction methods and intends to bridge the gap encountered in the existing approaches. A novel stacked Long Short-Term Memory(s - LSTM) with Deep Fully Connected- Convolutional Neural Network (DFC - CNN) is used to learn and memorize the long-term feature dependencies and attains essential information based on time-series prediction. Single and multi-channel EEG data is considered to measure the statistical characteristics of available EEG signals. The online available OpenBCI sleep analysis data is used for performing the experimentation, and run in GoogleColab environment. The proposed s - LSTM model provides a better trade-off compared to existing approaches. The model generalization is improved with the validation of combined feature subjects. Here, metrics like prediction accuracy, RMSE, false positives, scaling coefficients related to false positives are measured to show the significance of the model.},

  abstract     = {Trust enabled wireless networks use temporal behaviour information of nodes in order to classify them into different trust categories. This information is utilized by the router for high performance communication that is optimized in terms of end-to-end delay, energy consumption, throughput, packet delivery ratio, and other quality of service (QoS) parameters. Establishing security in trust enabled wireless networks is a difficult task, because high trust nodes might be compromised by external or internal attacks, thereby disrupting normal communication. In order to perform this task, blockchain based security models are deployed. These models provide high transparency, comprehensive traceability, distributed processing, and data immutability, which makes them highly deployable for trust enabled networks. Blockchain models enforce compulsive verification of data before communication, which makes them resilient to DDoS, MITM, denial of service, and other data-based attacks. In order to enforce these checks, each of the block is hashed, and the hash values are compared with every existing block in the chain. These checks include hash uniqueness, and hash pattern validations; the later of which is decided by the network designer(s). As the length of blockchain increases, computational complexity of adding a new block (a.k.a. blockchain mining) increases exponentially, which adds to the end-to-end delay, and energy consumption of wireless nodes, which is a drawback of these models. To avoid this, sidechains &amp; blockchain sharding models are developed. These models work by dividing the existing blockchain into multiple parts (based on a certain pre-set criteria), and then use the parts for high speed and low power mining. But again, due to increase in number of sidechains, the computational complexity of managing these chains, and locating data blocks within them increases exponentially. Moreover, in any practical wireless network, there is a need to communicate modifiable data, which is not supported by current blockchain implementations. In order to resolve these issues, this text proposes a transformable blockchain sharding model, which is managed via a light weight meta heuristic method for high-speed data access. The proposed model aims at reducing computational complexity of sidechain maintenance with the help of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for storing of hash ranges. The model also incorporates a transformable blockchain solution, wherein the block structure is designed to incorporate selectively mutable as well as non-mutable information. Both the mutable and non-mutable information is encrypted using high performance elliptic curve cryptosystem, which makes it highly secure against network attacks. The proposed model showcases 15% improvement in network lifetime, 8% reduction in end-to-end delay, 22% reduction in computational complexity, and 18% improvement in network throughput when compared with various blockchain and sidechain based wireless networks, thereby assisting in development of a high QoS and highly secure wireless network.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an innovative architecture called cascade chaotic fuzzy system (CCFS) for the function approximation and chaotic modeling. The proposed model can dominate complications in the type-2 fuzzy systems and increase the chaotic performance of a whole framework. The proposed cascade st ructure is based on combining two or more one-dimensional chaotic maps. The combination provides a new chaotic map with more high nonlinearity than its grain maps. The fusion of cascade chaotic structure into the neurons of the membership layer of a conventional fuzzy system makes the CCFS more capable of confronting nonlinear problems. Based on the General Function Approximation and Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we show that the proposed model has the function approximation property. By analyzing the bifurcation diagram and applying the CCFS to the problem of chaotic modeling, the new model is investigated. Simulation results and analysis are demonstrated to illustrate the concept of general function approximation.},

  abstract     = {A Neural Network is one of the techniques by which we classify data. In this paper, we have proposed an effectively stacked autoencoder with the help of a modified sigmoid activation function. We have made a two-layer stacked autoencoder with a modified sigmoid activation function. We have compared our autoencoder to the existing autoencoder technique. In the existing autoencoder technique, we generally use the logsigmoid activation function. But in multiple cases using this technique, we cannot achieve better results. In that case, we may use our technique for achieving better results. Our proposed autoencoder may achieve better results compared to this existing autoencoder technique. The reason behind this is that our modified sigmoid activation function gives more variations for different input values. We have tested our proposed autoencoder on the iris, glass, wine, ovarian, and digit image datasets for comparison propose. The existing autoencoder technique has achieved 96% accuracy on the iris, 91% accuracy on wine, 95.4% accuracy on ovarian, 96.3% accuracy on glass, and 98.7% accuracy on digit (image) dataset. Our proposed autoencoder has achieved 100% accuracy on the iris, wine, ovarian, and glass, and 99.4% accuracy on digit (image) datasets. For more verification of the effeteness of our proposed autoencoder, we have taken three more datasets. They are abalone, thyroid, and chemical datasets. Our proposed autoencoder has achieved 100% accuracy on the abalone and chemical, and 96% accuracy on thyroid datasets.},
