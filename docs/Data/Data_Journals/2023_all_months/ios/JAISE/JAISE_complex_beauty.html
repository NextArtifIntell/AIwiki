Existing research has focused on utilizing data-driven method to study carbon emissions off a single object. This study proposes a regional carbon emissions prediction method. The area objects are divided into dynamic objects for vehicles and static objects for buildings. For the dynamic object, carbon emissions is modeled using the vehicle location provided by the BeiDou satellite navigation system (BDS). For the static object, the neural network R3det (rotation remote sensing target detection) is used to identify the buildings in remote sensing images, and then the trained ARIMA time series model is used to predict the carbon emissions. The model is tested in an industrial park in Tangshan, Hebei Province in China. The result of the regional three-dimensional emission map shows that the method provided a novel and feasible idea for carbon emissions prediction.},

  abstract     = {Fog computing is a paradigm that works in tandem with cloud computing. The emergence of fog computing has boosted cloud-based computation, especially in the case of delay-sensitive tasks, as the fog is situated closer to end devices such as sensors that generate data. While scheduling tasks, the fundamental issue is allocating resources to the fog nodes. With the ever-growing demands of the industry, there is a constant need for gateways for efficient task offloading and resource allocation, for improving the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. This paper focuses on the smart gateways to enhance QoS and proposes a smart gateway framework for delay-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks. The proposed framework has been divided into two phases: task scheduling and task offloading. For the task scheduling phase, a dynamic priority-aware task scheduling algorithm (DP-TSA) is proposed to schedule the incoming task based on their priorities. A Memoization based Best-Fit approach (MBFA) algorithm is proposed to offload the task to the selected computational node for the task offloading phase. The proposed framework has been simulated and compared with the traditional baseline algorithms in different test case scenarios. The results show that the proposed framework not only optimized latency and throughput but also reduced energy consumption and was scalable as against the traditional algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are self-organizing, self-configuring, and infrastructure-less networks for performing multi-hop communication. The source mobile node can transmit the information to any other destination node, but it has limitations with energy consumption and battery lifetime. Since it appeals to a huge environment, there is a probability of obstacle present. Thus, the network requires finding the obstacles to evade performance degradation and also enhance the routing efficiency. To achieve this, an obstacle-aware efficient routing using a heuristic-based deep learning model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the nodes in the MANET are employed for initiating the transmission. Further, it is needed to be predicted whether the node is malicious or not. Consequently, the prediction for link connection between the nodes is achieved by the Optimized Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (OBi-LSTM), where the hyperparameters are tuned by the Adaptive Horse Herd Optimization (AHHO) algorithm. Secondly, once the links are secured from the obstacle, it is undergone for routing purpose. Routing is generally used to transmit data or packets from one place to another. To attain better routing, various objective constraints like delay, distance, path availability, transmission power, and several interferences are used for deriving a multi-objective function, in which the optimal path is obtained through the AHHO algorithm. Finally, the simulation results of the proposed model ensure to yield efficient multipath routing by accurately identifying the intruder present in the network. Thus, the proposed model aims to reduce the objectives like delay, distance, and power consumption.},

  abstract     = {As the world’s population rises, the healthcare system experiences significant changes. Wireless body area network (WBAN) is an emerging technology that has considerable impact on medical and non-medical applications. However, two crucial challenges in WBANs are interference minimization and channel assignment. High interference may increase collision probability, transmission delay, and energy consumption. Multichannel schemes are proposed to reduce the data transmission latency and improve the system throughput by allowing simultaneous transmission of sensors in coexisting WBANs. When WBAN users move, they need to switch the channels frequently to avoid potential channel conflicts and to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS). However, frequent switching may raise energy consumption and aggravate delay. Existing multichannel assignment schemes failed to perform well in highly dynamic and densely deployed WBANs environments. In contrast to existing studies, this paper proposes a Prediction-based Channel Assignment (PCA) algorithm that selects the channels for WBANs to remain valid for future time instances and thus minimizes the delay and number of channel switches for dynamic and coexisting WBANs. When a WBAN needs to switch a channel, the proposed method predicts the future neighbors of that WBAN based on its history. It explores the channel information of present and future neighbors to select a suitable channel with higher resilience in a dynamic environment. Thus, our algorithm minimizes channel interference by avoiding unnecessary channel switching. We have used machine learning algorithms to predict the future neighbors of a WBAN. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than an existing algorithm and random channel assignment in delay and throughput.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is to offer a unique adaptive path planning framework to address a new challenge known as the Unknown environment Persistent Monitoring Problem (PMP). To identify the unknown events’ occurrence location and likelihood, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and camera is used to record such events in agriculture land. A certain level of detecting capability must be the distinct monitoring priority in order to keep track of them to a certain distance. First, to formulate a model, we developed an event-oriented modelling strategy for unknown environment perception and the effect is enumerated by uncertainty, which takes into account the sensor’s detection capabilities, the detection interval, and monitoring weight. A mobile robot scheme utilizing LIDAR on integrative approach was created and experiments were carried out to solve the high equipment budget of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for robotic systems. To map an unfamiliar location using the robotic operating system (ROS), the 3D visualization tool for Robot Operating System (RVIZ) was utilized, and GMapping software package was used for SLAM usage. The experimental results suggest that the mobile robot design pattern is viable to produce a high-precision map while lowering the cost of the mobile robot SLAM hardware. From a decision-making standpoint, we built a hybrid algorithm HSAStar (Hybrid SLAM &amp; A Star) algorithm for path planning based on the event oriented modelling, allowing a UGV to continually monitor the perspectives of a path. The simulation results and analyses show that the proposed strategy is feasible and superior. The performance of the proposed hyb SLAM-A Star-APP method provides 34.95%, 27.38%, 33.21% and 29.68% lower execution time, 26.36%, 29.64% and 29.67% lower map duration compared with the existing methods, such as ACO-APF-APP, APFA-APP, GWO-APP and PSO-APP.},

  abstract     = {Path planning algorithms determine the performance of the ambient intelligence navigation schemes in autonomous mobile robots. Sampling-based path planning algorithms are widely employed in autonomous mobile robot applications. RRT*, or Optimal Rapidly Exploring Random Trees, is a very effective sampling-based path planning algorithm. However, the RRT* solution converges slowly. This study proposes a directional random sampling-based RRT* path planning algorithm known as DR-RRT* to address the slow convergence issue. The novelty of the proposed method is that it reduces the search space by combining directional non-uniform sampling with uniform sampling. It employs a random selection approach to combine the non-uniform directional sampling method with uniform sampling. The proposed path planning algorithm is validated in three different environments with a map size of 384*384, and its performance is compared to two existing algorithms: RRT* and Informed RRT*. Validation is carried out utilizing a TurtleBot3 robot with the Gazebo Simulator and the Robotics Operating System (ROS) Melodic. The proposed DR-RRT* path planning algorithm is better than both RRT* and Informed RRT* in four performance measures: the number of nodes visited, the length of the path, the amount of time it takes, and the rate at which the path converges. The proposed DR-RRT* global path planning algorithm achieves a success rate of 100% in all three environments, and it is suited for use in all kinds of environments.},

Effective irrigation scheduling necessitates an estimation of future soil moisture content. This study presents deep learning models such as CNN-LSTM, a hybrid Deep Learning model that predicts future soil moisture using climate and soil information, including past soil moisture content. The study also investigates the appropriate number of observations and data sampling rate required to predict the next day’s soil moisture value. In terms of MSE, MAE, RMSE, and R 2 , the hybrid CNN-LSTM model is compared to standalone LSTM and Bi-LSTM models. The LSTM model achieved an MSE of 0.2471, MAE of 0.1978, RMSE of 0.4971, and R 2 of 0.9714. The LSTM model outperformed the Bi-LSTM model, which had an MSE of 0.3036, MAE of 0.3248, RMSE of 0.5510, and R 2 of 0.9614. With an MSE of 0.1348, MAE of 0.1868, RMSE of 0.3672, and R 2 of 0.9838, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model outperformed the LSTM. Our findings suggest that deep learning models, particularly the Convolutional LSTM, hold great potential for predicting soil moisture accurately. The Convolutional LSTM model’s superior performance can be attributed to its ability to capture spatial dependencies in soil moisture data. Furthermore, the results show that for better prediction, sub-hourly data samples from the previous three days should be considered.},

These biosensors increase the amount of transmitted data across the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) network. Therefore, it is necessary to decrease the transmitted data and make a decision at the edge gateway to save the energy of the biosensors and produce a quick response for the medical staff. This paper proposes an energy-efficient multisensor adaptive sampling and aggregation (EMASA) for patient monitoring in edge computing-based IoHT networks. In the edge-based IoHT network, EMASA operates on two levels: biosensors and the edge gateway. Each biosensor removes the redundant sensed data using the local emergency detection and sampling rate adaptation algorithms. In the edge gateway, it implements a machine learning-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to provide a suitable decision about the status of the monitored patient. We accomplished various examinations using real data from the patients’ biosensors. According to the simulation results, EMASA reduced the size of transmitted data from 93.5% to 99% and saved 78.35% of energy when compared to a previous study. It keeps the whole score with a good representation at the Edge gateway and provides accurate and fast decisions based on the patient’s condition.},

  abstract     = {This systematic literature review presents the computational methods of human behaviour prediction research from Pentland and Liu’s seminal 1999 paper on human behaviour prediction to the latest research to date. The PRISMA framework for systematic reviews was used as the review methodology to structure this information aggregation. This review provides a high-level summary of the field with key areas identified for new research. The results show that there are frequently used datasets for training predictive models: MavHome, MavLab, LIARA, CASAS, PlaceLab, and REDD. Accuracies in the range of 43.9% to 100% for predictions of varying complexity. Common data structures for modelling behavioural data: Vectors, tables, trees, Markov models, and graphs. Algorithms that fall into three distinct categories: Machine Learning (NN, RL, LSTM), Probabilistic Graphical Models (namely Bayesian and Markov variants), and Statistical and Trend Analysis (ARIMA, Prophet). Additionally, we document other notably useful algorithms that fall outside of these three main categories including Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distances. Opportunities identified for further research include the use of audio as the data source for behaviour prediction methods, and applying times-series prediction machine learning algorithms (RNN, LSTM) to the smart home problem space.},

The authors examined the effects on the sleep quality with adjustment of autonomic nervous activity by individually optimizing complex environment befor e sleep. Sixteen subjects underwent an environment optimization experiment during the day and subsequent sleep experiment (9 days/individual) and the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency (LF/HF) components of heart rate variability was measured during the experiment. The LF/HF decreased under optimal conditions by 19% compared to the control conditions. Next, the effects of optimal conditions before sleep on the sleep quality were evaluated. Based on the index for the sleep quality (light sleep index), effect of the optimal environment conditions before sleep was not clearly observed for all subjects. Clustering analysis was evaluated to analyze the cause deeply. As a result, for the group of experiment subjects who did not feel nervous about the experiment, the light sleep index was decreased under optimal conditions by 29% compared to the control conditions. It was found that the effect on such stimuli could disappear in the subjects who were nervous about the experiment.},

  abstract     = {Scientific contributions in the area of smart environments cover different tasks of ambient intelligence including action and activity recognition, anomaly detection, and automated enactment. Algorithms solving these tasks need to be validated against sensor logs of smart environments. In order to acquire these datasets, expensive facilities are needed, containing sensors, actuators and an acquisition infrastructure. Even though several freely accessible datasets are available, each of them features a very specific set of sensors, which can limit the introduction of novel approaches that could benefit of particular types of sensors and deployment layouts. Additionally, acquiring a dataset requires a considerable human effort for labeling purposes, thus further limiting the creation of new and general ones. In this paper, we propose a model-based simulator capable to generate synthetic datasets that emulate the characteristics of the vast majority of real datasets while granting trustworthy evaluation results. The datasets are generated using the eXtensible Event Stream – XES international standard commonly used for representing event logs. Finally, the datasets produced by the simulator are validated against two real scenario’s logs from the literature.},

Given the unresolved uncertainties surrounding the SHT acceptance literature and concern regarding the relatively low smart home device uptake, there is a need to reappraise the existing literature to delve deeper and search for solutions. Based on the research method PRISMA, a systematic literature review on SHT acceptance was undertaken to evaluate its different models and develop a hypothetical model. Twenty-three papers were selected in the review, and the results indicate that the Technological Acceptance Model was the most applied model when investigating SHT acceptance. Moreover, the most significant variables used to measure SHT acceptance were compatibility and perceived usefulness. The systematic literature review also revealed some significant patterns including the uptake of non-Western research and the use of sales and market share as a metric of SHT acceptance. Future directions on how researchers, smart home developers and governmental agencies can utilize the findings conclude the systematic review.},

  abstract     = {Significant population growth and ongoing socioeconomic development have increased reliance on irrigated agriculture and agricultural intensification. However, accurately predicting crop water demand is problematic since it is affected by several factors such as weather, soil, and water properties. Many studies have shown that a hybrid irrigation system based on two irrigation strategies (i.e., evapotranspiration and soil-based irrigation) can provide a credible and reliable irrigation system. The latter can also alert farmers and other experts to phenomena such as noise, erroneous sensor signals, numerous correlated input and target variables, and incomplete or missing data, especially when the two irrigation strategies produce inconsistent results. Hence, we propose Multi-Target soil moisture and evapotranspiration prediction (MTR-SMET) for estimating soil moisture and evapotranspiration. These predictions are then used to compute water needs based on Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and soil-based methods. Besides, we propose an explainable MTR-SMET (xMTR-SMET) that explains the ML-based irrigation to the farmers/users using several explainable AI to provide simple visual explanations for the given predictions. It is the first attempt that explains and offers meaningful insights into the output of a machine learning-based irrigation approach. The conducted experiments showed that the proposed MTR-SMET model achieves low error rates (i.e., MSE = 0.00015, RMSE = 0.0039, MAE = 0.002) and high R2 score (i.e., 0.9676).},

In this study, an ecosystem consisting of Beacon devices, Bluetooth intelligent devices, and Wi-Fi access points has been created to propose an effective indoor location determination method by using Wi-Fi and BLE technologies in a hybrid way. First, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) data were collected using the fingerprint method. Then, Kalman Filter and Savitzky Golay Filter are used in a hybrid manner to reduce the noise on the obtained signal data and make it more stable. In the first part, using the collected data from Wi-Fi and Beacon devices, the Non-linear least squares method (NLLS), including Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), is used for indoor tracking. In the second part, a fingerprinting-based approach is tested. K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms estimate the area where the client is located. Each algorithm’s accuracy rate are calculated on different training and test data and presented.},

Pollution is a concern worldwide, and pollution levels inside buildings (homes or workplaces) can be higher than outdoors. To alleviate this problem and improve air quality, ornamental plants can be used. This paper presents the application of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to develop a system called P4L, an acronym for “Plants for Life”. The objective of P4L is the automated care of potted plants to improve air quality and make the indoor environments of a building healthier. This IoT-based system (IoTS) has been developed through low-cost Arduino-compatible components. In addition, the Test-Driven Development Methodology for IoT-based Systems (TDDM4IoTS) has been used to guide P4L development. In fact, this article shows the result of the application of this methodology (phase by phase), with the help of the Test-Driven Development Tool for IoT-based Systems (TDDT4IoTS), which supports the aforementioned methodology, to develop P4L. To validate the methodology, we conducted a survey among developers that have used it, the results of which show that it is efficient and covers all aspects of IoTS development.},

  abstract     = {The ubiquity of mobile devices has birthed one of the most promising IoT applications called Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) wherein mobile devices carried around by a crowd are used to sense phenomena of interest. Subsequently, sensed data are collected, aggregated and analysed to extract useful inform ation. Sparse Mobile Crowd Sensing (SMCS) aims at reducing the sensing overhead (e.g., battery consumption, incentive cost, etc.) by lowering the number of sensing tasks performed. Sensed data thus collected are used to infer missing values. However, it must be ensured that user’s private information (e.g., user’s home location) cannot be derived from the sensed data shared by a user. We propose a novel approach entitled ‘Privacy Aware Missing Data Inference Scheme for Sparse Mobile Crowd Sensing (PAMDI)’ which employs the concept of perceptual hash for ensuring privacy while trying to maintain performance guarantees. Simulation results with the help of two real-world data-sets point towards the feasibility of the proposed approach for provisioning user privacy. We use regression algorithms for missing data inference in PAMDI and find that linear regression algorithms work best with the proposed privacy approach as compared to non-linear regression algorithms. Moreover, we observe that inference accuracy is more or less maintained even after introducing privacy with the proposed approach. In particular, for the first data-set (Temperature data-set), the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) values obtained by the linear algorithms using the proposed approach are about 2.65∘C and 2.9∘C respectively. On the other hand, the corresponding MAE and RMSE values generated by the linear algorithms when no privacy is introduced are about 2.25∘C and 2.85∘C respectively. For non-linear algorithms, the corresponding error values are higher. We also observe the same trend in the results of the second data-set.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, human overpopulation is stressing our ecosystems in different ways, agriculture being a critical example as different predictions point towards food shortages in the near future. Accordingly, smart farming is becoming key to the optimization of natural resources so that different crops ca n be grown efficiently, consuming as few resources as possible. In particular, greenhouses have proved to be an effective way of producing a high volume of vegetables/fruits in a reduced space and within a short time span. Hence, optimizing greenhouse functioning results in less water use and nutrient consumption, less energy use, faster growth, and better product quality. In this article, we carry out an in-depth analysis of different machine learning (ML) models to improve climate control in smart greenhouses. As part of the analysis of the techniques we also considered 3 ways of pre-processing the data, as well as 12-hour and 24-hour forecasting. We focus on forecasting the indoor air temperature of an operational smart greenhouse, i.e. assessing the data anomalies that are inherently present in these environments due to the instability of IoT infrastructures. Several ML models are adapted to time series forecasting to provide an overview of these techniques and to find out which one performs better in this particular scenario. Our results show that, after statistically validating the results, the Random Forest Regression technique gives the best overall result with a mean absolute error of less than 1 degree Celsius.},
