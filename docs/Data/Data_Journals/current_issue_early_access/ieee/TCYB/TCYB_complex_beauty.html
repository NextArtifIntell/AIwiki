  abstract     = {Linear quadratic control with unknown value functions and dynamics is extremely challenging, and most of the existing studies have focused on the regulation problem, incapable of dealing with the tracking problem. To solve both linear quadratic regulation and tracking problems for continuous-time systems with unknown value functions, this article develops a discounted inverse reinforcement learning (DIRL) method that inherits the model-independent property of reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we first formulate a standard paradigm for solving linear quadratic control using DIRL. To recover the value function and the target control gain, an error metric is elaborately constructed, and a quasi-Newton algorithm is adopted to minimize it. Furthermore, three DIRL algorithms, including model-based, model-free off-policy, and model-free on-policy algorithms, are proposed. The latter two rely on the expert’s demonstration data or the online observed data, requiring no prior knowledge of the system dynamics and value function. The stability, convergence, and existence conditions of multiple solutions are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

Unlike traditional distance-based methods, which rely on intricate distance measurements, our approach simplifies constraints using bearing information, reducing hardware and sensing requirements. It also eliminates the need to update control commands for each AAV, as formation reconfiguration can be achieved solely by adjusting the motion trajectory of formation leaders. Moreover, the strategy demonstrates enhanced robustness in addressing real-world input constraints. A continuous hyperbolic tangent saturation function and an input saturation compensation system are incorporated, ensuring system convergence and precision while addressing singularity issues. In addition, unlike conventional bearing-based strategies focusing primarily on convergence time, the proposed algorithm enables preset control over both convergence time and precision. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through several illustrative examples, including a 6-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) quadrotor AAV swarm, highlighting its practical applicability and performance.},

  abstract     = {The main objective of this study is to develop an intelligent, resilient event-triggered control method for fractional-order multiagent networked systems (FOMANSs) using reinforcement learning (RL) to address challenges resulting from unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, the challenge of unknown system dynamics within their environment must be addressed to achieve desired system stability in the face of unknown dynamics or to optimize consensus in FOMANSs. To address this problem, an adaptive learning law is implemented to handle unknown nonlinear dynamics, parameterized by a neural network, which establishes weights for a fuzzy logic system utilized in cooperative tracking protocols. A novel distributed control policy facilitates signal sharing through RL among agents, reducing error variables through learning. Moreover, this study combines an RL algorithm with the sliding mode control strategy to optimize the parameterization of the distributed control protocol, thereby eliminating its constraints on initial conditions. Second, realizing that DoS attacks typically make the actuator signal inaccessible for distributed control protocols, an innovative intelligent dual-event-triggered control strategy is formulated to reduce the effects of DoS attacks. By coordinating nested event triggers across various channels, the distributed control input is protected from incorrect signals from DoS attacks, thus ensuring its resilience. To address this problem, an intelligent security dual-event-triggered control protocol guarantees Mittag–Leffler stability of the closed-loop system and ensures effective sliding motion conditions. This distributed control protocol ensures robust tracking of control tasks and mitigates “Zeno behavior” during event triggering. The proposed control strategy is validated using a single-link flexible-joint robotic manipulator system.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a noncooperative game of multiagent systems in incomplete information scenarios. To cooperatively seek the Nash equilibrium (NE), each agent aims to minimize its own cost function by interacting with its neighbors over undirected communication networks. While existing distributed NE seeking methods alleviate the computational burden, they also entail higher communication costs. To reduce communication frequency and bandwidth, we propose a class of distributed edge-based NE seeking methods by leveraging the advantages of event-triggered mechanisms and quantization techniques. In the proposed framework, a buffer is equipped on every communication channel, thereby reducing the workload of both agents at either end. It is shown that the convergence error can be made arbitrarily small by tuning a constant threshold, and it can asymptotically converge to zero by setting an exponentially decaying threshold or a dynamic threshold. Moreover, in the case of unawareness of any global information, we further provide a fully distributed event-triggered quantized algorithm, by which the convergence error is ultimately uniformly bounded. Finally, two numerical examples are utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Motivated by the ability of projective synchronization (PS) to adjust the chaotic system trajectory, this research aims to use PS to reduce the chaos in PMSG system. For better control in the time estimation of PS and the robustness of systems, an adaptive predefined-time robust zeroing neural dynamic controller (APTRZNDC) for the PS between PMSG systems is proposed. In the process, an adaptive parameter determined by the system error is designed with the demand for higher convergence factor in the case of large error. In addition, a nonlinear activation function contributed to the predefined-time synchronization is created, making the upper bound of synchronization time independent of system initial states and parameters, except for a single predefined parameter. Moreover, essential theorems for the predefined-time PS and robustness under the APTRZNDC are supplied and validated. And better robustness of PMSG system with the APTRZNDC is demonstrated when compared with other controllers. Furthermore, the APTRZNDC is applied in secure communication via the PS of PMSG systems, which guarantees both the timeliness of signals and the immunity of communication.},

Based on the behavioral systems theory, the proposed data-driven control framework does not require knowledge of the causality of the latent variables.

In this study, the sample weight information is first introduced into neighborhood rough sets, and a novel weighted neighborhood rough set model is consequently constructed. Then, considering the lack of sample weight information in practical data, a margin-based weight optimization function is designed, based on which a gradient descent algorithm is provided to adaptively learn sample weights through maximizing sample margins. Finally, an average granule margin measure is put forward for feature selection, and a forward-adding heuristic algorithm is developed to generate an optimal feature subset. The proposed method constructs the weighted neighborhood rough sets using sample weights for the first time and is able to yield compact feature subsets with a large margin.

Therefore, estimator MAS aims to estimate experts’ desired formation and learner MAS wants to track the estimators’ trajectories optimally. As a final step, data-driven implementations of these proposed IRL algorithms are presented. Consequently, this research contributes to identifying unknown reward functions and optimal controls by conducting demonstrations. Our analysis shows that the stability and convergence of MASs are thoroughly ensured. The effectiveness of the given algorithms is demonstrated via simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This article simultaneously addresses the dual-rate and view constraints issues for the image-based visual servoing (IBVS) system of robot manipulators. Considering the low sampling bandwidth of the camera, potentially diminishing the efficiency of the robotic controller in updating low-level servoing control commands, a predictive observer (PO) is initially designed to forecast the system output during the high-level sampling intervals. Moreover, by leveraging a mixture of soft-sensing and real-measured signals, a dual-rate integral-based prescribed performance control (DRIPPC) approach is devised. The benefit lies in that the proposed control method samples the low-frequency state signal while generating a relatively high-frequency control action, ensuring rapid response of the robot manipulator while maintaining strict adherence to field-of-view (FOV) constraints. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control approach is validated through a series of experiments conducted on a Universal Robots 5 (UR5) manipulator.},

Different from the existing works on NE seeking in noncooperative games, it is the first trial to consider the resilient distributed NE control problem for nonlinear MASs under DoS attacks. To overcome the challenges caused by the considered problem, a new layered NE control method is developed, which consists of a resilient distributed NE seeking algorithm, two-stage cascade filters, and a resilient adaptive controller. Specifically, the resilient distributed NE seeking algorithm is proposed to ensure that the actions in this algorithm converge to the NE even under DoS attacks. Then, the improved actions with smooth characteristics are designed by introducing novel two-stage cascade filters. By using newly designed actions and their derivatives, a resilient adaptive controller is proposed to ensure that the output of MASs converges to the NE.

Unlike the previous researches that address (or avoid) the problem of limited network resources by designing different scheduling protocols, this study focuses on further reducing and optimizing the bandwidth utilization by introducing a bit rate constraint model. Thus, an encoding-decoding mechanism under the constrained bit rates is proposed based on the quantization method. In order to analyze the H∞ performance of the LRP and design an appropriate controller, the LRP is transformed into a shift-varying two-dimensional (2-D) Fornasini-Marchesini model. Sufficient conditions in recursive linear matrix inequalities are proposed to ensure that the extended system achieves a bounded H∞ performance over a finite horizon within the 2-D framework. Furthermore, a component-based strategy for allocating the bit rates is provided to expand the quantization region under the constraint of bit rates.

  abstract     = {This article presents a distributed pinning control strategy aimed at achieving global stabilization of Markovian jump Boolean control networks. The strategy relies on network matrix information to choose controlled nodes and adopts the algebraic state space representation approach for designing pinning controllers. Initially, a sufficient criterion is established to verify the global stability of a given Markovian jump Boolean network (MJBN) with probability one at a specific state within finite time. To stabilize an unstable MJBN at a predetermined state, the selection of pinned nodes involves removing the minimal number of entries, ensuring that the network matrix transforms into a strictly lower (or upper) triangular form. For each pinned node, two types of state feedback controllers are developed: 1) mode-dependent and 2) mode-independent, with a focus on designing a minimally updating controller. The choice of controller type is determined by the feasibility condition of the mode-dependent pinning controller, which is articulated through the solvability of matrix equations. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by studying the T cell large granular lymphocyte survival signaling network consisting of 54 genes and 6 stimuli.},

  abstract     = {Safety guarantee is an important topic when training real-world tasks with reinforcement learning (RL). During online environmental exploration, any constraint violation can lead to significant property damage and risks to personnel. Existing safe RL methods either exclusively address safety concerns after reaching optimality or incorporate a certain degree of tolerance for constraint violations during training. This article proposes a feasible policy iteration framework that can guarantee absolute safety during online exploration, i.e., constraint violations never happen in real-world interactions. The key to maintaining absolute safety lies in confining the environmental exploration at each step always within the feasible region of the current policy. This feasible region is described by a newly defined constraint decay function with uncertainty, ensuring the forward invariance of the feasible region under the worst case. Within the proposed framework, the feasible region maintains its monotonic expanding property and converges to its maximum extent, even though only local samples are available, i.e., the agent only has access to samples within the feasible region. Meanwhile, the trained policy also improves monotonically within its corresponding feasible region if one can use different updating rules inside and outside the feasible region. Finally, practical algorithms are designed with the actor–critic-scenery architecture, consisting of three modules: 1) safe exploration; 2) model error estimation; and 3) network update. Experimental results indicate that our algorithms achieve performance comparable to baselines while maintaining zero constraint violation throughout the entire training process. In contrast, the baseline algorithm typically requires thousands of constraint violations to achieve the same performance. These findings suggest a substantial potential for applying feasible policy iteration in real-world tasks, enabling the online evolution of intricate systems.},

  abstract     = {Visual understanding of 3-D objects is essential for robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality. However, existing methods struggle to perform this task efficiently and accurately in an end-to-end manner. We propose a single-shot method based on the state space model (SSM) to predict the full 3-D information (pose, size, shape) of multiple 3-D objects from a single RGB-D image in an end-to-end manner. Our method first encodes long-range semantic information from RGB and depth images separately and then combines them into an integrated latent representation that is processed by a modified SSM to infer the full 3-D information in two separate task heads within a unified model. A heatmap/detection head predicts object centers, and a 3-D information head predicts a matrix detailing the pose, size and latent code of shape for each detected object. We also propose a shape autoencoder based on the SSM, which learns canonical shape codes derived from a large database of 3-D point cloud shapes. The end-to-end framework, modified SSM block and SSM-based shape autoencoder form major contributions of this work. Our design includes different scan strategies tailored to different input data representations, such as RGB-D images and point clouds. Extensive evaluations on the REAL275, CAMERA25, and Wild6D datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the large-scale Wild6D dataset, our model significantly outperforms the nearest competitor, achieving 2.6% and 5.1% improvements on the IOU-50 and 5∘10 cm metrics, respectively.},

LSCMOPs pose great challenges to algorithms due to the need to optimize multiple conflicting objectives and satisfy multiple constraints in a large search space. To better address such problems, this article proposes a dynamic subspace search-based evolutionary algorithm for solving LSCMOPs. The main idea is to initially allow the population to search in a low-dimensional subspace to increase convergence, then the searched subspace is gradually expanded to encourage the population to further search the full decision space. Specifically, the contribution of each decision variable to the evolution is first calculated using the proposed decision variable analysis method. Then, a probability-based offspring generation strategy is developed to encourage the population to preferentially search in a low-dimensional subspace composed of decision variables with high contribution degrees, thus speeding up the early convergence. With the continuous progress of evolution, the subspace is gradually expanded to ensure that the population can better explore the entire space. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a variety of test problems with 100–1000 decision variables. Experimental results on four test suits and three real-world instances show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in solving LSCMOPs.},

Furthermore, such methods, often are not suitable for performing feature selection due to their high complexity, especially when the dimensionality of the data is high. To address the above issues, a novel method, termed as unsupervised feature selection for high-order embedding learning and sparse learning (UFSHS), is proposed to select useful features. More concretely, UFSHS first takes advantage of the high-order similarity of the original input to construct an optimal similarity graph that accurately reveals the essential geometric structure of high-dimensional data. Furthermore, it constructs a unified framework, integrating high-order embedding learning and sparse learning, to learn an appropriate projection matrix with row sparsity, which helps to select an optimal subset of features. Moreover, we design a novel alternative optimization method that provides different optimization strategies according to the relationship between the number of instances and the dimensionality, respectively, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the model. Even more amazingly, the proposed optimization strategy is shown to be applicable to ridge regression, broad learning systems and fuzzy systems. Extensive experiments are conducted on nine public datasets to illustrate the superiority and efficiency of our UFSHS.},

By combining the internal model principle and the time-and event-triggered sampling mechanism for DoS detection, an improved dynamic compensator is first proposed and converts the safety tracking problem into the attractivity problem of the constrained error system. Then a security control is constructed for the error system by integrating the safety-critical controller in the barrier function-based framework. Finally, we prove that the integrated control design can guarantee the security, safety, and stability of the closed-loop system.},

  abstract     = {Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is emerging as a pivotal technique in graph representation learning. However, recent research indicates that GCL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while existing robust GCL methods against adversarial attacks are inefficient and lack scalability due to the significant computational expenses of explicit adversarial attacks on the graph structure. To address the shortcomings of existing approaches, we propose an efficient and robust GCL via multiadversarial views training framework, called ERMAV. Specifically, the ERMAV generates two adversarial views by attacking both node attributes and latent representations on randomly sampled subgraphs. The method conducts explicit adversarial attacks on node attributes by attacking node attributes and implicit adversarial attacks on the graph structure by attacking latent representations, which avoids the costly computation of explicit graph structure attacks. Moreover, two efficient attack methods are developed to construct adversarial perturbations, which can dynamically generate different adversarial views to enhance sample diversity in the training phase. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, extensive experiments of node classification on seven real-world datasets are conducted. Experimental results show that our ERMAV outperforms state-of-the-art GCL methods on the original graphs and is consistently more robust than existing robust GCL methods on a variety of attacked graphs. This demonstrates the strong robustness and great potential of our ERMAV in real-world applications.},

Existing test problems, which are often manually configured and lack scalability, can result in biased and nongeneralizable algorithm performance. In light of the above, we first introduce four concepts for characterizing STO problems (STOPs) in this study and present an important feature, namely similarity distribution, to quantitatively delineate the relationship between the optimal solutions of source and target tasks. Subsequently, we present general design guidelines for STOPs and introduce a problem generator that demonstrates strong scalability. Specifically, the similarity distribution of a problem can be easily customized through a novel inverse generation strategy, allowing for a continuous spectrum that captures the diverse similarity relationships present in real-world scenarios. Lastly, a benchmark suite comprising 12 STOPs, characterized by a range of customized similarity relationships, has been developed using the proposed generator and will serve as a platform for examining various STO algorithms. For instance, biased transferability representation, irregular mapping learning behaviors, and performance improvements unrelated to search experience are significant empirical findings that previous benchmarks failed to reveal, yet can be effectively identified through our test problems.

This article focuses on general linear dynamics and aims to solve the prescribed-time bipartite synchronization (PT-BS) problem over cooperative-antagonistic networks. First, a couple of time-varying Riccati equations (TVREs) is introduced, which transforms the prescribed-time synchronization problem into a dynamic parameter design issue. By using the solutions of TVREs to design output feedback gains, a class of time-varying-gain prescribed-time observers and observer-based protocols are proposed. Then, since the proposed PT-BS observers require knowledge of some global information (i.e., the minimum eigenvalue of the topology-relevant Laplacian matrix), two adaptive strategies are presented to solve the output-feedback PT-BS problems in a fully distributed manner: an edge-based adaptive strategy and a node-based adaptive strategy. It successfully achieves state synchronization, observer estimation, and adaptive gain convergence within the prescribed settling time. Finally, a simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

Zadeh previously asserted that a Z-number can be regarded as a summary of probability distributions. Researchers have proposed various methods for determining the underlying probability distributions from a given Z-number. Conversely, can a Z-number be used to summarize a set of probability distributions? This problem remains unexplored. In this article, we propose a nonlinear model, termed Maximum Expected Minimum Entropy (MEME), for generating a Z-number from a set of probability distributions. Through this model, Z-numbers can be generated directly from data without requiring expert knowledge. Additionally, we applied the MEME model to classification problems, introducing a novel if–then rule form, termed Z-valuation if–then rules. These rules replace the deterministic consequent part of a fuzzy rule with an uncertain Z-valuation, thereby further summarizing the uncertain information in the rule’s consequent. Based on the Z-valuation rules, we propose a Z-valuation rule-based (ZVRB) classification system, which aims to enhance decision-making processes in scenarios where uncertainty plays a key role. To validate the effectiveness of the ZVRB classification system, we conducted two experiments comparing it with both classic and advanced nonfuzzy classifiers as well as fuzzy classification systems. The results show that the ZVRB model is superior to the other comparative classifiers in terms of classification performance.},

To tackle these issues, a mechanism for generating smooth, safe reference signals is first devised. Additionally, we propose a novel approach that utilizes improved prescribed performance functions to confine tracking errors within predetermined constant bounds in finite time, while avoiding potential singularity issues arising from abrupt changes in the reference signal. Furthermore, a decentralized adaptive learning error-constrained control strategy is proposed, employing neural networks to approximate complex uncertainties with an asymptotic dynamic surface control method. Stability analysis confirms that the proposed control scheme guarantees the asymptotic stability of the system and ensures safe tracking within conflicted irregular output constraints, even in the presence of input saturation.

  abstract     = {Rhythm is an inherent aspect of human behavior, present from infancy and embedded in cultural practices. At the core of rhythm perception lies meter anticipation, a spontaneous process in the human brain that typically occurs before actual beats. This anticipation can be framed as a time series prediction problem. From the perspective of human embodied system behavior, although many models have been developed for time series prediction, most prioritize accuracy over biological realism, contrasting with the natural imprecision of human internal clocks. Neuroscientific evidence, such as infants’ natural meter synchronization, underscores the need for biologically plausible models. Therefore, we propose a neuron oscillator-based dynamic system that simulates human behavior during meter perception. The model introduces two tunable parameters for local and global adjustments, fine-tuning the oscillation combinations to emulate human-like rhythmic behavior. The experiments are conducted under three common scenarios encountered during human-machine interaction, demonstrating that the proposed model can exhibit human-like reactions. Additionally, experiments involving human-machine and interhuman interactions show that the model successfully replicates real-world rhythmic behavior, advancing toward more natural and synchronized human-machine rhythm interaction.},

This innovative soft exosuit integrates control barrier functions into the impedance optimization, allowing multiple safety constraints to be considered simultaneously, enabling the system to adaptively learn the impedance of the human ankle joint by analyzing the measured interaction forces at the ankle joint, so that the updated reference trajectories comply with safety requirements. To effectively track the updated reference trajectories, we have introduced an adaptive neural controller based on the integral barrier Lyapunov function. This controller is designed to perform the control task under strict safety constraints. The stability of this control approach is meticulously demonstrated through extensive Lyapunov analysis. In contrast to traditional soft exosuits designed purely for assistance, the key advantage of this technology is its ability to adapt to different terrains while ensuring the safety of human movement during assistance.

Therefore, this study proposed a dynamic hierarchical convolutional attention network (DH-CAN) that comprehensively learned discriminative information from both global and local spatial domains, as well as from time-frequency domains in EEG signals. Specifically, a multiscale convolutional block was designed to dynamically capture time-frequency information. The channels of EEG signals were mapped to different brain regions based on motor imagery neural activity patterns. The spatial features, both global and local, were then hierarchically extracted to fully exploit the discriminative information. Furthermore, regional connectivity was established using a graph attention network, incorporating it into the local spatial features. Particularly, this study shared network parameters between symmetrical brain regions to better capture asymmetrical motor imagery patterns. Finally, the learned multilevel features were integrated through a high-level fusion layer. Extensive experimental results on two datasets demonstrated that the proposed model performed excellently across multiple evaluation metrics, exceeding existing benchmark methods.

In this article, we propose contrastive dynamic skill discovery (ComSD) which generates diverse and exploratory unsupervised skills through a novel intrinsic incentive, named contrastive dynamic reward. It contains a particle-based exploration reward to make agents access far-reaching states for exploratory skill acquisition, and a novel contrastive diversity reward to promote the discriminability between different skills. Moreover, a novel dynamic weighting mechanism between the above two rewards is proposed to balance state exploration and skill diversity, which further enhances the quality of the discovered skills. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that ComSD can generate diverse behaviors at different exploratory levels for multijoint robots, enabling state-of-the-art adaptation performance on challenging downstream tasks.

  abstract     = {The underlying time-variant and subject-specific brain dynamics lead to inconsistent distributions in electroencephalogram (EEG) topology and representations within and between individuals. However, current works primarily align the distributions of EEG representations, overlooking the topology variability in capturing the dependencies between channels, which may limit the performance of EEG emotion recognition. To tackle this issue, this article proposes an adaptive attention-modulated graph network (AdamGraph) to enhance the subject adaptability of EEG emotion recognition against connection variability and representation variability. Specifically, an attention-modulated graph connection module is proposed to explicitly capture the individual important relationships among channels adaptively. Through modulating the attention matrix of individual functional connections using spatial connections based on prior knowledge, the attention-modulated weights can be learned to construct individual connections adaptively, thereby mitigating individual differences. Besides, a deep node-graph representation learning module is designed to extract long-range interaction characteristics among channels and alleviate the over-smoothing problem of representations. Furthermore, a graph domain co-regularized learning module is imposed to tackle the individual distribution discrepancies in connection and representations across different domains. Extensive experiments on three public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., SEED, DREAMER, and MPED, validate the superior performance of AdamGraph compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the issue of adaptive event-triggered and quantized control for a category of uncertain nonlinear systems, utilizing a prescribed-time (PT) control framework. We begin by introducing a dynamic event-triggering mechanism and a dynamic event-driven quantizer to develop a discrete control framework, without assuming the constraint of input-to-state stability (ISS). The aperiodic discrete control method can effectively improve the data transmission efficiency of the networked control system. Then, according to the adaptive parameter estimation, a novel PT event-triggered adaptive controller and a PT sampled and quantized adaptive controller are proposed. Compared with the backstepping control method, the designed “one-step-controller” decreases the computational loads of the virtual controllers. Moreover, the global PT stability of the nonlinear system is assured, and the Zeno phenomenon of the event-triggered sampling does not happen. Finally, the practicability and availability of the designed control method are validated via a numerical system and a manipulator system.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the cooperative output regulation problem for discrete-time multiagent systems with unknown parameters, a challenge that arises in many practical applications where system models are unavailable. Unlike existing techniques, a model-free Q-learning algorithm is devised to iteratively obtain the optimal policy. This algorithm operates independently of system parameters, and its immediate cost formulation excludes the necessity of solving regulator equations. Consequently, it achieves a streamlined structure, facilitating direct determination of the optimal policy. Subsequently, the stability of each iteration of the algorithm is formally established, along with the derivation of a unique condition for the Q-function matrix. Additionally, to address the challenge of obtaining a stable policy when the initial policy is unstable, an innovative data-driven algorithm is introduced that effectively computes the initial stable gains, ensuring convergence to stability throughout the learning process. Meanwhile, we focus on demonstrating that the distributed observer and the excitation noise do not introduce bias. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated through two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the variable convergence rate stability problem for nonlinear impulsive stochastic systems (NISSs). To solve the issue, a novel methodology of sliding mode surface design is presented by combining the definition of interval stability with the T–S fuzzy technique. A pioneering class of sliding mode controllers is constructed in accordance with the characteristics of the designed sliding mode surfaces and the sigmoid function. These controllers can intelligently adjust the convergence rate of the system according to practical requirements, thereby addressing the limitation of fixed convergence rate in existing results. Moreover, the proposed controllers can effectively suppress jitter and analyze the effects of different sigmoid functions on jitter suppression. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the states of the NISSs reach the designed surfaces in finite time and to achieve variable convergence rate stability. The excellent performance of the proposed theoretical strategy in achieving adjustable rate convergence of the system is demonstrated through a simulation of the ball-beam system.},
