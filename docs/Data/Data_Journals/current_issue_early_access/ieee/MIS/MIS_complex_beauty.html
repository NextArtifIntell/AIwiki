  abstract     = {The natural environment presents a multitude of scenes with diverse content, posing challenges for satisfactory segmentation results using existing segmentation networks. In response, we propose a Cascaded Resolution Learning Network (CRLNet) to enhance segmentation performance through global textual embedding and multi-resolution feature learning. The CRLNet constructs a multi-path segmentation system that integrates multi-resolution feature data from different paths, thereby progressively enhancing local feature learning. Two key modules, the Partition-Fusion Channel Attention Module (PFCAM) and the Features Learning Module (FLM), are pivotal components of CRLNet. The PFCAM serves as a computationally efficient channel attention module to mitigate segmentation confusion stemming from similar objects. Meanwhile, the FLM is tailored to learn resolution feature maps from different paths, facilitating the refinement of object representation and enhancing segmentation performance. Extensive experiments conducted on real natural scene datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CRLNet over existing efficient segmentation methods in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Today, data-driven models and artificial intelligence / machine learning underlie decision making in almost all aspects of society. However, significant concerns have been raised over the fairness of such models. While various aspects of algorithmic fairness have been studied, the effect of missing data on fairness remains understudied. This is a significant problem since data in real-world settings is almost never complete, and may often suffer from systemic missingness. This article systematically evaluates how missing data, particularly when correlated with protected classes and outcome variables, affects the fairness of classifiers. Utilizing a comprehensive framework covering various missing data patterns, rates, and mitigation methods, we analyze 150 experimental dataset variants derived from real-world scenarios, and find that missing data correlated with sensitive attributes and outcomes can exacerbate disparities, even for little missingness, making it crucial to address missingness in fairness evaluations.},

Ensuring secure communication channels for UAS is crucial to protecting sensitive information and maintaining operational integrity. Eavesdropping attacks pose a significant threat to data confidentiality and system security in these applications. To address these challenges, we propose an environment in Python that emulates eavesdropping attacks on UAS. Subsequently, we introduce UASDefMeta, a meta-learning-based approach that combines Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning and Proximal Policy Optimization for detecting these attacks. Experiments validate UASDefMeta’s effectiveness, demonstrating its adaptability and improved performance over other selected models.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning techniques achieve promising performance on the circuit annotation task for the hardware assurance of integrated circuits, but are reliant on large amounts of costly, labeled training data. Recently, image synthesis techniques have been explored to mitigate this reliance. However, exiting methods often lack precise pixel-level correspondence between the input image and synthetic image. When applied to IC images, this could lead to inconsistencies in the circuit structures, which then cause changes in circuit connectivity. In this paper, we propose shape consistent image translation (SCIT) to synthesize IC images that have a high pixel-level correspondence with the input images. Our experiments show that a segmentation model trained SCIT-generated images reduces the number of circuit connection errors by 56.26% compared to the second best reported technique. Our proposed SCIT also produced synthetic IC images of the highest image quality when evaluated across three IC image datasets.},

  abstract     = {Lung nodules are critical indicators of pulmonary lesions closely associated with lung cancer progression. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is widely employed to identify lung nodules. However, the large volume of imaging data it produces creates significant processing challenges for healthcare professionals, leading to diagnostic delays, uncertainty, and increased labor costs. To address these challenges, we propose a federated online learning framework that enables collaboration among multiple hospitals while complying with regulations. Our system includes three filters for lung nodule segmentation: a relabeling data balance filter, a two-stage network filter for segmentation and false positive reduction, and an interactive labeling correction filter. The system improves model robustness and mitigates biases during collaborative training. Tested in three hospitals, our framework preserved data privacy and achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%, outperforming models trained on local data.},
