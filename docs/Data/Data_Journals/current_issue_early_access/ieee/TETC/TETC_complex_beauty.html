  abstract     = {When arranged in a crossbar configuration, resistive memory devices can be used to execute Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs), the most dominant operation of many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, in constant time complexity. Nonetheless, when performing computations in the analog domain, novel challenges are introduced in terms of arithmetic precision and stochasticity, due to non-ideal circuit and device behaviour. Moreover, these non-idealities have a temporal dimension, resulting in a degrading application accuracy over time. Facing these challenges, we propose a novel framework, named LionHeart, to obtain hybrid analog-digital mappings to execute Deep Learning (DL) inference workloads using heterogeneous accelerators. The accuracy-constrained mappings derived by LionHeart showcase, across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and one transformer-based network, high accuracy and potential for speedup. The results of the full system simulations highlight runtime reductions and energy efficiency gains that exceed 6×, with a user-defined accuracy threshold for a fully digital floating point implementation.},

  abstract     = {Biocomputing envisions the development computing paradigms using biological systems, ranging from micron-level components to collections of cells, including organoids. This paradigm shift exploits hidden natural computing properties, to develop miniaturized wet-computing devices that can be deployed in harsh environments, and to explore designs of novel energy-efficient systems. In parallel, we witness the emergence of AI hardware, including neuromorphic processors with the aim of improving computational capacity. This study brings together the concept of biocomputing and neuromorphic systems by focusing on the bacterial gene regulatory networks and their transformation into Gene Regulatory Neural Networks (GRNNs). We explore the intrinsic properties of gene regulations, map this to a gene-perceptron function, and propose an application-specific sub-GRNN search algorithm that maps the network structure to match a computing problem. Focusing on the model organism Escherichia coli, the base-GRNN is initially extracted and validated for accuracy. Subsequently, a comprehensive feasibility analysis of the derived GRNN confirms its computational prowess in classification and regression tasks. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of performing a well-known digit classification task as a use case. Our analysis and simulation experiments show promising results in the offloading of computation tasks to GRNN in bacterial cells, advancing wet-neuromorphic computing using natural cells.},

A uniform robust exact differentiator (URED) is developed to construct a multi-layer virtual control framework of the robotic manipulator system. Under the control framework, adaptive ELM-based control strategies are proposed to suppress the influence of the uncertainties and disturbances layer-by-layer, combining with the minimum learning parameter (MLP) technique which is employed to reduce the calculation complexity of ELM parameters. The significance of this study is that general model/input uncertainties, matched and mismatched disturbances can be effectively compensated within a limited time, so that bounded trajectory tracking of the robotic manipulator can be achieved avoiding the complexity explosion issue. The time-constrained stability of the closed-loop robotic error systems is proved through Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations are employed to display the feasibility and superiority of the designed robust adaptive ELM-based control schemes of a robotic manipulator system.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of Aging-Related Bugs (ARBs) poses a significant challenge to software systems, resulting in performance degradation and increased error rates in resourceintensive systems. Consequently, numerous ARB prediction methods have been developed to mitigate these issues. However, in scenarios where training data is limited, the effectiveness of ARB prediction is often suboptimal. To address this problem, CrossProject Aging-Related Bug Prediction (CPARBP) is proposed, which utilizes data from other projects (i.e., source projects) to train a model aimed at predicting potential ARBs in a target project. However, the use of source-project data raises privacy concerns and discourages companies from sharing their data. Therefore, we propose a method called Cross-Project AgingRelated Bug Prediction based on Negative Database (NegCPARBP) for privacy protection. NegCPARBP first converts the feature vector of a software file into a binary string. Secondly, the corresponding Negative DataBase (NDB) is generated based on this binary string, containing data that is significantly more expressive from the original feature vector. Furthermore, to ensure more accurate prediction of ARB-prone and ARB-free files based on privacy-protected data (i.e., maintain the data utility), we propose a novel negative database generation algorithm that captures more information about important features, using information gain as a measure. Finally, NegCPARBP extracts a new feature vector from the NDB to represent the original feature vector, facilitating data sharing and ARB prediction objectives. Experimental results on Linux, MySQL, and NetBSD datasets demonstrate that NegCPARBP achieves a high defense against attacks (privacy protection performance reaching 0.97) and better data utility compared to existing privacy protection methods.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to tackle the challenge of rapid target circumnavigation by unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) under boundary and obstacle constraints through leveraging an emerging computing architecture specifically tailored for unmanned systems. Owing to the underactuation of USV dynamic systems and the presence of various time-varying surface disturbances, attaining rapid and accurate position control along with maneuverability poses a significant challenge to USVs. Therefore, when an USV maneuvers around a target in a confined search area with obstacles, it is essential for the guidance law to consider collision risks and environmental disturbances. This paper proposes a modified Lyapunov vector field with heading deviation compensation to circle the target in complex search regions. The vector field is designed to increase the radial velocity of the USV and accelerate convergence towards the target circle during the pursuit phase. By combining the proposed Lyapunov vector field with a boundary vector field, the USV can swiftly avoid boundaries and dynamic obstacles and then continue circling the target. The proposed computing architecture extends the application scope of the target circumnavigation to practical water surface environments, which is validated by extensive simulations and rigorous experiments.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computers have the potential to solve a number of hard problems that are believed to be almost impossible to solve by classical computers. This observation has sparked a surge of research to apply quantum algorithms against the cryptographic systems to evaluate its quantum resistance. In assessing the security strength of the cryptographic algorithms against the upcoming quantum threats, it is crucial to precisely estimate the quantum resource requirement (generally in terms of circuit depth and quantum bit count). The National Institute of Standards and Technology by the US government specified five quantum security levels so that the relative quantum strength of a given cipher can be compared to the standard ones. There have been some progress in the NIST-specified quantum security levels for the odd levels (i.e., 1, 3 and 5), following the work of Jaques et al. (Eurocrypt&#39;20). However, levels 2 and 4, which correspond to the quantum collision finding attacks for the SHA-2 and SHA-3 hash functions, quantum attack complexities are arguably not well-studied. This is where our article fits in. In this article, we present novel techniques for optimizing the quantum circuit implementations for SHA-2 and SHA-3 algorithms in all the categories specified by NIST. After that, we evaluate the quantum circuits of target cryptographic hash functions for quantum collision search. Finally, we define the quantum attack complexity for levels 2 and 4, and comment on the security strength of the extended level. We present new concepts to optimize the quantum circuits at the component level and the architecture level.},

FLCL conducts contrastive learning at the feature level and leverages the subtle relationships between positive and negative samples to achieve more effective classification. Additionally, we address the challenges of requiring a large number of negative samples and the difficulty of selecting high-quality negative samples in traditional contrastive learning methods. For feature learning, we design a Feature Enhancement Coding (FEC) module to analyze the interactions and correlations between nonlinear features, enhancing the quality of feature representations. In the metric stage, we propose a centered hypersphere projection metric to map feature vectors onto the hypersphere, improving the comparison between the support and query sets. Experimental results on four few-shot classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method, while simple in design, outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. A detailed ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of each component of our model.},

We present the evaluation results obtained from measurement and modeling implementations. The measurement infrastructure was composed of 15 large and 15 extra-large VMs. The modeling approach used Markov Decision Processes (MDP). On the measurement testbed, we implemented three different levels of software rejuvenation granularity to achieve software resiliency. We have discovered two threats to resiliency in this environment. The first threat to resiliency was a memory leak that was part of the underlying open-source infrastructure in each VM. The second threat to resiliency was the result of the contention for resources in the physical host, which is dependent on the number and size of VMs deployed to the physical host. In the MDP modeling approach, we evaluated four strategies for assigning tasks to VMs with different configurations and different levels of parallelism. Using the large cluster under study, we compared our approach of using software aging and rejuvenation with the state-of-the-art approach of using a network of VMs deployed to a private cloud without software aging detection and rejuvenation. In summary, we show that in a private cloud with non-elastic resource allocation in the physical hosts, careful performance engineering needs to be performed to optimize the trade-offs between the number of VMs allocated and the total memory allocated to each VM.},

  abstract     = {Traditional task assignment approaches in crowdsourcing platforms have focused on optimizing utility for workers or tasks, often neglecting the general utility of the platform and the influence of mutual preference considering skill availability and budget restrictions. This oversight can destabilize task allocation outcomes, diminishing user experience, and, ultimately, the platform&#39;s long-term utility and gives rise to the Worker Task Stable Matching (WTSM) problem. To solve WTSM, we propose the Skill-oriented Stable Task Assignment with a Bi-directional Preference (SoSTA) method based on deferred acceptance strategy. SoSTA aims to generate stable allocations between tasks and workers considering mutually their preferences, optimizing overall utility while following skill and budget constraints. Our study redefines the general utility of the platform as an amalgamation of utilities on both the workers&#39; and tasks&#39; sides, incorporating the preference lists of each worker or task based on their respective utility scores for the other party. SoSTA incorporates Multi Skill-oriented Stable Worker Task Mapping (Multi-SoS-WTM) algorithm for contributions with multiple skills per worker. SoSTA is rational, non-wasteful, fair, and hence stable. SoSTA outperformed other approaches in the simulations of the MeetUp dataset. SoSTA improves execution speed by 80%, task completion rate by 60%, and user happiness by 8%.},

However, existing anti-counterfeiting and authentication technologies for porcelain are often unreliable and costly. This paper proposes a physical unclonable functions (PUF) design based on crack physical feature extraction for the anti-counterfeiting and authentication of Gold-Wire porcelain. The proposed method generates PUF information by extracting inherent physical deviations in the surface cracks of Gold-Wire porcelain. First, a standard crack extraction process is established using digital image processing to obtain crack information from the porcelain surface. Then, a physical feature extraction model based on the chain code encoding technique and the Delaunay triangulation technique is used to derive the physical feature values from the cracks. Subsequently, a PUF encoding algorithm is designed to convert these physical feature values into a PUF response. Finally, the security and reliability of the designed PUF are evaluated, and a PUF-based porcelain authentication protocol is developed. Experimental results show that the proposed PUF exhibits 50.16% uniqueness and 98.85% reliability, and the PUF data successfully passed the NIST randomness test, demonstrating that the proposed technology can effectively achieve low-cost, high-reliability anti-counterfeiting for commercial porcelain.},

However, naive implementations on embedded devices are vulnerable to side-channel attacks (SCAs) with full key recovery possible through power and electromagnetic leakage analysis. This paper presents two protection schemes, masking and shuffling, for the baseline Radix-2 multi-path delay commutator (R2MDC) number theoretic transform (NTT) architecture. The proposed masking NTT scheme introduces a random number to protect the secret key during the decryption phase and leverages the linear property of arithmetic transform in NTT polynomial multiplication. By adjusting the comparing decoding threshold, the masking method greatly reduces the ratio of $t-test$ value exceeding the threshold of unprotected NTT scheme from 77.38% to 3.91%. An ingenious shuffling transform process is also proposed to disturb the calculation sequence of butterfly transformation, adapting to the high-throughput architecture of R2MDC-NTT. This shuffling NTT scheme does not require operations to remove shuffle or additional operation cycles, reducing the leakage ratio to 13.49% with minimal extra hardware resources and wide applicability. The proposed masking and shuffling techniques effectively suppress side-channel leakage, improving the security of hardware architecture while maintaining a balance between overall performance and additional hardware resources.},
