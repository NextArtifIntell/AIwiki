  abstract     = {Smartphones are widely used as portable data collectors for wearable and healthcare sensors that can passively collect data streams related to the environment, health status, and behaviors. Recent research shows that the collected data can be used to monitor not only the physical states but also the mental health of individuals. However, extracting the features of digital phenotypes that characterize major depressive disorder (MDD) is technically challenging and may raise significant privacy concerns. Addressing such challenges has become the focus of many researchers. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of several key issues related to ubiquitous sensing to aid in detecting MDD. Specifically, this article analyzes existing methodologies and feature extraction algorithms used to detect possible MDD through digital phenotyping from smartphone data. In particular, five types of features are summarized and explained, namely, location, movement, rhythm, sleep, and social and device usage. Finally, related limitations and challenges are discussed to provide paths for further research and engineering.},

  abstract     = {Uncrewed vehicles (UVs) functioning as autonomous agents are anticipated to play a crucial role in the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks. Their seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and additional controllability through motion planning make them an attractive deployment option for a wide range of applications, both as assets in the network e.g., mobile base stations (BSs) and as consumers of network services (e.g., autonomous delivery systems). However, despite their potential, the convergence of UVs and wireless systems brings forth numerous challenges that require attention from both academia and industry. This article then aims to offer a comprehensive overview, encompassing the transformative possibilities as well as the significant challenges associated with UV-assisted next-generation wireless communications. Considering the diverse landscape of possible application scenarios, problem formulations, and mathematical tools related to UV-assisted wireless systems, the underlying core theme of this article is the unification of the problem space, providing a structured framework to understand the use cases, problem formulations, and necessary mathematical tools. Overall, this article sets forth a clear understanding of how UVs can be integrated in the 6G ecosystem, paving the way toward harnessing the full potential at this intersection.},

  abstract     = {Building the next-generation wireless systems that could support services such as the metaverse, digital twins (DTs), and holographic teleportation is challenging to achieve exclusively through incremental advances to conventional wireless technologies like metasurfaces or holographic antennas. While the 6G concept of artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks promises to overcome some of the limitations of existing wireless technologies, current developments of AI-native wireless systems rely mostly on conventional AI tools such as auto-encoders and off-the-shelf artificial neural networks. However, those tools struggle to manage and cope with the complex, nontrivial scenarios faced in real-world wireless environments and the growing quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements of the aforementioned, emerging wireless use cases. In contrast, in this article, we propose to fundamentally revisit the concept of AI-native wireless systems, equipping them with the common sense necessary to transform them into artificial general intelligence (AGI)-native systems. Our envisioned AGI-native wireless systems acquire common sense by exploiting different cognitive abilities such as reasoning and analogy. These abilities in our proposed AGI-native wireless system are mainly founded on three fundamental components: a perception module, a world model, and an action-planning component. Collectively, these three fundamental components enable the four pillars of common sense that include dealing with unforeseen scenarios through horizontal generalizability, capturing intuitive physics, performing analogical reasoning, and filling in the blanks. Toward developing these components, we start by showing how the perception module can be built through abstracting real-world elements into generalizable representations. These representations are then used to create a world model, founded on principles of causality and hyperdimensional (HD) computing. Specifically, we propose a concrete definition of a world model, viewing it as an HD causal vector space that aligns with the intuitive physics of the real world—a cornerstone of common sense. In addition,we discuss how this proposed world model can enable analogical reasoning and manipulation of the abstract representations. Then, we show how the world model can drive an action-planning feature of the AGI-native network. In particular, we propose an intent-driven and objective-driven planning method that can maneuver the AGI-native network to plan its actions. These planning methods are based on brain-inspired frameworks such as integrated information theory and hierarchical abstractions that play a crucial role in enabling human-like decision-making. Next, we explain how an AGI-native network can be further exploited to enable three use cases related to human users and autonomous agent applications: 1) analogical reasoning for the next-generation DTs; 2) synchronized and resilient experiences for cognitive avatars; and 3) brain-level metaverse experiences exemplified by holographic teleportation. Finally, we conclude with a set of recommendations to ignite the quest for AGI-native systems. Ultimately, we envision this article as a roadmap for the next generation of wireless systems beyond 6G.},

  abstract     = {Key operational and protection functions of power systems (e.g., optimal power flow scheduling and control, state estimation (SE), protection, and fault location) rely on the availability of models to represent the system’s behavior under different operating conditions. Power system models require knowledge of the components’ electrical parameters and the system topology. However, these data may be inaccurate for several reasons (e.g., inaccurate information of components datasheets and/or outdated topological information). The deployment of time synchronization in phasor measurement units (PMUs) and remote terminal units (RTUs) enables the collection of large datasets of synchronized measurements to infer power system models and learn associated power flow constraints. Within this context, this article presents a comprehensive review of measurement-based estimation methods for power flow models using time-synchronized measurements. It begins by exploring advancements in time dissemination technologies and the characterization of uncertainties in PMUs and instrument transformers (ITs), along with their implications for parameter estimation. This article then examines the power system parameter estimation problem, highlighting key techniques and methodologies. In the following, this article focuses on measurement models for state-independent power flow model estimation, including line parameters, admittance matrices, topology, and joint state-parameter estimation. Finally, this article discusses recent approaches for estimating state-dependent power flow models, with particular reference to linearized power flow approximations because of their large use in control applications.},
