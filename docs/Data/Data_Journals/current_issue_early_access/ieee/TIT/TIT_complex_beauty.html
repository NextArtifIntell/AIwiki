  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a structured signal detection problem in Ferromagnetic Ising models with examples encompassing Ising Models on lattices, and Mean-Field type Ising Models such as dense Erdős-Rényi, and dense random regular graphs. We provide sharp constants of detection in each of these cases and thereby pinpoint an asymptotically precise relationship between the detection problem with the underlying dependence. To obtain this sharp characterization of the detection boundary at the level of sharp multiplicative constants, we derive necessary moderate deviation bounds for partial summands of magnetizations which might be of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate how our tests can be designed to be adaptive over the strength of dependence present in the respective models.},

  abstract     = {Marton’s optimal error exponent for the lossy source coding problem is defined as a non-convex optimization problem. This fact had prevented us to develop an efficient algorithm to compute it. This problem is caused by the fact that the rate-distortion function R(Δ|P) is potentially non-concave in the probability distribution P for a fixed distortion level Δ. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a parametric expression that is in perfect agreement with the inverse function of the Marton exponent. This representation has two layers. The inner layer is convex optimization and can be computed efficiently. The outer layer, on the other hand, is a non-convex optimization with respect to two parameters. We give a method for computing the Marton exponent based on this representation.},

To that end, at each time point we are allowed to update a finite-state machine with S states, using a possibly randomized but time-invariant rule, where each state of the machine is assigned an entropy estimate. Our goal is to characterize the minimax memory complexity S* of this problem, which is the minimal number of states for which the estimation task is feasible with probability at least 1 − δ asymptotically, uniformly in p. Specifically, we show that there exist universal constants C1 and C2 such that S* ≤ C1 · n(log n)4/ε2δ for ε not too small, and S* ≥ C2 · max{n, log n/ε} for ε not too large. The upper bound is proved using approximate counting to estimate the logarithm of p, and a finite memory bias estimation machine to estimate the expectation operation. The lower bound is proved via a reduction of entropy estimation to uniformity testing. We also apply these results to derive bounds on the memory complexity of mutual information estimation.},

In this context, it is essential to specify conditions for these bent concatenations so that f do (not) belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class M#. In this article, we resolve this question completely by providing the algebraic characterization of M-subspaces for the concatenation of the form f = f1||f2 and f = f1||f2||f3||f4, which allows us to estimate ind(f), the linearity index of f, and consequently to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions so that f is outside M#. Based on these conditions, we propose several explicit and generic design methods of specifying bent functions outside M# in the special case when f = g||h||g||(h+1), where g and h are bent functions. Moreover, we show that it is possible to even decrease the linearity index of f = g||h||g||(h+1), compared to ind(g) and ind(h), if the largest dimension of a common M-subspace of g and h is small enough (less than minfind(g); ind(h)}–1). This also induces iterative methods of constructing bent functions outsideM# with (controllable) low linearity index. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the 2-rank of f and show that this concatenation method can generate bent functions that are provably outside M# ∪ PS#ap. In difference to the approach of Weng et al. (Finite Fields Appl. vol. 13 (4), 2007) that uses the direct sum and a bent function g outside M#, our method employs g, h ϵ M# for the same purpose.},

Under this paradigm, a DNA molecule is being labeled by specific k patterns and is then imaged. Then, the resulting image is modeled as a (k + 1)-ary sequence in which any non-zero symbol indicates on the appearance of the corresponding label in the DNA molecule. The primary goal of this work is to study the labeling capacity, which is defined as the maximal information rate that can be obtained using this labeling process. The labeling capacity is computed for almost any pattern of a single label and several results for multiple labels are provided as well. Moreover, we provide the optimal minimal number of labels of length one or two, over any alphabet of size q, that are needed in order to achieve the maximum labeling capacity of log2(q). Lastly, we discuss the maximal labeling capacity that can be achieved using a certain number of labels of length two.},

  abstract     = {In multi-source status update systems, sources need to be scheduled appropriately to maintain timely communication between each of the sources and the monitor. A cyclic schedule is an age-agnostic schedule in which the sources are served according to a fixed finite transmission pattern, which upon completion, repeats itself. Such a scheme has a low O(1) runtime complexity, which is desirable in large networks. This paper’s focus is on designing transmission patterns so as to be used in massive scale networking scenarios involving a very large number of sources, e.g., up to thousands of IoT sources, with service time requirements and weights being heterogeneous in nature. The goal is to minimize the weighted sum age of information (AoI), called weighted AoI, when transmitting users’ packets over a channel susceptible to heterogeneous packet errors. The main tool we use is a stochastic modeling framework using either Markov chains (MC) or moment generating functions (MGF), by which we obtain the weighted AoI for a given transmission pattern, which is not straightforward in the presence of packet drops. Using this framework, we provide a lower bound on the weighted AoI for the particular case of two sources, and also an algorithm to attain this lower bound. Then, by using the same framework, we design a cyclic scheduler for general number of sources with reasonable complexity using convex optimization and well-established packet spreading algorithms, and comparatively evaluate the proposed algorithm and existing age-agnostic scheduling schemes for general number of sources (resp. two sources) when the lower bound is not available (resp. when it is available). We present extensive numerical results also involving comparisons with age-aware scheduling to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In outlier hypothesis testing, one aims to detect outlying sequences among a given set of sequences, where most sequences are generated i.i.d. from a nominal distribution while outlying sequences (outliers) are generated i.i.d. from a different anomalous distribution. Most existing studies focus on discrete-valued sequences, where each data sample takes values in a finite set. To account for practical scenarios where data sequences usually take real values and the number of outlying sequence is unknown, we study outlier hypothesis testing for continuous sequences when there might exist multiple outliers, and both the nominal and anomalous distributions are unknown. Specifically, we propose distribution free tests and prove that the probabilities of misclassification error, false reject and false alarm decay exponentially fast for three different test designs: fixed-length test, sequential test, and two-phase test. In a fixed-length test, one fixes the sample size of each observed sequence; in a sequential test, one takes a sample sequentially from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision can be made; in a two-phase test, one adapts the sample size from two different fixed values. Remarkably, the two-phase test achieves a good balance between test design complexity and theoretical performance.},

  abstract     = {In the setting of error-correcting codes with feedback, Alice wishes to communicate a k-bit message x to Bob by sending a sequence of bits over a channel while noiselessly receiving feedback from Bob. It has been long known (Berlekamp, 1964) that in this model, Bob can still correctly determine x even if ≈ 1/3 of Alice’s bits are flipped adversarially. This improves upon the classical setting without feedback, where recovery is not possible for error fractions exceeding 1/4. In the corresponding setting of erasures rather than bit flips, feedback improves the error resilience from 1/2 − ε to 1 − ε for any ε &gt; 0. The original feedback setting assumes that after transmitting each bit, Alice knows (via feedback) what bit Bob received. In this work, our focus in on the limited feedback model, where Bob is only allowed to send a few bits at a small number of pre-designated points in the protocol. For any desired ε &gt; 0, we construct a coding scheme that tolerates a 1/3 − ε fraction of bit flips (respectively a 1 − ε fraction of erasures) relying only on Oε (log k) bits of feedback from Bob sent in a fixed Oε (1) number of rounds. We complement this with a matching lower bound showing that Ω(log k) bits of feedback are necessary to recover from an error fraction exceeding 1/4 (respectively 1/2 for erasures), and for schemes resilient to a 1/3−ε fraction of bit flips (respectively a 1 − ε fraction of erasures), the number of rounds must grow as ε → 0.},

However, the space complexity of the clustering problem, specifically, the number of bits required to compress the cost function within a multiplicative error ε, remains unclear in existing literature. This paper initiates the study of space complexity for Euclidean (k, z)-Clustering and offers both upper and lower bounds. Our space bounds are nearly tight when k is constant, indicating that storing a coreset, a well-known data compression approach, serves as the optimal compression scheme. Furthermore, our lower bound result for (k, z)-Clustering establishes a tight space bound of Θ(nd) for terminal embedding, where n represents the dataset size.

  abstract     = {The classical Rician Weichselberger channel and the emerging holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel share a common characteristic of non-separable correlation, which captures the interdependence between transmit and receive antennas. However, this correlation structure makes it very challenging to characterize the fundamental limits of non-centered (Rician), non-separable MIMO channels. In fact, there is a dearth of existing literature that addresses this specific aspect, underscoring the need for further research in this area. In this paper, we investigate the mutual information (MI) of non-centered non-separable MIMO channels, where both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components are considered. By utilizing random matrix theory (RMT), we set up a central limit theorem for the MI and give the closed-form expressions for its mean and variance. The derived results are then utilized to determine the ergodic MI and outage probability of holographic MIMO channels. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical results.},

Indeed, the MacWilliams distribution provides a finite analog of the classical Gauss distribution. In particular, the MacWilliams distribution over quotient space of a code is statistically close to the uniform distribution. In the context of lattices, the analogy of MacWilliams identity associated with nu-function was conjectured by Solé in 1995. We give an answer to this problem.},

The inequalities, which are simple to state, enlighten the contribution of each process individually. Additionally, we derive an exact formulation when the conditioned pointwise derivative of each process follows a Gaussian distribution. As application examples, the results are exercised in different scenarios using the α-μ and κ-μ fading models, which encompass several other well-known models such as Semi-Gaussian, Rayleigh, Rice, Nakagami-m, and Weibull. We provide unprecedented closed-form formulations for the level crossing rate bounds of the product of these widely-known fading processes. Notably, there are no closed forms for the level crossing rate of these products. Therefore, our bounds supply a benchmark for this metric, with one of them serving as an excellent approximation of the exact metric.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by modern applications such as computerized adaptive testing, sequential rank aggregation, and heterogeneous data source selection, we study the problem of active sequential estimation. The goal is to design an adaptive experiment selection rule and an estimator for more accurate parameter estimation. Greedy information-based experiment selection rules, which optimize information gain one step ahead, have been employed in practice thanks to their computational convenience, flexibility to context or task changes, and broad applicability. However, the optimality of greedy methods under a sequential decision theory framework is only established in the one-dimensional case, partly due to the problem’s combinatorial nature and the seemingly limited capacity of greedy algorithms. In this study, we close the gap for multidimensional problems. We cast the problem under a sequential decision theory framework with generalized risk measures for a large class of design-and-estimation methods. We propose adopting the maximum likelihood estimator with a class of greedy experiment selection rules. This class encompasses both existing methods and introduces new methods with improved numerical efficiency. We prove that these methods achieve asymptotic optimality when the risk measure aligns with the selection rule. Additionally, we establish that the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and further extend the results to allow early stopping rules. We also perform extensive numerical studies on both simulated and real data to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {We consider both classical and quantum variations of X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T-colluding symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR). This is the first work to study SPIR with X-security in classical or quantum variations. We first develop a scheme for classical X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T-colluding SPIR (XSETSPIR) based on a modified version of cross subspace alignment (CSA), which achieves a rate of R = 1 − X+max(T,E)/N . The modified scheme achieves the same rate as the scheme used for X-secure PIR with the extra benefit of symmetric privacy, i.e., user-privacy as well as databaseprivacy. Next, we extend this scheme to its quantum counterpart based on the N-sum box abstraction. This is the first work to consider the presence of eavesdroppers in quantum private information retrieval (QPIR). In the quantum variation, the eavesdroppers have better access to information over the quantum channel compared to the classical channel due to the over-the-air decodability. To that end, we develop two different schemes for quantum X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T-colluding SPIR (QXSETSPIR) with secure over-the-air decoding. The first scheme achieves the highest possible super-dense coding gain, i.e., RQ = min {1, 2 (1 − X+max(T,E)/N) , which requires additional uploads from the user. The second scheme on the other hand requires no extra uploads. However, it does not achieve the super-dense coding gain in some cases based on the relation between the number of eavesdropped links and the number of interference terms. The second scheme is based on the idea that there exist some special entanglement states that can be used to hide the contents of the user-required messages from the eavesdroppers using the interference symbols.}},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy provides a robust framework for protecting sensitive data, while maintaining its utility for computation. In essence, a differentially private algorithm takes as input the data of multiple parties, and returns an output disclosing minimal information about any individual party. Previous research has introduced several quantum extensions of differential privacy, with applications ranging from quantum machine learning on private classical data to quantum shadow tomography. However, the local model of quantum differential privacy – where each party is responsible for privatizing their own data at a local level – has received limited attention. This work delves into locally differentially private quantum measurements. Although any measurement can be made locally differentially private by adding noise to the outcome, we demonstrate that certain quantum measurements inherently satisfy some degree of local differential privacy for specific classes of input states. This finding has two significant implications: first, limiting the analysis to classical noise injection mechanisms may lead to suboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs for quantum data; second, the theory of differential privacy can be harnessed to further investigate the capabilities of quantum measurements. Motivated by these insights, we establish strong data processing inequalities for the quantum relative entropy under local differential privacy and apply these results to asymmetric hypothesis testing of quantum states with restricted measurements. Additionally, we prove an equivalence between quantum statistical queries and quantum differential privacy in the local model, thereby addressing an open question posed by Arunachalam et al. [11]. Finally, we consider the task of quantum multi-party computation under local differential privacy, demonstrating that parity functions can be efficiently learned in this model, whereas the corresponding classical task requires exponentially many samples.},

To this end, we view the group testing problem as a function learning problem in the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework. We derive sufficiency bounds on the number of tests for popular binary group testing recovery algorithms, namely, combinatorial orthogonal matching pursuit under Bernoulli and near-constant row-weight test designs, and definite defectives under a Bernoulli test design. We compare the derived bounds with the existing ones in the literature for exact recovery both theoretically and using simulations.

  abstract     = {Nowadays there are several classes of constrained codes intended for different applications. The following two large classes can be distinguished. The first class contains codes with local constraints; for example, the source data must be encoded by binary sequences containing no sub-words 00 and 111. The second class contains codes with global constraints; for example, the code-words must be binary sequences of certain even length where half of the symbols are zeros and half are ones It is important to note that often the necessary codes must fulfill some requirements of both classes. In this paper we propose a general polynomial complexity method for constructing codes for both classes, as well as for combinations thereof. The proposed method uses the Cover enumerative code, but calculates all the parameters on the fly with polynomial complexity, unlike the known applications of that code which employ combinatorial formulae. The main idea of the paper is to use dynamic programming to perform calculations like: how many sequences with a given prefix and a given suffix length satisfying constraints exist. For the constraints under consideration, we do not need to know the entire prefix, but much less knowledge about the prefix is sufficient. That is, we only need a brief description of the prefix.},

A common feature between relay systems and IRS-aided systems is the two-hop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. As a result, the mutual information (MI) of two-hop MIMO channels has been widely investigated with very engaging results. However, a rigorous investigation on the fundamental limits of two-hop MIMO channels, i.e., the first and second-order analysis, is not yet available in the literature, due to the difficulties caused by the two-hop (product) channel and the noise introduced by the relay (active IRS). In this paper, we employ large random matrix theory, specifically Gaussian tools, to derive the closed-form deterministic approximation for the mean and variance of the MI. Additionally, we determine the convergence rate for the mean, variance and the characteristic function of the MI, and prove the asymptotic Gaussianity. Furthermore, we also investigate the analytical properties of the fundamental equations that describe the closed-form approximation and prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to obtain the solutions for the fundamental equations. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {We study nonparametric contextual bandits under batch constraints, where the expected reward for each action is modeled as a smooth function of covariates, and the policy updates are made at the end of each batch of observations. We establish a minimax regret lower bound for this setting and propose a novel batch learning algorithm that achieves the optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors). In essence, our procedure dynamically splits the covariate space into smaller bins, carefully aligning their widths with the batch size. Our theoretical results suggest that for nonparametric contextual bandits, a nearly constant number of policy updates can attain optimal regret in the fully online setting.},

  abstract     = {Graph alignment refers to the task of finding the vertex correspondence between two correlated graphs of n vertices. Extensive study has been done on polynomial-time algorithms for the graph alignment problem under the Erdős–Rényi graph pair model, where the two graphs are Erdős–Rényi graphs with edge probability qu, correlated under certain vertex correspondence. To achieve exact recovery of the correspondence, all existing algorithms at least require the edge correlation coefficient ρu between the two graphs to be non-vanishing as n → ∞. Moreover, it is conjectured that no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve exact recovery under vanishing edge correlation ρu &lt; 1/polylog(n). In this paper, we show that with a vanishing amount of additional attribute information, exact recovery is polynomial-time feasible under vanishing edge correlation ρu ≥ n−Θ(1). We identify a local tree structure, which incorporates one layer of user information and one layer of attribute information, and apply the subgraph counting technique to such structures. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed that recovers the vertex correspondence for most of the vertices, and then refines the output to achieve exact recovery. The consideration of attribute information is motivated by real-world applications like LinkedIn and Twitter, where user attributes like birthplace and education background can aid alignment.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we initiate the study of the Rank Decoding (RD) problem and Low Rank Parity Check (LRPC) codes with blockwise structure in rank-based cryptosystems. First, we introduce the blockwise errors (ℓ-errors) where each error consists of ℓ blocks of coordinates with direct-sum supports, and define the blockwise RD (ℓ-RD) problem as a natural generalization of the RD problem whose solutions are ℓ-errors (note that the RD problem is actually a special ℓ-RD problem with ℓ = 1). We adapt the typical attacks on the RD problem to the ℓ-RD problem, and find that the blockwise structure does not ease the problem too much: the ℓ-RD problem is still exponentially hard for appropriate choices of ℓ &gt; 1. Second, we introduce the blockwise LRPC (ℓ-LRPC) codes as generalizations of the LPRC codes whose parity-check matrices can be divided into ℓ sub-matrices with direct-sum supports, i.e., the intersection of two subspaces generated by the entries of any two sub-matrices is a null space, and investigate the decoding algorithms for ℓ-errors. We find that the gain of using ℓ-errors in decoding capacity outweighs the complexity loss in solving the ℓ-RD problem, which makes it possible to design more efficient rank-based cryptosystems with flexible choices of parameters. As an application, we show that the two rank-based cryptosystems submitted to the NIST PQC competition, namely, RQC and ROLLO, can be greatly improved by using the ideal variants of the ℓ-RD problem and ℓ-LRPC codes. Concretely, for 128-bit security, our RQC has total public key and ciphertext sizes of 2.5 KB, which is not only about 50% more compact than the original RQC, but also smaller than the NIST Round 4 code-based submissions HQC, BIKE, and Classic McEliece.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the unsourced random access (URA) problem with a random and unknown number of active users in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels.We derive non-asymptotic achievability bounds on the probability of incorrectly estimating the number of active users, and provide scaling laws on the gap between the estimated and true numbers of active users. We prove that the error probability reaches a plateau as the power P and blocklength n increase, whereas it decays exponentially with the number L of receive antennas and eventually vanishes. Then, we explore the fundamental limits of URA by deriving nonasymptotic achievability bounds and converse bounds (including two single-user converse bounds and one multi-user ensemble converse bound) on the minimum energy-per-bit required by each active user to transmit J bits with blocklength n under misdetection and false-alarm constraints. Numerical results show that the extra required energy-per-bit due to the uncertainty in the number Ka of active users decreases as L and E[Ka] increase and the error requirement becomes milder. In the non-asymptotic regime, using codewords distributed on a sphere outperforms Gaussian random coding. Existing schemes are shown to exhibit a large gap to our bounds when the number of active users is large, calling for more advanced schemes that perform energyefficiently in this case. In the asymptotic regime with n → ∞, we establish scaling laws on the minimum required P and L to reliably support Ka active users as functions of n, which highlight the potential of MIMO in enabling low-cost communication and indicate that it is possible for the minimum required P and L to remain on the same order when the number of active users increases but stays below a threshold.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides a finite-sample analysis of a passive stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (PSGLD) algorithm. This algorithm is designed to achieve adaptive inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Adaptive IRL aims to estimate the cost function of a forward learner performing a stochastic gradient algorithm (e.g., policy gradient reinforcement learning) by observing their estimates in real-time. The PSGLD algorithm is considered passive because it incorporates noisy gradients provided by an external stochastic gradient algorithm (forward learner), of which it has no control. The PSGLD algorithm acts as a randomized sampler to achieve adaptive IRL by reconstructing the forward learner’s cost function nonparametrically from the stationary measure of a Langevin diffusion. This paper analyzes the non-asymptotic (finite-sample) performance; we provide explicit bounds on the 2-Wasserstein distance between PSGLD algorithm sample measure and the stationary measure encoding the cost function, and provide guarantees for a kernel density estimation scheme which reconstructs the cost function from empirical samples. Our analysis uses tools from the study of Markov diffusion operators. The derived bounds have both practical and theoretical significance. They provide finite-time guarantees for an adaptive IRL mechanism, and substantially generalize the analytical framework of a line of research in passive stochastic gradient algorithms.},

We introduce an analogue of the Poisson summation formula for stabilizer codes, facilitating a method for the exact computation of the number of error paths within the syndrome extraction circuit of the code that does not require direct enumeration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by explicitly providing the exact number of error paths in a distance five surface code under various error models, a task infeasible via direct enumeration. We also show our circuit enumerator is related to the process matrix of a channel through a type of MacWilliams identity.},

  abstract     = {Temperature control is of utmost importance in transmission systems. In this paper, a binary channel model is considered in which the transmission of a one causes a temperature increase while communicating a zero causes a temperature drop. By putting constraints on the input sequences, it is guaranteed that the channel temperature will not exceed a certain pre-determined maximum. In the asymptotic regime, the capacity of such a channel is studied. For the non-asymptotic regime, fixed-length codes are presented, with the property that codewords can be freely cascaded without violating the temperature constraint. Optimization of the code size is investigated and codewords are enumerated using generating functions.},
