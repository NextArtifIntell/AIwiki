  abstract     = {The growth of cloud computing has led to the widespread use of location-based services, such as spatial keyword queries, which return spatial data points within a given range that have the highest similarity in keyword sets to the user&#39;s. As the volume of spatial data increases, providers commonly outsource data to powerful cloud servers. Because cloud servers are untrustworthy, privacy-preserving keyword query schemes have been proposed. However, existing schemes consider only location queries or exact keyword matching. To address these issues, we propose the Privacy-Preserving Spatial Keyword Similarity Query Scheme (PPSKSQ), designed to search for spatial data points with the highest similarity while protecting the privacy of outsourced data, query requests, and results. First, we design two sub-protocols based on improved symmetric homomorphic encryption (iSHE): iSHE-SC for secure size comparison and iSHE-SIP for secure inner product computation. Then, we encode range information and integrate it with a quadtree to construct a novel index structure. Additionally, we use the Jaccard to measure similarity in conjunction with the iSHE-SC protocol, transforming similarity comparison into a matrix trace operation. Finally, rigorous security analysis and extensive simulation experiments confirm the flexibility, efficiency, and scalability of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {The Industrial Internet of Things provides an opportunity for flexible and collaborative manufacturing, but introduces more risk and more communication overhead from the Internet to the industrial field. To avoid attacks from unreliable service providers and requesters, Industrial Demilitarized Zone (IDMZ) is introduced in conjunction with firewalls to provide new communication modes between edge servers and industrial devices. As the number of tasks being offloaded to the edge side increases, optimal task offloading to balance the risk and the communication overhead with limited demilitarized buffer size becomes a challenge. Therefore, this paper establishes a mathematical model for secure task offloading in the Industrial Internet-of-Things considering dense communication with different communication modes. Then, a Parallel Gbest-centric differential evolution (P-G-DE) is designed to solve this task offloading problem with a heuristic-embedded initialization strategy, a modified Gbest-centric differential evolutionary operator and a circular-rotated parallelization scheme. The experimental results verify that the proposed method is capable of providing a high-quality solution with a lower risk and a shorter execution time in seconds, compared to six state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) is a highly active research field, with Private Set Intersection (PSI) being a classic subtopic within it. However, simple intersection computation is insufficient for many real-world scenarios, leading to the development of various PSI variant protocols. In this context, we propose a cloud-based multi-party private set intersection with union protocol, denoted as MPSI-U. This protocol securely computes the intersection of the designated party&#39;s set with the union of the sets of all other parties, which can be applied to scenarios such as contact tracing. MPSI-U leverages cloud servers to alleviate the computational burden placed on users, while guaranteeing privacy and security simultaneously for all involved parties with the threshold BGN cryptographic system. Furthermore, a comprehensive formal security analysis of the protocol was conducted under the semi-honest model to prove its resilience against potential security threats. Based on our performance analysis, MPSI-U exhibits favorable characteristics in terms of communication and computation overhead. This enhances the versatility of MPSI-U, rendering it a valuable solution that can be widely applied across various domains and scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The explosive growth in training data and model sizes has spurred the adoption of distributed deep learning (DL) in heterogeneous computing clusters. Efficiently scheduling distributed training jobs in such heterogeneous environments while ensuring they meet user-specified deadlines remains a critical challenge. While most existing works focus on reducing job completion time in homogeneous clusters, they pay little attention to meeting job deadlines in heterogeneous clusters. To address this issue, we propose Dancer (Deadline-Aware dyNamiC GPU allocation approach for Efficient Resource utilization), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts not only the number but the type of GPUs assigned to each job throughout its training lifecycle. Dancer aims to maximize the number of jobs meeting their deadlines in heterogeneous GPU clusters. It decouples job placement from resource allocation and formulates the scheduling optimization problem for maximizing the number of deadline-meeting jobs as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. To solve this ILP problem in real-time, we propose an online algorithm with a competitive ratio guarantee, leveraging primal-dual and dynamic programming techniques. Extensive trace-driven simulations based on real-world DL workloads demonstrate that Dancer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, improving the deadline satisfactory ratio up to 58.9%-74.2%.},

Due to the requirement of geographically distributed wireless sensor networks for Se-aaS, it is not always possible for a single Sensor-cloud Service Provider (SCSP) to meet the end-users requirements. To address this problem, we propose a federated sensor-cloud architecture involving multiple SCSPs for provisioning high-quality Se-aaS. Moreover, for ensuring trust in such a distributed architecture, we propose the use of consortium blockchain to keep track of the activities of each SCSP and to automate several functionalities through Smart Contracts. Additionally, to ensure profitability and end-user satisfaction, we propose a composite scheme, named BRAIN, comprising of two parts. First, we define miner&#39;s score to select an optimal subset of SCSPs as miners periodically. Second, we propose a modified multiple-leaders-multiple-followers Stackelberg game-theoretic approach to decide the association of an optimal subset of SCSPs to each service. Thereafter, we evaluate the performance of BRAIN by comparing with three existing benchmark schemes through simulations. Simulation results depict that BRAIN outperforms existing schemes in terms of profits and resource consumption of SCSPs, and price charged from end-users.},

  abstract     = {With the development of cloud computing, more and more data is stored in cloud servers, which leads to an increasing degree of privacy of data stored in cloud servers. For example, in the critical domain of medical vaccine trials, where public health outcomes hinge on the analysis of sensitive patient data, the imperative to safeguard privacy has never been more pronounced. Traditional encryption methods, though effective at protecting data, often expose vulnerabilities during decryption and lack the ability to support granular data access and computation. One-way re-encryption schemes further impede the agility of data sharing, which is indispensable for the collaborative efforts of research institutions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel bidirectional re-encryption scheme for inner-product functional encryption (IPFE). Our scheme secures data while allowing computation and sharing in an encrypted state, preserving patient privacy without hindering research. By harnessing inner-product functional encryption, our approach allows authorized researchers to extract valuable insights from encrypted data, significantly enhancing privacy protections. Our scheme&#39;s security is predicated on the $l$-ABDHE (augmented bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent) assumption, ensuring robustness against chosen plaintext attacks within the standard model. This foundation not only secures the data but also yields compact ciphertext length, minimizing storage demands. We introduce a protocol specifically designed for medical vaccine trials, which leverages our bidirectional IB-IPFRE (Identity-Based Inner-Product Functional Re-Encryption) scheme. This protocol enhances data security, supports collaborative research, and maintains patient privacy. Its application in vaccine trials demonstrates the scheme&#39;s effectiveness in protecting sensitive information while enabling critical research insights.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of container-based cloud computing services has been prevalent, especially with the introduction of Kubernetes, which enables the automated deployment, scaling, and administration of applications in containers, hence boosting the popularity of containers. As a result, researchers have placed greater emphasis on container runtime security, notably investigating the efficacy of traditional techniques such as Capabilities, Seccomp, and Linux security modules in guaranteeing container security. However, due to the limitations imposed by the container environment, the results have been unsatisfactory. In addition, eBPF-based solutions face the problem of being unable to quickly load policies and affect real-time operations when faced with newer kernel vulnerabilities. This paper investigates the limitations of existing container security mechanisms. Additionally, it examines the specific constraints of these mechanisms in Kubernetes environments. The paper classifies container monitoring and obligatory access control into three distinct categories: system call access control, LSM hook access control, and kernel function access control. Therefore, we propose a technique for regulating container access with a variety of granularity levels. This technique is executed using eBPF and is tightly integrated with Kubernetes to collect relevant meta-information. In addition, we suggest implementing a consolidated routing method and employing function tail call chaining to overcome the limitation of eBPF in enforcing mandatory access control for containers. Lastly, we conducted a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness of the system&#39;s security using CVE-2022-0492 and to benchmark the system that had BPFGuard enabled. The results indicate that the average performance loss increased merely by 2.16%, demonstrating that there are no adverse effects on the container services. This suggests that greater security can be achieved at a minimal cost.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing number of devices, the demand for data computation is growing rapidly. In edge-cloud collaborative computing, tasks can be scheduled to servers as interdependent subtasks, enhancing performance through parallel computing. A task is executed in an executor, which must first initialize the runtime environment in a process called task startup. However, most existing research neglects the reuse of executors, leading to considerable delays during task startup. To address this issue, we model the edge-cloud collaborative task scheduling scenario considering executor reuse, task startup, and dependency relationships. We then formulate the dependent task scheduling problem with task startup. To meet real-time demands in edge-cloud collaborative computing, we propose ReflexPilot, an online task scheduling architecture featuring executor management. Building on this architecture, we introduce OTSA-PPO, a task scheduling algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and EMA, an advanced executor allocation algorithm. Under constraints of computational and communication resources, ReflexPilot leverages OTSA-PPO for online scheduling of dependent tasks based on current states, while EMA pre-creates and reuses executors to reduce the average task completion time. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ReflexPilot significantly reduces the average task completion time by 31% to 71% compared with existing baselines.},

In reality, it is more practical for users to obtain credentials on attributes from multiple authorities. There are a few works on multi-authority ABC, which do not support delegation needed in real deployments. In this paper, we present the first delegatable multi-authority attribute-based anonymous credential system, which simultaneously achieves revocation and traceability.
