  abstract     = {The concept of priority has been introduced to the robotic systems in 1980 s as an effort to overcome problems caused by singularity and it has attracted considerable attention from both the robotics and control societies. However, none of the previous works have successfully addressed two fundamental degenerate properties of singularity: nonsmoothness and imperfect inversion. This technical note proposes a prioritized output tracking control method that guarantees the ultimate boundedness and the convergence of higher priority outputs when the input-output feedback linearization becomes nonsmooth and imperfect by singularity. For that purpose, we firstly prioritize the input-output feedback linearization and discuss how two degenerate properties can occur when the system becomes singular. Then, we introduce the differential inclusion to deal with the nonsmooth internal dynamics and establish a condition using the upper Dini derivative for asymptotically stable zero dynamics. Also, we propose a strictly positive realness-based feedback gain design and find a condition related to an M-matrix in order to handle nonlinearities that appear in the imperfect feedback linearization. Finally, we combine these two results and show the ultimate boundedness and the output convergence. Additionally, we provide a motivational example with a planar four-link manipulator to illustrate the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the maximum likelihood identification of models for offset-free model predictive control (MPC), where LTI models are augmented with (fictitious) uncontrollable integrating modes, called integrating disturbances. The states and disturbances are typically estimated with a Kalman filter. The disturbance estimates effectively provide integral control, so the quality of the disturbance model (and resulting filter) directly influences the control performance. We implement eigenvalue constraints to protect against undesirable filter behavior (unstable or marginally stable modes, high-frequency oscillations). Specifically, we consider the class of linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions for eigenvalue constraints. These LMI regions are open sets by default, so we introduce a barrier function method to create tightened, but closed, eigenvalue constraints. To solve the resulting nonlinear semidefinite program, we approximate it as a nonlinear program using a Cholesky factorization method that exploits known sparsity structures of semidefinite optimization variables and matrix inequalities. The algorithm is applied to real-world data taken from two physical systems: a low-cost benchmark temperature microcontroller suitable for classroom laboratories, and an industrial-scale chemical reactor at Eastman Chemical&#39;s plant in Kingsport, TN.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers distributed online convex optimization with time-varying constraints. In this setting, a network of agents makes decisions at each round, and then only a portion of the loss function and a coordinate block of the constraint function are privately revealed to each agent. The loss and constraint functions are convex and can vary arbitrarily across rounds. The agents collaborate to minimize static network regret and network cumulative constraint violation. A novel distributed online algorithm with a vanishing stepsize is proposed and it achieves an $\mathcal {O}(T^{\max \lbrace c,1-c\rbrace })$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-c/2})$ network cumulative constraint violation bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $c\in (0,1)$ is a user-defined trade-off parameter. When Slater&#39;s condition holds (i.e, there is a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints), the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-c})$. Moreover, if the loss functions are strongly convex, then static network regret bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(\log (T))$, and the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{\log (T)T})$ and $\mathcal {O}(\log (T))$ without and with Slater&#39;s condition, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to achieve tighter (network) cumulative constraint violation bounds for (distributed) online convex optimization with time-varying constraints under Slater&#39;s condition. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical simulations.},

Auxiliary signals are perturbations that make faults easier to detect, at the cost of some disruption to normal operation. In this paper, we find minimally disruptive auxiliary signals that guarantee detection under set-based uncertainty. Our motivation is distance protection in inverter-dominated power systems, wherein small fault currents can go undetected by traditional schemes. We focus on static systems because distance protection is based on phasors. We formulate a general auxiliary signal design problem with constraints imposed by system operational requirements, and additive and multiplicative noise. We use a relaxation and duality to reformulate the problem as a semidefinite bilinear program. In the special case of additive uncertainty and no constraints, we obtain an analytical lower bound on the magnitude an auxiliary signal must have to guarantee detection. We solve the optimizations in an example based on distance protection, in which the auxiliary signal is negative sequence current.},

Unfortunately, adaptive identification based on both saturated observations and the $\ell _{1}$-optimization turns out to be a challenging nonlinear problem, and has rarely been explored in the literature. Motivated by this and the need to fit with the $\ell _{1}$-based index of prediction accuracy in, e.g., judicial sentencing prediction problems, we propose a two-step weighted $\ell _{1}$-based adaptive identification algorithm. Under certain excitation conditions much weaker than the traditional persistent excitation (PE) condition, we will establish the global convergence of both the parameter estimators and the adaptive predictors. It is worth noting that our results do not rely on the widely used independent and identically distributed (iid) assumptions on the system signals, and thus do not exclude applications to feedback control systems. We will demonstrate the advantages of our proposed new adaptive algorithm over the existing $\ell _{2}$-based ones, through both a numerical example and a real-data-based sentencing prediction problem.},

  abstract     = {For stabilizing stop-and-go oscillations in traffic flow by actuating a variable speed limit (VSL) at a downstream boundary of a freeway segment, we introduce event-triggered PDE backstepping designs employing the recent concept of performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC). Our design is for linearized hyperbolic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) PDEs governing traffic velocity and density. Compared to continuous feedback, ETC provides a piecewise-constant VSL commands—more likely to be obeyed by human drivers. Unlike the existing “regular” ETC (R-ETC), which enforces conservatively a strict decrease of a Lyapunov function, our performance-barrier (P-ETC) approach permits an increase, as long as the Lyapunov function remains below a performance barrier, resulting in fewer control updates than R-ETC. To relieve VSL from continuously monitoring the triggering function, we also develop periodic event-triggered (PETC) and self-triggered (STC) versions of both R-ETC and P-ETC. These are referred to as R/P-PETC and R/P-STC, respectively, and we show that they both guarantee Zeno-free behavior and exponential convergence in the spatial $L^{2}$ norm. With comparative simulations, we illustrate the benefits of the performance-barrier designs through traffic metrics (driver comfort, safety, travel time, fuel consumption). The proposed algorithms reduce discomfort nearly in half relative to driver behavior without VSL, while tripling the driver safety, measured by the average dwell time, relative to the R-ETC frequent-switching VSL schedule.},

Specifically, we delve into the details of the geometrically periodic system through the tunnel of considering the convergence between the system and its geometrically averaging approximation. Under different corresponding conditions, the approximation on infinite time intervals can achieve certain accuracies, such that one can use the stability result of either the original system or the averaging system to deduce the stability of the other. After that, we employ the graphical stability to investigate the “pattern stability” with respect to the phase-based system. Finally, by virtue of the contraction analysis on the Finsler manifold, the idea of accentuating the periodic pattern incremental stability and convergence is nurtured in the phase-based differential inclusion system, and comes to its preliminary fruition in application to biomimetic mechanic robot control problem.},

In this paper, we focus on the noisy communication setting and propose an algorithm that bridges the performance gap caused by communication noise while also mitigating other challenges like data heterogeneity. We establish theoretical results of the proposed algorithm that quantify the effect of communication noise and gradient noise on the performance of the algorithm.

  abstract     = {To stabilize PDE models, control laws typically require space-dependent functional gains mapped by nonlinear operators from the PDE functional coefficients. When a PDE is nonlinear and its “pseudo-coefficient” functions are state-dependent, a gain-scheduling (GS) nonlinear design is the simplest approach to the design of nonlinear feedback. The GS version of PDE backstepping employs gains obtained by solving a PDE at each value of the state. Performing such PDE computations in real time may be prohibitive. The recently introduced neural operators (NO) can be trained to produce the gain functions, rapidly in real time, for each state value, without requiring a PDE solution. In this paper we introduce NOs for GS-PDE backstepping. GS controllers act on the premise that the state change is slow and, as a result, guarantee only local stability, even for ODEs. We establish local stabilization of hyperbolic PDEs with nonlinear recirculation using both a “fullkernel” approach and the “gain-only” approach to gain operator approximation. Numerical simulations illustrate stabilization and demonstrate speedup by three orders of magnitude over traditional PDE gain-scheduling. The code for the numerical implementation is available on Github [23]. This work was the subject of the 2023 Bode Prize Lecture by the last coauthor.},

  abstract     = {The application of distributed model predictive controllers (DMPC) for multiagent systems (MASs) necessitates communication between agents, yet the consequence of communication data rates is typically overlooked. This work focuses on developing stability-guaranteed control methods for MASs with limited data rates. Initially, a distributed optimization algorithm with dynamic quantization is considered for solving the DMPC problem. Due to the limited data rate, the optimization process suffers from inexact iterations caused by quantization noise and premature termination, leading to suboptimal solutions. In response, we propose a novel real-time DMPC framework with a quantization refinement scheme that updates the quantization parameters on-line so that both the quantization noise and the optimization suboptimality decrease asymptotically. To facilitate the stability analysis, we treat the suboptimally controlled MAS, the quantization refinement scheme, and the optimization process as three interconnected subsystems. The cyclic-small-gain theorem is used to derive sufficient conditions on the quantization parameters for guaranteeing the stability of the system under a limited data rate. Finally, the proposed algorithm and theoretical findings are demonstrated in a multi-AUV formation control example.},

Moreover, the full state of the plant is available for feedback. A multiple model online identification scheme for the plant&#39;s state and input matrices is developed that guarantees the estimated parameters converge to the underlying plant model under the assumption of persistence of excitation. Using an exact matching condition, the parameter estimates are used in a control law such that the plant&#39;s states asymptotically track the reference signal generated by a state-space reference model. The control architecture is proven to provide boundedness of all closed-loop signals and to asymptotically drive the state tracking error to zero. Numerical simulations illustrate the stability and efficacy of the proposed MMRAC scheme, even in the presence of noise. Statistical analysis is included to showcase the improvements of using multiple models.},

Existence conditions for the protocol are then systematically discussed from the graph, low gain and high gain perspectives, respectively.

We first show how to formulate the collaborative STL tasks as assume-guarantee contracts by leveraging the idea of prescribed performance control. The concept of contracts is used to establish our compositionality result, which allows us to guarantee the satisfaction of a global contract by the multi-agent system when all agents satisfy their local contracts. Then, a closed-form continuous-time feedback controller is designed to enforce local contracts over the agents in a distributed manner, which further guarantees global task satisfaction based on the compositionality result.

In order to avoid any unwanted behavior during the learning phase, a tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller is employed, which ensures satisfaction of constraints and input-to-state stability of the closed-loop states. In addition, the proposed approach guarantees the convergence of states to the origin under certain conditions. To make the algorithm implementable online, a dual-timescale adaptation mechanism is utilized, where the weights of the output layer of the neural network are updated each time instant using a weight update law, while the inner layers are repeatedly trained in self-supervised manner by using the adaptive actions as labels for the training. Our results are validated through a numerical experiment, which indicates that the proposed deep MPC architecture is effective in learning to control safety critical systems without suffering instability drawbacks.},

Our approach is based on that of the so-called mean subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithm with a special emphasis on its use in agents capable to communicate with multi-hop neighbors. The MSR algorithm provides an effective technique for agents to achieve resilient consensus if the multi-agent network satisfies certain connectivity requirements. Our analysis highlights that for maintaining the same level of resilience against adversarial nodes, such network connectivity requirements can be relaxed by increasing the number of relay hops. In particular, we characterize tight network structures for our algorithm to succeed and propose a novel notion of graph robustness with multi-hop communication. Moreover, we analyze the multi-hop W-MSR algorithm with delays in communication since messages from multi-hop neighbors may require different numbers of time steps for their transmissions.

However, the remote control center is usually well protected and its knowledge is difficult to be disclosed, which becomes a major obstacle in developing stealthy false data injection (FDI) attack scheme because only partial system knowledge (i.e., the system matrices of the physical plant) could be used. To meet this challenge, a novel stealthy FDI attack scheme against the sensor measurement is proposed by employing the normal and compromised self-governed filters held by malicious attackers, where the normal one is adopted to estimate the system state and the compromised one is used as the virtual attacked target. The corresponding attack strategy is obtained by maximizing the estimation error of the compromised self-governed filter. Then, the residual of the compromised system is derived to prove attack stealthiness. Next, it is derived and found that the attack impact on system estimation performance is the same as that based on full system knowledge. Furthermore, the divergence condition of NCSs under the attack is presented. Finally, all the theoretical analyses are verified by simulation results.},

This is achieved by proving that the exact backstepping kernels, constructed for stabilization of the large-scale system, can be approximated (in certain sense such that exponential stability is preserved) by the backstepping kernels constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (essentially an infinite ensemble) of the original PDE system. The proof relies on construction of a convergent sequence of backstepping kernels that is defined such that each kernel matches the exact backstepping kernels (derived based on the original, large-scale system), in a piecewise constant manner with respect to an ensemble variable; while showing that they satisfy the continuum backstepping kernel equations. We present a numerical example that reveals that complexity of computation of stabilizing backstepping kernels may not scale with the number of components of the PDE state, when the kernels are constructed on the basis of the continuum version, in contrast to the case in which they are constructed on the basis of the original, large-scale system. In addition, we formally establish the connection between the solutions to the large-scale system and its continuum counterpart. Thus, this approach can be useful for design of computationally tractable, stabilizing backstepping-based control laws for large-scale PDE systems.},

For non-minimum phase systems with unstable internal dynamics, the inverse model yields unbounded inputs, impeding the implementation of the feedforward control method. Existing stable inversion leverages non-causal input and initial state transition to achieve exact tracking with an infinite time preview of the output. However, a limited preview window results in tracking errors, and the existence of the optimal transition relies on the invertibility of the Grammian matrix. Recently, a novel stable inversion based on lifting time systems has been introduced. It enables finite-time precision tracking without an infinite preview window and exhibits significant application potential, though confined to linear time-invariant systems. From the perspective of the lifted system, this paper addresses the stable inversion problem in finite time for multivariate linear periodic time-varying systems leveraging the equivalence between the linear periodic time-varying system and its lifted system. Simulation is designed to validate the effectiveness of the results.},

The learning problem becomes even more difficult for complex tasks with temporal and logical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a modular deep RL architecture as a control framework to satisfy complex tasks specified using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). To enhance safety, we propose a safe “shield” to constrain RL actions within a safe set. In turn, a challenge with this strategy is that the safe filter can restrict RL exploration during training. To address this limitation, we have developed an innovative safe guiding process by integrating the properties of LTL automata with perturbations of the safe “shield”. This innovation is verified to maintain the original optimality of LTL satisfaction and enhances exploration efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves near-perfect success rates and safety guarding with a high level of confidence during the training.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new aggregative game model over Free-in and Free-out (FIFO) networks, in which each player can freely join and leave the network at its timing and aims to minimize its total cost during its active period. To enable the players to make self-beneficial decisions in such a dynamic environment, it is assumed that the players can locally store and exchange the historical action information. Based on the stored information, a distributed strategy is established, in which each player updates its action by a dual averaging method. In order to prevent excessive storage requirements, a storage mechanism is designed so that only the information generated from a certain historical time horizon is retained. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated by the static regret, which quantifies player&#39;s loss between the actual cost and the cost with the fixed best response during its active period. It is shown that the upper bound of each player&#39;s static regret grows sub-linearly under local diminishing step-sizes, indicating that the proposed strategy performs as well as choosing the best stationary action in hindsight for the long-term players. Finally, a simulation study on energy consumption games is given to verify the effectiveness of the developed methods.},

These notions are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) is sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.},

We propose an information structure called a partial modified state class graph with respect to a timed observation. Then, based on the particular graph, an algorithm is designed to construct a delayed marking estimator that is used for the verification of $K$-step opacity of a timed observation by solving a number of linear programming problems. Finally, when the timed observation is not $K$-step opaque, a strategy by adjusting the time horizons of transitions with soft time intervals is proposed for the opacity enforcement purpose.},

To reveal the relationship about safety between subsystems and switched systems, an extended Nagumo&#39;s Theorem in the switched systems framework is derived. Also, several switched control design conditions are respectively provided to ensure safety of switched systems. Based on the union of MBFs and multiple Lyapunov functions (MLFs), a novel safety-critical control framework is established to simultaneously ensure safety and stability of switched systems. Also, an auxiliary cost function is introduced to transform the safety-critical optimal control (SCOC) problem of switched systems into the one of non-switched systems.

However, as the quantity of nodes in a network expands, existing investigations encounter difficulties in obtaining solutions within finite computation times due to computational complexity. For coping with this scenario, a novel event-triggered pinning quasi-synchronization approach is explored in this research for a category of switched directed networks (SDNs) with sampling measurements. By developing a time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and implementing a state-dependent switching strategy utilizing sampling measurements, sufficient conditions are formulated to assure that the synchronization errors are ultimately bounded in an exponential fashion. Different from previous relevant findings, the verification of matrix conditions in the derived synchronization criterion no longer depends on the number of nodes in networks, making it more suitable for large-scale SDNs. Ultimately, two simulation examples are incorporated to elucidate the applicability of the newly crafted synchronization methodology.},

To this end, the underlying uncertain nonlinear system is decomposed based on a first-order Taylor series expansion into a nominal system and an error (deviation) described as an uncertain linear time-varying system. This decomposition allows us to leverage system level synthesis to jointly optimize an affine error feedback, a nominal nonlinear trajectory, and, most importantly, a dynamic linearization error over-bound used to ensure robust constraint satisfaction for the nonlinear system. The proposed approach thereby results in less conservative planning compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

In this paper, by extending the famous I-MMSE (mutual information – minimum mean-square error) relationships to the discrete-time additive white Gaussian channels with and without feedback, a new paradigm is introduced to estimate and analyze total information rate as a control and filtering trade-off metric.

The strategy ensures that the detection signal at sampling instants consistently remains zero, allowing the designed zero-dynamics attack to achieve stealthiness. From the perspective of defenders, asynchronous sampling-and-holding countermeasure by introducing time-gap is presented. This countermeasure effectively disrupts the stealthiness of zero-dynamics attack, realizing the attack detection and enhancing the system security. It is demonstrated that for each sampling interval, there is at least one time-gap caused by asynchronous sampling-and-holding that allows attack signal to be detected. Finally, the automatic voltage regulator system and the inverted pendulum system are taken to verify the stealthiness of the attack design strategy and the effectiveness of the asynchronous-based countermeasure.},

In particular, many works require to restrict the class of LTI systems to those satisfying the relation $p\ell =n$. In this note, we show how to address the general MIMO case (for which $p\ell \geq n$ in general) by constructing an alternative non-minimal state vector from data.

This suggests the emergence of bifurcations in population games admitting multiple strict Nash equilibria, as observed in numerous examples. We then characterize a novel class of monotone separable population games for which globally asymptotically stable logit equilibria are proved to exist for every noise level.

Specifically, both GT-RR and ED-RR achieve the convergence rate of $\mathcal {O}(1/[(1-\lambda)^{1/3}m^{1/3}T^{2/3}])$ in driving the (minimum) expected squared norm of the gradient to zero, where $T$ denotes the number of epochs, $m$ is the sample size for each agent, and $(1-\lambda)$ represents the spectral gap of the mixing matrix. When the objective functions further satisfy the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, we show GT-RR and ED-RR both achieve $\mathcal {O}(1/[(1-\lambda)mT^{2}])$ convergence rate in terms of the averaged expected differences between the agents&#39; function values and the global minimum value. Notably, both results are comparable to the convergence rates of centralized RR methods (up to constant factors depending on the network topology) and outperform those of previous distributed random reshuffling algorithms.},

Based on traditional SCP, we introduce two methods to improve the solution quality and reduce the cost when SCP is stopped early at each time step. First, we analyze multiple explicit representations of a single constraint and propose a method to reduce convexification loss without solving additional nested dual problems. Second, we map the expansion points to the constraint boundary and propose the second method, which minimizes the loss to the greatest extent, referred to as weak loss convexification. Both methods are incorporated into a suboptimal MPC framework, guaranteeing recursive feasibility and stability, even when SCP is stopped early. Finally, simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods reduce conservatism in closed-loop trajectories, particularly for higher-order concave inequality constraints.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a sliding-mode controller design for safety against DoS attacks in networked switched systems. Firstly, we analyze the impact of the time delays induced by signal quantization and DoS attacks on the switching signals, control laws, and measurement data. We then design an integral sliding surface associated with the switching modes such that, when system uncertainties, disturbances, and the frequency and duration of DoS attacks are suitably bounded, input-to-state practical stability is guaranteed. Moreover, a reaching law is designed such that the trajectories of the networked switched system reach the sliding surface in finite time. The practicality and applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with numerical simulations on a networked continuous stirred tank reactor system.},

A challenging exploration is to implement neural network functionalities through biochemical reaction networks (BCRNs), a language that is inherently compatible with in vivo, with difficulties especially in constructing an appropriate BCRN that respects computation and information processing steps involved in neural networks. These two-part articles finish programming a nonlinear fully connected neural network (FCNN) with a three-layer structure using BCRNs endowed with mass action kinetics. In part I, we divide the FCNN into Assignment, Feedforward propagation, Judgment, Learning, and Clear-out modules. Each module is programmed using BCRNs by setting species concentrations to carry information related to all kinds of computations and operations, with the equilibria of some species to represent the computation results and information processing results. The newly formed biochemical neural network exhibits the potential to work independently in vivo. Additionally, our construction addresses a critical design gap by integrating two essential modules: the biochemical assignment module that enables iterative input of training samples, and the biochemical judgment module responsible for determining the termination of the training process. We further confirm theoretically that the BCRN system achieves FCNN functionality with exponential convergence to all target computational results. Finally, the performance of this construction is evaluated numerically on binary classification problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an approach to mitigate epidemic spread in a population of strategic agents by encouraging safer behaviors through carefully designed rewards. These rewards, which adapt to the evolving state of the epidemic, are ascribed by a dynamic payoff mechanism we seek to design. We use a modified SIRS model to track how the epidemic progresses in response to the agents&#39; strategic choices. By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics to model the population&#39;s strategic behavior, we extend previous related work so as to allow for noise in the agents&#39; perceptions of the rewards and intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium with minimized infection prevalence under budget constraints. We leverage the Lyapunov function to analyze how the epidemic&#39;s spread rate is influenced by the time scale of the payoff mechanism&#39;s dynamics. Additionally, we derive anytime upper bounds on both the infectious fraction of the population and the instantaneous cost a social planner must incur to control the spread, allowing us to quantify the trade-off between peak infection prevalence and the corresponding cost. For a class of one-parameter perturbed best response models, we propose a method to learn the model&#39;s parameter from data.},

Given the difficulty of dealing with coupled time-varying coefficients in reachable set estimation, a constructive polynomial-based approach is utilized to transform time-varying non-convex constraints into constant vertex constraints through the property of multi-affine matrix polynomials. Based on that, when the decay rate parameters for Lyapunov functions are known, the reachable set bounding region can be determined by solving vertex constraints in linear matrix inequality (LMI) forms. In cases where the decay rates are unknown, a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm and a Boundary Intersection (BI) algorithm are proposed to provide a tractable solution for parameter searching, and to achieve lower conservatism in the reachable set bounding regions. The effectiveness of our polynomial-based approach is illustrated through simulations using a single-mesh gear system. Moreover, the efficiency of the two algorithms can be assessed by contrasting the conservatism reduced in measurements of bounding regions.},

In particular, fixed-gain control offers more predictable closed-loop system behavior but requires the knowledge of uncertainty bounds. In contrast, while adaptive learning does not necessarily require such knowledge, it often results in less predictable closed-loop system behavior compared to fixed-gain control. To this end, this paper presents a novel symbiotic control framework that offers the strengths of fixed-gain control and adaptive learning architectures. Specifically, this framework synergistically integrates these architectures to mitigate the effects of uncertainties in a more predictable manner as compared to adaptive learning alone and it does not require any knowledge on such uncertainties. Both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties are considered, where we utilize neural networks to approximate the unknown uncertainty basis for the latter case. Counterintuitively, the proposed framework has the ability to achieve a desired level of closed-loop system behavior even with an insufficient number of neurons (e.g., when the neural network approximation error is large) or in the face of injudiciously selected adaptive learning parameters (e.g., high leakage term parameters).},

However, the current SCA algorithm exhibits a slow convergence rate, resulting in a relatively poor performance within a limited sample time. In this paper, the process of SCA is retreated as solving a fixed point nonlinear equation. By analyzing the derivative properties of this nonlinear equation, we introduce a Newton-based accelerated SCA (ASCA) algorithm designed to enhance the local convergence rate while inheriting all favorable characteristics of the SCA methods. Specifically, our algorithm offers the following benefits: (i) It is capable of effectively tackling nonlinear optimization-based control problems; (ii) It permits flexible termination with all generated intermediate solutions being feasible for the original nonlinear problem; and (iii) It guarantees convergence with locally superlinear convergence rate to the stationary point of the original nonlinear problem. Finally, we conduct experiments in a multi-agent collision avoidance scenario to show its validity.},

Based on group homomorphism theory, each group can be mapped as a virtual node, called the group representative node. Consequently, the signed networks can be represented by the homomorphic mapping graph with only negative weight edges. The definition of structural balance has been extended, eliminating the requirement for a structurally balanced network to have an even number of negative edges. As a result, a signed network with negative cycles is also considered structurally balanced. Then, multi-group symmetry consensus conditions are derived based on the characteristics of the Laplacian matrix associated with the homomorphic mapping graph. It can be concluded that average consensus and bipartite consensus are special cases of multi-group symmetric consensus. Each group in the signed networks is assigned different consensus parameters, thereby achieving asymmetric consensus, which together with symmetric consensus forms multi-group consensus control.},

However, existing methods, such as mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming, often struggle to efficiently solve control problems with complex, long-horizon STL specifications. This study introduces STLCCP, a novel convex optimization-based framework that leverages key structural properties of STL: monotonicity of the robustness function, its hierarchical tree structure, and correspondence between convexity/concavity in optimizations and conjunctiveness/disjunctiveness in specifications. The framework begins with a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, transforming the problem into an equivalent difference of convex (DC) programs. This is then solved sequentially as a convex quadratic program using an improved version of the convex-concave procedure (CCP). To further enhance efficiency, we develop a smooth approximation of the robustness function using a function termed the mellowmin function, specifically tailored to the proposed framework. Numerical experiments on motion planning benchmarks demonstrate that STLCCP can efficiently handle complex scenarios over long horizons, outperforming existing methods.},

The exponential stability of one single subsystem is shown with the existence of the artificial perturbation in the actual control input. We also elucidate the uniformly bounded growth of the system trajectory over the switching interval.
