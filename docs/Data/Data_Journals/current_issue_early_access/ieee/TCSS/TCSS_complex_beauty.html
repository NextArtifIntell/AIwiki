  abstract     = {Detecting Twitter bots is essential for combating misinformation and maintaining the integrity of online social networks. Existing methods often overlook the high-order interactions and heterogeneous relationships among users and tweets, limiting their effectiveness in addressing sophisticated bot behaviors. This article introduces HHG-Bot, a novel hyper-heterogeneous graph-based framework for Twitter bot detection. The proposed approach integrates heterogeneous graph convolutional networks with a trainable hypergraph aggregation model to capture complex, high-order interactions. To overcome the challenge of labeled data scarcity, HHG-Bot employs a meta-learning paradigm that enhances the model’s generalization capability across different bot types. Experiments conducted on the Twibot-20 benchmark dataset demonstrate that HHG-Bot achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in terms of accuracy (86.17%), F1-score (87.51%), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) (71.75%). The results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraphs and meta-learning for detecting Twitter bots, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.},

  abstract     = {User trajectories are denser and highly dynamic in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) system, rendering traditional privacy budget allocation schemes insufficient. Additionally, the protection of semantic location privacy is often neglected in these schemes, making them vulnerable to inference attacks. To address these deficiencies, a user trajectory privacy protection strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed in this article. First, a differential privacy-based user trajectory privacy protection algorithm (DP-upps) is designed to protect the privacy by perturbing the extracted trajectory feature points. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based privacy budget allocation algorithm (DRL-pbas) is introduced. The privacy budget is dynamically adjusted by deep reinforcement learning option to continuously adapt to environmental changes and maximize benefits. After that, a DRL-pbas based user privacy protection strategy (DRL-UPPS) is proposed, integrating semantic location privacy protection. This approach combines the previous two algorithms, allowing the privacy budget to be allocated in a way that effectively balances the protection of physical and semantic location privacy and data quality. Ultimately, a large number of simulation experiments are conducted based on real datasets. The experiments demonstrate that DRL-UPPS can effectively balance privacy protection and data quality, resisting the privacy attacks. Compared with other strategies, DRL-UPPS improves comprehensive privacy protection capability by approximately 10% and data utility by approximately 8%.},

  abstract     = {The level of service (LOS) serves as a crucial metric in assessing the efficiency of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). Precise forecasting of LOS is vital to improving the service quality provided by ITSs. However, within a transportation network, the LOS at each node typically exhibits spatial and temporal correlations due to the complex dynamics of traffic patterns. This poses a significant difficulty in accurately predicting traffic LOS. In this article, we propose a deep learning model, namely spatiotemporal cross-attention neural network (STCANN), to predict the LOS of a transportation network. On the one hand, the spatiotemporal dependencies between network nodes are captured through a set of stacked spatial and temporal cross-attention modules. On the other hand, the nonlinear interactions between traffic flow and speed are also resolved using a deliberate cross-attention mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct experiments on two public datasets available from California highways. The results demonstrate that the proposed STCANN model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy. The findings show that the incorporation of the cross-attention mechanism into the spatiotemporal neural network architecture shows great promise in improving the accuracy and reliability of LOS prediction.},

  abstract     = {Numerous significant temporal graph tasks, such as graph similarity ranking, trend analysis and anomaly detection, necessitate low-dimensional and high-order graph-level embedding in terms of the evolving nodes and topologies over time. However, most existing graph embedding methods focus on extracting node-level embeddings, while ignoring these evolutions. Therefore, these methods inadequately consider the impact of trends on the overall graph. Moreover, there are a large number of nodes in temporal graphs, which make it difficult to generate effective graph embeddings directly by aggregating dynamic node embeddings. In this study, we propose a novel temporal attention network for learning graph-level embedding learning called GraphTAN. Specifically, the proposed model employs pooling attention to select crucial nodes and filter out noisy ones for each snapshot, thereby enhancing the quality of aggregated graph embeddings. Furthermore, we design a graph-level temporal attention mechanism to effectively extract temporal graph embeddings, capturing trends and patterns across snapshots. The proposed model is evaluated on three downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTAN captures both the topology structure and fine-grained trend effectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods with big margins on multiple tasks over several real networks.},

Further, a key opinion leader (KOL) indicator system model is proposed to quantify the key opinion leaders’ metrics, and an information forwarding model that collaborates with the KOL indicator system and public opinion orientation is established to simulate information spread in real social networks. The results show that the information forwarding model performs excellently in predicting the spread of public opinion, and the cluster social network model aligns well with the topological structure of real social networks. Without considering positive and negative interventions, the optimal intervention period is when the total spread time proportion is $15\%\leq \tau\leq 32\%$. During this period, enhancing or suppressing information spread can achieve the best results. Additionally, it was discovered during the experiments that higher activity levels among opinion leaders might be more important than greater influence for information spread, often affecting the entire public opinion spread process.},

However, the diversity of carriers and technologies has led to a huge gap between the training scenarios and actual scenarios of detection methods. This makes it difficult for supervision-based detection frameworks to identify new malware variants and complicates threat response. We propose a novel method that integrates frequency domain techniques with feature alignment to enhance variant malware detection, reducing distribution differences between labeled (source) and new (target) samples. By converting malware into grayscale images and applying discrete cosine transform (DCT) for improved feature extraction, followed by feature extraction via a deep residual network from both domains, our model systematically aligns features. This alignment is achieved through a tailored domain adaptation technique involving the minimization of classification and domain alignment losses, which ensures the consistent learning of features across varied domains. Such rigorous alignment not only enhances detection accuracy for both known and variant malware but also supports simultaneous detection across significant distribution differences. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of various deep learning models under consistent and inconsistent domain distributions. Compared to existing methods, our approach improves accuracy by an average of 1.4% on the BIG2015 dataset, 3.2% on the MDA dataset, 2.75% on the Malimg dataset, and also achieves the best performance on the MaleVis dataset, with similar gains in precision, recall, and F1-score across all datasets.},

Prior efforts in disaster event management have applied unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques. However, these efforts encounter difficulties when focusing on specific events and dealing with class-imbalance domain adaptation (CDA), often leading to modifications in data distribution. This article introduces a solution named class-imbalanced adversarial neural network (CADNN) to address UDA challenges in emergency events across diverse domains. First, an adversarial domain adaptation model is developed to achieve cross-domain feature representation. Second, unlike existing methods that rely on data augmentation, a cross-domain interpolation model is designed to generate aligned pairwise samples. This ensures that the generated samples preserve the original data distribution by preserving the sample centroid. Third, the sample interpolation is integrated with the adversarial domain adaptation model, optimizing the overall loss function to enhance generalization performance. Experimental results on four open-source datasets demonstrate that CADNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in recognizing emergency event information.},

  abstract     = {The massive expansion of social media and the rapid growth in multimedia content on it has resulted in a growing interest in visual content analysis and classification. There are now a good number of studies that focus on identifying hateful and offensive content in social media posts. The social media content is often analyzed through automated algorithmic approaches, with respect to being unsuitable or harmful for different groups such as women and children. There is, however, a noticeable gap in the exploration of positive content, particularly in the case of multimodal content such as GIFs. Therefore, the present work attempted to address this gap by introducing a high-quality annotated dataset of animated GIFs. The dataset provides for two subtasks: 1) subtask 1 involves binary classification, determining whether a GIF provides emotional support; and 2) subtask 2 involves multiclass classification, wherein the GIFs are categorized into three different emotional support categories. The data annotation quality is assessed using Fleiss&#39; kappa. Various unimodal models, utilizing text-only and image-only approaches, are implemented. Additionally, an effective multimodal approach is proposed that combines visual and textual information for detecting emotional support in animated GIFs. Both sequence and frame-level visual features are extracted from animated GIFs and utilized for classification tasks. The proposed multimodal long-term spatiotemporal model employs a weighted late fusion technique. The results obtained show that the proposed multimodal model outperformed the implemented unimodal models for both subtasks. The proposed LTST model achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.8304 and 0.7180 for subtask 1 and subtask 2, respectively. The experimental work and analysis confirm the suitability of the dataset and proposed algorithmic model for the task.},

However, existing works on PDFL still have two challenges that urgently need to be solved. First, model updates exposed by point-to-point communication during collaborative training in PDFL may disclose sensitive information about clients. Second, the distributed structure makes PDFL vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can disrupt the network by introducing poisoned data or faulty behaviors. In this article, we propose a privacy-enhanced and Byzantine-resilient approach to effectively address the dual challenges of privacy and security in PDFL. In particular, each client is required to build a unique critical parameter index set by evaluating the importance of its model parameters and broadcasting it to neighbors. To improve Byzantine resilience, we propose a novel weight allocation scheme based on the critical parameter index set for clients to alleviate the negative impact of Byzantine neighbors in the model aggregation. To enhance privacy protection while boosting personalization, we combine with model decoupling and execute a clipping-robust personalized local training for each client to achieve user-level differential privacy. We finally conduct exhaustive experiments on FEMNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR10 datasets and various settings. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to five state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed method achieves excellent performance with user-level differential privacy guarantee in PDFL and implements additionally superior Byzantine robustness in adversarial settings.},

First, a new fuzzy control model of the bullwhip effect is proposed.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the ownership of shared social images has attracted increasingly serious privacy violation concerns, thus the protection of these images is particularly important. Further, due to the increasing value of deep learning (DL) models in social media platforms, there is an urgent demand to protect their copyright and prevent privacy leakage. Currently, relatively limited research has been carried out in the field of ownership protection for deep neural network (DNN) and, at the same time, related social images. This article presents a robust copyright protection system and method for the DNN model and related social images to verify ownership. Initially, split-way training of our model was established, based on cover and encoded secret images, to reduce or eradicate privacy leakage. Then, the sender sends only encoded vector information instead of raw data to adversarial-based embedding and extraction networks. Next, we embed a secret mark in DL embedding and extraction models, using interpolation-based watermarking to verify the ownership of suspicious models if any piracy or infringements occur. Last, the intended receiver extracts the hidden information using the extraction networks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed system is more robust and secure against attacks than state-of-the-art methods, making it beneficial for social media and other practical applications. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average peak signal-to-noise noise ratio, normalized correlation, number of pixel change rate, and unified average change intensity, with improvements of 47.25%, 43.25%, 17.89%, and 14.23%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The limitations of acquisition equipment often result in scene image data of limited size, posing a challenge for comprehensive analysis of social image datasets. Advances in generative models have introduced image outpainting techniques that expand the size of acquired social scene images, thereby enhancing the value of social image data. Stable diffusion (SD), which benefits from the guidance of caption prompts, shows excellent performance in image outpainting. However, its heavy reliance on manual prompts leads to a significant drawback: a decrease in the quality of generated images without prompts. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel self-prompt diffusion model for image outpainting that extrapolates images based on the semantics of the source image, thereby removing the dependence on manual prompts. Specifically, we design a prompt autoencoder that uses an autoregressive transformer to map prompt embeddings into their semantic space, facilitating the construction of a semantic decoder. The semantic decoder and prompt embeddings are then cooptimized within the proposed prompt embedding network, allowing the mapping of image features to the stable diffusion prompt embeddings. Furthermore, by exploiting the inherent generative capabilities of diffusion models, we introduce a seam line regeneration mechanism to address the common problem of seam lines when splicing input and generated images. Comparative experiments on the Places2 and COCO datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on visual quality metrics and is adaptable to the stable diffusion model without additional fine-tuning.},

However, the heterogeneous nature of edge servers (ESs) and the single-destination offloading strategy may limit the overall network performance. In this case, tasks are exclusively handled by the administrative ES, resulting in only marginal improvements in service quality, such as energy consumption and task delay. To fully exploit the advantages of edge computing, this article investigates the cooperation among ESs within CPSS and proposes a cooperative algorithm, named MATORA, to exploit a further performance gain by calculating the task offloading and resource allocation decisions. First, we formulate the joint optimization problem as a time-varying mixed integer nonlinear programming problem; then, we utilize the multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to learn the action policy. Second, the MATORA novelly builds reputation model for each ES to obtain insightful knowledge based on service quality, enhancing the training efficiency of MADRL. Thirdly, we simulate a digital twin-based virtual system to monitor the physical network, in which a risk-free, centralized training environment is provided for the multiagent algorithm.

  abstract     = {With the increasingly rapid aging of the global population, the population of middle-aged and older people with disabilities has been increasing, and thus disability has gradually been highlighted as an important issue for the middle-aged and elderly population. In this article, a 1-D convolutional neural network (1DCNN) model incorporating the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), i.e., the 1DCBAMCNN model, is designed and applied to the risk assessment of disability in the elderly. The 1DCNN effectively captures both local and global features within the data through convolutional operations. By directly analyzing tabular data related to disabilities in the elderly, it circumvents the information loss and increased computational complexity associated with dimensionality transformation. Additionally, the CBAM, which comprises channel attention and spatial attention modules, facilitates fine-grained feature selection and weighting of the input data. The integration of these two components not only leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of the 1DCNN but also utilizes the attention mechanism of CBAM to delve deeper into the abstract characteristics of the data, significantly enhancing the model&#39;s sensitivity to data features and effectively improving predictive performance. The model proposed in this article (1DCBAMCNN) experiments using the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset, and the model is compared with deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN), artificial neural network, and long short-term memory, as well as with the CNN model that incorporates the squeeze-and-excitation module, the efficient channel attention module, and the self-attention, respectively. The experimental results show that 1DCBAMCNN has better prediction results on the test set compared to other models, with accuracy and F1 score reaching 92.46% and 80.25%, respectively. The 1DCBAMCNN model presented in this article can more effectively predict disabilities within the elderly population, providing a basis for diagnosis and treatment.},

Recently, graph structure learning (GSL) have been used to model the complex relationships between candidates and experts in both professional fields and avoidance strategies. Most existing GSL models aim to learn the structure of homogeneous graph. However, they cannot learn the structure of heterogeneous graph (HG) because they ignore the complex relation attributes in HG. To fill this gap, we propose a relation enhanced heterogeneous graph structure learning (RE-HGSL) model that refines HG structure and learns node and relation representations simultaneously for expert selection in academic evaluation. The main idea of RE-HGSL is refining the HG structure by reconstructing edges through the similarity of relation triplet &lt;head node, relation, tail node&gt;. Specifically, we first set relation representation vector for each kind of relation to capture multiple relation attributes and learn node and relation representations to preserve multiple semantic information. Then, we construct multiple feature graphs where the edges are constructed according to the similarity of the relation triplet. Finally, the refined graph structure is generated by aggregating the original graph and the feature graphs, which maintains not only the part of original vital structure but also the refined edges.},

However, insufficient consideration of both inter- and intra-layer weights in existing research has limited the effectiveness of node identification methods. To address this gap, we propose a novel algorithm, coupling weighted intra-layer and inter-layer influence factors (CWIIIF), which accurately identifies nodes that exert significant influence in multilayer networks. The algorithm integrates weighted intra- and inter-layer influence factors, taking into account the unique properties of multilayer network structures. First, we define a set of layer weight influence parameters, including active nodes, active paths, and communication intersections between layers, to determine the weight of each network layer. We then calculate the intra-layer influence of each node using a combination of K-shell and betweenness centrality methods. Finally, we introduce a set of coupled equations that convert the intra-layer influence vectors into scalar values by incorporating the weights of each layer, producing a final influence score for each node. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conducted four comparative experiments across nine real-world and one synthetic multilayer networks. The results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms nine classical and state-of-the-art methods for identifying influential nodes.},

We utilized five ground-truth datasets, which were used to predict social ties, missing events, and potential links.We found: 1) the cognitive mechanism enables more accurate capture of the heterogeneity of the temporal effect, leading to an average precision improvement of 9% compared to baselines with competitive area under curve (AUC); 2) the local structure and synchronous agent behavior contribute differently to different types of datasets; and 3) appropriately increasing the time intervals, which may reduce the negative impact from noise when dividing time windows to calculate the behavioral synchrony of agents, is effective for link prediction tasks.},

However, GAN struggle with minority data that have few instances and lack accurate statistical characteristics. To mitigate this problem, a hierarchical oversampling based on Cohen’s criterion (HiOC) is proposed for extremely imbalanced data with missing information. The main idea of HiOC is to use Cohen’s criterion to design a primary rebalancing rate by considering data size, distribution, and feature information comprehensively. Then, HiOC including two stages to achieve the data balance. In the first stage, to enhance the data variety, especially for instances on the borderline as well as make a delicate imputation for missing information, a progressive oversampling method in the framework of fuzzy information decomposition (FID) is proposed. The progressive FID (PFID) introduces a small bias to expand the prediction region’s bounds and fulfills imputation step by step using newly sampled data. In the second stage, to greatly keep the original data distribution, an information granularity (IG) incorporated fuzzy c-means clustering strategy is developed. Afterward, a GAN based onMahalanobis distance performs over-sampling in each cluster to achieve ultimate data balance with unbiased evaluation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to several real datasets, demonstrating higher classification accuracy compared with existing algorithms, thus proving the applicability of the research results in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Crowd simulation plays a crucial role in the prevention and management of public safety events in cities. However, the inherent complexity and diverse nature of human behaviors present substantial challenges in developing realistic and precise simulation models. Traditional rule-based physical models are limited by their reliance on fixed physical formulas and parameters, which hinders their ability to effectively handle the complex tasks associated with crowd simulation. Although deep learning methods have emerged as a promising solution, existing approaches largely emphasize pedestrian trajectory generation while struggling with interpretability and real-time dynamic simulation requirements. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel data-driven crowd simulation framework that integrates physics-informed machine learning (PIML) with navigation potential fields. Our approach takes advantage of the strengths of both physical models and PIML. Specifically, we design an innovative physics-informed spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (PI-STGCN) as a data-driven module. Leveraging PI-STGCN, pedestrian movement trends can be accurately predicted in real-time during the simulation. Additionally, we construct a physical model of navigation potential fields based on flow field theory to guide pedestrian movements, thereby reinforcing physical constraints during the simulation. In our framework, navigation potential fields are dynamically computed and updated based on the movement trends predicted by the PI-STGCN, while the updated crowd dynamics, guided by these fields, subsequently feed back into the PI-STGCN. Comparative experiments on two publicly available large-scale real-world datasets across five scenes demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing rule-based methods in both accuracy and fidelity. The similarity between the simulated and actual pedestrian trajectories improves by 10.8%. Furthermore, our framework exhibits enhanced adaptability and superior interpretability compared with methods that rely solely on deep learning for trajectory generation.},

  abstract     = {Research indicates significant differences in the voice and facial expressions of individuals with depression compared to healthy individuals. Consequently, many studies have begun using audio-visual data for automatic depression detection (ADD). Despite significant progress, numerous challenges remain. During feature extraction, many studies fail to capture crucial spatiotemporal information for depression diagnosis, leading to decreased feature quality. In the modality fusion stage, many methods assume that the semantic information of different modalities is temporally aligned, which is not the case. To address the first challenge, this study proposes a linear spatiotemporal detector (LSTD) to model spatiotemporal information through detection and ensemble, enhancing feature quality. To tackle the second challenge, a cross-modal temporal aligner (CMTA) is proposed, using cross-modal attention for alignment before modality fusion to promote thorough fusion. LSTD and CMTA form the proposed spatiotemporal information modeling and modal alignment (SIMMA) framework. Extensive experiments on five depression datasets (AVEC2013, AVEC2014, AVEC2017, AVEC2019, and CMDep) demonstrate that our method outperforms previous studies in effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Information diffusion prediction plays a pivotal role in the analysis of information propagation across social networks. Many existing methods rely on learning social homophily solely from users’ social connections as a single diffusion dependency to drive information diffusion. Moreover, these approaches often capture temporal influence from cascades within discrete time intervals, which might be inadequate in describing complex diffusion processes and can limit prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach with augmented diffusion dependency and multigranularity temporal influence (ADDMT) for information diffusion prediction. Our method strategically leverages the interactive regularity implicit in historical diffusion cascades. This information is integrated with social homophily through a cross-graph convolution network (GCN) to augment the diffusion dependency among users. Furthermore, we introduce multiple overlapping sliding windows to partition diffusion cascades. Adjacent cascade slices exhibit 50% overlap, enhancing semantic and structural coherence. In addition, we employ the combination of hypergraph convolution networks (HGCNs) and temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to capture multigranularity temporal influence within cascades. This design enables our model to further discern evolutionary trends and ephemeral fluctuations in users’ preferences across time intervals. The experimental results, obtained from comprehensive evaluations on four realistic datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model. In particular, our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion prediction models, as evidenced by improved metrics such as Hits@K and MAP@K. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of ADDMT in predicting information diffusion in social networks.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to train a model using a minimal number of samples and subsequently apply this model to recognize unseen classes. Recently, metric-based methods mainly focus on exploring the relationship between the support set and the query set through attention mechanism in solving FSL problems. However, these methods typically employ unidirectional computation when calculating the attention relationship between support and query. This unidirectional approach not only limits the depth and breadth of knowledge acquisition but may also lead to mismatched patches between support and query, thereby affecting the overall performance of the model. In this article, we propose a bidirectional patch-aware attention network for few-shot learning (BPAN) to address this issue. First, we extract subimages via grid cropping and feed them into the learned feature extractor to obtain patch features. Moreover, self-attention is used to assign different weights to patch features and reconstruct them. Then, PFCAM is proposed to mutually explore the patch feature relationship between the support set and the support set, further reconstruct the patch features, and aggregate multiple patch features of each image into one feature through a learnable parameter matrix for the purpose of prediction. Finally, the template for each class is constructed to extend the results of PFCAM to the few-shot classification scenario. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that BPAN achieves superior performance.},

Seasonal trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) is employed to decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and remainder components by effectively capturing residual variations. VAR attention enhances prediction accuracy by focusing on specific crime types and prioritizing relevant information. The proposed approach is evaluated on publicly available crime datasets from New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles and three state-of-the-art evaluation measures: mean error (ME), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE). Our simulation results demonstrate the significance of the proposed method in enhancing crime prediction accuracy for the most critical crimes compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of social media, the barriers to sharing information have significantly decreased, leading to the rampant spread of rumors across various platforms. Current natural language processing (NLP) techniques use models trained on datasets to detect rumors. However, these datasets often contain inherent biases, which, as has been demonstrated in other NLP tasks, can negatively impact the accuracy of the results. This study confirms the presence of significant bias in rumor detection datasets. Given the intertwined and complex nature of bias and rumors, both of which play a crucial role in assessing the trustworthiness of online content, the article argues that improving detection models should not only focus on performance but also prioritize detecting biased rumors. Addressing this dual challenge is essential to prevent rumor creators from exploiting biases to enhance the spread of false information. To tackle this issue at the data level, this study proposes integrating bias attributes into the training datasets, thereby improving the ability of models to identify biased rumors. Through experiments conducted across multiple rumor detection models, the approach has been shown to enhance the detection of biased rumors in both Chinese and English datasets without compromising overall detection accuracy. This method might be helpful in reducing the spread of biased rumors online, contributing to a healthier information ecosystem.},

Furthermore, we analyze the structural properties and social balance of the social networks. Particularly, the layers in multiplex networks composed of positive behaviors has higher reciprocity than the layers composed of negative behaviors, the out-degree distributions of nodes in the layers composed of negative behaviors basically conform to the power-law distribution, and the small-world phenomenon is also common in virtual game.

The system is built upon a model grounded solely in basic individual behavioral dynamics and free from reliance on specific technical assumptions, ensuring broad generality. By incorporating bibliometric attributes such as article quality scores and temporal publication data, the system enables replication of journal behaviors and citation dynamics. A series of computational experiments are conducted on the system, revealing and analyzing various phenomena under different scenarios. Key findings include the identification of dynamic patterns such as stationarity, inertia, and polarization tendencies in journal performance over time. The experiments further demonstrate the robustness of journal dynamics against moderate external disturbances, such as self-citation behavior, and highlight a gradual weakening of volatility in journal citation indices. These findings are further explained through a semianalytical approach.

Ablation studies highlight the critical roles of attention mechanisms and multimodal integration, showcasing significant performance improvements over single-modality and simplified fusion approaches.

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, motion prediction is vital for anticipating the behaviors of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users, enabling the system to make accurate decisions and plan driving paths effectively. Current motion prediction models typically utilize an encoder–decoder architecture, and many methods focus on the decoder’s design because the decoder is directly responsible for generating future trajectories. However, this often leads to neglecting the encoder’s capability to represent input information, resulting in a failure to provide the decoder with accurate and semantic prior features, which impacts the overall prediction accuracy. Contrastive learning, as an effective approach for enhancing feature representation through cross-modal alignment, demonstrates strong generalization and reduced reliance on labeled data. Therefore, we propose a motion prediction network named DMotion that leverages contrastive learning to align trajectory features with numeric signals and textual descriptions, improving the model’s representational capacity and enriching contextual priors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to use textual descriptions as a modality to enhance motion prediction accuracy. We sparsify dense agent attribute labels, such as historical distance and angular variation, to enable these prior features learned by the model through contrastive learning. By investigating the impact of numeric and textual supervision signals on contrastive learning effectiveness, textual supervision achieves superior results compared with numeric signals, benefiting from richer input information and more robust extraction capabilities of the text model.We further apply the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method to fine-tune the text encoder, improving model performance and preventing catastrophic forgetting with only 0.1M additional trainable parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that DMotion shows competitive performance on the Waymo motion prediction and interaction prediction challenges. Additionally, the contrast learning module of DMotion does not introduce additional parameters or computational overhead during inference, maintaining the efficiency of the original encoder-decoder model.},

These contents have been proven effective in influencing people’s beliefs and behaviors, spanning from influencing political opinions to directly impacting public health, particularly during events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, it becomes crucial to take proactive measures to identify the misinformation spreaders to mitigate their impact and influence over society. Existing approaches primarily focus on identifying spreaders by analyzing features such as writing style, content, user profiles, and engagement statistics. However, since fake or deceiving content is frequently crafted to closely resemble authentic information, traditional techniques alone prove insufficient to effectively identify either fake content or its spreaders. In this context, this work introduces a deep-learning model tailored for detecting misinformation spreaders in social media. Our model not only incorporates content-based features but also integrates patterns of social interactions and information propagation structures. By considering the multifaceted nature of misinformation spread, our approach provides a more holistic and accurate means of identifying its spreaders. An experimental evaluation focusing on COVID-related data yielded promising results, demonstrating a significant performance improvement compared to other techniques in the literature.
