  abstract     = {Grasping task is one of the crucial objectives in activities of daily living. However, elderly human subjects are facing significant challenges when attempting to perform grasping task. In this regard, a hand exoskeleton with a proper force control strategy is necessary to improve the performance of assistive technology. In this article, a lightweight, size-adjustable, underactuated, and force-controllable two-fingered exoskeleton prototype is developed for grasping assistance. A novel radial basis function network-based indirect adaptive force controller for robust grasping assistance is proposed along with the prototype design. We have conducted real-time grasping experiments on six elderly human subjects to verify the feasibility of the developed exoskeleton with a novel grasping force control strategy. Furthermore, we have performed force trajectory tracking experiment to validate the efficacy of the proposed force control scheme. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed grasping force control strategy has been validated through a disturbance rejection experiment. Extensive simulation and experimental studies with the developed kinematic model and feasibility tests involving elderly human subjects show that the newly developed hand exoskeleton with the proposed robust intelligent control strategy is efficient for object-grasping tasks aimed at the assistance of elderly human subjects.},

  abstract     = {In evolutionary robotics (ER), the evolution of a robot’s morphology (i.e., physical structure) or controller (i.e., control algorithm or instruction sequence) often entails tackling an extensive number of tasks. The use of evolutionary multitasking (EMT) in ER, which optimizes multiple tasks simultaneously by reusing potentially useful knowledge across diverse tasks, could improve the performance of problem-solving to each task. However, existing EMT methods do not fully use intertask correlations, limiting knowledge sharing. In view of this, this study introduces a novel framework, termed adaptive group-based collaborative optimization, tailored for handling optimization problems involving a large number of tasks within the ER domain simultaneously. The proposed framework divides tasks into groups according to their similarity and then proceeds through two principal stages, namely, intergroup knowledge separation and intragroup knowledge reunion. During intergroup knowledge separation stage, an adaptive method for selecting crossover operators enables source tasks to share useful knowledge to the target task across groups. During intragroup knowledge reunion stage, an adaptive knowledge combination strategy facilitates the target task in assimilating knowledge from multiple sources intragroup. We validated the efficacy of the proposed framework in both planar manipulators and hexapod robot experiments. The results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., MME, MMKT) on several metrics (e.g., mean fitness and quality diversity metrics). The proposed method can effectively improve the effectiveness and diversity of solutions in solving ER problems with a large number of tasks (e.g., 5 000 or 10 000), and has broad potential in practical ER applications.},

The proposed method addresses challenges arising from limited scope, dynamic circumstances, and inaccurate decision data due to communication disruptions or interference in real-world scenarios. A comprehensive environmental map is generated using a grid-based mapping methodology, encompassing data related to obstacles, coverage, target occupancy, and communication conditions. Considering the constraints imposed by communication conditions, we develop the adaptive communication condition hierarchical distributed model predictive control framework. This framework incorporates a hierarchical communication strategy for multirobot target search. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, a series of comparative experiments are conducted on three distinct maps, each characterized by unique communication environments, obstacle layouts, and target distributions. These experiments employ four commonly used swarm intelligence algorithms. The research findings indicate that implementing the proposed search framework and communication strategy significantly reduces the time and communication costs associated with locating targets in complex and unfamiliar environments. This is particularly relevant for multirobot systems operating under diverse and limited communication conditions, substantially increasing the task’s success rate.},

  abstract     = {Graffiti detection is essential in historic building protection and urban neighborhood management. Graffiti detection has made significant progress in recent years based on the development of deep learning. However, small-scale graffiti, interference from the background, and the false detection of word parts in graffiti make it a challenging problem. This article proposes a Transformer-based high-precision graffiti detection method, namely DIG. Precisely, it consists of three modules: 1) Spatial query selection (SQS), scale-aware IoU loss (SIL); 2) Denoising Task with binary contrastive denoising (BCDN); and 3) IoU-guided box denoising (IBD) modules. To detect small-scale graffiti, this paper proposes SIL to help the loss function to perceive small-scale graffiti and large-scale graffiti fairly. To reduce the false detection of word parts, this article presents the SQS module, which integrates spatial information into the query selection process of the Encoder to filter out falsely detected bounding boxes within the graffiti. To reduce the interference from the background, this article introduces a denoising task with BCDN and IBD modules, improving the model’s ability to distinguish graffiti from the background and accurately select appropriate bounding boxes. A large number of experimental results on the STORM dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results with an AP50 of 87.9%. Moreover, DIG achieved competitive results on the FineFM dataset for mask detection. This indicates that DIG can also be conveniently transferred to detect other scenarios.},

This is called sensory connectivity maintenance. A function termed as coordination function with sensory connectivity maintenance (CFSCM) is defined to describe the performances of the coordination as well as the sensory connectivity status between the agents. Then, a general control strategy is designed based on the proposed CFSCM for spatial coordination of multiple nonholonomic agents with sensory connectivity maintenance. Moreover, the applications of the proposed control strategy for formation with omnidirectional sensors and flocking with directional sensors are shown, respectively.

Main objective of this research is to propose a novel neural network-based framework, enhanced by a metaheuristic approach, to achieve robust energy prediction in the context of mobile app development. The metaheuristic approach here aims to achieve two goals: 1) identifying suitable learning algorithms and their corresponding hyperparameters, and 2) determining the optimal number of layers and neurons within each layer. Moreover, due to limitations in accessing certain aspects of a mobile phone, there might be missing data in the data set, and the proposed framework can handle this. In addition, we conducted an optimal algorithm selection strategy, employing 13 base and advanced metaheuristic algorithms, to identify the best algorithm based on accuracy and resistance to missing values. The representation in our proposed metaheuristic algorithm is variable-size, meaning that the length of the candidate solutions changes over time. We compared the algorithms based on the architecture found by each algorithm at different levels of missing values, accuracy, F-measure, and stability analysis. Additionally, we conducted a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical comparison of the results. The extensive experiments show that our proposed approach significantly improves energy consumption prediction. Particularly, the JADE algorithm, a variant of differential evolution (DE), DE, and the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy deliver superior results under various conditions and across different missing value levels.},

This method enables autonomous decision-making and game equilibrium in group decision scenarios, considering individual preferences amidst constraints like incomplete information and alliance limitations. Leveraging the complementary entropy theorem on superiority, inferiority, and fuzzy measures, we propose a cognitive model for information interaction and attribute fusion. Utilizing the ordered weighted averaging operator and average tree solutions aids in identifying optimal alliance structures. We subsequently discuss evaluating missing information to complete the topological network. Updating the cognitive model and value function, we develop a Gaussian oscillation heuristic algorithm to explore alliance and component strategy spaces.

Specifically, to improve the model accuracy and control capabilities, we proposed a nonparallel distributed compensation-based controller approach, be precise, the system and controller adopts the distinct membership functions. Moreover, the stability analysis of IT3FSs in the state space form is studied newly in this article. Besides the primary membership function that exists for interval type-2 fuzzy systems (IT2FSs), the IT3FSs possess the secondary membership function to handle the overall uncertainty which enacts the superiority of the proposed work. Notably, the adequate stability criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Additionally, the convex relaxation technique is used to strengthen the design flexibility and achieve the faster convergence rate, which converts an optimization problem with a vector variable to a convex program with a matrix variable, via a lifting technique. A noteworthy aspect is that the application of the convex relaxation technique in the context of IT3FSs is proposed for the first time in literature. Finally, the comparative results between IT2FSs and IT3FSs are shown via two illustrative examples, including the inverted-pendulum model, to underscore the efficacy and practical implementations of the developed control methodology.},

In what follows, with the aid of the parallel distributed compensation fuzzy control scheme, the main results of stability analysis and controller synthesis for the closed-loop re-entrant manufacturing control system are derived using a timer-dependent Lyapunov functional with spatio–temporal auxiliary variables.

Then, the equivalent transformation of the reconstructed system is implemented by virtue of barrier functions. With the aid of the nonquadratic utility function, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of the NZS game is derived. After that, an adaptive critic scheme with experience replay is employed to acquire the Nash equilibrium solution. Furthermore, a novel dynamic self-triggered rule is proposed with the dead-zone operation, which not only significantly reduces source consumption but also overcomes the implementation difficulty of monitoring hardware in the event-triggered mechanism. Moreover, the stability of the system and the uniform ultimate boundedness of the critic weights are guaranteed.

The proposed adaptive barrier-function global PID-type control method is designed to handle both matched and unmatched uncertainties and adjust the control parameters in real time to account for changes in system dynamics and perturbations. It efficiently handles both matched and mismatched uncertainties, ensuring precise tracking performance even amid uncertain dynamics and disturbances. The methodology dynamically adjusts control parameters in real time to accommodate changes in system dynamics, enhancing adaptability and performance. The globality of the suggested controller ensures the absence of a reaching phase and establishes the presence of the sliding mode around the surface right from the beginning. The proposed method has also been expanded to address uncertain dynamic systems with both matched and unmatched disturbances, while accounting for actuator faults and input saturation. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulation studies and experimental results on a rotary inverted pendulum (RIP) system, showcasing rapid convergence and exceptional tracking capabilities in practical scenarios. The contributions of this research lie in presenting a novel methodology that significantly contributes to the field of nonlinear control systems, offering a robust framework capable of addressing uncertainties in complex nonlinear systems. The results show that the method achieves fast convergence and excellent tracking performance in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances.

  abstract     = {A secret sharing scheme is an important cryptographic procedure that enables the secure distribution of secret information, such as private images, in an untrusted network. However, in all secret sharing schemes, the sizes of the shares increase in proportion to the size of the secret information, because they involve computationally expensive polynomials of degree n-1 (n is total number of shares) and increasingly large modulus of modulo operations for security. Moreover, with large share sizes, it is not easy in practice to encrypt them quickly using block cipher algorithms. Therefore, ensuring the security of secret sharing for large-scale visual data with a reasonable share length and efficiently encrypting n shares properly represents formidable challenges. To overcome these challenges in secret sharing schemes, we propose new multiparty random phase wrapping secret sharing systems for visual datasets. Computational optical imaging enables the acquisition of wrapped phase information, ranging from –π to π, to be expressed in the form of a complex sinusoidal waveform. The proposed scheme allows for large-scale secret data—such as confidential digital images and visual data, including optical images—to be securely and efficiently shared and distributed to multiple parties or agencies utilizing a digital representation of a complex sinusoidal waveform of the secret information. The proposed scheme can be useful in cryptographic key escrow systems and in use with large-scale secret data.},

Above all, a mathematic model of fractional networks with signed topology and heterogeneous nodes’ dynamics is introduced, in which the topological graph possesses both negative and positive edges to illustrate the competition and cooperation between individuals, and the desired synchronized state is an arbitrarily specified smooth orbit and not necessarily the decoupled state. Additionally, two innovative control schemes with logarithmic quantizer are developed, and several conditions are obtained to reach bipartite complete synchronization of fractional heterogeneous networks just by virtue of the Laplacian matrix of the original signed graph rather than the traditional technique of gauge transformation. The theoretical analysis is eventually confirmed by several numerical results.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the challenge of state observer design for sliding mode security control in Markov jump cyber–physical systems subjected to stochastic injection attacks. To enhance network efficiency, a dynamic event-triggered algorithm is introduced in the communication channel. First, the design begins with a Luenberger state observer featuring an adaptive compensator. This configuration aims to effectively counteract malicious attacks. Second, an integral sliding hyperplane is formulated within the estimation space, which serves as the foundation for deriving the sliding mode dynamics, ensuring robustness against disturbances. Recognizing the diversity of transition rates (TRs), an elastic sliding mode controller is designed to accommodate three distinct types of TRs, which is also strategically designed to guarantee reachability and maintain sliding motion. Third, stochastic stability with an H∞ attenuation level is conducted separately for each type of TR. Correspondingly, the development of an algorithm for determining threshold parameters in triggered conditions is presented. Simultaneously, a proof of the nonexistence of Zeno behavior is provided, ensuring the stability and efficiency of the proposed system. Finally, a simulation study using a practical model is included to empirically demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in a real-world context.},

Given a plant, attackers work as a group in the framework of a coordinated distributed architecture and have the ability to edit some sensor readings to conceal the faults to confuse the operator. Furthermore, attackers necessarily remain furtive, i.e., their presence should not be discovered by the operator. In order to describe the set of all possible furtive attacks, a joint furtive diagnoser is established. We prove that an LPN under the above attacks is diagnosable if and only if its joint furtive diagnoser does not have the cycles composed of pairs of either faulty states and normal states, or faulty states and uncertain states. A new labeling function is proposed to enforce a plant to be diagnosable against as many attacks as possible. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method.},

The proposed model is able to effectively eliminate the hysteresis error and suppress the influence of noises. Specifically, the proposed model is capable of implementation in a distributed manner, which extends its scope of applications. Then, theoretical analyses are provided to prove the global convergence in both noise-free and noisy conditions.

In order to ensure the convergence of the boundary position error at a predetermined rate, the control approach incorporates a performance function to attain the necessary transient performance.

Taking the bandwidth-limited situation into account, the model of bit-rate constraints and the encoding-decoding strategy are employed to reflect the principles of resource allocation and data schedule. Moreover, two Bernoulli sequences are adopted to depict the topologies switched stochastically and the deception attacks occurred randomly. A novel optimized SEBRCs method for NCDNs is proposed such that, for both stochastic topological structures and deception attacks, the covariance upper bound of estimation error can be derived and the estimator parameter can be determined accordingly. It is worth mentioning that both the related effects caused by attack probability and bit-rate constraints onto estimation performance are clarified from the monotonicity analysis perspectives, where new analysis method is given. Besides, a sufficient criterion is given to guarantee the uniform mean-square boundedness of the obtained covariance upper bound.

Nevertheless, the conventional obtained QIP estimates are numerically unstable, especially when the error samples contain outliers, resulting in the optimal solution of the MEE criterion deviating from the target vector to a certain extent. To address this problem, we introduce the M-estimate method from robust statistics into the QIP estimation process; thus, a robust estimation method called instantaneous M-estimate QIP (IM-QIP) is proposed, and several important properties of IM-QIP are presented. The proposed IM-QIP estimates could be implemented simply while ensuring great robustness. Naturally, we further propose the corresponding instantaneous M-estimate MEE (IM-MEE) criterion and apply it to adaptive filtering. A robust recursive adaptive filtering algorithm, called the recursive IM-MEE (RIM-MEE) algorithm, is proposed and analyzed in this article, along with its stability and theoretical steady-state performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RIM-MEE algorithm achieves a smaller theoretical bound compared to the traditional MEE algorithm under heavy-tailed and skewed noise conditions.

  abstract     = {Federated Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) has received considerable attention due to the increasing need for privacy-conscious data analysis across diverse domains and sources in many real-world applications. Recent developments in federated FCM, however, are still in their infancy and largely unexplored. These methods struggle to handle nonindependent and identically distributed (non-iid) data. Moreover, critical hyperparameters, such as the number of iterations for local updates, are typically set manually, which can significantly affect the performance of federated clustering. To address these challenges, we introduce an Adaptive Federated FCM with an auxiliary model, named AF-FCM. In this approach, prior information from the auxiliary model, along with a proximal term in the local objective, mitigates the effects of the non-iid environment, enhancing both model robustness and effectiveness. Critical hyperparameters are adaptively adjusted using a proposed adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm, guided by a carefully designed fitness function. Within APSO, a nonlinear regression function adjusts the inertia weight, reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. In AF-FCM, global prototypes are refined using momentum gradient descent (MGD). Numerical experiments highlight the effectiveness and generalization performance of AF-FCM across various conditions, including heterogeneity variations, the number of clients, and the number of clusters. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art federated clustering baseline methods validates the competitive performance of AF-FCM.},

To address this issue, we investigate a privacy protection scheme based on multifeature fusion tensor (PPS-MFFT). Different from previous studies using a single feature or simple combination of several features, for every face image, PPS-MFFT first constructs a multifeature fusion tensor through hierarchically exploiting the correlations and complementarity between deep-learning features and those handcrafted features for stronger robustness and transferability. Further, on the basis of such tensors, the target images are reasonably chosen to enhance the camouflage effects while maintaining the visual similarities for final perturbed images, which are generated by means of developing a new optimization model for better tradeoff between effectiveness and practicability. Finally, the measurement results validate that both higher protective efficacy (e.g., 16% more in misidentifying the original face images) and acceptable visual effects can be obtained by PPS-MFFT when compared to the existing methods, and thus demonstrate the generality and applicability of our scheme.},

First, piecewise FD observer with adaptive saturation of output errors is designed to mitigate the effect of outliers on the residual signals, such that false alarms are avoided through the established FD scheme. Then, based on the presented piecewise FD observer, a new ET design scheme that depends on the different regions where the states of the PWL system and piecewise FD observer are located is proposed, and an ET FD method is studied through the ET mechanisms. Unlike the existing results, the established FD scheme can effectively avoid false alarm caused by outliers, and the piecewise FD observer is designed separately from the new ET mechanisms, while co-design is necessary in the existing results. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented scheme is demonstrated by simulation examples.},

To manage computational complexity, the size of the mixed-integer problem is reduced through an exact clustering of items, sectors, and layouts.

By leveraging eigendecomposition and matrix splitting methods, explicit solutions for optimal attacks are derived by solving two distinct optimization problems. To illustrate the superiority of such attack behaviors, we further investigate OLS attacks with colored noises and historical innovations, where the leverage of historical data is maximized to enhance attack performances.

A Newton-based continuous-time algorithm is first designed for general constrained optimization, which is adapted to handle inequality constraints by using log-barrier penalty functions. Then, a general class of EZGS dynamics is developed to address equation-constrained distributed optimization, where an auxiliary dynamics is introduced to ensure the final ZGS property from any initialization. It is demonstrated that for typical consensus protocols and auxiliary dynamics, the proposed EZGS dynamics can achieve the performance with exponential/finite/fixed/prescribed-time (PT) convergence. Particularly, the nonlinear consensus protocols for finite-time EZGS algorithms allow for heterogeneous power coefficients. Significantly, the proposed PT EZGS dynamics is continuous, uniformly bounded, and capable of reaching the optimal solution in a single stage. Furthermore, the barrier method is employed to handle the inequality constraints effectively. Finally, the efficiency and performance of the proposed algorithms are validated through numerical examples, highlighting their superiority over existing methods. In particular, by selecting appropriate protocols, the proposed EZGS dynamics can achieve desired convergence performance.},

The fuzzy dominance rough sets (FDRS) model is an important knowledge acquisition tool for ordinal classification tasks. However, it has been proved in practice that this model usually performs poorly fault tolerance, and only one noisy sample can cause huge interference in acquiring knowledge. Attribute reduction is one of the nontrivial applications of the FDRS. At present, most attribute reduction methods for ordinal classification tasks mainly focus on the dependence of decision to attributes, while ignoring the information provided by the separability of classes and the correlation of attributes for ordinal classification. In view of these two issues, this article first proposes a robust FDRS model with filterable noise samples. Then, the class-separability and attribute-correlation are explored in robust fuzzy dominance rough approximation space, and corresponding attribute evaluation index is designed. Finally, an attribute reduction algorithm is designed to select the attribute subset with the highest classification performance.

It should be noticed that a new framework comprising a special PDT switching strategy is proposed for distributed DoS attacks with energy limitation. Accordingly, the controlled system is converted into a complex and constrained PDT-switched system. Subsequently, based on weak multi-Lyapunov functions, membership-function-dependent sufficient criteria are offered for judging the globally uniformly exponential stability of the researched closed-loop system, from which the gains of the observer and the controller can be computed. Finally, an algorithm generating PDT switching sequences for distributed DoS attacks is proposed, and simulations are given to substantiate the usability of the developed approach.},

Due to the effects of DoS attacks, such controlled CDSs can be viewed as a switched system with two modes: a stable mode during dormant intervals and an unstable one during attack intervals. Because of the switching character of the CDS with DoS attacks, some well-known data-driven control methods can not be used directly. To tackle this issue, a new relationship between the dormancy and activation periods of DoS attacks is built, which offers a more reasonable description of DoS attacks. Additionally, in the presence of measurement noise, a novel lemma (Lemma 3) is introduced to establish a data-based representation of CDSs using noisy measurement data. Without the need of explicit system parameter identification, stabilization criteria and control gain matrix are derived solely based on the input-state data. Finally, the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed method are illustrated through a numerical example and a power system.},

However, traditional GNNs are primarily designed based on the homophily assumption, which means that they show poor performance on heterophilic networks where dissimilar nodes prefer to connect. To address this issue, several heterophilic GNNs have been proposed that employ techniques, such as extending local neighbors and improving GNN architectures. From another perspective, recent studies have shown that, unlike homophilic GNNs, heterophilic GNNs exhibit higher robustness against graph adversarial attacks. In these attacks, the attackers try to inject small perturbations into the graph. Therefore, in this study, we delve into the core designs of heterophilic GNNs, including high-order neighbor, potential neighbor, ego-neighbor separation, and interlayer combination designs. We further analyze the influence of these key designs on the robustness of GNNs. We conducted comprehensive experiments to compare the impact of different designs on baseline and real-world GNN models. The findings of this work can serve as a reference for future studies aiming to design more robust and universal GNNs.},

By developing backstepping, an event-triggered switched NN observer, event-triggered adaptive NN controllers of subsystems and three novel switching dynamic event-triggering mechanisms (ETMs) are constructed. Multiple event-triggering communications from sensor to controller and observer to controller and controller to actuator are thus achieved under arbitrary switchings. Naturally, more communication burdens can be reduced compared with those existing single or dual event-triggering communications methods for non-switched and switched systems. Note that one difficulty caused by dual asynchronous switchings among candidate subsystems and candidate controllers and candidate observers is overcome. Also, other difficulties caused by finding an adjustable positive lower bound of interexecution times for each ETM and the errors between continuous-time and sampled-data-based basis function vectors of NNs are overcome.

  abstract     = {In this article, a predefined-time event-triggered attitude consensus control problem is investigated for multiple spacecraft with time-varying state constraints. A backstepping-based control scheme for achieving a consensus in spacecraft attitudes within a predefined time is presented. To enhance the efficiency of communication resource utilization, an event-triggering mechanism is designed by employing a saturation function. This mechanism allows for the application of three existing triggering strategies in multiple spacecraft systems. Then, a novel asymmetric fractional barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) guarantees adherence to time-varying constraints while addressing the issue of excessive control amplitude associated with large constraint boundaries in conventional logarithmic BLFs (LBLFs). This enables the proposed approach to handle both constrained and unconstrained scenarios. The efficacy of the proposed control strategy is illustrated through numerical simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Open multiagent systems (OMASs) feature a dynamic structure with agents continuously joining or leaving, resulting in shifting Nash equilibria and frequent disruptions of equality constraints. This inherent instability poses a significant challenge to traditional incremental-consensus-based distributed optimization or game methods, which rely on a stable and consistent agent population to compute and maintain equilibrium solutions effectively. The necessity for these methods to continuously enforce constraints and the time-intensive process of recalculating equilibria in response to agent dynamics present a substantial bottleneck in the optimization of OMASs. To address this challenge, we develop an innovative incremental consensus-based distributed (ICBD) algorithm to achieve the dynamic Nash equilibrium (NE) for constrained noncooperative game of OMASs. The ICBD algorithm leverages predefined-time stability and integral sliding-mode control to enable rapid recalibration to new equilibria and maintain constraints without the need for prolonged recalculations. Finally, several numerical simulations validate our approach to demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {It remains a challenge to improve the accuracy of impedance rendering while ensuring stability under strong impacts during human–robot interaction. In this work, we aim to render the desired impedance for the flexible joint under an admittance control scheme with prescribed performance function (PPF). Specially, Gaussian kernels are introduced as the slack terms for PPF, so that the control stability can be maintained in the presence of abrupt external torques. Meanwhile, a narrower error envelope is yielded when such torques are absent, which also improves the fidelity of the desired impedance model. To achieve the prescribed tracking performance of the inner position loop, a two-stage backstepping control is proposed by defining two first-order composite error surfaces bridged by a second-order dynamic surface. This promulgates the minimum number of backstepping stages under the available state feedback, thus avoiding “explosion of terms.” In addition, dual-adaptive neural networks are incorporated into the backstepping control to compensate for the matched and unmatched disturbances. Real-time experiments are conducted to validate the appeal of the proposed method.},

Although there has been a growing interest in multiobjective problems with complex constraints, such as the vehicle routing problem with time windows, existing multiobjective evolutionary optimization techniques still face significant challenges, particularly when addressing the fragmented and narrow feasible regions that arise from these constraints. Our research introduces a refined framework tailored for complex constrained multiobjective evolutionary optimization. The methodology conducts an initial strong-weak analysis to categorize constraints and merges each strong constraint with all weak constraints to form subsets. Each subset, combined with the original objective functions, defines a subproblem. Independent optimization of the original problem and subproblems is carried out by utilizing multiple populations. Information acquired from the subproblems’ populations is transferred into the population of the original issue, thereby expediting the detection of the feasible region and simplifying the resolution of the original problem. The efficacy of our innovative algorithm, when benchmarked against traditional constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms across 72 test functions, has demonstrated superior convergence, diversity, and competitiveness.},

Initially, a coupled performance index function associated with consensus errors is constructed. As the positive-definite function with the quadratic form is allocated to the constructed consensus errors-based performance index function, the original system stabilization problem is converted into the issue of seeking an optimal control strategy profile for the leader and followers. Under the hierarchical Stackelberg–Nash differential game framework, the optimal control strategies are derived in sequence and further proved to compose the equilibrium points of Stackelberg–Nash differential games. Afterward, based on the ADP technique, a modified single-critic neural network (NN) is implemented and the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is approximately identified. Under the proposed control scheme, the leader–follower consensus of the considered MAS can be achieved while consuming less control cost. Meanwhile, all signals of the MAS are ensured to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a numerical simulation and an application to the electrode regulating system of the three-phase electric arc furnace are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

However, the massive kernels, deep fusion, and heterogeneous ensemble mechanisms, which are the core of the three frameworks, respectively, lead to overfitting risks. Therefore, in this article, a novel convolution-based TSC algorithm multichannel-based multiview shallow fusion (MC-MSF) within a new shallow fusion ensemble-based MCF is proposed. MC-MSF enhances feature diversity, quality, and classifier diversity while suppressing the overfitting risks via three shallow components. For feature diversity, the original series is mapped to the connected multichannel series spaces, and then diverse pooling features are extracted via a single-layer convolution with fewer kernels. For feature quality, the power of proportion of positive values (PPPV) features with adaptive powers are extracted based on alternating gradient descent, and the multiview shallow feature fusion is implemented to generate fused features. For classifier diversity, diverse linear classifiers are trained on the combined multiview feature vectors to ensemble homogeneously. The state-of-the-art TSC accuracy is achieved by MC-MSF via the sequential operation of three effective shallow components, as verified by comparative experiments on the public UCR and real excavator fault diagnosis application datasets.},

The effectiveness and superior performance of CMB-MPC are demonstrated by experiments and comparisons, and the results indicate that CMB-MPC imparts three distinct advantages.

Second, it achieves a remarkable enhancement in register accuracy within R2R printing systems, surpassing the capabilities of conventional MPC and fully decoupled proportional-differential control methods.

By the cooperativity theory and Lyapunov stability theory, it is established that the distributed interval observer can not only access some information about MASs at any instant, that is, the upper and lower bounds of each component of the agent state, but also realize the cooperative behavior of MASs under some essential conditions involving network synchronization and the unstable eigenvalue of the system matrix.

The traditional contrastive learning-based sequential recommendation algorithms generate augmentations of original item sequences by utilizing crop, mask and reorder operations. However, those augmentation schemes destroy the underlying semantics of item sequences, resulting in difficulty in accurately defining positive and negative samples. To address this issue, we propose a contrastive translation based sequential recommendation algorithm, namely, CT4Rec. Specifically, CT4Rec generates augmented views of item sequences by injecting noises into embeddings of users and items, which is able to guarantee that the underlying semantics of augmented views are consistent with those of original item sequence. Hence, CT4Rec is able to effectively learn the invariances among the augmented views. In addition, the personalized translation operations are utilized to model the third-order relationships among entities. Moreover, it is difficult for contrastive learning-based recommendation algorithms with static temperature to simultaneously capture the differences among individual users/items and among the clusters of users/items. Hence, we utilize a dynamic temperature strategy to enhance CT4Rec, which endows CT4Rec with the capabilities of group-wise discrimination and instance discrimination. Our validation on five benchmark datasets shows that CT4Rec outperforms SOTA sequential recommendation methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/zar123123/CT4Rec.},

The above two-step process of expansion and testing is developed here using the best-first search (BFS) on an OR-tree, where the nodes denote trial solutions (new creations) and edges represent parent-child connectivity satisfying the rules of the given problem domain. Two alternative extensions of BFS are examined in view of the cost function employed at the nodes to ultimately determine the optimal node in the search tree within a user-defined depth as the solution to the creativity problem. The first algorithm considers maximizing the diversity cost earned by a node with respect to its parent, while the second considers maximizing the difference between the diversity and the penalty cost earned by a node with respect to the root node. The significant contribution of the present research lies in ensuring diversity of the solutions during iterative expansions of the tree as well as the novelty of the optimal solution (best node) across runs of the same program. The relative performances of the two algorithms are compared in the context of their applicability. Performance analysis undertaken reveals that the proposed algorithms outperform their competitors with respect to three important metrics.

Therefore, this article proposes a collaborative control framework of human–machine game in lateral and longitudinal dimensions considering dynamic allocation of driving authority to improve the collaborative performance of co-driving. First, a human–machine collaborative driving system model that adapts to the characteristics of co-driving mode is built as the basis of the shared control scheme. Then, the unconscious competitive relationship of human–machine is described as the game interaction relationship, with optimal control strategies for both sides being deduced theoretically at the game equilibrium. Additionally, a dynamic adjustment strategy of driving authority considering the longitudinal speed is established based on the assessment of lateral and longitudinal risks. Finally, the driver-in-the-loop test and co-simulation results show that the proposed control strategy has achieved good performance in terms of path tracking, driver’s driving burden, and vehicle stability.},

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) is a novel problem-solving paradigm to facilitate collaboration. Group multirole assignment (GMRA), an extension of group role assignment (GRA), is a critical step in the RBC process, enabling the formation of efficient collaborative teams by reasonably assigning roles to agents. Recognized as a significant determinant impacting assignment and collaboration, conflict has been delineated and incorporated into GMRA. Nevertheless, the specified conflict is characterized as an oppositional conflict (OC), signifying that conflicting agents are engaged in conflict across the entirety of the role set. Rather than completely OC, which is highly specific, a more prevalent relationship involves conflict in certain aspects while remaining conflict-free in others. Therefore, we propose the concept of general conflict (GC) to describe the more common and realistic conflict relationship, offering a broader and novel perspective to depict conflict relationships. Then, we formalize these two problems by considering GC avoidance in GRA and GMRA, called GRA with GC (GRAGC) and GMRA with GC (GMRAGC), respectively. Furthermore, we establish the necessary conditions for the GRAGC and GMRAGC problems through a graph-theoretical lens, accompanied by a thorough analysis of their mathematical nature. Additionally, we propose practical solutions and refine methodologies to address both problems. The effectiveness of the improved algorithms utilizing necessary conditions is verified by simulations, which also provides evidence supporting the advantages of conflict avoidance.},

  abstract     = {Cyber attacks and disturbances greatly impair the performance of formation tasks in multiagent systems (MASs). To achieve robust formation control against these challenges, this article proposes a generative adversarial learning framework that is theoretically transparent and practically applicable. Rather than relying on an end-to-end deep neural networks (DNNs) architecture, our work leverage a double robust structure that combine the representation capabilities of DNNs with established, theoretically grounded linear control theory, ultimately achieving a practical, learning-based robust formation for MASs. Initially, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are used to linearize agent dynamics under false data injection (FDI) attacks and external disturbances. Subsequently, a proportional-integral (PI) protocol is employed to achieve overall robust formation. We present rigorous theoretical analyses of both stages, demonstrating the guaranteed convergence of GANs training and the closed-loop formation errors. Our approach is directly validated through a series of physical experiments involving multi-quadrotors, demonstrating robustness against attacks and disturbances during formation flights, without the sim-to-real gap commonly encountered in learning-based control frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Crowd management plays a crucial role in improving travel efficiency and reducing potential risks caused by overcrowding in large public places. Crowd control at entrances is a common way in our daily life to avoid overcrowding, but nowadays the control of crowd inflow at the entrances of public places mainly relies on manual operation. In this article, we intend to propose a dynamic crowd inflow control system (DRIFT) to avoid risks of overcrowding and improve the throughput of public places. First, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes throughput by adjusting the crowd inflow rate of each entrance in the public place. Through mathematical analysis and related proofs, we introduce a baseline for the aforementioned problem that can calculate the upper bound of static inflow rate. With this baseline, we can easily measure the performance of other dynamic inflow control algorithms. Second, we treat the proposed optimization problem as a real-time decision-making problem, and further propose the DRIFT system based on deep reinforcement learning to address it. Specifically, the strategy of DRIFT is a basic actor–critic framework adapting a shared long short term memory (LSTM) layer to extract scene feature information. Third, we train it through proximal policy optimization (PPO) to improve learning performance. The environment for experiments is a crowd simulation model of OpenAI Gym structure based on real scene data from the 1F floor of the Chengdudong Railway Station and Xizhimen Railway Station. In comparison experiments and ablation experiments, the strategy of our DRIFT outperforms all other comparison strategies, including the most recent strategy using reinforcement learning, in term of system crowd throughput and robustness.},

  abstract     = {In the context of distribution inconsistent data classification, addressing distribution shift is crucial, typically accomplished through domain adaptation (DA) techniques. Once distributions are aligned between the source and target domains, the problem transforms into a conventional recognition task. This article introduces a new method called multitarget DA based on Evidence Theory (MET). For a given target domain, a random merger with other target domains is performed, generating distinct new target domains. Domain-invariant features corresponding to each new target domain are learned by minimizing distribution discrepancies separately between the source and different new target domains. The merging of target domains alters the distribution of the new target domain, leading to variations in the retained information within the learned domain-invariant features. For a query pattern in this target domain, multiple soft classification results (CCR) are obtained after aligning the distributions of the source and different new target domains. These soft CCR complement each other, and evidence theory is employed as a tool to represent and combine uncertain information, fusing these results. The weights for this fusion are automatically learned by minimizing the mean squared error between the combined results and the ground truth on labeled source domain data. The final class decision is determined through the weighted evidential combination of multiple pieces of soft CCR. MET is assessed on several datasets (i.e., Office+Caltech-10, VLSC, and V-RSIR) and compared to various advanced DA methods (e.g., GNN, MT, PAL, PTD, and so on) to validate its effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that MET usually can obtain a higher classification performance (i.e., the accuracy can be improved by 2% compared to many methods in most cases).},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is a promising paradigm inspired by transfer learning to solve the cold-start problem in recommender systems. Existing state-of-the-art CDR methods train an explicit mapping function to transfer the cold-start users from a data-rich source domain to a target domain. However, a limitation of these methods is that the mapping function is trained on overlapping users across domains, while only a small number of overlapping users are available for training. By visualizing the loss landscape of the existing CDR model, we find that training on a small number of overlapping users causes the model to converge to sharp minima, leading to poor generalization. Based on this observation, we leverage loss-geometry-based machine learning approach and propose a novel CDR method called sharpness-aware CDR (SCDR). Our proposed method simultaneously optimizes recommendation loss and loss sharpness, leading to better generalization with theoretical guarantees. Empirical studies on real-world datasets show that SCDR significantly outperforms other CDR models on cold-start recommendation tasks. Additionally, our method enhances the model’s robustness to adversarial attacks.},
