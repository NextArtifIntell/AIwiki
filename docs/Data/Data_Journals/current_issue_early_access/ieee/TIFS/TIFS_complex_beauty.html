  abstract     = {Deep learning has emerged as a promising technology for achieving Android malware detection. To further unleash its detection potentials, software visualization can be integrated for analyzing the details of app behaviors clearly. However, facing increasingly sophisticated malware, existing visualization-based methods, analyzing from one or randomly-selected few views, can only detect limited attack types. We propose and implement LensDroid, a novel technique that detects Android malware by visualizing app behaviors from multiple complementary views. Our goal is to harness the power of combining deep learning and software visualization to automatically capture and aggregate high-level features that are not inherently linked, thereby revealing hidden maliciousness of Android app behaviors. To thoroughly comprehend the details of apps, we visualize app behaviors from three related but distinct views of behavioral sensitivities, operational contexts and supported environments. We then extract high-order semantics based on the views accordingly. To exploit semantic complementarity of the views, we design a deep neural network based model for fusing the visualized features from local to global based on their contributions to downstream tasks. A comprehensive comparison with six baseline techniques is performed on datasets of more than 51K apps in three real-world typical scenarios, including overall threats, app evolution and zero-day malware. The experimental results show that the overall effectiveness of LensDroid is better than the baseline techniques. We also validate the complementarity of the views and demonstrate that the multi-view fusion in LensDroid enhances Android malware detection.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread use of machine learning (ML), privacy concerns during neural network inference are attracting growing attention. Secure two-party neural network (2PC-NN) inference is the privacy-preserving inference method, which allows client to obtain the inference result without disclosing client’s input to the server. The server’s model parameters are also confidential to the client. However, current 2PC-NN inference schemes still have large overhead, especially for non-linear functions. In this paper, we present Swift, a fast secure 2PC-NN inference scheme based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and secret sharing (SS). FHE protects the input and model parameters in linear functions, while SS is integrated to protect the non-linear functions. Concretely, Swift integrates FHE and SS to design secure and efficient non-linear protocols used for ReLU and max pooling. To further optimize performance, Swift employs FHE with computation-friendly coefficient encoding for fast execution of linear functions, and SIMD encoding for non-linear functions. Swift constructs efficient encoding conversion protocol between the coefficient-encoded ciphertext and the SIMD-encoded ciphertext. Finally, Swift achieves secure neural network inference framework for MNIST dataset. Compared with Cheetah (USENIX 2022), the execution time of ReLU, max pooling, secure inference under a WAN setting improves 7.4×, 13.3×, 1.9×, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In high-stakes process industries, the Basic Process Control System (BPCS) relies on conventional control to enhance productivity, while the Safety Instrumented System (SIS) uses safety functions to maintain safety. Compared to the BPCS, attackers targeting the SIS can modify safety function activation conditions to trigger them prematurely or to evade the activation of the safety function. While various attack detection methods focus on the BPCS, they often overlook the SIS. This can lead to undetected safety breaches, significantly increasing the risk of catastrophic fault. Recent methods face three key limitations that hinder their practical application to SIS. First, both attackers and engineers can exploit the hot update mechanism of SIS to add or modify control logic. However, current methods lack verification for the newly added or modified logic. Second, current methods are unable to assess the rationality of dangerous value ranges. Third, these methods struggle to distinguish between faults and attacks, making it difficult to determine the appropriate time to activate the SIS’s safety function. To overcome these limitations, we propose SecureSIS, a method for securing SIS safety functions by leveraging the safety attributes of the SIS and incorporating information from the BPCS. The core of SecureSIS includes: 1) using the safety attributes of the SIS to verify automatically extracted candidate control logic detection rules; 2) utilizing information from the BPCS to verify automatically extracted candidate value range detection rules; and 3) distinguishing between safety function attacks and industrial process faults with validated rules and integration of process data from BPCS. Our scheme was evaluated using a Tricon SIS controller deployed on a gas pipeline network platform. The results indicate that SecureSIS achieved 97.3% accuracy in detecting data injection attacks and a detection accuracy of 96.0% for control logic modification attacks. Compared with the other representative detection approaches, our scheme has better detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Due to the powerful feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs), deep image hashing has extensive applications in the fields such as image authentication, copy detection and content retrieval, making its security a critical concern. Among various security metrics, collision resistance serves as a crucial indicator of deep image hashing methods. Research on collision attacks not only reveals the potential vulnerabilities of deep image hashing but also can promote the development of more robust and secure hashing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel generative collision attack scheme, which achieves several advantages over existing attack schemes based on adversarial examples. Our scheme requires no additional perturbations added to the image, and can simultaneously generate multiple hash collision images of different classes specified by the attacker. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative collision attack scheme effective across various deep image hashing methods. Specifically, our attack framework consists of three parts, i.e., a Hash-to-Noise Network (HTNN), a pretrained BigGAN generator and a conditional discriminator. The designed HTNN embeds the hash code of the target image and the attacker-specified generation class information into a “noise” vector. By optimizing various hash distance loss functions between the generated and target images, this “noise” guides the generator to directly generate images that meet the collision requirement. At the same time, the discriminator ensures that the generated images are visually realistic. Extensive experimental results verify that our scheme can effectively generate multiple high-quality images with attacker-specified classes, achieving the high success rate of hash collision attack and the applicability across state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.},

As most current works focus on privacy during the training and inference tasks in machine learning, implementing privacy preservation in preprocessing is a powerful complement. In this paper, we present an efficient and privacy-preserving feature selection protocol based on secure multiparty computation (MPC). We customize a novel method called approximate fixed-point representation to reduce the bitwidth of the sample distribution probability, thereby decreasing communication overhead. We optimize the comparison protocol by reducing the high-order bits of values according to the characteristics of the datasets and design the feature score calculation protocol together with several other MPC-based sub-protocols. We also construct an efficient feature selection workflow to obtain the reduced feature matrix, which avoids the numerous calls of secure comparison and equality test protocols in loops. Experiments on several real-world datasets show that the improved comparison protocol achieves a 29%-53% improvement in runtime and a 6%-32% reduction in communication compared to the general comparison protocol. The optimized feature selection workflow exhibits an upper performance bound, achieving a 38% improvement in runtime compared to prior work. Besides, we implement secure logistic regression training based on the selection features, where the accuracy has improved by an average of 8% compared to training on raw features.},

Hence, anomalous communication behaviors may often indicate cyber attacks taking place in these systems. As a result, identifying anomalous communication links can help us to activate appropriate response mechanisms to ensure the integrity and security of such networked systems. In this study, we propose an approach to detect anomalous communication links in dynamically evolving networked systems. Furthermore, we employ the External Direct Sum of Vector Spaces (EDSoVS) to enable edge/dyad representation learning from node representations. We then use the dyad representations as features to train an SVM model and detect future anomalous links. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic dataset representing a real-world communication network provided by the MITRE Corporation and twelve real-world datasets provided by Cisco. Our empirical results show that the accuracy rates of the proposed model vary between 70.54% to 95.79%, while the F1 score is between 78.22% and 95.97%. We compare our approach against four techniques involving neural networks and graph neural networks.

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a spurt progress in steganography, which poses challenges for steganalysis. However, previous steganalysis methods attach equal attention to various feature information, while key feature information in detection is ubiquitously ignored, and the detection time-space cost is burdened consequently. To alleviate this predicament, this paper proposes an enhanced image steganalysis via opposition-based evolutionary algorithm (EIS-OBEA), which can guide steganalysis showing more solicitude for key feature information and reduce detection time overhead. Specifically, evolutionary algorithm is introduced into enhanced steganalysis. To elevate searching ability for steganalysis key feature submodels, Tent map is applied in enhanced steganalysis population initialization because of its great randomness. Secondly, considering that opposition-based learning can dynamically adjust searching space of enhanced steganalysis population, opposition-based learning via lens imaging strategy is proposed to help enhanced steganalysis escape from local optimal solutions. Then, to reasonably evaluate the detection contribution of steganalysis key feature submodels, the pearson correlation coefficient for steganalysis is designed. On this basis, fitness function is devised to select superior individuals and obtain steganalysis key feature submodels after iteration. It is noted that EIS-OBEA can optimize steganalysis training samples into quite small-size data, so that computational cost can be significantly reduced when maintaining or even improving detection accuracy. Extensive experimental results substantiate that compared with the state-of-the-art peer algorithms, EIS-OBEA not only achieves highly competitive or even better detection performance, but also meliorates steganalysis time-space cost to a large extent.},

  abstract     = {Private Set Intersection (PSI) allows two mutually distrusting parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing any additional information, and has found numerous applications. A part of applications require labeled PSI in the unbalanced setting, where a server holds a label for each item in a set that is much larger than the set held by a client, and the client obtains the intersection and the corresponding labels. In this paper, we present a new concretely efficient labeled PSI protocol in the unbalanced setting, without using computation-heavy homomorphic encryption. Our protocol is based on Distributed Point Function (DPF) with hardware acceleration from fixed-key AES-NI, and has communication complexity linear in the size of a small set of the client and sublinear in the size of a large set of the server. Our protocol exploits two Oblivious Pesudorandom Function (OPRF) protocols, based on Diffle-Hellman PRFs or block ciphers, to achieve a trade-off between computation and communication. Our implementation demonstrates that our protocol outperforms the previous labeled and unbalanced PSI protocols. In particular, for two sets with respective 224 and 1 items, where each item has a 32-byte label, our protocol takes 1.19 seconds for an end-to-end performance, resulting in 26× improvement compared to the state-of-the-art protocol by Cong et al.

To address these challenges, we propose two enhancements. The first enhancement optimizes quantization distortion in existing frameworks to minimize KL divergence, thereby enhancing theoretical security. The second redesigns the sampling mechanism via distribution coupling to amplify steganographic capacity, achieving this without incurring substantial computational overhead. Experimental validation on text generation task confirms our enhancements substantially outperform previous implementations, demonstrating notable capacity improvements, marked security enhancements, and efficiency gains on consumer-grade hardware. Cross-task comparisons with popular provably secure steganography further establish the proposed enhancements as achieving superior security-capacity-efficiency tradeoffs across diverse generative scenarios, advancing the practical deployment of provably secure steganography systems.},

Usually, shadow models are trained without taking into account the target model; we argue that utilizing the predictions of the target model can guide the training process of the shadow model. To improve the efficiency of shadow model-based membership inference attacks, we propose GLiRA, a knowledge distillation-guided approach to membership inference attacks.

To restrict user access from untrusted devices, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy has been proposed to authenticate users and devices simultaneously. However, when integrating BYOD policy into MEC authentication to improve security, issues of efficient binding and user-device conditional anonymity have not been well supported. To address these issues, we propose Bring Your Device Group (BYDG) policy by constructing efficient and privacy-preserving user-device authentication. Our core idea is to use key sequences generated by PUFs-based key derivation functions (KDFs) to not only construct efficient binding relationships, but also achieve conditional anonymity for device groups. Specifically, a flexible and secure binding method is first developed by leveraging Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to bind user with device groups. Each device’s CRT modulus is derived from the key sequence to construct many-to-many user-device binding relationships, which are managed in the form of on-chain Pedersen Commitment. Moreover, we design an identity anonymizing and tracing method for device groups. The key sequence is regarded as traceable device pseudo-identities, and then inserted into the cuckoo filter to reduce the on-chain storage overhead and mitigate malicious login attempts with low costs. Based on above two methods, the combination of Pedersen Commitment and Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge is used to achieve user-device authentication with conditional anonymity. The security analysis was presented to demonstrate important security properties. A proof-of-concept prototype was implemented to conduct performance evaluation and comparative analysis.},

Using a modified replica detection algorithm and a new seeded deletion detection algorithm, we establish sufficient conditions on the database growth rate for successful matching, demonstrating a double-logarithmic seed size relative to row size is sufficient for detecting deletions in the database. Importantly, our findings indicate that these sufficient de-anonymization conditions are tight and are the same as in the distribution-aware setting, avoiding asymptotic performance loss due to unknown distributions.

  abstract     = {The emerging virtual machine-based Android packers render existing unpacking techniques ineffective. The stateof- the-art unpacker falls short because it relies on unreliable heuristics and manually crafted semantic models. Hence, it cannot precisely recover app semantics necessary for malware detection. In this paper, we propose DEEPVMUNPROTECT, a deep learning-based approach to automatically and accurately capture the semantics of VM-packed code, so as to facilitate semantic-based Android malware classification. Experiments have shown that DEEPVMUNPROTECT outperforms the state-of-the-art tool on recovering opcode semantics in Qihoo(58.3%), Baidu(47.5%) and NMMP (58.8%) respectively, and can enable semantics-aware malware detection which prior work fails to do.},

  abstract     = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are fundamental in ubiquitously providing position and time to a wide gamut of systems. Jamming remains a realistic threat in many deployment settings, civilian and tactical. Specifically, in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) sustained denial raises safety critical concerns. This work presents a strategy that allows detection, localization, and classification both in the frequency and time domain of interference signals harmful to navigation. A high-performance Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV with a single antenna and a commercial GNSS receiver is used to geolocate and characterize RF emitters at long range, to infer the navigation impairment. Raw IQ baseband snapshots from the GNSS receiver make the application of spectral correlation methods possible without extra software-defined radio payload, paving the way to spectrum identification and monitoring in airborne platforms, aiming at RF situational awareness. Live testing at Jammertest, in Norway, with portable, commercially available GNSS multi-band jammers demonstrates the ability to detect, localize, and characterize harmful interference. Our system pinpointed the position with an error of a few meters of the transmitter and the extent of the affected area at long range, without entering the denied zone. Additionally, further spectral content extraction is used to accurately identify the jammer frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme based on spectral correlation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning, hailed as a privacy-preserving collaboration paradigm, has garnered significant attention in research circles. Typically, it involves multiple clients collaborating to integrate multi-party knowledge, facilitating the learning of a shared global model with decentralized local data. Despite the popularity of federated learning, the surge in approaches addressing various realistic challenges has highlighted a critical issue. The aggregated model may struggle to capture diverse domain knowledge across participants, leading to limited performance in cross-client domain scenarios. Furthermore, the incorporation of knowledge from participating parties can hinder generalization on out-of-client distributions. To comprehensively address this challenge, we dissect federated generalization into two dimensions: the participating domain and the unseen domain. In this paper, we propose a novel solution incorporating domain-specialized and invariant experts. These experts are designed to faithfully represent individual domain characteristics and different domain universality. Additionally, we introduce a pioneering test-time expert aggregation strategy that utilizes prediction consistency metrics to aggregate different experts, specifically tailored for handling agnostic testing distributions. Empirical results validate that our proposed methodology significantly enhances federated performance on both cross-client and out-of-client generalization under different scenarios and with various related methods. A comprehensive ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed modules.},

  abstract     = {The technique of hiding secret messages within seemingly harmless covertext to evade examination by censors with rigorous security proofs is known as provably secure steganography (PSS). PSS evolves from symmetric key steganography to public-key steganography, functioning without the requirement of a pre-shared key and enabling the extension to multi-party covert communication and identity verification mechanisms. Recently, a public-key steganography method based on elliptic curves was proposed, which uses point compression to eliminate the algebraic structure of curve points. However, this method has strict requirements on the curve parameters and is only available on half of the points. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a more general elliptic curve public key steganography method based on admissible encoding. By applying the tensor square function to the known well-distributed encoding, we construct admissible encoding, which can create the pseudo-random public-key encryption function. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed provable secure public-key steganography method can be deployed on all types of curves and utilize all points on the curve.},

  abstract     = {Data confidentiality, a fundamental security element for dependable cloud storage, has been drawing widespread concern. Public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) has emerged as a promising approach for privacy protection while enabling efficient retrieval of encrypted data. One of the typical applications of PEKS is searching sensitive electronic medical records (EMR) in healthcare clouds. However, many traditional countermeasures fall short of balancing privacy protection with search efficiency, and they often fail to support multi-user EMR sharing. To resolve these challenges, we propose a novel lightweight multi-user public-key authenticated encryption scheme with keyword search (LM-PAEKS). Our design effectively counters the inside keyword guessing attack (IKGA) while maintaining the sizes of ciphertext and trapdoor constant in multi-user scenarios. The novelty of our approach relies on introducing a dedicated receiver server that skillfully transforms the complex many-to-many relationship between senders and receivers into a streamlined one-to-one relationship. This transformation prevents the sizes of ciphertext and trapdoor from scaling linearly with the number of participants. Our approach ensures ciphertext indistinguishability and trapdoor privacy while avoiding bilinear pairing operations on the client side. Comparative performance analysis demonstrates that LM-PAEKS features significant computational efficiency while meeting higher security requirements, positioning it as a robust alternative to existing solutions.},

However, while the vulnerabilities of fixed-scale SR have been assessed, the robustness of continuous representation-based arbitrary-scale SR against adversarial attacks remains an area warranting further exploration. The elaborately designed adversarial attacks for fixedscale SR are scale-dependent, which will cause time-consuming and memory-consuming problems when applied to arbitraryscale SR. To address this concern, we propose a simple yet effective “scale-invariant” SR adversarial attack method with good transferability, termed SIAGT. Specifically, we propose to construct resource-saving attacks by exploiting finite discrete points of continuous representation. In addition, we formulate a coordinate-dependent loss to enhance the cross-model transferability of the attack. The attack can significantly deteriorate the SR images while introducing imperceptible distortion to the targeted low-resolution (LR) images. Experiments carried out on three popular LIIF-based SR approaches and four classical SR datasets show remarkable attack performance and transferability of SIAGT.},

Specifically, during the sensor deployment phase, we employ quality-guaranteed Monte Carlo propagation simulations coupled with a greedy strategy to achieve maximum coverage with minimal sensors. In the source detection phase, for the structurally incomplete network snapshots, we first attempt edge reconnection from the sensor with the earliest timestamp, followed by posterior maximization Bayesian estimation for source identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SDSA and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/cheng-le/SDSA.},

  abstract     = {One-Time Passwords (OTPs) play a crucial role in Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) by adding an additional layer of security. OTPs effectively mitigate the risk of static passwords being intercepted and reused. Nevertheless, both academic schemes and industrial solutions still encounter security threats stemming from server/device compromises and OTP factor forgery. Chain-based asymmetric OTP schemes are a promising approach to addressing server compromise but still face threats from device compromise and pre-generated chain leakage. We emphasize that since devices directly store the OTP seed, OTP authentication is essentially equivalent to verifying device possession. This means that in existing OTP schemes, OTP forgery and device compromise remain prevalent and difficult to overcome. In this work, we propose a brand new scheme to address OTP factor forgery and server/device compromises. For the first time, our scheme constructs a tightly coupled architecture between the password factor and the OTP factor. The OTP seed is derived from a password and a device-stored salt, preventing OTP seed extraction and OTP forgery even in the event of a device compromise. Through the integration of “honeywords” with the tightly coupled OTP architecture, the server stores decoy OTP seeds generated by decoy passwords, providing resistance against server compromises and partial password guessing from devices. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our OTP schemes. The computational overhead is correlated with the number of honeywords, and with the recommended set size of 20, the total verification overhead is approximately 0.24ms. Additionally, we propose formal security properties and application metrics, and rigorously prove our scheme’s resistance against server/device compromise attacks and guessing attacks. Our scheme is the first to achieve comprehensive OTP security with low overhead.},

The ESs are crafted to encompass four critical factors: intra-dataset distance distribution, inter-sample distance within the target dataset, differential distance analysis, and inference withholding ratio. MIBench includes ten typical evaluation metrics and 84 distinct ESs per dataset. Using MIBench, we conducted a thorough comparative analysis of 15 state-of-the-art MI attacks across 588 ESs, seven widely adopted datasets, and seven representative model architectures. Our analysis revealed 83 instances of Conflicting Comparison Results (CCR), providing substantial evidence for the CCR Phenomenon. We identified two CCR types: Type 1 (single-factor) and Type 2 (dual-factor). The CCR distribution across four factors was: inter-sample distance (40.96%), differential distance (37.35%), inference withholding ratio (19.28%), and intra-dataset distance (2.41%).

However, the existing flow spectrum cannot adapt to the open-world scenarios and behaviorbased detection for unknown cyber threats. To address these challenges, we propose a new flow spectrum construction scheme, named unFlowS, to effectively represent network flows and assist analysts to understand the behaviors of network traffic. unFlowSNet, an unsupervised flow-based detection model we designed as the core of our scheme, can transform network flows into spectral lines. It makes unFlowS possible to detect unknown cyber threats. We further build spectral vectors for spectral lines generated by network flow sets, enabling the visualization of network behaviors within a period of time and automatic behavior-based detection. Experimental results demonstrated that unFlowS-Net can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods on unsupervised flow-based detection.

While some researchers have explored unsupervised CC-ReID, these methods still depend on additional deep learning models for preprocessing. To eliminate the need for additional models and improve performance, we propose a joint augmentation and part learning (JAPL) framework that obtains clothing change positive pairs in an unsupervised fashion by synergistically combining augmentation-based invariant learning (AugIL) and part-based invariant learning (ParIL). AugIL first constructs clothing change pseudo-positive pairs and then encourages the model to focus on clothing-invariant information by enhancing feature consistency between the pseudo-positive pairs. ParIL beneficially encourages high similarity between inter-cluster clothing change positive pair using part images and a prediction sharpening loss. PartIL also introduces a soft consistency loss that promotes clothing-invariant feature learning by encouraging consistency of class vectors between the real features actually used for CC-ReID and the part features. Experimental results on multiple ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed JAPL not only surpasses existing unsupervised methods but also achieves competitive performance compared to some supervised CC-ReID methods.},

To address these limitations, we propose a novel Few-shot Specific Emitter Identification (FS-SEI) approach named KDM. This method fuses deep learning with multi-modal data processing, utilizing a hybrid neural network architecture that combines handcrafted features, self-supervised learning, and few-shot learning techniques. Our framework improves learning efficiency and accuracy, especially in data-scarce scenarios. We evaluate KDM using open-source Wi-Fi and ADS-B datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot SEI approaches. For example, on the ADS-B dataset, KDM boosts accuracy from 60.99% to 75.34% as the sample count increases from 5-shot to 10-shot, surpassing other methods by over 10%. Similarly, on the Wi-Fi dataset, KDM achieves an impressive 88.94% accuracy in low-sample (5-shot) scenarios. The codes are available at https://github.com/tengmouren/KDM2SEI.},

  abstract     = {The objective of a data-free black-box adversarial attack is to attack a victim model without using internal information, training datasets or semantically similar substitute datasets. Concerned about stricter attack scenarios, recent studies have tried employing generative networks to synthesize data for training substitute models. Nevertheless, these approaches concurrently encounter challenges associated with unstable training and diminished attack efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel query-efficient data-free black-box adversarial attack method. To mitigate unstable training, for the first time, we directly manipulate the intermediate-layer feature of a generator without relying on any substitute models. Specifically, a label noise-based generation module is created to enhance the intraclass patterns by incorporating partial historical information during the learning process. Additionally, we present a feature-disturbed diversity generation method to augment the inter-class distance. Meanwhile, we propose an adaptive intra-class attack strategy to heighten attack capability within a limited query budget. In this strategy, entropy-based distance is utilized to characterize the relative information from model outputs, while positive classes and negative samples are used to enhance low attack efficiency. The comprehensive experiments conducted on six datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to six state-of-the-art data-free black-box competitors in both label-only and probability-only attack scenarios. Intriguingly, our method can realize the highest attack success rate on the online Microsoft Azure model under an extremely low query budget. Additionally, the proposed approach not only achieves more stable training but also significantly reduces the query count for a more balanced data generation. Furthermore, our method can maintain the best performance under the existing defense models and a limited query budget.},

  abstract     = {Physical layer security (PLS) is an important technology in wireless communication systems to safeguard communication privacy and security between transmitters and legitimate users. The integration of large-scale antenna arrays (LSAA) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance PLS. However, LSAA requires a dedicated radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna element, and IRS comprises hundreds of reflecting micro-antennas, leading to increased hardware costs and power consumption. To address this, cost-effective solutions like constant modulus analog beamforming (CMAB) have gained attention. This paper investigates PLS in IRS-assisted communication systems with a focus on jointly designing the CMAB at the transmitter and phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. The resulting secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is non-convex. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose two algorithms: (1) the time-efficient Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm, which reformulates the fractional problem into a series of quadratic programs using the Dinkelbach method and solves them via block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM), and (2) the product manifold conjugate gradient descent (PMCGD) algorithm, which provides a better solution at the cost of slightly higher computational time by transforming the problem into an unconstrained optimization on a Riemannian product manifold and solving it using the conjugate gradient descent (CGD) algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and highlight their distinct advantages.},

However, there is a lack of research on side-channel security for the message decoding module in masked CRYSTALS-Kyber. In this paper, we seek to address this gap. First, we conduct a side-channel security evaluation of the first-order masked message decoding function in mkm4 of CRYSTALS-Kyber, finding that an incremental storage vulnerability still exists. Then, we implement a practical experiment in the Cortex-M4 CPU using the sum-of-squared difference method, with the accuracy of the message recovery reaching 90.6% and the secret key recovery achieving 77.2%. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze that any order of masking strategy cannot effectively protect the message decoding function, except by increasing the attack difficulty to a limited extent. We also provide our idea for solving this problem by emulating the data behavior of the dual-rail pre-charge logic circuit at the software level, which can effectively ensure the implementation security of CRYSTALS-Kyber.},

  abstract     = {Remote data integrity auditing enables a client to efficiently ensure the integrity of entire data stored in untrusted servers via auditing. Yet, existing solutions generally emphasize on various metrics (such as minimal storage, fast update, metadata privacy), but not audit performance (e.g., low audit time, small proof size). To this end, a label-aggregating remote data integrity auditing scheme (LARDA) was proposed in ESORICS ’22, which is the state-of-the-art work in terms of proof size and storage cost. However, LARDA needs a trusted third party (TTP) for performing data auditing for all data owners, which introduces a single point of failure since the audit process routinely needs to interact with the TTP. To address this issue, we introduce a new concept called threshold label-aggregating data auditing and propose two novel schemes. Our first solution is based on Pedersen secret sharing technique, which can significantly alleviate the key escrow problem of LARDA. Our second solution is an efficient batch verifying scheme for multiple TTP’s secret key shares, utilizing the KZG (Kate, Zaverucha and Goldberg) secret sharing technique. This scheme can maintain the size of commitment for TTP’s secret key constant rather than a linear factor with the number of TTPs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the scalability of our schemes. In particular, our second scheme improves the verification time for TTP’s secret key shares in constant, only requiring two pairings and one exponentiation in group with an average of 7.39 ms, regardless of the number of TTPs increasing. For our first scheme, the verification procedure requires 2t exponentiations in group (where t is the threshold value), ranging from 2.37 ms (t = 2) to 26.85 ms (t = 35).},

Most existing schemes only consider the scenario where user models have the same weight in model aggregation. However, users often hold different numbers of training samples in practice. This makes the model convergence speed of existing schemes very slow. To solve this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning scheme with secure weighted aggregation. It is able to allocate appropriate user weights based on the user’s local data size with privacy protection. In addition, it is impossible for the cloud server to obtain the user’s original model parameters and local data size in the proposed scheme. Specifically, we use Lagrange interpolation to combine the model parameters and local data size into a set of ciphertexts. The cloud server can smoothly perform weighted aggregation based on these ciphertexts. Leveraging the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we convert the local data size into a series of verification values. This enables the user to verify the correctness of results returned from the server. We provide a theoretical analysis for the proposed scheme, demonstrating its effectiveness, privacy, and verifiability. We perform extensive experiments on the MNIST dataset. Experimental results demonstrate its model performance, computation overhead, and communication overhead.},

Key-value data, as a popular NoSQL structure, requires simultaneous frequency and mean estimations of each key, which poses a challenge to traditional LDP-based collection methods. Despite many schemes proposed for the privacy protection of key-value data, they inadequately solve the condensed perturbation for keys and the advanced combination of privacy budgets, leading to suboptimal estimation accuracy. To address this issue, we propose an efficient key-value collection scheme (COKV) with tight privacy budget composition. In our scheme, we first design a padding and sampling protocol for key-value data to avoid privacy budget splitting. Second, to enhance the utility of key perturbation, we design a key perturbation primitive and optimize the perturbation range to improve computational efficiency. After that, we propose a key-value association perturbation algorithm whose value perturbation strategy guarantees the output expectation equals the original value. Finally, we demonstrate that through a tight privacy budget composition, COKV can provide higher data utility under the same privacy level. Theoretical analysis shows that COKV possesses lower frequency and mean estimations variance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets also indicate that COKV outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for secure key-value data collection.},

  abstract     = {Privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) based on Differential Privacy (DP) protects clients’ data by adding DP noise to samples’ gradients and has emerged as a de facto standard for data privacy in FL. However, the accuracy of global models in DP-based FL may be reduced significantly when rogue clients occur who deviate from the preset DP-based FL approaches and selfishly inject excessive DP noise beyond expectations, thereby applying a smaller privacy budget in the DP mechanism to ensure a higher level of security. Existing DP-based FL fails to prevent such attacks as they are imperceptible. Under the DP-based FL system and random Gaussian noise, the local model parameters of the rogue clients and the honest clients have identical distributions. In particular, the rogue local models show a low performance, but directly filtering out lower-performance local models compromises the generalizability of global models, as local models trained on scarce data also behave with low performance in the early epoch. In this paper, we propose ReFL, a novel privacy-preserving FL system that enforces DP and avoids the accuracy reduction of global models caused by excessive DP noise of rogue clients. Based on the observation that rogue local models with excessive DP noise and honest local models trained on scarce data have different performance patterns in long-term training epochs, we propose a long-term contribution incentives scheme to evaluate clients’ reputations and identify rogue clients. Furthermore, we design a reputation-based aggregation to avoid the damage of rogue clients’ models on the global model accuracy, based on the incentive reputation. Extensive experiments demonstrate ReFL guarantees the global model accuracy performance 0.77% - 81.71% higher than existing DP-based FL methods in the presence of rogue clients.},

A POR scheme with public verifiability further enhances usability by allowing users to delegate the auditing task to a third party, making it highly desirable for a wide range of applications. However, most existing publicly verifiable POR schemes derive their security from the computational hardness of discrete logarithm or factoring, making them vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although it is possible to construct quantum-resistant POR schemes with public verifiability upon hash trees or general lattices, the resulting schemes often exhibit performance limitations when compared to existing constructions, thereby limiting their deployment in real-world applications. In this work, we address this gap by constructing a new publicly verifiable POR scheme on structured lattices. We show that our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under the Ring-LWE and Ring-SIS assumptions. We provide an implementation of our scheme and our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our scheme is comparable to that of well-known constructions based on pairing and RSA.},

Nevertheless, under the dishonest-majority setting with malicious adversaries, prior secure inference works are still costly in terms of communication and run-time. Additionally, existing outsourcing frameworks impose a substantial client-side design, which leads to obstacles in resource-constrained devices. To address the above challenges, we propose MD-SONIC, an online efficient and maliciously-secure framework for outsourcing NN inference with a dishonest majority. We first construct communication-efficient n-party protocols for the basic primitives such as fixed-point multiplication and most significant bit extraction by combining mask-sharing and TinyOT-sharing with SPDZ2k seamlessly. Then, we build fast secure blocks for the widely used NN operators, including matrix multiplication, ReLU, and Maxpool, on top of our basic primitives. To enable an arbitrary number of users to outsource the secure inference task to n computing servers, we propose a lightweight-client and fast Σ paradigm named SPIN, stemming from zero-knowledge proofs. Our SPIN can be instantiated into a set of efficient outsourcing protocols over multiple algebraic structures (e.g., finite field and ring). We also conduct extensive evaluations of MD-SONIC on various neural networks. Compared to the work by Damgård et al.

To address this, we investigate X-ray prohibited item detection under labor-efficient point supervision and develop an intra-inter objectness learning network (I2OL-Net). I2OL-Net consists of two key modules: an intra-modality objectness learning (intra-OL) module and an inter-modality objectness learning (inter-OL) module. The intra-OL module designs a local focus Gaussian masking block and a global random Gaussian masking block to collaboratively learn the objectness in X-ray images. Meanwhile, the inter-OL module introduces the wavelet decomposition-based adversarial learning block and the objectness block, effectively reducing the modality discrepancy between natural images and X-ray images and transferring the objectness knowledge learned from natural images with box annotations to X-ray images. Based on the above, I2OL-Net greatly alleviates the severe problem of part domination caused by large intra-class variations in X-ray images. Experimental results on four X-ray datasets show that I2OL-Net can achieve superior performance with a significant reduction of annotation cost, thus enhancing its accessibility and practicality.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in applying artificial intelligence to IDS. However, existing research often assumes that training and testing data are static and identically distributed, whereas in reality, data drift is inevitable. Moreover, to enhance model versatility and detection performance, models have become increasingly complex, posing challenges to real-time deployment. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive network intrusion detection system named A-NIDS, consisting of a main task and two bypass tasks. The main task is to develop a fully connected and shallow network with strong detection performance and real-time capability. The first bypass task is a clustering model that helps the main task detect data drift in an unsupervised manner. The second bypass task is a generation model to generate old data to address catastrophic forgetting in new model iterations and the storage cost issue caused by accumulating old data. We conduct extensive experiments on the CICIDS-2017 and CSE-CICIDS-2018 datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of A-NIDS on new and old data. Furthermore, our detection module achieves a detection latency of 5 microseconds, highlighting its suitability for real-time applications.

  abstract     = {The reentrancy vulnerability is one of the most notorious vulnerabilities of smart contracts. It enables attackers to hijack the control flow of a smart contract by invoking a function as the entry point and then re-invoking a function as the reentry point before the execution of the entry point ends. Although several approaches have been proposed to detect this vulnerability, they still face two main limitations. Firstly, existing approaches oversimplify the rules for identifying entry and reentry points, and many even neglect reentry point identification during vulnerability detection. Secondly, most existing approaches overlook the flow of state variables that are not promptly updated, a critical aspect of the reentrancy vulnerability. To address the limitations mentioned above, this article proposes a novel static analysis framework for reentry vulnerability detection. We formulate the reentrancy vulnerability detection as entry and reentry point identification with the state variable flow tracking. Based on the insight that most smart contracts are implemented following various technical standards, we utilize static analysis with standard-based rules to identify potential entry and reentry points. This is achieved by detecting the presence of hijackable and exploitable operations inside the smart contract. Meanwhile, we also conduct state variable flow tracking by the static taint analysis. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we construct three different datasets. ThenWe compare our approach with eight state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detectors, and our tool outperforms these baselines in detecting more vulnerable samples with fewer false positive samples. Meanwhile, our approach achieves a relatively shorter detection time with better detection results, striking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has emerged as a vital technique for enhancing Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) in New Radio (NR) networks. Unlike cryptographic methods, RFF leverages device-specific signal impairments to uniquely identify transmitters. Deep Learning (DL) advances have improved PLA, though challenges persist due to communication channel dynamics and device state changes. In this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates 5G NR protocol-specific structures and channel knowledge via SRS-based CSI to generate relative RFF features. Through a tailored frame design and carefully engineered processing pipeline, we achieve cross-domain stability and improved robustness against time-varying conditions. By applying regularization techniques (e.g., mixup) during training, our method further mitigates model overfitting and domain bias. Simulation and real-world SDR experiments, using data from 9 ADALM-PLUTO devices, validate the approach’s effectiveness. The proposed system attains recognition accuracies of 99.878%, 93.376%, 86.325%, and 66.558% in intra-domain, cross-channel, cross-time, and cross-scenario tests, respectively, highlighting its potential to substantially enhance physical layer security in NR-based networks.},

  abstract     = {With the prevalence of online social networks (OSNs), much personal information is collected and maintained by trusted service providers for third-party queries and analyses. Existing works regarding differentially private social network data publication overlook the fact that different users exhibit distinct privacy preferences or sensitivity inclinations. Neglecting these individual nuances may lead to privacy mechanisms that are overly conservative or inadequately protective. Furthermore, the injection of excessive noise into OSN data perceived by users as non-personal or less sensitive can incur additional privacy costs, resulting in lower service quality. This paper introduces a fine-grained, sensitivity-aware personalized edge differential privacy model (SPEDP) for OSNs. Specifically, SPEDP enables each OSN user to individually define the sensitivity level of their social connections, facilitating user-friendly personalized privacy settings. We design a privacy-aware mechanism that operates within a trusted service provider, capable of establishing privacy protection levels based on user-perceived sensitivity settings. Additionally, we propose a sensitivity-aware sampling mechanism to implement SPEDP. To further optimize the privacy mechanism, we explore a privacy threshold optimization strategy aimed at minimizing privacy budget waste. Finally, the personalized privacy protections and utility improvements achieved by the SPEDP mechanism are rigorously validated through theoretical analysis and comprehensive comparative experiments on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Hand-based multimodal biometrics has garnered significant attention in information security and identity authentication. However, prevalent multimodal recognition techniques often extract the discriminant features from different modalities separately, ignoring the structural consistency between various modalities of the same class. Moreover, these methods generally focus on specific-scenarios, where recognition performance will be compromised when faced with different databases or multiple application scenarios. To solve these limitations, we present an innovative Dual-Cohesion Metric Learning (DCML) framework embedded in noise decomposition for few-shot hand multimodal biometrics. This approach comprehensively exploits multimodal features from both intra-modal and inter-modal structural consistency to improve its robustness across multiple applications. Specifically, DCML imposes a dual-cohesion mechanism to pull in the cross-modal distance of the same label and the within-class distance for each modal, while concurrently pushing away the between-class distance in the projected space. Furthermore, in the procedure of feature learning, the proposed DCML incorporates the low-rank constraint to mitigate the interference of noise in the raw data and enforces a sparsity constraint to extract more salient and compact features. Notably, our DCML can be flexibly extended to other multimodal biometrics. Extensive experimental results on six multimodal datasets demonstrated that our DCML outperforms the latest approaches in multiple multimodal recognition scenarios and has strong generalization ability even when the training samples are small.},

A privacy model is composable if the privacy guarantees of the model are preserved, possibly to a limited extent, after repeated independent application of the privacy model. From the opposite perspective, a privacy model is not composable if multiple independent data releases, each of them satisfying the requirements of the privacy model, may result in a privacy breach. Current privacy models are broadly classified into syntactic ones (such as k-anonymity and l-diversity) and semantic ones, which essentially refer to ε-differential privacy (ε-DP) and variations thereof. While ε-DP and its variants offer strong composability properties, syntactic notions are not composable unless data releases are conducted by a single, centralized data holder that uses specialized notions such as m-invariance and τ-safety. In this work, we propose m-uncoordinated-syntactic-privacy (m-USP), the first syntactic notion with composability properties for the independent publication of nondisjoint data, in other words, without a centralized data holder. Theoretical results are formally proven, and experimental results demonstrate that the risk to individuals does not increase significantly, in contrast to non-composable methods, that are susceptible to attribute disclosure. In most cases, the utility degradation caused by the extra protection is less than 5% and decreases as the value of m increases.},

As a pioneering work, the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) is proved more transferable in black-box attacks than its multi-small-step extension, i.e., iterative-FGSM, particularly being restricted by a limited number of iterations. This paper revisits their early, representative successor MI-FGSM as a baseline, i.e., iterative-FGSM with momentum, and introduces an innovative boosting idea different from either FGSM-inspired algorithms or other mainstream methods. For one thing, during gradient backpropogation of MI-FGSM, the proposed approach merely requires amending the chain rule with respect to adversarial images using the counterpart original images. For another, a credible analysis has revealed that such a naively boosted MI-FGSM essentially performs a special kind of intermediate-layer attacks. In specific, the notable finding in the paper is a new principle of adversarial transferability guided by the relative feature importance, emphasizing the significance of semantically non-critical information for the first time in the literature, although originally thought to be weak in large. Experimental results on various leading victim models, both undefended and defended, demonstrate that the new approach incorporating robust gradients has indeed attained stronger adversarial transferability than state-of-the-art works.

This study proposes an advanced domain incremental learning (DIL) framework for SEI, named Adaptive Domain-Incremental Learning with Knowledge Replay and Domain Alignment (ADIRA). ADIRA employs knowledge replay and distillation strategies, along with adaptive coefficients, to balance the model’s performance in recognizing signals across both new and old domains. To address the variations in signal data feature distributions across different domains, we introduce a domain alignment strategy based on adversarial training. This approach integrates embedding distillation loss with supervised contrastive loss, significantly enhancing the model’s adaptability to domain changes. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that ADIRA achieves performance only 0.42% and 1.71% lower than joint training, with replay samples constituting just 1.1% and 1.5% of the training set, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.},

Consequently, the eavesdropper experiences a consistently high bit/symbol error rate, whereas the legitimate receiver maintains a very low error rate. Furthermore, we extend the parallel PAM scheme to both the in-phase and quadrature components of the signal, forming a heterogeneous quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme. This enhances transmission efficiency while preserving security. We analyze the bit/symbol error rates at both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, deriving a lower bound for the eavesdropper’s error rate.

  abstract     = {Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) has gained widespread attention for ensuring the security and integrity of data communication. While existing PKI mainly supports digital signatures, it is lacking in crucial anonymity, leading to the leakage of a signer’s identity information. To alleviate the issue, ring signatures are a suitable choice to provide anonymity as they allow users to create their own rings without the need for an administrator. Unfortunately, the utilization of ring signatures in PKI may present compatibility challenges within the system. Thus, proposing a general mechanism to convert a standardized Σ-based signature to a ring signature is far-reaching. In this paper, we propose a general construction for converting Σ-based signatures into ring signatures. To achieve this, we first introduce a Σ-based general model, providing a general transformation to convert existing Σ-based signatures into a Σ-protocol form. Subsequently, we incorporate our redesigned one-out-of-many relation within our general model and proceed to devise ring signatures leveraging on one-out-of-many proofs. Furthermore, to reduce the signature size, we employ the Bullet-proofs folding technique, enabling the attainment of logarithmic size ring signatures. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our general construction, we present four prominent signatures as case studies. Ultimately, we conduct a rigorous security analysis and benchmark experimental evaluation. The signing and verification times are 0.44 to 0.97 times and 0.27 to 0.91 times compared to other state-of-the-art schemes, respectively. Additionally, we exhibit the lowest signature size to date.},

It has several valuable applications, for instance, wireless sensor networks. Identity-based chameleon hash (IB-CH), as an alternative building block to construct OO-IBS, has been explored in numerous literatures. Nevertheless, there still exist two major issues. (1) Nearly all of the previous IB-CH schemes with weak collision-resistance (W-CollRes) are with random oracles, which may lead to security risks in practicality. The only IB-CH scheme in the standard model suffers from the large size of public parameters and inefficient setup process. (2) The only IB-CH scheme without key exposure also relies on random oracles. In this paper, we propose two novel IB-CH schemes in the standard model. The first scheme is adaptive identity, W-CollRes secure and efficient, significantly reducing the computation costs of all algorithms and the size of public parameters compared with the existing scheme in the standard model. The second scheme is the first IB-CH achieving key exposure freeness without random oracles. Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the good performance of our proposed schemes. Furthermore, we apply our schemes to optimizing the existing generic OO-IBS construction. The optimized generic constructions reduce computational overhead by 50.0% in the online phase and enable the hash value/signature tuple generated in the offline phase to be reusable, respectively.},

The resulting schemes are theoretically helpful for private key security but inconvenient for individual users as their implementation requires distributed computing and networking system with broadcasting channels. To address the private key security issue of PKC schemes for individual users, this paper proposes the concept and general construction of sequentially threshold PKC under a communication model consisting of a computing device and several offline storages where broadcasting channels are not required. To illustrate the new paradigm, we design and realize a sequentially threshold Schnorr signature scheme STSS. The security proofs for STSS indicate its effectiveness of achieving unforeability under traditional attacks as well as security incidents caused by human faults and system failures. The experiments on FIPS recommended curves P-256, P-384, and P-521 show that STSS is comparable with the original Schnorr scheme in terms of time consumed for generating a signature. The construction of sequentially threshold ElGamal decrtyption scheme is also presented. Finally, we illustrate the application of STSS in the Blockchain ecosystem.},

However, current VFL solutions are limited in their ability to perform inference on non-overlapping samples, and data stored on clients is often subject to loss due to various unavoidable factors. This leads to incomplete client data, where client missing features (MF) are frequently overlooked in VFL. The main aim of this paper is to propose a VFL framework to handle missing features (MFVFL), which is a tensor decomposition network-based approach that can effectively learn intra- and inter-client feature information from client data with missing features to improve VFL performance. In the proposed MFVFL method each client imputes missing values and encodes features to learn intra-feature information, and the server collects the uploaded feature embeddings as input to our developed low-rank tensor decomposition network to learn inter-feature information. Finally, the server aggregates the representations from tensor decomposition to train a global classifier. In the paper, we theoretically guarantee the convergence of MFVFL. In addition, differential privacy (DP) for data privacy protection is always used, and the proposed framework (MFVFL-DP) can deal with such degraded data by using a tensor robust PCA to alleviate the impact of noise while preserving data privacy. We conduct extensive experiments on six datasets of different sample sizes and feature dimensions, and demonstrate that MFVFL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially under high missing ratios. The experimental results also show that MFVFL-DP possesses excellent denoising capabilities and illustrate that the noisy effect by the DP mechanism can be alleviated.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised learning (SSL) is increasingly attractive for pre-training encoders without requiring labeled data. Downstream tasks built on top of those pre-trained encoders can achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance. The pre-trained encoders by SSL, however, are vulnerable to backdoor attacks as demonstrated by existing studies. Numerous backdoor mitigation techniques are designed for downstream task models. However, their effectiveness is impaired and limited when adapted to pre-trained encoders, due to the lack of label information when pre-training. To address backdoor attacks against pretrained encoders, in this paper, we innovatively propose a mutual information guided backdoor mitigation technique, named MIMIC(Mutual Information guided backdoor MItigation for pre-trained enCoders). MIMIC uses the potentially backdoored encoder as the teacher network and applies knowledge distillation to create a clean student encoder from it. Different from existing knowledge distillation approaches, MIMIC initializes the student with random weights, inheriting no backdoors from teacher nets. Then MIMIC leverages mutual information between each layer and extracted features to locate where benign knowledge lies in the teacher net, with which distillation is deployed to clone clean features from teacher to student. We craft the distillation loss with two aspects, including clone loss and attention loss, aiming to mitigate backdoors and maintain encoder performance at the same time. Our evaluation conducted on two backdoor attacks in SSL demonstrates that MIMIC can significantly reduce the attack success rate by only utilizing. ≤ 5% of clean pre-training data that is accessible to the defender, surpassing seven state-of-the-art backdoor mitigation techniques.

  abstract     = {Adversarial examples, characterized by imperceptible perturbations, pose significant threats to deep neural networks by misleading their predictions. A critical aspect of these examples is their transferability, allowing them to deceive unseen models in black-box scenarios. Despite the widespread exploration of defense methods, including those on transferability, they show limitations: inefficient deployment, ineffective defense, and degraded performance on clean images. In this work, we introduce a novel training paradigm aimed at enhancing robustness against transferable adversarial examples (TAEs) in a more efficient and effective way.We propose a model that exhibits random guessing behavior when presented with clean data x as input, and generates accurate predictions when with triggered data x + τ . Importantly, the trigger τ remains constant for all data instances. We refer to these models as models with trigger activation. We are surprised to find that these models exhibit certain robustness against TAEs. Through the consideration of first-order gradients, we provide a theoretical analysis of this robustness. Moreover, through the joint optimization of the learnable trigger and the model, we achieve improved robustness to transferable attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse datasets, evaluating a variety of attacking methods, underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.},

To address this issue, this paper focuses on spread spectrum clocking (SSC) schemes employed in information visualization devices (IVDs), offering an in-depth analysis of the diverse characteristics of EM leakage and highlighting their associated risks. To convey our contributions, we introduce a novel model based on a modified Fourier series that accurately captures SSC-induced EM waves, enhancing the understanding of emissions from SSC-based devices. Additionally, we propose complete coherent demodulation (CCD), an advancement of the periodic nonuniform sampling (PNS) framework that resolves byproduct-phase terms. Our work further integrates parameterized demodulation with singular value decomposition (PD-SVD) to refine the analysis of modulated instantaneous frequency terms within EM leakage observed over significant distances.

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of autonomous driving systems (ADS) on autonomous vehicles (AV), in recent years, there have been many attacks targeting AVs and ADSes. Meanwhile, recent studies are trying to improve the safety and security of AVs from different perspectives, and they mainly focus on the spoofing attacks against the sensors and the injection attacks against the vehicle chassis and actuators. However, direct attacks on ADSes (i.e., communication hijacking and malicious codes) remain inadequately addressed, and even worse, such attacks can let the AVs make unsafe driving decisions rapidly. In this paper, we introduce DSAD, a driving state-aware anomaly detection framework designed to enhance AV safety and security by identifying ADS attacks, such as communication hijacking and malicious codes, through chassis states. First, DSAD models ADS operations (i.e., driving states) as a two-layer state machine, utilizing real-time chassis data to infer driving states and detect anomalies in ADS outputs. This reduces false positives and negatives by aligning detection with the diverse operational modes of AVs. To achieve this, we develop a prototype system, DSAD, which incorporates a Detection Policy Update mechanism that dynamically adjusts detection policies based on the vehicle’s driving states, such as lane changing and obstacle avoidance. Second, DSAD considers both collision avoidance and control stability, addressing potential conflicts through hard and soft requirements. Furthermore, DSAD integrates a Fault Handling module compatible with existing autonomous driving fault handling mechanisms, ensuring timely response to detected anomalies. We develop a prototype anomaly detection system called DSAD and deploy it on four ADSes. We evaluate DSAD using various attack scenarios, and the results show that DSAD can identify over 90% of attacks on ADS.},

The proposed model records coalition formation information as transactions in the blockchain to protect the VNF information from being tampered with by attackers.Coalition formation for SFC provisioning consists of two steps: VNF node identity verification and the decision to join the coalition. To address the issue of unreliability in SFC deployment due to attacks, we propose a cooperative SFC provisioning algorithm based on security-aware coalition formation to identify trustworthy VNFs for SFC. Moreover, to handle the instability of SFC provisioning caused by DDoS attacks, we present an SFC reprovisioning algorithm based on the stochastic evolutionary coalition game with reward machines (SECGRM) under the constraint of VNF service times.

However, it is important to consider the potential risks of theft. Although various techniques have been developed to protect the intellectual property of deep models, there is still room for improvement in terms of efficiency, comprehensiveness, and generalization. Compared with the intrusiveness of watermarking methods, fingerprinting methods do not affect the training process of the source model. Consequently, this paper proposes a fingerprinting method to address the paucity of attempts in fingerprinting methods for model protection. Our method consists of two efficient algorithms for generating fingerprinting samples, where the first one possesses the advantage of efficiency, while the second one is better in terms of robustness. The first algorithm takes a comprehensive approach to modeling the fingerprint of the deep model. The generated samples are distributed within the stable region and near the decision boundary of the model, taking into account both the duality and the conviction factors. Then, a heuristic sample perturbation algorithm is introduced, which generates a fingerprint with solid stability and generalization across multiple domains. The two algorithms proposed in this paper have been shown to be capable of withstanding attacks on intellectual property removal, detection, and evasion. They also show some advantages in terms of efficiency. In addition, the proposed method is the first to apply fingerprinting techniques in a cross-domain context.},

The predominant countermeasures are Deepfake detectors based on deep learning (DL). However, due to the opaque nature of DL-model, they struggle to offer understandable explanations for their predictive decisions, which undermines their reliability and effectiveness in real-world applications. Existing mainstream DL-oriented interpretation approaches, the feature attribution methods, struggle to work on Deepfake detectors due to issues of low interpretation fidelity, poor intelligibility, and limited applicability across different types of detectors. This paper addresses these critical challenges by proposing the Deepfake Detector Lens (DDL), a novel framework designed to enhance the interpretability of diverse architectural Deepfake detectors, encompassing those based on image, frequency domain, and video. DDL employs a heuristic algorithm to enhance interpretation efficacy and incorporates image segmentation and face parsing techniques to bridge the gap between the machine-generated interpretation saliency map and human understanding. Comprehensive evaluations of DDL demonstrate its superiority over existing feature attribution methods in terms of fidelity, intelligibility, and applicability. The proposed DDL significantly advances the interpretability of Deepfake detection technology, offering a more reliable and understandable tool for combating AI-generated face forgeries.},

However, extensive research has shown that DNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can lead them to confidently output incorrect results with high confidence scores. Existing adversarial attack methods often focus solely on temporal characteristics of signals while neglecting frequency domain information, resulting in adversarial examples with poor transferability and inadequate performance in the black-box scenario. An adversarial attack method based on frequency domain feature enhanced and integral gradient (FEIG) for AMC task is proposed in this paper. The approach utilizes techniques such as translation interpolation and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform to enhance the frequency domain information of original examples, thereby constructing enhanced baseline examples. Subsequently, these generated enhanced baseline examples are used as new inputs for gradient integration to obtain adversarial examples. Compared to traditional methods, the generated adversarial examples exhibit stronger transferability. Furthermore, in order to improve the defense performance of the model, an enhanced hybrid adversarial training (EH-AT) framework is proposed in this paper. The original clean example and the adversarial example generated by the proposed attack method are trained with joint loss constraints, which greatly enhances the robustness of the model.

Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is gaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer computing resources. Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy that optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of different examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization. However, this imbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class disparity regarding their performances. This disparity could be embodied from a perspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy. Based on the analysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the imbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different training data adaptively to enhance robustness. Specifically, we take disparity and misalignment into consideration. First, we introduce self-knowledge guided regularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each class based on its training state, alleviating class disparity. Additionally, we propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label relaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and improving robustness. By combining these methods, we formulate the Self-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge during training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising training efficiency. Extensive experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive clean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Outsourcing is an essential strategy for enterprises, and leveraging it can offer advantages such as saving costs, improving efficiency, and allowing them to concentrate on their main business activities. Therefore, announcing and managing service requests is paramount for obtaining suitable quotes and partnering with the right outsourcing service providers. To achieve this, enterprises can employ digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and security of these service requests. However, the irrevocable nature of traditional digital signatures poses challenges, particularly when canceling the service requests is necessary. A withdrawable signature scheme provides a novel property for signers to initially create “withdrawable” signatures, which they can later confirm into additional conventional signatures. Withdrawable signatures can be regarded as withdrawn when the signer has not confirmed them yet. This property provided by the withdrawable signature mechanism can then be adopted as a solution to this problem, allowing the enterprise to retract announced signatures on service requests. However, to meet the demands in the outsourcing system, existing approaches on withdrawable signatures require further development since it only allows signers in outsourcing systems to confirm withdrawable signatures on service requests. This limitation prevents enterprises from accepting quotes for service requests simply by confirming the withdrawable signature. This paper focuses on this problem by applying withdrawable signature to the outsourcing framework, identifying the limitations of existing withdrawable signature schemes, and proposing solutions. We demonstrate how a revisit of withdrawable signature can lead to flexible outsourcing systems that ensure the cancellation of announced service requests. Additionally, we provide a performance evaluation demonstrating that our revised withdrawable signature scheme achieves acceptable efficiency and security within the outsourcing system.},

However, existing studies have predominantly focused on the online phase, and the equally critical offline phase remains overlooked. This oversight can lead to significant yet unaddressed challenges in both security and efficiency. To address these challenges, we start from the pseudorandom correlation generator (PCG) notion by Boyle et al. (CRYPTO&#39;19, FOCS&#39;20) and propose a programmable, verifiable, and efficient PCG construction using dedicated, small security hardware. Our technique, termed HPCG, bridges cryptography and hardware worlds for both strong security and high performance. It enables parties to generate virtually unbounded target correlations and verify their well-formedness at a low cost. Compared to existing cryptographic PCGs, HPCG restrainedly relies on minimal hardware trust, while advancing: 1) support for versatile correlations; 2) well-formedness enforcement for any correlation regardless of its form; and 3) reduced offline costs further. In contrast to prior hardware-based MPC solutions, HPCG 1) minimizes the trusted computing base; 2) eliminates single-vendor trust assumptions; and 3) avoids hosting sensitive user inputs directly on security chips. Furthermore, although HPCG operates solely in the offline phase and requires no direct access to user inputs, it enables performant online MPC protocols by efficiently generating some new, highly customized correlations. Our results demonstrate that HPCG outperforms prior preprocessing techniques in performance, security, simplicity, or a combination thereof.},

In this work, we propose a system-level approach to remedy this issue based on a novel security notion of Proofs of Stateful Execution (PoSX) for IoT/embedded devices’ software. To realize the PoSX concept, we design SLAPP: a System-Level Approach for Poisoning Prevention. SLAPP leverages commodity security features of embedded devices – in particular ARM TrustZone-M security extensions – to verifiably bind raw sensed data to their correct usage as part of FL/LDP edge device routines. As a consequence, it offers robust security guarantees against poisoning. Our evaluation, based on real-world prototypes featuring multiple cryptographic primitives and data collection schemes, showcases SLAPP’s security and low overhead.},

However, existing ASSO schemes suffer from heavy ticket requesting and verifying overheads, limiting their applications in large-scale settings. To address this problem, we propose a novel concept called keyed-verification anonymous credentials with disposable delegation (KVAC-DD) in the multi-verifier setting. Next, we extend KVAC-DD to build an efficient ASSO system, dubbed DkvSSO. The construction of DkvSSO can be instantiated in efficient prime-order groups, avoiding costly operations required in previous ASSO systems. We formally prove the security of our proposed constructions. Extensive experiments show that DkvSSO is significantly more efficient than existing ASSO schemes, making it suitable to be deployed in large-scale settings.},

In this paper, we focus on handling the security and privacy issues in such a promising system by customizing a new cryptographic primitive to provide the following security guarantees: (1) fine-grained, privacy-preserving authorization for smart home users and integrity protection of communication contents; (2) flexible self-sovereign permission delegation; (3) forward security of previous messages. To our knowledge, no previous system has been designed to consider these three security and privacy requirements simultaneously. To tackle these challenges, we put forward the first-ever efficient cryptographic primitive called the Forward-secure Hierarchical Delegable Signature (FS-HDS) scheme for smart homes. Specifically, we first propose a new primitive, efficient Hierarchical Delegable Signature (HDS) scheme, which is capable of supporting partial delegation capability while realizing privacy-preserving authorization and integrity guarantee. Then, we present an FS-HDS for smart homes with the efficient HDS as the underlying building block, which not only inherits all the desirable features of HDS but also ensures that the past content integrity is not affected even if the current secret key is compromised. We provide comprehensively strict security proofs to prove the security of our proposed solutions. Its performance is also validated via experimental simulations to showcase its practicability and effectiveness.},

These limitations include susceptibility to adaptive attacks, adverse impact on benign samples, high time consumption for conducting a complete defense cycle, etc. To bridge the gap, developing more advanced plug-and-play countermeasures is urgently needed to safeguard these applications. Specifically, this paper first proposes a novel method named Gaussian-augmented GAN-based Adversarial Purification (GA-GAP). Unlike previous methods, GA-GAP enhances the density of the training data in low-robustness regions by using random Gaussian noise. Moreover, GA-GAP incorporates a pre-trained deep learning classifier into the training architecture and integrates its classification loss into the training loss function. Then, following the development of GA-GAP, this paper innovatively proposes a dual-function defense framework named Adversarial Detection on Purification (ADoP) to mitigate adversarial examples further. In ADoP, purification and detection complement each other, achieving the effect of 1 + 1 &gt; 2, which can more efficiently avoid adaptive attacks. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that ADoP outperforms other countermeasures in multiple aspects. These aspects include superior generalization capability in purifying and detecting various adversarial examples, less adverse impact on benign samples, and practical time consumption for conducting a complete defense cycle.},

However, several schemes that aim to attack robust aggregation rules and reducing the model accuracy have been proposed recently. These schemes do not maintain the sign statistics of gradients unchanged during attacks. Therefore, the sign statistics-based scheme SignGuard can resist most existing attacks. To defeat SignGuard and most existing cosine or distance-based aggregation schemes, we propose an enhanced model poisoning attack, ScaleSign. Specifically, ScaleSign uses a scaling attack and a sign modification component to obtain malicious gradients with higher cosine similarity and modify the sign statistics of malicious gradients, respectively. In addition, these two components have the least impact on the magnitudes of gradients. Then, we propose MSGuard, a Multi-Strategy Byzantine-robust scheme based on cosine mechanisms, symbol statistics, and spectral methods. Formal analysis proves that malicious gradients generated by ScaleSign have a closer cosine similarity than honest gradients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScaleSign can attack most of the existing Byzantine-robust rules, especially achieving a success rate of up to 98.23% for attacks on SignGuard. MSGuard can defend against most existing attacks including ScaleSign. Specifically, in the face of ScaleSign attack, the accuracy of MSGuard improves by up to 41.78% compared to SignGuard.},

Current effort is mainly devoted to the investigation of detecting and mitigating DLAAs, while, for a holistic cyber-resiliency-enhancement process, the last but not least cyber recovery from DLAAs (CRDA) has not been paid enough attention yet. Considering the interconnection among electricity, transportation, and cyber networks, this paper presents the first exploration of the CRDA, where two essential sub-tasks are formulated: i) Optimal design of repair crew routes to remove installed malware and ii) Robust adjustment of system operation to eliminate the mitigation costs with stability guarantee. Towards this end, linear stability constraints are established by utilising a sensitivity-based eigenvalue estimation method, where the eigenvalue sensitivity information is appropriately ordered and strategically selected to guarantee the estimation accuracy. Moreover, to assure the CRDA solution’s robustness to the adversary’s follow-up movement, the worst-case attack strategies in all attack scenarios during the recovery process are integrated. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is subsequently developed for the CRDA with the primary objective to restore the secure but cost-inefficient mitigation operation mode to the cost-efficient one and secondarily to repair compromised IoT home appliances. Case studies are performed in IEEE power system cases to validate the eigenvalue estimation’s accuracy, the CRDA solution’s effectiveness and robustness, as well as the proposed CRDA’s extensibility.},

Current methods aimed at safeguarding artworks often employ adversarial attacks. However, these methods face challenges such as poor transferability, high computational costs, and the introduction of noticeable noise, which compromises the aesthetic quality of the original artwork. To address these limitations, we propose a Structurally Imperceptible and Transferable Adversarial (SITA) attacks. SITA leverages a CLIP-based destylization loss, which decouples and disrupts the robust style representation of the image. This disruption hinders style extraction during stylized image generation, thereby impairing the overall stylization process. Importantly, SITA eliminates the need for a surrogate diffusion model, leading to significantly reduced computational overhead. The method’s robust style feature disruption ensures high transferability across diverse models. Moreover, SITA introduces perturbations by embedding noise within the imperceptible structural details of the image. This approach effectively protects against style extraction without compromising the visual quality of the artwork. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SITA offers superior protection for artworks against unauthorized use in stylized generation. It significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of transferability, computational efficiency, and noise imperceptibility.},

Its design rationale is to leverage the model update contributions of all data points, including ones outside of the source and target classes, to construct an Amplifier set, in which we falsify the data labels before the FL training process, as a means to boost attacks. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and compatibility of BoTPA on various targeted poisoning attacks. Under data poisoning attacks, our evaluations reveal that BoTPA can achieve a median Relative Increase in Attack Success Rate (RI-ASR) between 15.3% and 36.9% across all possible source-target class combinations, with varying percentages of malicious clients, compared to its baseline. In the context of model poisoning, BoTPA attains RI-ASRs ranging from 13.3% to 94.7% in the presence of the Krum and Multi-Krum defenses, from 2.6% to 49.2% under the Median defense, and from 2.9% to 63.5% under the Flame defense.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the development of embodied intelligence. By providing a few contextual demonstrations (such as rationales and solution examples) developers can utilize the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs to effortlessly translate complex tasks described in abstract language into sequences of code snippets, which will serve as the execution logic for embodied agents. However, this paper uncovers a significant backdoor security threat within this process and introduces a novel method called Contextual Backdoor Attack. By poisoning just a few contextual demonstrations, attackers can covertly compromise the contextual environment of a black-box LLM, prompting it to generate programs with context-dependent defects. These programs appear logically sound but contain defects that can activate and induce unintended behaviors when the operational agent encounters specific triggers in its interactive environment. To compromise the LLM’s contextual environment, we employ adversarial in-context generation to optimize poisoned demonstrations, where an LLM judge evaluates these poisoned prompts, reporting to an additional LLM that iteratively optimizes the demonstration in a two-player adversarial game using chain-of-thought reasoning. To enable context-dependent behaviors in downstream agents, we implement a dual-modality activation strategy that controls both the generation and execution of program defects through textual and visual triggers. We expand the scope of our attack by developing five program defect modes that compromise key aspects of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in embodied agents. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across various tasks, including robot planning, robot manipulation, and compositional visual reasoning. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential impact of our approach by successfully attacking real-world autonomous driving systems. The contextual backdoor threat introduced in this study poses serious risks for millions of downstream embodied agents, given that most publicly available LLMs are third-party-provided. This paper aims to raise awareness of this critical threat. Our code and demos are available at https://contextual-backdoor.github.io/.},

State-of-the-art methods for unlearning use historical data from FL clients, such as gradients or locally trained models. However, studies have revealed significant information leakage in this setting, with the possibility of reconstructing a user’s local data from their uploaded information. Addressing this, we propose Starfish, a privacy-preserving federated unlearning scheme using Two-Party Computation (2PC) techniques and shared historical client data between two non-colluding servers. Starfish builds upon existing FU methods to ensure privacy in unlearning processes. To enhance the efficiency of privacy-preserving FU evaluations, we suggest 2PC-friendly alternatives for certain FU algorithm operations. We also implement strategies to reduce costs associated with 2PC operations and lessen cumulative approximation errors. Moreover, we establish a theoretical bound for the difference between the unlearned global model via Starfish and a global model retrained from scratch for certified client removal. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that Starfish achieves effective unlearning with reasonable efficiency, maintaining privacy and security in FL systems.},

In this trend, providing Private Sample Alignment (PSA) among multi-clients becomes naturally necessary for preventing unauthorized sample access and client privacy exposure. However, exiting PSA protocols mainly focus on two-party scenarios and cannot be directly adapted to the multi-client delegated computing scenarios required for vertical federated learning. Besides, these studies fail to address the need for protocol robustness in practical federated Learning network environments. Therefore, we aim to design an efficient and reliable PSA protocol in multi-client vertical federated learning. In this work, we present the first practical PSA protocol for vertical federated learning, allowing multi-clients to efficiently identify common samples without revealing additional information. Toward this direction, our PSA protocol first explores the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem to create a lightweight delegated Private Set Intersection (PSI) scheme, enabling efficient sample intersection among multiple clients. To achieve the reliability of the PSA protocol, we devise a multi-client vector aggregation algorithm that securely delegates the server to calculate the sample intersection. Building on this foundation, we develop an efficient Threshold-based Private Sample Alignment (T-PSA) protocol that allows multiple clients to determine the intersection of their input samples only if the intersection size surpasses a specific threshold. We implement a prototype and conduct a thorough security analysis. Comprehensive evaluation results confirm the efficiency and practicality of our design.},
