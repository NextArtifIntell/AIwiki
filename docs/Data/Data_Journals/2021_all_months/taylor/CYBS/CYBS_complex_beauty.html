  abstract     = {Categorization of profiles in social networks represents one of the most interesting current challenges. Indeed, nowadays social networks have an inevitable role in the decision-making of Internet users. Detecting categories of profiles, which can play the role of influencers, can make a difference in understanding the structures and the functions of networks. With the exponential growth of data, and since we are talking about machine learning methods, classical techniques have become of poor efficiency. In this article, we introduce Weighted Categories Propagation (WCP), an improvement of existing methods which benefit from the labels propagation to consider the influence of social relationships on profile categorization. The efficiency of WCP is experimentally validated. Experiments carried out on the data set of RepLab 2014 indicate that WCP outperforms similar methods.},

Nevertheless, firms do not invest all assets into higher-paying assets and hold part of their cash, especially firms in the high-tech electronics industry. Firms in this industry hold considerable amounts of cash because they have high expenses and recovery is uncertain, potentially leaving the firm without sufficient funds. It is therefore necessary to prepare a certain amount of cash. This study uses a decision tree algorithm including J48, LMT, Random Forest, REP Tree, Simple CART, Extra Tree, and BF Tree to measure the performance of predictions. This study has three experiments: (1) testing the predictive ability of the decision tree algorithm, (2) testing the decision tree algorithm with performance improvements, and (3) determining the best decision tree forecast rate comparison using the logistic regression model. The experiments indicate that the random forest has the highest and best prediction rate comparison with the logistic regression model.},

While the connection between emotion and strategic action has been well-established in the past, in this work, we introduce the following question: Can emotional signals, automatically captured and interpreted from short video and audio recordings of a user, serve as good predictors of strategic action selection in an economic context, modeled as a game? In order to initiate the research on this question, we perform a user study where emotional signals are elicited from users using short video clips of emotional content. These signals are automatically analyzed by standard off-the-shelf computational means and are in turn used as potential predictors of strategic decisions in two classic, well-studied one-shot economical games: the ultimatum game and the trust game. By employing supervised machine learning techniques, we demonstrate the potential predictive power of these emotional signals and show that relying on the interpreted emotions can bring about more accurate predictions than standard baseline approaches.},

We proposed a twofold adaptive approach to exploit and compare different sentiment analysis techniques, namely lexicons (VADER and NRC) and machine learning. The analysis brings out that positive sentiments are higher in both the involved countries. However, there is a belief that people of both countries are negative and vicious about this act. The observations may help to break this myth and to foster positive engagement between the two nations, which are at the edge of a full-fledged war. The study provides a list of top Twitter influencer handles in each country and the disputed state. Thus, the purpose of this research is to scientifically analyze the situation to arrive at a fair decision and thereby removing unjust opinions that cause a lot of disturbance.

The paper proposes the use of data envelopment analysis (DEA) with undesirable inputs-outputs for quantitative assessment of the impact on road fatalities of road safety culture. This method determines a number of road safety factors and then distinguishes between the effects of specified factors and the cultural factors. The applicability and usefulness of the proposed DEA are illustrated in a real-world application for assessment of the impact of road safety culture on Iran provincial road fatalities in the time period of two years. Results of DEA enable differentiating between provinces according to the impact of cultural aspects on fatality rate. Moreover, results show that road safety culture on average has improved in the time period of two years. The results of this study may be considered as a basis for traffic safety culture (TSC) interventions at provincial level. This paper provides a new opportunity to look at road safety culture across provincial road transportation systems in Iran and represents a critical step toward understanding relationship between safety culture and safety performance.},

There is evidence in the predictive analytics literature that the former is more robust than the latter, as in individual selection you tend to overfit models to the data. A third approach is to first identify homogeneous clusters within the dataset, and then select a single forecasting method for each cluster (cluster selection). To that end, we examine three machine learning clustering methods: k-medoids, k-NN and random forests. The evaluation is performed in the 645 yearly series of the M3 competition. The empirical evidence suggests: (a) random forests provide the best clusters for the sequential forecasting task, and (b) cluster selection has the potential to outperform aggregate selection.},

The robot’s working environment is cluttered with static obstacles with a priori knowledge of their shapes and positions and with moving obstacles with unknown geometry and motion. In order to ensure a safe motion for the robot I propose a two-stage approach. First, using the Bump-Surface concept I construct a path by considering only the static obstacles of the environment. Then, the robot starts its motion on the given path. When the robot detects a potential danger situation (i.e., collision), a decision algorithm tries to evaluate the risk of collision and simultaneously to find the safest action for the robot. The proposed approach is evaluated in randomly generated simulated scenarios.},

Therefore, this study applies the GM(1,1) power model, the most frequently used gray prediction model, to forecast the demand for magnesium materials. Gray prediction is appropriate for this study, because there is little available data on magnesium material demand and it does not coincide with statistical assumptions. In contrast to the original GM(1,1) power model, which simply treats each sample with equal importance, this study uses gray relational analysis to estimate the weight of each sample to improve the prediction accuracy. The forecasting ability of the proposed gray residual modification models was verified using real data regarding magnesium material demand. The results showed that the proposed variant of the GM(1,1) power model offers performance that is comparable to other gray prediction models.},

The design of proper routing protocols to control dynamic topological changes in an ad hoc network can enhance the performance of a network. In this regard, the current study attempts to present a new routing protocol to improve energy consumption using the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm and the TOPSIS multi-criteria algorithm. The proposed approach can be applied in dynamic environments, and four important variables including the accessible bandwidth, the remaining energy, the speed of movement, and the number of steps necessary for routing have been considered for it. To select proper groups for the purpose of relaying data packages, the TOPSIS multi-criteria algorithm was applied. In addition, the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm was used to select the shortest route between the relay groups. The simulation results showed that the process of selecting a stable route using the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm and the TOPSIS algorithm has a significant impact on the performance of networks, and the proposed algorithm shows better performance compared to the methods introduced in Tabatabaei and Behravesh with regard to the throughput and the end-to-end delay.},

An accurate diagnosis and its treatment demand strict delineation of the tumor affected tissues. Herein, we focus on a smart, automated, and robust segmentation approach for brain tumor using a modified 3D U-Net architecture. The pre-operative multimodal 3D-MRI scans of High-Grade Glioma (HGG) and Low-Grade Glioma (LGG) are used as data. Our proposed approach solves the problem of memory and system resource constraints by robustly applying dense network training on image patches of 3D volumes. It improves the border region artifact detection by applying convolutions at an appropriate phase in the proposed neural network. Multi-class imbalance data are handled by using Categorical Cross Entropy (CCE) loss developed by combining the Weighted Cross Entropy (WCE) with Weighted Multi-class Dice Loss (WMDL) functions, which enables the network to perform smart segmentation of the smaller tumorous regions. The proposed approach is tested and evaluated for the challenge datasets of multimodal MRI volumes of tumor patients. Experiments are performed to compute the average dice scores on BraTS-2019 and BraTS-2020 datasets for the whole tumor region.},

Centralization has proven to be a vital tool that helps to solve many problems. Besides the existence of numerous centralization measures, there is a lack of requirements for them. The main contribution of this article are postulates for centralization measures that solve this problem by enforcing intuition behind centralization. To prove the legitimacy of these postulates, a few existing measures that have fulfilled all postulates are shown. The proposed postulates are not only helpful during the formation of new measures but they also represent the perfect tool to compare two different measures.},

To solve these problems, we have developed a support system for selecting a group of reviewers to evaluate a particular problem, such as a proposal or a research paper. Our support system consists of three main modules: data collection, reviewer identification and group prediction of reviewers. The Data Collection module collects data from a variety of sources to create the scientist profile database. The reviewer identification module recognizes reviewers on a specific topic. The reviewer prediction module provides a group of exp reviewers to evaluate a submitted paper or a proposal.

  abstract     = {The fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0 is reshaping and evolving the way industries produce products and individuals live and work therefore, gaining massive attraction from academia, business, and politics. The manufacturing industries are optimistic regarding the opportunities that Industry 4.0 may offer such as improved efficiency, productivity and customization. The present research contributes to the Industry 4.0 literature by identifying, modeling, analyzing, and prioritizing the challenges in implementing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing industries. In doing so, the article first introduces the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to develop the hierarchical relationships among the challenges and analyzes their mutual interactions. Further, “Matrice d’Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliquee aun Classement” (MICMAC) analysis is used to categorize the challenges into four categories, namely autonomous, driver, dependent, and linkage based on their driving power and dependence power. Moreover, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) methodology is used to prioritize the challenges based on three criteria: driving power, dependence power, and change management. The hierarchical model developed through ISM methodology shows that “lack of vision and leadership from top management (C12), lack of skills training program and education (C2), and uncertainty of return on investment (C9)” are the major challenges in implementing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing industries. The findings of F-AHP analysis suggest that “lack of vision and leadership from top management (C12), lack of skilled workforce (C3), lack of skills training program and education (C2), and uncertainty of return on investment (C9)” are some of the major challenges of implementing Industry 4.0. Finally, the obtained results show how challenges affect other so that to uncover the root cause triggering the other challenges. The industrial practitioners and managers can then take advantage of these analyses to know which challenge acts as the main barrier in implementing Industry 4.0 and to be focused first in order to reach a solution.},

  abstract     = {Closed sequential pattern (CSP) mining is an optimization technique in sequential pattern mining because they produce more compact representations. Additionally, the runtime and memory usage required for mining CSPs is much lower than the sequential pattern mining. This task has fascinated numerous researchers. In this study, we propose a novel approach for closed clickstream pattern mining using C-List (CCPC) data structure. Closed clickstream pattern mining is a more specific task of CSP mining that has been lacking in research investment; nevertheless, it has promising applications in various fields. CCPC consists of two key steps: It initially builds the SPPC-tree and the C-List for each frequent 1-pattern and then determines all frequently closed clickstream 1-patterns; next, it constructs the C-List for each frequent k -pattern and mines the remaining frequently closed k -patterns. The proposed method is optimized by modifying the SPPC-tree structure and a new property is added into each node element in both the SPPC-tree and C-Lists to quickly prune nonclosed clickstream. Experimental results conducted on several datasets show that the proposed method is better than the previous techniques and improves the runtime and memory usage in most cases, especially when using low minimum support thresholds on the huge databases.},

Experiential knowledge relating to formal decisional events is collected, stored and used by the system in the form of set of experiences (SOEs). Here we discuss the working mechanism of the PIP module and show how experiential knowledge relating to the inspection of products that have features and functions in common can be used to enhance product inspection planning during early stages of product development. Our discussion commences with an introduction to fundamental concepts and a general system overview. We then describe the development of our SVPD system’s PIP module, and a case study we undertook for validation purposes. Results of the case study show that our system is capable of supporting product inspection planning in smart manufacturing, and thus has a vital role to play in Industry 4.0.},

  abstract     = {The dramatic deterioration in a corporate’s profitability not only threatens its own interests, employees, and investors, but can also impact external entities and people through financial losses and high risk exposure. Thus, in today’s turbulent market environments an essential issue arises as to how to set up an effective pre-warning model that provides managers with specific avenues to avoid financial troubles from getting worse and offers investors useful directions to adjust their investment portfolios. However, extant forecasting models are not yet capable of fully explaining the relationships between past and future performances, which may be due to the omission of some critical information. To capture the multidimensional nature of performance assessment, this study extends a singular data envelopment analysis (DEA) specification to multiple DEA specifications and further incorporates them with a risk-adjusted metric so as to present an overarching reflection of corporates’ operations. To make the outcome much more accessible to non-specialists, we utilize a visualization technique to represent the data’s main structure and then feed the analyzed data into a twin parametric-margin support vector machine (TPSVM) to construct the forecasting model. Due to the obscure nature of the SVM-based model, this study executes the multiple instances learning (MIL) algorithm to extract the inherent decision logics and to represent them in human readable way. After examining it with real cases, the proposed model is a promising alternative for performance assessment and forecasting.},

An illegitimate action of endeavoring to solicit sensitive and valuable information from user by masquerading as a truthful agent is called phishing. It involves the use of website and e-mail spoofing. A spoofed e-mail can be used to redirect a user to spoofed website which in turn can trick the user to reveal his valuable personal information. The traditional solutions for detecting spoofed or phishing websites are based on signature based methods. These methods are not able to detect the newly created spoofed websites or web pages. In order to solve this problem, researchers are coming up with machine learning methods. This paper brings out a diverse set of robust features categorized into the three categories, i.e., webpage, URL and HTML based features. The features under these categories are firstly used individually to classify webpages. Thereafter, a technique is proposed where the integration of all the features is used for classification purpose. The experimental results demonstrate that the features under URL based category are most effective in classifying the webpages. Further, there occurs a significant improvement in classification accuracy using proposed approach and random forest turns out to be the best classifier offering the accuracy of 99.5% with FPR and FNR as 0.006 and 0.005 respectively.},

  abstract     = {This research presents an efficient automatic thresholding technique based on Otsu’s method that can be used in edge detection algorithms and then applied as a plug-in for real-time image processing devices. The proposed thresholding technique uses an iterative clustering based method that targets a reduced number of operations. It is well known that the Otsu calculates the global threshold splitting the image into two classes, foreground and background, and choose the threshold that minimizes the interclass variance of the threshold black and white pixels. In this paper, a faster version of Otsu’s method is proposed knowing that the only pixels that have to be moved from one class to another class are the ones with values in between the previous two thresholds. This procedure yields the same set of thresholds as the original method but the redundant computation has been removed and, in this way, only few operations are required. The proposed thresholding technique has been implemented in software using C# programing language and in reconfigurable hardware on a Spartan 3E XC3S500E FPGA board using VHDL. The results obtained, presented for different digital images, confirm that the proposed iterative thresholding algorithm and architecture on FPGA can achieve the requirements to be included in real-time image processing systems.},
