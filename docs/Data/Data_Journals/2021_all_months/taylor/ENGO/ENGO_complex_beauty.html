  abstract     = {In this article, the multi-modal and multi-route transportation problem for hazardous materials under uncertainty is studied, and an interval 0–1 integer programming model is proposed to optimize the transportation risks and transportation costs during the transportation of hazardous materials. Factors such as freight rates and loading and unloading costs are different when the transportation modes, transportation time and transportation areas are different. Therefore, some parameters in the model are assumed as interval numbers. The proposed model is transformed to a deterministic model by the interval ranking method. In addition, a genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the model. Finally, a real-world case of the multi-modal and multi-route transportation problem for hazardous materials under uncertainty is studied to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of proposed model and algorithm.},

Constraints can be imposed on a component basis or system-wide, based on the resource flows. Optimization is performed by a genetic algorithm utilizing a variable-length genome. This specialized genome enables a more open-ended design capability than previous similar frameworks. Systems are evaluated through a user-defined simulation, and results can be presented in any trade space of interest based on the performance in the simulation. The framework is then applied to the design of a table as a simple proof of concept. In this problem, the framework was found to identify a design within 4% of the theoretical optimum 80% of the time, and within 8% of the theoretical optimum the remaining 20% of the time.},

The sensitivity expressions for minimizing the compliance or maximizing the fundamental natural frequency are derived in detail. Different thin feature constraints and the support structure constraints in different printing directions are investigated.

Coated structures with porous substrates (infills) are often adopted in additive manufacturing to reduce the material cost and printing time, while improving robustness against local bucking, unknown loads and material deficiencies. This article presents a new density filter method for the topology optimization of coated structures. Compared to previous work, the new method uses only the density filter and its projection, and does not rely on the gradient of the density field, which can pose a numerical challenge in large-scale problems. Since the output of the proposed density filter is bounded exactly between zero and one, it will also eliminate the need to approximate the maximum magnitude of the density gradient, the inaccuracy of which can cause non-uniform thickness of the coating. The proposed filter also realizes a smoother change between substrate material and coating material, and encourages the merging and splitting of coatings during optimization. Several numerical examples on compliance minimization are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed density filter.},

In response, this research proposes a mathematical model for optimal clustering of garbage containers or bins (referred to as customers) for solid waste collection. The model’s objective function is to define the customers of each cluster such that the transportation costs within each cluster and between the hubs and depots are minimized, and the satisfaction of the clusters’ demand mean and variance is maximized. The optimization model was illustrated on solid waste collection for 20 customers, where the results showed that the proposed model is found to be effective in optimizing the waste collection process.

A simplified control law is used to convert the optimal low-thrust transfer problem into a parameter optimization problem, where the gains of control law are optimized to determine the time-minimum trajectories. An adaptive kriging-assisted two-stage optimization framework is developed to solve the optimization problem. In the first stage, the kriging metamodels are constructed to replace the expensive transfer model for optimization. The kriging metamodels are gradually refined via a probability of constrained improvement-based infill sampling process to efficiently determine an initial guess of the gains. In the second stage, a sequential quadratic programming-based local search is conducted to precisely compute the gains. Finally, two engineering examples are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization scheme for solving real-world low-thrust GEO transfer optimization problems.},

To suppress dependence of the initial guess for the parameterized level-set-based topology optimization, the solid isotropic material with penalization method is adopted to generate the initial topology design. Then, the parameterized level-set method is further performed to obtain the optimal shape. The material volume is strictly controlled by restricting the coefficients of radial basis functions within a dynamic bound, which can avoid incorrect topological results due to topological changes.

  abstract     = {The demands for a high-performance prosthesis include high strength and low weight. This study addresses the optimization of a new tube concept, made of composite material, which makes use of an isogrid and internal layer. For the methodological procedure, a response surface methodology (RSM) was used to define in what quantity, under what conditions and which data should be collected during a given experiment, seeking to satisfy the highest statistical precision and the lowest cost in the response. After RSM analysis, the finite element method was used for structural calculations for each condition of the experiment. The numerical results allowed the creation of a meta-model capable of translating the global structural behaviour. Thus, it was possible to optimize the parameters that were translated as responses applied to a lattice structure by particle swarm optimization and the Lichtenberg algorithm (LA). Comparison of the results demonstrated the good performance of the LA.},

By integrating scheduling and vehicle routing problems for perishable products, this study tries to minimize costs and maximize customers’ purchase probability. In the scheduling stage, a flexible flowshop scheduling problem considering production quality is studied. After completion of the last job, the distribution stage begins and each product must be delivered in its time-window. This problem is formulated as mixed-integer linear programming and solved by the GAMS solver. Owing to the NP hardness of this problem, a hyper-heuristic is proposed to solve large-size instances. In the proposed algorithm, the acceptance of the solution is based on the Monte Carlo criterion. Finally, the numerical results and analysis demonstrate the proposed algorithm’s superiority on some criteria compared to the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II).},

This article reviews approaches from the literature focusing on computer aided design environments, sampling methods, data analytics and optimization techniques for design and sizing optimization with finite-element models. The evaluated approaches are integrated into a Python-based optimization environment. Accordingly, the introduced methodology enables the environment to handle geometrically infeasible designs. The presentation of the first results focuses on the feasibility of structural assemblies and the results demonstrate the viability of NSGA-II for optimization tasks. The example considers the design of a generic b-pillar structure under crash-safety requirements.

  abstract     = {In this work, a topology optimization (TO) based framework for functional grading of triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) based lattice structures is developed, implemented and demonstrated. Material interpolation laws of the gyroid, G-prime and Schwarz-D surfaces are derived by numerical homogenization for transversely isotropic elasticity and are represented as convex combinations of solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) and rational approximation of material properties (RAMP) models. These convex combinations are implemented in the TO-based compliance problem with new upper and lower bounds on the density variables representing the volume fraction limits of the lattices. The lower bound on the density variables is treated by introducing a sigmoid filter in the optimization loop forcing densities below the lower boundary towards zero. The optimal density solution is represented by Shepard interpolations or radial basis function networks, which, in turn, are utilized for the thickness grading of the TPMS-based lattices. In addition, the global boundary of the lattice structure is identified by support vector machines. Finally, a standard triangle language (STL) file is generated from the implicit surfaces by using marching cubes, which is utilized for further studies by nonlinear finite element analysis and to set up 3D printing of the optimal component quickly. The framework is demonstrated for the established L-shaped benchmark and the well-known General Electric engine bracket.},

Ahead of an auctioning process, the company should decide which deliveries should be served by its fleet and which can be assigned to the occasional drivers.

The IMOPSO is applied to the component parameter optimization to find the Pareto optimal solution set that provides a wide range of options for HHV powertrain design successfully. In order to improve the management control effect of the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), the equivalence factors (EFs) are optimized offline by the IMOPSO to obtain the EF map between different torque demands and the state of charge of the accumulator, and further, to establish the online ECMS with the EFs optimized by the IMOPSO (I-ECMS).

The POD method is adopted to extract the principal component of the snapshot matrix, which collects mode shapes of representative configurations. The objective of the iterative process is to find the global ROB with enough prediction accuracy in the entire design space. Once the global ROB has been constructed, the optimization design for vibration reduction is performed by reduced-order models. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are verified through an example of an S-shape stiffened curved shell. The proposed global ROB obtains similar optimal results to the mode-superposition method, with 33.51% computational cost saving.},

A series of computational experiments is conducted on a diverse set of test functions to benchmark the optimization performance of the HB2O against six commonly used alternative optimizers, and to validate the effectiveness of AEI against four alternative acquisition functions. The computational results show that the proposed HB2O can robustly converge on the functions’ optima with limited simulation samples, and it significantly outperforms other optimizers for various test functions.

A data-driven predictive maintenance policy is proposed for maximizing the system reliability and minimizing the maximum repair time, considering both budget and human resources constraints. Therefore, a data-driven algorithm is designed for extracting component breakage probabilities. Then, two bi-objective optimization approaches are proposed for determining the set of components to repair. The former is based on the formulation of a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model solved through the AUGMEnted ε -CONstraint (AUGMECON) method.

  abstract     = {An enhanced permutation search (EPS) algorithm is proposed for stacking sequence optimization of simply supported orthotropic plates to maximize the buckling load. By taking advantage of the approximate linear superposition regular of buckling load factor and accounting for the nonlinear effects of buckling mode as well as the non-dimensional anisotropic coefficients, the stacking sequence design is decomposed to three phases. First, the best ply orientations are identified using the sequential permutation table with multiple buckling modes. Secondly, the stacking sequence is designed from the mid-plane to the outermost position sequentially within a nested-loop search accounting for the buckling mode. Thirdly, the signs of the ply orientations are designed independently to control the bending–twisting coupling effects. Numerical examples are presented to verify the robustness and efficiency of the EPS, and the results are compared with those of heuristic algorithms. Better optimal solutions are obtained by EPS, with higher efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In the production process of open-pit mines, transportation costs account for 45–60% of the total cost. Therefore, a reasonable and economic transportation system can effectively improve production efficiency. In this article, optimization of the layout of the fixed crushing station in the in-pit crusher and conveyor system of open-pit mining is studied. First, the entire ore body is discretized into multiple ore blocks. By calculating the transportation distance between each block and the crushing station, an optimized model for minimizing the total transportation work is established. Finally, combining the advantages of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and quantum PSO (QPSO), a two-stage fusion particle swarm optimization algorithm (TSF-PSO) is designed to solve the model, and the effectiveness of the model is verified by actual cases. Experimental data show that, compared with the PSO and QPSO algorithms, the solution efficiency of the TSF-PSO algorithm is improved by 2.83% and 1.48%, respectively.},

It is observed that SGO is not able to identify the damage in the structures owing to the algorithm becoming trapped in local optima. To improve the performance of SGO, a modified social group optimization (MSGO) is proposed, which deals with the drawbacks of SGO in dealing with the complicated objective functions of civil structures.

To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, design optimization of various sandwich panels is evaluated. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of unit cells, core height, stiffener configuration and impact load intensity on the optimal designs. Up to 50% reduction in weight, 30% increase in energy absorption and 30% decrease in boundary reaction forces are achieved.

Based on the law of total variance in successive intervals without overlapping and the dual-stage adaptive kriging (AK) model-based importance sampling (IS) method, an efficient dimensionality-independent method is proposed. First, an interval-conditional failure probability-based formula is established. Secondly, a dual-stage AK model is embedded into the formula to construct the IS probability density function and identify the state (failed or safe) of every IS sample. Thirdly, using different partitions of IS samples, all inputs’ FPGSIs can be simultaneously obtained by taking the corresponding subdomains’ samples into the proposed computational formula.

  abstract     = {Many engineering design problems are associated with computationally expensive and time-consuming simulations for design evaluation. In such problems, each candidate design should be selected carefully, even though it means extra algorithmic complexity. This study develops the Proximity-based Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (PSA-EA) that aims at handling both single-objective and multi-objective computationally expensive problems. It controls the trade-off between exploration and exploitation by defining proximity and trust regions around high-fidelity solutions. The proximity measure aims to maximize the diversity of information about specific regions of the search space and to improve the goodness of the surrogate for future cycles simultaneously. The method employs an ensemble of metamodels and a parallel infill criterion. PSA-EA is evaluated and compared to a recently developed surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm on ten test problems. Thereafter, a case study involving a multi-objective design optimization of the cylinder head water jacket of a vehicle engine is presented and discussed.

Surrogates constructed using MSE are poorly optimized using gradient-based optimizers. Hence, Nelder–Mead like optimizers are often favoured, which is unfortunate as surrogates make analytical gradients freely available and gradient-based optimizers scale better with increasing dimension. To address this shortcoming, this article proposes a new Cross-Validation (CV) approach, by optimizing the surrogate and computing the Mean Optimizer Distance (MOD-CV) to the best design in the surrogate. Four experimental CV measures are compared on seven test problems and it is demonstrated that the performance of gradient-based optimizers can be significantly enhanced, with a possible 97% improvement in MOD-CV over MSE-CV using Sequential Least-Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP). Additionally, surrogates constructed using MOD-CV outperform surrogates constructed with MSE-CV, 80% of the time when optimized with SLSQP and 68% when optimized with Nelder-Mead.},

In this article, the proposed heuristic similarity control methods like the Energy Scaling Method (ESM), weak passive material method, and an intuitive method of modified design domain are compared with the formal mathematical method of Optimality Criteria (OC)-based Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) with a similarity constraint. Initially, the methods are coupled with Hybrid Cellular Automata (HCA) and OC-based SIMP for the TO of a cantilever beam under a static point load. The ESM is found to be the most effective and further tested for similarity-based TO with HCA in crash loading scenarios.

However, these approaches are based on Monte Carlo simulations and double-loop approaches such that most of them would be time consuming for high target reliability levels or high dimensional problems. To improve the efficiency of surrogate-based RBDO, this article proposes a Single-Loop Approach (SLA) combined with the Kriging surrogate. This Kriging model is updated efficiently by using the Most Probable Points (MPPs) from the last SLA iteration. A very simple and effective stopping criterion is proposed. Compared with other sampling methods, the initial Kriging can be started with very few training points and converges to the right optimum very efficiently. Three mathematical examples and a practical engineering problem are used to demonstrate the effectiveness, the advantages and also the limitations of this method.},

Then, a continuous adjoint method including the adjoint to the Laplace grid displacement model was used to recompute sensitivity derivatives. To shed more light and to support the authors&#39; findings, an alternative continuous adjoint method for computing the objective function gradient in terms of the field integrals of grid sensitivities was also formulated and programmed.

MGP models are used to estimate the relationship models for physical experiments with input uncertainty, and a covariance structure with the input noise distribution is constructed. Then an optimization scheme integrating the quality loss function and tolerance cost function is built to find the compromise solutions. The optimal solution is selected from the Pareto set by using grey relation analysis (GRA) technique. Two examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can obtain optimal settings that minimize quality loss and tolerance cost simultaneously.},

TAL assumes that each mated workstation contains two workstations in parallel, and it can process tasks on the left, on the right or on either side. However, in a traditional TAL, only one worker is responsible for completing the task at each workstation. Dealing with large-size products and massive operations may require more than one operator to perform tasks. This study proposes mixed-integer linear programming and constraint programming (CP) models for the two-sided assembly line balancing problem with multi-operator stations for the purpose of solving small- and large-size problems. Computational results indicate that the CP model finds optimal solutions for all instances. It is useful to highlight that the CP model is highly concise and solved by a black-box, commercial solver.},

In this study, the maximum nodal displacement is formulated as a sole constraint. The p -mean aggregation function is adopted to efficiently treat a mass of local displacement constraints imposed on nodes in the user-specified region. The sensitivities of the objective and constraint functions with respect to relative densities are derived. The effect of the aggregate parameter on the final design is further investigated through numerical examples. By comparison with final designs from the traditional formulation, i.e. minimization end compliance with the volume fraction constraint, or minimization of total volume subject to multiple nodal displacement constraints, the optimized results clearly demonstrate the necessity for and efficiency of the present approach.},

The morphable bars and embedded holes are then projected onto multiple density fields to avoid remeshing the grids. A Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP)-like multi-material interpolation scheme that considers embedding holes is introduced for material parameterization. Several numerical examples are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation. It is seen that far fewer design variables are involved in the present formulation for multi-material topology optimization when compared to the existing optimization framework with embedded movable holes.},

For this purpose, considering open channels with uniform and composite roughness, fixed and variable freeboard, and also velocity, Froude number and flooding probability constraints, eight models were defined. The performance of HBP in terms of convergence rate was investigated using 10 random runs, and the resulting coefficient of variation for different models was 0.00001–0.002. Solutions of HBP were also compared to those of other optimization algorithms. The results indicated that using HBP, compared to BA, PSO, LINGO, Lagrange multiplier method and shuffled frog-leaping algorithm, led to a 32% saving in construction cost. Therefore, HBP has high potential for the optimal design of open channels.},

The generic model was first validated using appropriate experimental data and further utilized in evaluating crashworthiness performance under various design conditions. Statistical analysis of the system response reveals the necessary design considerations required to achieve improved crashworthiness. A multi-criteria optimization study was conducted using the resulting statistical models and suitable optimization algorithms.

Manual preferences and selection are required to obtain a single implementable solution from the obtainable Pareto set. For achieving such a single optimum, the multi-scenario property is applied to adjust the required preference weights automatically; as a result, robust performance for various scenarios is provided. The robust quality definition is believed to decrease the performance uncertainty owing to any possible scenario in real-world settings. These challenges have motivated the creation of a method that searches a robust solution using evolutionary algorithms and well-applied IT tools. This selection process applies two robustness aspects simultaneously: the necessary weights for the aggregation of multi-scenario and multi-objective dimensions are adjusted to obtain similar performances for scenarios as much as possible; the robustness against system parameters is evaluated by the calculation of the robustness indices. The method can be used universally where the robust optimum is required for a model having multi-scenario and multi-objective properties. The proposed method has been tested on test functions, and in conclusion it has been applied to two engineering problems.},

Mathematical programming models are used to optimize long-term open pit production planning problems. In real mines with several thousands of blocks and several scheduling periods, however, these methods lose their efficiency by increasing the number of decision variables, and it is almost impossible to solve and obtain a solution in a reasonable time using current solvers. In this paper, a new method based on block clustering was proposed to reduce the model size. In the first step, blocks are aggregated in clusters called “mother clusters” using the concept of clustering as a mathematical programming problem and solved using Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the second step, the mother clusters are converted to the mining clusters considering the practicality issues. The results of implementing the proposed method on a real deposit showed that block clustering could decrease the number of binary variables from 476,100 to 5,652. This led to a significant reduction in solution time from 372 hours to 23.4 seconds compared to the original block model. The clustering strategy was also able to realize more than 82% of the NPV obtained from scheduling original blocks.},

This MMAL problem was investigated to achieve three minimization objectives: total set-up cost, number of work overload situations, and total earliness and tardiness costs, according to the specified priority of orders. Accordingly, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm was developed for the proposed NP-hard model and the algorithm parameters were tuned by applying the Taguchi technique to the experimental design.

  abstract     = {In this article, online collaborative content caching in wireless networks is studied from a network economics point of view. The cache optimization problem is first modelled as a finite horizon Markov decision process that incorporates an auto-regressive model to forecast the evolution of the content demands. The complexity of the problem grows exponentially with the system parameters, and even though a good approximation to the cost-to-go can be found, the single-stage decision problem is still NP-hard. To deal with cache optimization in industrial-size networks, a novel methodology called rolling horizon is proposed that solves the dimensionality of the problem by freezing the cache decisions for a short number of periods to construct a value function approximation. Then, to address the NP-hardness of the single-stage decision problem, two simplifications/reformulations are examined: (a) to limit the number of content replicas in the network and (b) to limit the allowed content replacements. The results show that the proposed approach can reduce the communication cost by over 84% compared to that of running least recently used updates on offline schemes in collaborative caching. The results also shed light on the trade-off between the efficiency of the caching policy and the time needed to run the online cache optimization algorithm.},

This is, for example, of interest for design problems related to crashworthiness design. Because of the noisy or discontinuous character of the responses, in these cases it is very hard or nearly impossible to find or approximate meaningful gradient information. Hence, an evolutionary method is attractive because it does not need gradients; however, to ensure numerical efficiency, a low-dimensional explicit representation of the geometric parameters is required, which is available via the moving morphable components (MMC) approach. The aim of this article is to present a new strategy to improve the efficiency and convergence speed of evolutionary topology optimization based on MMC.

  abstract     = {This article presents a multi-objective optimal design method for a squeeze film damper (SFD) with centring spring. The proposed method is able to obtain the optimal design parameters for a flexible rotor system. The objectives are minimizing the amplitude of the disk and transmitted force, and maximizing the SFD effectiveness simultaneously. These objectives generally conflict with each other, and the optimal values of the design parameters, or Pareto set, are obtained using the cell mapping method for different rotor imbalances with dynamic constraints. Three SFDs are designed and manufactured based on the obtained Pareto set, and experiments are conducted. The experimental results correspond with numerical simulation results, and the conflicting nature between objectives is validated in the case study. The proposed multi-objective optimization algorithm offers a novel and effective tool for designing SFDs. Engineers can refer to an optimal solution set with strong robustness against different demands, rather than a single design.},

  abstract     = {Machining level and manufacturing accuracy have an important influence on the reliability of turbomachinery flow physics and dynamic performance. This article proposes a hybrid uncertainty analysis method for fluid dynamics problems with manufacturing constraints. The parameters with sufficient and insufficient experimental samples are processed by the stochastic method and interval method, respectively, which can quickly solve the difficulties of epistemic uncertainty modelling caused by the lack of experimental samples. On this basis, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the hybrid reliability model based on the update response surface, and the interval of the failure probability of fluid dynamics for turbomachinery is calculated. Two examples of cooling axial flow and centrifugal turbomachinery are given to verify the validity of the proposed method. The results show that the reliability of the turbomachinery flow performance can be significantly improved by increasing the uncertainty level of key parameters.},

While mathematically optimal strategies can support SWM decision making, they may not be readily implementable because of unmodelled objectives ( e.g. practical limitations, social preferences, political and management considerations). A mathematical programming technique extending SWOLF is used to systematically identify, for several scenarios, different ‘optimal’ SWM strategies that are maximally different from each other in terms of waste flows, while meeting modelled objectives and constraints. The performance with respect to unmodelled issues was analysed to demonstrate the flexibility in potential strategies. Practitioner feedback highlighted implementation challenges due to existing practices; however, insights gained from this exercise led to more plausible and acceptable strategies by incrementally modifying the initial SWM alternatives generated.},

To address the shortage problem, this article applies a redundancy optimization theory to realize a reasonable and practical design of the anchorage capacity. A new concept of anchorage capacity reliability and its calculation method, via an anchorage capacity probability evaluation model, are proposed. A multi-objective optimization model with maximum anchorage capacity reliability and minimum anchorage redundant area is established. Furthermore, a case study of a container terminal in northern China is adopted to verify the performance of the proposed concept and methodology. Model results show that anchorage capacity reliability can effectively reflect the anchorage capacity uncertainty, and the redundancy optimization model can help to reasonably determine the anchorage capacity.},

The significance of determination of an optimal sequence for improved geometrical quality is substantial. Previously, genetic algorithms have been studied for defining the optimal sequence. However, these algorithms are highly dependent on the internal parameters, requiring additional computational analysis and thereby extended evaluation time. In this article, a novel robust stepwise algorithm is introduced to determine the optimal weld sequence. Application of the proposed algorithm leads to drastic time improvements for defining the optimal weld sequence of each assembly. Three industrial assemblies are evaluated. Comparison with the previously applied population-based optimization algorithms indicates that the optimization time can be reduced drastically with the proposed stepwise algorithm. The stepwise algorithm is intended to be applied in a geometry assurance digital twin, where the assembly parameters are being optimized for each individual assembly.},

To overcome this limitation, this study investigates a two-stage three-machine flow-shop assembly problem with a truncation learning function where the makespan criterion (completion of the last job) is minimized. Given that the proposed model is NP hard, dominance rules, lemmas and a lower bound are derived and applied to the branch-and-bound method.

Furthermore, the total test time is limited, with the inspection interval and the number of inspections as the design variables.

Based on PSO, the proposed algorithm divides the swarm into subgroups to mimic different behaviours of a social spider colony. Particles are classified in each iteration and then a variety of search strategies is adopted. Specifically, dominant male particles aim to search the neighbourhood, while negative female particles tend to search in the opposite direction to enhance the diversity. Meanwhile, positive female particles and non-dominant male particles are designed to balance the potential impact. Various commonly used benchmark functions and truss structural designs are tested for comparison. The results indicate that the proposed SSI-PSO is effective and efficient.},

However, a criterion of minimum energy consumption for a combination of objective arrival and passing times is applied to avoid the gaps that could appear in Pareto fronts. The multi-dimensional set of speed profiles obtained by means of the proposed algorithm can help railway operators to make better decisions when designing timetables.

The comparison is done by minimizing different norms of the residual vector of the leave-one-out cross-validation errors for linear, affine and convex combinations of 10 metamodels. The norms are taken to be the taxicab, the Euclidean and the infinity norm, respectively. The ensemble of metamodels consists of quadratic regression, Kriging with linear or quadratic bias, radial basis function networks with a-priori linear or quadratic bias, radial basis function networks with a-posteriori linear or quadratic bias, polynomial chaos expansion, support vector regression and least squares support vector regression. Eight benchmark functions are studied as ‘black-boxes’ using Halton and Hammersley samplings. The optimal ensembles are established for either one of the samplings and then the corresponding root mean square errors are established using the other sampling and vice versa. In total, 80 different test cases (5 formulations, 8 benchmarks and 2 samplings) are studied and presented. In addition, an established design optimization problem is solved using affine and convex combinations. It is concluded that minimization of the taxicab or Euclidean norm of the residual vector of the leave-one-out cross-validation errors for convex combinations of metamodels produces the best ensemble of metamodels.},

  abstract     = {An important challenge in damage detection based on the curvature mode shape (CMS) method is recognizing damage severity in damaged structures. Here, an efficient approach is proposed based on the finite element (FE) method, which detects the existence, location and severity of damage using the distributed genetic algorithm in conjunction with CMS. First, using the mode shape of the structure, curvature is calculated at the nodes of the structure in the FE model. By comparing the curvature between the intact and damaged structures, the existence and location of damage are determined. Next, by defining an optimization problem, damage severity in the damaged elements is determined. Results of applying the proposed approach on beam and frame structures under various damage scenarios and an experimental set-up show that this method is very effective in damage detection of such structures. Furthermore, the performance and accuracy of the proposed method are examined for various noise levels.},

The first-stage kriging model between the nodes and level-set values is developed, and a new blank holder structure can be determined according to a level-set threshold. The second-stage kriging model between the level sets and forming quality is then developed. The second-stage kriging model is updated based on a parallel infilling strategy.

The reduced function evaluations method is used as an efficient tool for structural reliability analysis, while a novel algorithm is proposed for efficient structural optimization. Excessive interstorey drifts of a building and absolute accelerations of its floors are considered as failure events in calculating the probability of failure of the building. The uncertainty regarding the characteristics of future earthquakes is accounted for by applying a probabilistic approach. The effects of pulse components of stochastic pulse-wise ground motions, fixity factor of semi-rigid beam-to-column connections and values of different parameters of LCVAs on the performance and safety of semi-rigidly connected steel-framed buildings are investigated.},

The grades used and the arrangement of the lamellas define the quality of the floorboard produced. This results in a large number of pattern permutations that must be considered during production planning. Hence, a mixed integer program is developed here in order to minimize the total production cost. First, it is shown how to reduce the number of patterns without constraining the feasible region. Secondly, numerical studies with different pattern selection strategies are carried out. This reveals that only a very small fraction of the total number of patterns is necessary in order to achieve results which are close to the global optimum and fast enough for an industrial application.},

A cutoff constraint added to each subproblem ensures that the objective function value of the original MILP problem improves at each iteration. If no integer feasible solution to the MILP subproblem can be found, a neighbourhood search is used to repair the infeasibility.

This work develops an enhanced beam search heuristic algorithm to solve types 1 and 2 U-shaped assembly line balancing problems (UALBP-1 and UALBP-2). The proposed beam search heuristic is enhanced by utilizing: (1) five lower bounds and four dominance rules to prune the dominated partial solutions; (2) a new station load selection criterion to select station load with a smaller lower bound, less idle time and fewer ‘easy’ tasks; and (3) a new method to extend partial solutions based on heuristic information to encourage full station load. Extensive numerical study is carried out to test and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for both UALBP-1 and UALBP-2 by achieving 33 and 31 new optimal solutions for UALBP-1 and UALBP-2, respectively.},

First, the unconditional–conditional FFPs are equivalently transformed into the integrals of the unconditional–conditional failure probabilities (FPs) by an introduced variable related to the fuzzy state assumption. The unconditional–conditional FPs can be further expressed as the integrals of the unconditional–conditional probability density functions (PDFs) of the output. Secondly, the unconditional–conditional PDFs are solved using the maximum entropy theory constrained by the unconditional–conditional fractional moments. These fractional moments can be solved simultaneously through the multiplicative dimensional reduction using the same group of Gaussian quadrature points. The computational cost of the proposed method grows linearly with the dimensionality, and the computational efficiency is greatly improved.},

To tackle this, ensemble models that combine different surrogate models have been developed based on global measures and local measures respectively. This article proposes a novel ensemble of surrogates to take advantage of both global and local measures, and a unified strategy is conceived over the entire design space with proper trade-off between these two measures. The effectiveness of the proposed model is tested with 38 mathematical problems and an engineering optimization example.

  abstract     = {An engineered cluster-based genetic algorithm (ECGA) has been used for performance-based design optimization of two dimensional moment-resisting steel frames (MRSF) considering effects of the soil-structure interaction (SSI). Based on the engineering judgments and via using simple specified filters on defined constrained of the problem, an engineered population is generated. To impose this concept for increasing efficiency of the genetic algorithm (GA), first, engineered populations are generated, and then linear analysis of the structure is performed to check some of the constraints, finally in the case of satisfying the first stage constraints, nonlinear static analysis is carried out. The nonlinear spring model has been used to model SSI of the frames in OpenSees software. The constructed model in the OpenSees has been coupled with the GA optimization technique in MATLAB software to minimize weight of the structural elements. Efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated.},

In this method, first presented by Zou et al. [ Engineering Optimization 48(7), 2016], the system level coordinates each subsystem based on sensitivity information. Test results suggest that the SCM is robust and efficient; however, for complex engineering problems the computing cost is significant. In this article, the SCM is improved by adopting the optimum sensitivity derivatives as the sensitivity information for global objective F in the system level. The performance of the improved SCM is demonstrated by a numerical test example, and the results show that the solutions and computational efficiency are both improved. The potential of the improved SCM is then demonstrated by structural optimization of the wings of an unmanned aerial vehicle family. The difference between the individual design and family design of wing structures is further investigated.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing truss structures considering natural frequency constraints can fundamentally enhance their dynamic behaviour under transient loadings. In this regard, the current investigation assesses the search capability of the interactive fuzzy search algorithm (IFSA) in solving this class of problem. Since the natural frequencies are very sensitive to configuration changes in the system, throughout the optimization process the algorithm should be able to adaptively shift its search behaviour. To meet this aim, the IFSA utilizes two nine-rule fuzzy modules which permanently monitor the optimization process and try to balance the exploration and exploitation search behaviours of the algorithm. Then, the search capability of the proposed method is tested on five structural benchmark problems. The numeric results reveal that the IFSA, by systematically reducing the number of ineffective iterations, considerably decreases the required computational cost. In addition, considering solution accuracy and process stability, IFSA provides promising results in solving structural optimization problems.},

Formulations for the sound pressure or sound power radiation in an integral form are derived in terms of mutual kinetic and strain energy densities. These integrals lead to novel physical response functions for solving the proposed optimization problem to design graded damping materials. The response function derived for individual frequency is utilized to solve the multi-objective optimization problem of minimizing sound pressure at the reference point for excitations with a range of frequencies.

The determination of Chaboche kinematic hardening parameters from experimental data is not well defined and the same is true for the cyclic yield stress. These parameters are interdependent and need optimization, maintaining the same hierarchy of dependence. Therefore, in the present work, evolutionary search algorithms are implemented in nested applications to find the material parameters phenomenologically. The main coding is done in MATLAB ® , while the objective function is evaluated in the ABAQUS finite element simulation environment. Necessary extraction of the field outputs is achieved by PYTHON scripting. The optimum material parameters offer good simulation of the actual material behaviour in cyclic plastic loading.},

To date, lot scheduling researchers have assumed that all lots have identical processing times. In this study, variable lot processing times are considered; specifically, the setting where the processing time of the lots is position dependent, reflecting general position-dependent processing time properties, e.g. learning/ageing effects. Three special cases are examined: minimizing the total completion time, minimizing the makespan, and minimizing the linear combination of the makespan and the total completion time.

This work proposes a new Parallel Constrained EGO (PC-EGO) algorithm to extend the C-EGO algorithm to parallel computing. The proposed PC-EGO algorithm is tested on sixteen analytical problems as well as one real-world engineering problem. The experiment results show that the proposed PC-EGO algorithm converges significantly faster and finds better solutions on the test problems compared to the standard C-EGO algorithm.

The soil is assumed to be elastic–perfectly plastic material with an associated flow rule, and a solution procedure for the ultimate bearing capacity is established based on the virtual work principle. The results show that IRMO can calculate the ultimate bearing capacities efficiently, accurately and stably.

The models under study take into account that cables cannot cross each other, which, particularly in instances with restrictive cable capacity, can make it attractive to let cables follow a joint trajectory, and visit turbines without connecting to them. A two-layered optimization process is developed. The outer layer is associated with an integer programming problem, which is subject to simultaneous generation of rows and columns representing cable paths. In the inner layer, a problem identifying feasible low cost paths is solved, guided by optimal dual variable values in the continuous relaxation of the former problem.

Fourteen human subjects were recruited to collect motion and ground reaction force data in the laboratory. Twelve subjects’ data were used to determine cost function weights. The other two subjects’ data were used to validate the best MOO objective function weights through the root mean square errors and Pearson coefficients between the simulated and experimental data. The results show that the proposed MOO method and the best weighting coefficients could improve the accuracy of the simulation.},

  abstract     = {This article considers linear multi-objective programming problems with block angular structure, which are analogous to multi-disciplinary optimization environments where disciplines must collaborate to achieve a common overall goal. In this decentralized environment, a mechanism to guide locally optimized decision makers’ solutions to a Pareto-optimal solution without sharing the entire local information is developed. The mechanism is based on an augmented Lagrangian approach to generate a solution and is separated into two phases: phase I determines an ideal point for each of the single objectives and phase II searches for a compromise solution starting from a single ideal point. Theoretical results show that the algorithm converges and the solution generated is Pareto optimal. The algorithm’s effectiveness is demonstrated via an illustrative example and a real-world bi-objective re-entrant flow-shop production planning problem. The real-world experimental results showed that the decentralized method had an average 50% better performance compared to other centralized methods.},

The method enables the maintenance of high values of schedule evaluation indicators in variable conditions, such as stability robustness and quality robustness. The frequency of a machine failure is described by the Maxwell distribution. Formulae for different reliability characteristics are given. The parameters of the distribution are estimated using maximum likelihood, empirical moments and a method based on the renewal theory. The advantage of the last method is the ability to achieve accurate predictions of failure-free time of a machine, when there is a lack of complementary and reliable historical data. In the related literature, only the first method is used to estimate unknown parameters of the probability distribution. The methods are applied to job-shop scheduling problems to evaluate their impact on achieving predictive schedules.},

According to the GSA results, the filtered structural parameters are used to optimize the thermal performance of the heat sink, and several optimization algorithms (genetic algorithm, differential evolution, teaching–learning-based optimization, particle swarm optimization and efficient global optimization) are used for optimization. The steady thermal response of the PINS with the optimized heat sink is also studied, and the result shows that the maximum temperature of the high-temperature region of the platform is reduced by 1.08°C compared with the PINS without the heat sink.},

In this article, a deterministic mathematical programming approach is proposed, aiming to minimize the cost of looped WDNs, considering known pipe lengths and a discrete set of commercially available diameters. The optimization model constraints are mass balances in nodes, energy balances in loops and hydraulic equations, in such a way that no additional software is needed to find the appropriate pressure drops and water velocities. Generalized disjunctive programming is used to reformulate the discrete optimization problem to a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) environment is used to solve the problem. Four cases are studied to test the applicability of the model and the results show compatibility with the literature.},

  abstract     = {Rail–road container terminals can be seen as buffers within a large logistics network encompassing hinterland distribution systems. They are used as temporary storage points for containers such that unloading operations from a train and loading operations onto a truck need not be synchronized. Container transferring operation implemented by gantry cranes is one of the most important issues to ensure efficient logistics. To enable efficient container transfer, this article considers the special features of container movement, and integrates the starting position and the ending position of container movement into the gantry crane scheduling problem. In order to solve the proposed problem, this article develops two models: first using mixed integer programming, and secondly using constraint programming (CP). Since the problem is computationally intractable for realistic sizes, this article also proposes a logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) methodology to solve it. This method exploits a natural decomposition of the studied problem into a relaxed master problem (RMP) solved by mixed integer programming (MIP), and a series of sub-problems, solved separately by MIP and CP. Computational experiments are performed on generated instances, the structures of which are designed to follow the practical application. The computational results show that the CP approach is better suited to solve the proposed problem with small-sized and medium-sized instances compared with MIP and LBBD. In addition, the LBBD framework is far superior to mixed integer programming on all but a few small instances, and it is highly effective in finding good-quality solutions for larger cases with up to 100 tasks within a reasonable runtime. Moreover, the results find that LBBD using constraint programming to solve the sub-problems usually outperforms LBBD with mixed integer programming on the instances tested.},
