In general, biometrics are data that owns fuzzy properties but the authors in this paper have neglected this technical point and the biometric information was authenticated using a hash function. Since the output of a hash function is sensitive to the input it cannot be applied to verify the validity of fuzzy data such as biometrics. Since this scheme is based on a hash function for biometric verification, it must not be used in real applications. The authors alerted the issue to the Editor and Publisher and all have agreed to retract the article to ensure the integrity of the scholarly record. We have been informed in our decision-making by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retractions. The retracted article will remain online to maintain the scholarly record, but it will be digitally watermarked on each page as ‘Retracted’.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been introduced into smart grids, which has achieved great improvement. The statistics of power consumption is one of the important functions but could lead to the leakage of user daily behaviour. Researchers have put efforts into secure data aggregation protocols to avoid such potential risk. However, only a few schemes have considered the dynamic unit price of electricity, and no schemes have been designed for calculating the power consumption of every appliance in a specific area. This paper proposes a novel appliance-based data aggregation scheme (ABDAS) for bill generation and demand management in smart grids. In the proposed scheme, chameleon hash function (CHF) is utilised to facilitate the extraction of aggregated data due to the characteristic of collision controllability. Furthermore, indistinguishability obfuscation (IO) is utilised to keep the chameleon hash value secret and decrease the overhead of the trusted third party. The fog nodes (FNs) in our scheme are responsible for the calculation of aggregation with its powerful computing and storage capabilities. The security analysis shows that our scheme satisfies IND-CPA and multiple security goals. Additionally, the performance evaluation indicates that the computational overhead of our scheme is lower than that of existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Dispatching and Control Cloud (DCC) is a cloud platform constructed by State Grid Corporation with the technology of cloud computing. DCC has improved the overall operation and monitoring capabilities, the smart level and many other advantages of power grid. However, the development of DCC has been hampered by security and privacy issues. Secure unified identity authentication, access control and authorisation management are significant topics in DCC. To find out a solution for the topics above, we have employed some encryption schemes using the attribute-based encryption(ABE), as ABE can preserve users&#39; privacy and achieve access control with fine grain over the encrypted information. SM9 is a kind of Chinese official standard in the field of cryptography, which contains the SM9 encryption algorithm (SM9-IBE). In this paper, an ABE scheme based on SM9-IBE is proposed, making SM9 support fine-grained access control which would be better applied in DCC. Our proposed scheme (SM9-ABE) has been proven to be of great security in the selective CPA model under DBDH assumption. Furthermore, we implement SM9-ABE and evaluate its practical performance. The implementation indicates our scheme performs well in the matter of security and functionality, at an additional time cost which is acceptable.},

  abstract     = {Malware detection is a fundamental task and associated with significant applications in humanities, cybersecurity, and social media analytics. In some of the relevant studies, there is substantial evidence that heterogeneous ensembles can provide very reliable solutions, better than any individual verification model. However, so far, there is no systematic study of examining the application of ensemble methods in this task. This paper introduces a sophisticated Extrinsic Random-based Ensemble (ERBE) method where in a predetermined set of repetitions, a subset of external instances (either malware or benign) as well as classification features are randomly selected, and an aggregation function is adopted to combine the output of all base models for each test case separately. By utilising static analysis only, we demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of taking advantage of the availability of multiple external instances of different size and genre. The experimental results in AndroZoo benchmark corpora verify the suitability of a random-based heterogeneous ensemble for this task and exhibit the effectiveness of our method, in some cases improving the hitherto best reported results by more than 5%.},

  abstract     = {Fog computing is recently a novel distributed computing paradigm that performs a significant achievement in the latency-sensitive smart Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the security and privacy issues, such as data leakage, still challenge the wide deployment of fog computing infrastructure. To guarantee data confidentiality and meanwhile achieving fine-grained access control, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) promises to provide a flexible access policy for securely sharing data among users, fog nodes, and cloud center. However, due to the complicated cryptographic operations, CP-ABE has met a significant drawback that requires heavy computation resources on the user-side. In this paper, we propose an outsourced access control scheme with hidden access structures, named OAC-HAS, in fog-enhanced IoT systems. The contributions of our OAC-HAS scheme are three-folds. Firstly, we introduce a fog-cloud computing (FCC) environment which has the outsourcing capability. Then, we design an outsource verification mechanism to guarantee the correctness of executing cryptographic operations on the fog nodes. Finally, we also provide a privacy guarantee that prevents information leakage from the access structures. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed OAC-HAS scheme achieves flexible access policy, privacy-preserving, and high efficiency in fog-enhanced IoT systems.},

Based on this, the mixed utility model is used to empirically test the relationship between accounting conservatism, corporate governance, and stock price collapse risk. The results show that: accounting conservatism, corporate governance and stock price collapse risk are negatively correlated, and conservative accounting policies can effectively restrain the occurrence of the stock price collapse, and higher levels of corporate governance can effectively reduce the possibility of the future stock price crash, and accounting conservatism and corporate governance have substitution effects in preventing the risk of the stock price collapse, and higher corporate governance levels can significantly reduce the negative impact of accounting conservatism on future stock price collapse risks.

However, it is difficult to vacate room from the encrypted image. This problem limits the embedding capacity of the existing RDHEI methods. In this paper, we propose a new RDHEI method designed to supply large embedding capacity without pre-processing of the original images. Using a block-level encryption scheme, the proposed method partially retains the spatial correlation in the high bit-planes of the encrypted image, while the content of the image is held securely. The data hider can compress the high bit-planes of the encrypted image to vacate high-capacity room using Huffman compression coding. In addition, image recovery and data extraction are separable and error-free at the receiver side. The receiver can retrieve the lossless original image without the embedded data using only an encryption key or by extracting the secret data directly from the encrypted image without decryption using only the data-hiding key. The experimental results and comparison proved that the proposed method performs better than previous methods in terms of embedding capacity and visual quality.},

In the proposed SIWODE, first, the two parameters are adaptively proposed to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. Second, the crossover and mutation operations are introduced in SIWODE to improve the population diversity and increase the exploration capability during the iterative process. Furthermore, a local perturbation strategy is presented to improve exploitation ability during the late process. The exploration and exploitation ability of the algorithm is effectively balanced by cooperative mechanisms. The experiment results of SIWODE show that the SIWODE has the superior searching quality and stability than other mentioned approaches.},

  abstract     = {The goal of cross-domain sentiment classification is to utilise useful information in the source domain to help classify sentiment polarity in the target domain, which has a large number of unlabelled data. Most of the existing methods focus on extracting the invariant features between two domains. But they cannot make better use of the unlabelled data in the target domain. To solve this problem, we present a deep transfer learning mechanism (DTLM) for fine-grained cross-domain sentiment classification. DTLM provides a transfer mechanism to better transfer sentiment across domains by incorporating BERT(Bidirextional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence. We introduce BERT as a feature encoder to map the text data of different domains into a shared feature space. Then, we design a domain adaptive model using KL divergence to eliminate the difference of feature distribution between the source domain and target domain. In addition, we introduce the entropy minimisation and consistency regularisation to process unlabelled samples in the target domain. Extensive experiments on the datasets from YelpAspect, SemEval 2014 task 4 and Twitter not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method but also provide a better way for cross-domain sentiment classification.},

Choosing appropriate social media marketing strategies to stimulate customer engagement in different forms is an important issue. In order to better understand customer behaviours in the social media marketing context, we draw on the Stimulus-Organism-Response theory, and conceptualise and characterise marketing posts from six dimensions to get various features as stimuli, which induce or activate customers’ cognitive and affective states to varying levels, and ultimately lead to different behaviour responses. Machine learning algorithms are applied to the customer engagement behaviour choice prediction when facing marketing posts. It is proved that the post features designed by humans can be used to get good predictions, while the best results are achieved by combining the human-designed features with the high-dimensional features automatically extracted from post texts by the BERT model.

For its significant practical applications, the influence maximisation problem has been widely used in many fields, such as network marketing and rumour control. However, most existing algorithms tend to select accuracy or efficiency to optimise, which leads to their poor performance. Therefore, a Three-step Fast Selection algorithm for Influence Maximisation (TsFSIM) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new method to evaluate nodes&#39; influence spread is proposed, called Influence Estimation Value. Influence Estimation Value (IEV) combines the node&#39;s and its neighbours&#39; degree to estimate its influence. This can improve the efficiency of our algorithm. Afterwards, based on IEV, a three-stage filtering strategy is proposed. This strategy can improve the accuracy of our algorithm greatly. Finally, experimental results on seven real-world networks show that the proposed method is more accurate than other methods while keeping competitive efficiency.},

Data hiding can embed critical information into carriers, such as images, videos, and so on. Efficiently embedding information into images is the goal of this research. Image steganography techniques utilise a cover image to hide secret data and produce a stego-image by modifying pixel values. After modification, the stego-image is distorted with respect to the cover image. Vector quantisation (VQ) is a lossy image compression technique. The image recovered from the VQ compressed code has distortion compared to the original image. Based on the VQ image, we can hide secret data by modifying the pixel value in a way that the distortion is compensated. The embedding rate of the proposed scheme is adjustable. Experimental results show that our scheme can achieve a high embedding rate in comparison with related works. For low-quality VQ images, embedding can improve the visual quality of the stego-image at the same time.},

However, it lacks the ability to preserve diversity by mainly focusing on exploitation, and adopting random selection to choose leaders also hinders its performance. To overcome these deficiencies, an improved multi-leader comprehensive learning particle swarm optimiser is proposed based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker proximity measure and Gravitational Search Algorithm. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker proximity measure is employed to determine the best-ranked particles’ contribution to the swarm’s convergence to influence their selection as guides for other particles. Gravitational Search Algorithm is introduced to preserve the algorithm’s ability to maintain diversity. To curb premature convergence and particles getting trapped in a local optimum, an adaptive reset velocity strategy is incorporated to activate stagnated particles. Some benchmark test functions are employed to compare the proposed algorithm with seven other peer algorithms. The results verify that our proposed algorithm possesses a better capability to elude local optima with faster convergence than other algorithms. Furthermore, to prove the efficacy of the application of our proposed algorithm in real-life, the algorithms are used to train a Feedforward neural network for epilepsy detection, of which our proposed algorithm outperforms the others.},

Because of the reasons given above, it is necessary to build tools that can reliably detect zero-day malware on these devices. At the moment, many of the frameworks that have been proposed to detect malware applications leverage Machine Learning (ML) techniques. However, an essential requirement to build these frameworks consists of using very large and sophisticated datasets for model construction and training purposes. Their success, indeed, strongly depends on the choice of the right features used for building a classification model providing adequate generalisation capability. Furthermore, the creation of a training dataset that well represents the malware properties and behaviour is one of the most critical challenges in malware analysis. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is proposing a new dataset called Unisa Malware Dataset (UMD) available on http://antlab.di.unisa.it/malware/ , which is based on the extraction of static and dynamic features characterising the malware activities. Additionally, we will show some experiments concerning common ML tools to demonstrate how it is possible to build efficient ML-based malware classification frameworks using the proposed dataset.},

The proposed scheme uses PUF and compact PUF identity authentication models to implement secure mutual authentication between tag and server. The key information in the scheme is generated by PUF, which not only reduces the cost of algorithm design but also avoids the risk of information leakage and key loss. In addition, this article uses ECC technology to encrypt the PUF response information and random numbers, which can ensure that this data information will not be leaked to the attacker. Then through the ProVerif verification tool and security attribute analysis, it is proved that the scheme is safe in the face of major attacks.

Moreover, we consider context bias and employ multi-task learning to reduce prediction error and improve the predicted performance.

However, once NDN&#39;s forwarding plane suffers Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, the overall system performance would be affected significantly. In NDN data transmission, interest forwarding is the most time-consuming operation and thus opens a possible vector of DoS attacks. It is proposed in this paper a fast name lookup algorithm for NDN interest forwarding, which selects feature prefixes instead of lengths to filter out interest packets in NDN interest forwarding. Due to the excellent filtration with feature prefixes, the algorithm accelerates NDN forwarding processes.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive feature fusion method based on an auto-encoder to improve classification accuracy. The method includes the following steps: Firstly, the CNN model is trained by transfer learning. Next, the features of the convolution layer and the fully connected layer are extracted respectively. These extracted features are then passed into the auto-encoder for further learning with Softmax normalisation to obtain the adaptive weights for performing final classification.

Software-defined networking (SDN) with machine learning (ML) has become an emerging solution for network scheduling, quality of service (QoS), resource allocations, and security. This paper focuses on the implementation of a network traffic classifier using a novel Docker-based SDN network. ML offers good performance to real-time traffic solutions without depending on well-known TCP or UDP port numbers, IP addresses, or encrypted payloads. In this paper, using three ML techniques, we first classify network flows with 3, 5, and 7 parameters giving up to 97.14% accuracy. Additionally, we present a new performance accelerator algorithm (PAA), which incorporates these three ML classifiers and accelerates the overall performance significantly. We then propose a dynamic network classifier (DNC) generated from PAA over a novel Docker-based SDN network. Finally, we propose a new controller algorithm for Ryu platforms, which integrates the DNC and classifies both TCP and UDP flows in real-time. Based on the evaluations, an improvement in latency performance has been demonstrated, where analysing a packet, controller processing time takes on an average of 10 µs. This study will certainly serve to further research on optimising SDN and QoS.},

  abstract     = {The utilisation of communication network models is growing day by day in a drastic way around the world. In order to communicate the data round the devices, the utilisation or the establishment of communication networks is mandatory. In this paper, a forked communication network model with the base of a queuing model and the equations developed for a better understanding of the model. The results calculated with the help of MATLAB and MathCAD Software. The results observed in detail in the results section. To better understand the performance of the current forked model of communication network, the performance metrics of the current network model had compared with the performance metrics of the previous two three-node communication networks. The comparison done with the arrival process of packets to the network in one model follows the Duane process. In other model follows the Poisson process, whereas in the current model follows the Homogeneous Poisson process of arrivals. The comparison had given in detail in the comparison section.},

  abstract     = {Clustering ensemble, also referred to as consensus clustering, has emerged as a method of combining an ensemble of different clusterings to derive a final clustering that is of better quality and robust than any single clustering in the ensemble. Normally clustering ensemble algorithms in the literature combine all the clusterings without learning the ensemble. But by learning the ensemble, one can define the merit of a clustering or even a cluster in it, in forming a quality consensus. In this work, we propose a cluster-level surprisal measure to define the merit of a clustering that reflects both levels of agreement as well as disagreement among clusters. Using the proposed measure of merit, we devise a polynomial heuristics that judiciously selects a subset of clusterings from the ensemble that contribute positively in forming the consensus. We also empirically show that consensus achieved by our proposed method performs better in terms of quality compared to well-known clustering ensemble algorithms on different benchmark datasets.},

Recent studies have attempted to achieve precise pixel-level classification by using deep networks that provide hierarchical features. These methods are trying to effectively utilise multi-level features that are extracted from the data and precisely reconstruct some characteristics of objects that are lost in producing high-level features. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale context U-net (MSCU-net) for semantic image segmentation. This network uses a multi-scale context block (MSCB) to aggregate multi-level features and employs the CRF layer to explicitly model the dependencies among pixels.

  abstract     = {Online social networks (OSNs) are nowadays an important field of applications thanks to the recent surge in online interaction. However, the illegal disclosure of user&#39;s private data can cause damaging consequences and even threaten the safety of users&#39; life. The privacy issues of OSNs have become a matter of great concern for many people. In recent years, there are some research works to address this privacy issue, yet they do not always focus on providing the normal social network services for users, such as data sharing, data retrieval and data access services. Therefore, it is a challenge to ensure the security of sensitive data while providing efficient and privacy-preserving social network services for users. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based privacy-preserving framework for online social networks, called BPP. Combined blockchain and public-key cryptography technique, the BPP framework can achieve secure data sharing, data retrieving, and data accessing with fairness and without worrying about potential damage to users&#39; interest. Specifically, based on blockchain and public key encryption with keyword search technique, a secure, fair and efficient keyword search algorithm is proposed, with which the BBP framework realises privacy preservation of user&#39;s query and then obtain accurate query results with assurance and without needing for any further verification operation in online social network. Finally, we implement a prototype of our framework and deploy it to a locally simulated network. The extensive experiments and security analysis demonstrate the security, efficacy and efficiency of our proposed framework.},

In addition to these issues, mobile healthcare applications are prone to various types of attacks and formal proof is often unavailable. In this work, we propose our community cloud framework in an IoMT setting that ensures end-to-end security and circumvents many of the existing negative aspects using the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). We provide necessary proofs using BAN logic and Scyther tool. Also, we show that the energy consumption and the costs of communication and computation for our proposed protocol are far less than that of the existing protocols.

Besides, a block and coefficient selection strategy is utilised to further improve the image quality and suppress the increase of file size. More specifically, the smooth discrete cosine transform (DCT) blocks with fewer zero AC coefficients are preferentially selected to embed data. The experiments indicate that our scheme achieves a high embedding capacity, meanwhile, the stego-image quality keeps good and the file size preserves well, moreover, our scheme is superior to the state-of-the-art scheme.},

Since  quantum bits use probability to represent binary information, the quantum CNN does not represent the actual network, but the probability of existence of each convolutional layer, thus achieving the aim of training weights and optimising the number of convolutional layers at the same time. In the simulation part, CIFAR-10 (including 50k training images and 10k test images in 10 classes) is used to train VGG-19 and 20-layer, 32-layer, 44-layer and 56-layer CNN networks, and compare the difference between the optimal and non-optimal convolutional layer networks. The simulation results show that without optimisation, the accuracy of the test data drops from approximately 90% to about 80% as the number of network layers increases to 56 layers. However, the CNN with optimisation made it possible to maintain the test accuracy at more than 90%, and the number of network parameters could be reduced by nearly half or more. This shows that the proposed method can not only improve the network performance degradation caused by too many hidden convolutional layers, but also greatly reduce the use of the network’s computing resources.},

Accurate air quality prediction can provide useful information for government decision-making and residents&#39; activities. However, accurately predicting future air quality remains a challenging task because of the complex spatial-temporal dependencies of air quality. Previous studies failed to explicitly model these spatial-temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive spatial-temporal network (SA-STNet) to efficiently and effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of air quality. In order to effectively aggregate spatial information, we employ a self-adaptive graph convolution module that can learn the latent spatial correlations of air quality automatically. In the temporal dimension, we utilise three independent components to capture the recent, daily-periodic, and weekly-periodic temporal dependencies of air quality, respectively. In addition, our model exploits rich external complementary information by means of a features extraction component. A parametric-matrix-based fusion architecture is used to combine the outputs of different components into a joint representation which is used for generating the final prediction results. Extensive experiments carried out on real-world datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model compared with baselines and state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Learning adversarial policy aims to learn behavioural strategies for agents with different goals, is one of the most significant tasks in multi-agent systems. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), as a state-of-the-art learning-based model, employs centralised or decentralised control methods to learn behavioural strategies by interacting with environments. It suffers from instability and slowness in the training process. Considering that parallel simulation or computation is an effective way to improve training performance, we propose a novel MARL method called M ultiple scenes multi-agent proximal P olicy O ptimisation (MPO) in this paper. In MPO, we first simulate multiple parallel scenes in the training environment. Multiple policies control different agents in the same scene, and each policy also controls several identical agents from multiple scenes. Then, we expand proximal policy optimisation (PPO) with an improved actor-critic network, ensuring the stability of training in multi-agent tasks. The actor network only uses local information for decision making, and the critic network uses global information for training. Finally, effective training trajectories are computed with two criteria from multiple parallel scenes rather than single to accelerate the learning process. We evaluate our approach in two simulated 3D environments, one of which is Unity&#39;s official open-source soccer game, and the other is unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) built by Unity. Experiments demonstrate that MPO converges more stable and faster than benchmark methods in model training, and demonstrates excellent adversarial policy compared with benchmark models.},

  abstract     = {Smart and proactive surveillance of crowds has turned up into greater importance in recent years due to the increase in urban population and immutable crowd disasters. Although the behaviours that emerged in a crowd are often unpredictable, researches in computer vision try to figure out this emergent behaviour based on the psychological and cognitive aspects of the crowd. This review is intended to analyse the insights shared from these aspects for analysing crowd behaviour. We also try to uncover the crowd psychological theories present in the literature that largely helps in determining the non-adaptive crowd behaviours. Further, this paper discusses an outlook of state-of-the-art psychological, cognitive computing and cognitive psychological approaches of crowd behaviour analysis. This paper also provides a discussion on the benchmark datasets available for vision-based crowd analysis. The comprehensive discussion and insights based on crowd psychology and cognition will provide a deep understanding of the fundamental prospects of smart crowd behaviour analysis.},

  abstract     = {The expansion of information technology infrastructure is encountered with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), which can launch data destruction, disclosure, modification, and/or Denial of Service attacks by drawing upon vulnerabilities of software and hardware. Moving Target Defense (MTD) is a promising risk mitigation technique that replies to APTs via implementing randomisation and dynamic strategies on compromised assets. However, some MTD techniques adopt the blind random mutation, which causes greater performance overhead and worse defense utility. In this paper, we formulate the cyber-attack and defense as a dynamic partially observable Markov process based on dynamic Bayesian inference. Then we develop an Inference-Based Adaptive Attack Tolerance (IBAAT) system , which includes two stages. In the first stage, a forward–backward algorithm with a time window is employed to perform a security risk assessment. To select the defense strategy, in the second stage, the attack and defense process is modelled as a two-player general-sum Markov game and the optimal defense strategy is acquired by quantitative analysis based on the first stage. The evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm has about 10% security utility improvement compared to the state-of-the-art.},

The Dunhuang clothes culture has a long history which represents ancient Chinese aesthetics.

However, little research has been done on the usage of AI for the creation of clothing, especially in traditional culture. It is challenging that the exploration of computer science and Dunhuang clothing design, which is a cross-history interaction between AI and Chinese classical culture. In this paper, we propose ClothGAN, which is an innovative framework for “designing” new patterns and styles of clothes based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and style transfer algorithm. Besides, we built the Dunhuang clothes dataset and conducted experiments to generate new patterns and styles of clothes with Dunhuang elements. We evaluated these clothing works generated from different models by computing inception score (IS), human prefer score (HPS) and generated score (IS and HPS). The results show that our framework outperformed others in these designing works.},

Photo attractiveness, the most prominent information provided in the online dating context before social interactions, has attracted considerable attention but reached inconsistent conclusions. By considering the location, gender, and attractiveness difference between each dyad of participants (hunter and target) together, this study attempts to re-examine the contingent impact of physical attractiveness in initiating social interactions. Multi-methods (machine-learning and panel logistic regression) were used to empirically analyse the large-scale field data. The results show that: (1) A target’s photo attractiveness can promote a hunter’s willingness to leave a message; (2) The impact of photo attractiveness will be attenuated when two users have a larger location difference; (3) Male users are more likely to be impacted by photo attractiveness in their social interactions than female users; (4) A hunter with low attractiveness is inclined to initiate social interactions with a more attractive target; whereas a hunter with high attractiveness does not. This study deepens the theoretical implications in relevant fields, provides new methodology insight, and offers personalised marketing strategies for mobile dating applications.},

We explored whether core affect would be leveraged through communication with conspecifics (e.g. signalling danger or foraging opportunities). Genetic algorithms served to evolve recurrent neural networks controlling virtual agents in an environment with fitness-increasing food and fitness-reducing predators. Previously, neural oscillations emerged serendipitously, with higher frequencies for positive than negative stimuli, which we replicated here in the fittest agent. The setup was extended so that oscillations could be exapted for the communication between two agents. An adaptive communicative function evolved, as shown by fitness benefits relative to (1) a non-communicative reference simulation and (2) lesioning of the connections used for communication. An exaptation of neural oscillations for communication was not observed but a simpler type of communication developed than was initially expected. The agents approached each other in a periodic fashion and slightly modified these movements to approach food or avoid predators. The coupled agents, though controlled by separate networks, appeared to self-assemble into a single vibrating organism. The simulations (a) strengthen an account of core affect as an oscillatory modulation of neural-network competition, and (b) encourage further work on the exaptation of core affect for communicative purposes.},

In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional architecture, named as refined DSE-LinkNet, to extract the connected and precise road maps. We use a pre-trained encoder by combining the layers of the two very efficient and light-weight CNN models: DenseNet and SE-Net that makes the proposed model more expressive with faster convergence. We introduce a new module, Fusion block, in our architecture that enhances its precise localisation as well as classification ability by capturing multilevel as well as multiscale features. To address the imbalanced class distribution problem, a new aggregate loss function is proposed by integrating binary cross-entropy, Jaccard coefficient, and Lovasz sigmoid loss functions. The experiments are performed on a publicly available dataset, DeepGlobe Road Extraction Challenge 2018, to show its efficacy over the D-LinkNet, winner of DeepGlobe Challenge 2018, by achieving IoU of 0.69 with lesser number of parameters and better computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Recently meta-heuristic techniques have attracted more attention. Algorithms based on Bio-inspired problems are among the most popular techniques of this field. In meta-heuristic algorithms, Genetic algorithm is one of the most useful. GA uses chromosome representation and operates on the chromosome with crossover and mutation operators. Genetic programming is a form of GA with tree representation for its chromosomes. GP was developed to evolve programming in computers and is a population-based algorithm. But GP is very slow and needs a long time for converging. On the other hand, asexual reproduction optimisation (ARO) is another variant of meta-heuristic algorithms in which convergence to the global optima is done at a fast time. In this paper, we introduced a new method, which is inducted by asexual reproduction with combination to GP. This algorithm is named Asexual Reproduction Programming (ARP). ARP has advantages of both ARO and GP together i.e. the fast convergence time of ARO and the power and flexibility of GP. ARP has fast convergence to global optimum while its error is less than GP. By mathematically analysing and proving, we show the ARP convergence to the global optimum. To assay the efficiency of the ARP, two algorithms were compared on some real-valued symbolic regression problems. Perusing the experimental results demonstrate that ARP outperforms GP in performance and convergence time.},

The lack of large standard test datasets is a crucial shortcoming which limits the research in this field. Information presented in this paper is a result of the authors’ literature research on recent academic publications and practical field investigation in the public security and transportation sectors. The state-of-the-art technologies in the field of TPIR are surveyed in detail from two aspects of tyre patterns – their low-level spatial features and high-level semantic features. Existing algorithms are examined and their pros and cons are compared and verified through experimental results. This paper also surveys the available tyre pattern datasets used in all available literature. Finally, with the considerations on technology trends in image retrieval and application requirements in TPIR, the future research directions in this field are laid out.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the rapid development of sensing technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors play increasingly important roles in traffic control, medical monitoring, industrial production and etc. They generated high volume of data in a streaming way that often need to be processed in real time. Therefore, streaming data computing technology plays an indispensable role in the real-time processing of sensor data in high throughput but low latency. However, there are two problems in deploying streaming data process ability in cloud computing data centre. Firstly, massive sensor nodes simultaneously upload data to the remote cloud computing data centre, which requires a large number of bandwidth resources supports. The existing network infrastructure cannot provide enough bandwidth at a reasonable price. Secondly, due to the geographical distribution characteristics of the cloud computing data centre, there will inevitably be large transmission delay during the process of data transmission. Such end-to-end delay is intolerable to mobile applications especially for those latency sensitive tasks. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes an autonomous driving oriented edge streaming data processing framework, which migrates the computing and storage capability from the remote cloud data centre to the edge data centre. It focuses on the change of vehicle flow in a specific geographical area, and uses the computing power sunk to edge node to process the massive streaming data generated by autonomous vehicles nearby. The proposed framework is implemented on top of Spark Streaming, which builds up a gray model based traffic flow monitor, a traffic prediction orientated prediction layer and a fuzzy control based Batch Interval dynamic adjustment layer for Spark Streaming. It could forecast the variation of sensors data arrive rate, make streaming Batch Interval adjustment in advance and implement real-time streaming process by edge. Therefore, it can realise the monitor and prediction of the data flow changes of the autonomous driving vehicle sensor data in geographical coverage of edge computing node area, meanwhile minimise the end-to-end latency but satisfy the application throughput requirements. The experiments show that it can predict short-term traffic with no more than 4% relative error in a whole day. By making batch consuming rate close to data generating rate, it can maintain system stability well even when arrival data rate changes rapidly. The Batch Interval can be converged to a suitable value in two minutes when data arrival rate is doubled. Compared with vanilla version Spark Streaming, where there has serious task accumulation and introduces large delay, it can reduce 35% latency by squeezing Batch Interval when data arrival rate is low; it also can significantly improve system throughput by only at most 25% Batch Interval increase when data arrival rate is high.},

  abstract     = {With the exponential increase in the number of transistors under fast-paced technology progress, the soft error induced reliability issue is becoming even more challenging in heterogeneous multicore processor design. As there are significant opportunities to mitigate the soft error impacts through heterogeneous multicore scheduling, we show in this paper that the correlation among multiple applications exhibits important reliability characteristics, by defining a new metric to measure the system-level vulnerability factor of multiple applications and an approximate estimator to evaluate the metric fast and accurately for effective scheduling decisions. To approach these issues, we propose CASH , a Correlation-Aware Scheduling strategy to optimise heterogeneous multicore system reliability. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is promising, achieving up to 21.4% reliability improvement with only 3.6% performance degradation when compared with performance-oriented scheduling policy.},

  abstract     = {Most of the existing outsourced encrypted data schemes are retrieved based on the query keyword entered by authorised users. However, with the increase of the data scale in the cloud storage system, the retrieval efficiency of existing solutions has not been significantly improved. In this paper, a multi-keyword ranked search scheme for ciphertext based on mapping set matching (MSMR) is proposed, where (1) The private cloud server matches the keyword numbering set corresponding to the document index vector and the keyword numbering set corresponding to the query vector and sends the document identifier of the matching keyword numbering to the public cloud server. The public cloud server filters the documents irrelevant to the query request according to the document identifier corresponding to the matching keyword numbering, which effectively reduces the time spent in calculating the correlation score, and (2) the document index vector and query vector are segmented before encrypting them out, reducing the time to construct such vectors. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure in the known ciphertext model. Experimental results confirm that whenever the data scale grows, the improvement of MSMR retrieval efficiency is more significant.},

As rumours propagation or evolution with respect to time is highly submitted to networks users’ dynamics, rumours propagation in a targeted community may inherit self-purification mechanism due to human ability to judge and clarify allegations and assumptions not based on truth. In this article, we analysed rumours spreading through social media taking into account self-purification mechanism using epidemic control approach. Rumours spreading threshold value was obtained. Results of numerical simulation validated theoretical analysis and suggested controlling social media influence on potential rumours purifiers and disseminators.},

  abstract     = {Integrity and privacy are two important secure matrices in cyber security. Due to the limited resources and computing capability of the sensor nodes, it is challenging to simultaneously satisfy these two matrices for top- k querying in two-tiered sensor networks. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a weight-bind-based secure top- k query processing scheme (WBB-TQ), which utilises both the order-preserving symmetric encryption scheme (OPES) and the pairwise-key encryption technique to ensure data privacy in top- k querying. Since OPES can keep the size orders of the sensed data items unchanged before and after they are encrypted, the upper-layer storage nodes in the network can process top- k queries without knowing the exact values of the sensed data items. To guarantee the completeness of query results, we propose a novel method to establish chaining relationship among all the data items generated by each sensor node. By checking whether the relationship holds on not, Sink can find out whether adversaries drop and/or tamper with part or all of the qualified top- k data items in the query results. Theoretical analyses show that WBB-TQ can preserve data integrity and privacy of the top- k query results. Extensive simulation results further demonstrate that, WBB-TQ incurs very low computational and communication cost in securing top-k querying.},

However, the existing community discovery algorithms are not effective in dealing with complex network which always contains fuzzy community structure. With the help of graph convolution, the proposed algorithm defines the connectivity between any nodes in a network and constructs the symmetric doubly stochastic matrix. Then, the algorithm enhances the network by the nonlinear transformation of the eigenvalues of the symmetric doubly stochastic matrix and makes the original fuzzy community structure become clear. Experimental results show that this method can effectively sharpen the community structure of a network and improve the effect of community partitioning.},

In this paper, we introduce a new prediction model, which combines several machine learning algorithms, such as KNN, clustering, similarity, sample and attribute weighting with multiple linear regression techniques, to predict the execution time of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) software at the source code level. Prediction at source code level tends to both under-predict the performance for certain testing samples and over-predict for some other samples. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm called MAX/MIN algorithm to select the best-predicted execution time. To validate the new model, we measure experimentally the execution time of a set of functions selected from PHY DSP Benchmark and run them on TIC64 DSP processor. It is observed that the average absolute relative prediction error is less than 10% between the computed performance from the new model and the actual measured execution time.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a novel population-based optimisation algorithm, namely firefly algorithm (FA), which mimics the flashing and attraction behaviour of fireflies, has shown promising performance in solving global optimisation problems. However, the preliminary studies have shown that FA often gets stuck in local optima. In this paper, we investigate the reasons why the FA suffers from getting stuck in local optima; and then propose an improved firefly algorithm (IFA). These improvements are twofold: first, a sigmoid-based attractiveness is employed to reformulate its definition and strengthen its local refinement ability; second, a dynamic step parameter tuning strategy is designed to adjust the random search intensity and narrow the search space iteratively to strengthen its global search ability. The empirical results indicate IFA can well balance between the global exploration and the local exploitation, and provides the best solutions, at least the competitive results, for most of 12 global optimisation problems over other FA variants. Besides, by employing IFA to solve well-known infinite impulse response filter design problems, we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of IFA. The experimental results and comparisons show that IFA performs better than, at least as competent again, other meta-heuristics in terms of the solution accuracy, solution robustness, and convergence rate.},
