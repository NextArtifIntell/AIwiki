  abstract     = {With the recent advancements in distributed computing technologies, the fog computing model has emerged to provide resource capabilities at the edge of the network for executing IoT applications. However, due to the rapid growth of IoT applications and variability their workload over time, achieving an efficient resource provisioning solution to deal with time-varying workloads as one of the challenging tasks in resource management scope to be considered. In this work, we propose a learning-based resource provisioning approach for managing time-varying workloads of IoT applications in the fog network. Our proposed approach utilises the nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network as prediction method and hidden Markov model (HMM) as a decision-maker to identify scaling decisions to provision the fog resources for serving of workloads of IoT applications. The effectiveness of our proposed solution is evaluated using extension experiments under real-world datasets, and the obtained results from iFogSim toolkit demonstrated that it yields a reduction of the delay and cost and improves resource energy consumption compared with existing baseline mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Improvement of prediction accuracy and early detection of the Alzheimer’s disease is becoming increasingly important for managing its impact on lives of affected patients. Many machine learning approaches have been applied to support the diagnosis and prediction of this illness. In this paper we propose an approach for improving the Alzheimer’s disease classification accuracy by using data fusion of several independent clinical datasets. Data fusion was performed twofold: 1) by enriching attributes of the base dataset with the attributes of the secondary dataset and 2) by enriching the examples set of the base dataset with the examples of the secondary dataset. In both cases the missing values (for newly added attributes and/or examples) were predicted by using linear regression for numeric and naive Bayes classifier for nominal attributes. We experimented on three data sources: on a dataset of Alzheimer’s disease-impaired patients, on a dataset of patients with vascular dementia, and on a dataset of patients who have been affected by a stroke. We fused these datasets with different data fusion approaches and analysed the improvement in classification accuracy as well as the quality of the fused attributes. The experiments indicated that we obtained an increase of classification accuracy on the fused dataset compared with the accuracy obtained from individual dataset.},

This method uses data generated by LB and based on the local population and density data. The interface between dispersed and matrix phases on the neural points was simulated. The neural mesh of interface was created by the ANFIS method and locally was compared by the CFD results. The results showed that there is a great agreement between ANFIS and numerical data when a particularly more number of rules are used in the learning step of simulations. Since this new overview of modelling can predict fluid flow based on existing data, less number of rules cause over prediction for the ANFIS method; however, by enhancing the number of rules, ANFIS can solve this over-prediction far from the curvature of the dispersed phase. This algorithm can be a promising tool for simulation of macroscopic parameters in the large-scale multi-phase reactors.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing services provide an economic and efficient means of acquiring multiple noisy labels for each training instance in supervised learning. Ground truth inference methods, also known as consensus methods, are then used to obtain the integrated labels of training instances. Although consensus methods are effective, there still exists a level of noise in the set of integrated labels. Therefore, it is necessary to handle noise in the integrated labels to improve label and model quality. In this paper, we propose a resampling-based noise correction method (simply RNC). Different from previous label noise correction methods for crowdsourcing, RNC first employs a filter to obtain a clean set and a noisy set and then repeatedly resamples the clean and noisy sets several times according to a certain proportion. Finally, multiple classifiers built on the resampled data sets are used to re-label the training data. Experimental results based on 18 simulated data sets and five real-world data sets demonstrate that RNC rarely degrades the label and model quality compared to other three state-of-the-art noise correction methods and, in many cases, improves quality dramatically.},

Current approaches rely on adding many watermarks in different bands or channels utilising scaling factor, and embedding locations that are mainly defined by experts. This brought many challenges in achieving equilibrium between security, robustness, and quality. Aiming to fill the gap of determining stationary scaling factor and embedding locations, the work proposed in this paper adapts genetic algorithm to find the optimality of these issues; that will enhance both of watermarking capacity and imperceptibility in colour images. To increase security, the suggested model encodes the watermarks using 2-D Walsh transform (WHT). Furthermore, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a dimension reduction tool is utilised to factorise Wavelet coefficients to determine the most salient embedding locations. Experimental results show that the proposed model is more robust against common image manipulation attacks in terms of PSNR and NCC.},

Some useful properties of the proposed preference degree were also examined and discussed. It was shown that the proposed preference degree can satisfy the common and desired properties expected in the space of k-dimensional vectors of qualitative labels. Numerical examples were also employed to illustrate the proposed ranking method. Three application examples were used to show the applicability of the proposed ranking method in a single criterion group decision-making (SAGDM) and multiple criteria group decision-making (MAGDM). Moreover, the proposed preference degree was compared with a conventional method in terms of ranking the k-dimensional vector of qualitative labels. Unlike the proposed method, the numerical evaluations revealed that the previous techniques are not applicable to some situations in decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Image captured in bad weather conditions confines scene prominence, appears grey and diminishes image contrast. This usually happens due to atmospheric dispersing phenomenon that affects the quality of outdoor computer vision frameworks. This deprivation relies on the gap between the object point and the camera and mostly differs for every pixel present in an image. Transmission coefficients, which state the aforementioned dependence are used to manage the haze level in each pixel. Our algorithm is subject to the presumption that the haze-free image forms clusters given in RGB space. The pixels over the image plane are often found at different locations and their distance from camera also differs. These fluctuating distances give rise to different transmission coefficients. Consequently, these colour clusters form the certain lines of colours in RGB space known as haze lines. The first step is to assure accurate estimation of the atmospheric light, for this an additional wavelet channel is recommended, based on frequency subdivision. The next step is to separate the average gradients present in the foggy regions of an image according to the frequency criteria. Lastly, the haze-free image information is retrieved by utilising the atmospheric scattering model on low and high frequencies according to the edges of unpredicted change in the field depth. Using the non-local and frequency information retrieval, proposed algorithm recovers the haze-free image, efficiently.},

Given a semantics, such problems consist, for example, in enumerating all the extensions, and checking the credulous or sceptical acceptance of an argument passed as parameter. The goal is to let programmers use the library to quickly develop programs on top of it, as, for instance, implementing decision-making procedures based on the strongest arguments, or comparing two frameworks by looking at the differences between their (e.g., stable) semantics. The library features the possibility to use different branching strategies, which we all test and compare on a set of frameworks taken from the International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation ( ICCMA17 ). Moreover, for some of the tasks, it is possible to perform a parallel search using several workers at the same time: we test the speed-up between using from 1 to 16 threads on a set of ICCMA17 frameworks.},

Since unexpected events and conditions may cause an agent’s goals and plans to become invalid or infeasible, an agent with goal-driven autonomy should monitor the environment against its expectations. Designed for dynamic, open, and partially observable environments, such an agent can create new goals or change its existing goals as needed. We present a formalisation of expectations for agents operating in these kinds of environments. Our formalisation includes situations where agents have the capability to sense the environment with some associated costs. We examine agent choices and behaviour in these domains and evaluate multiple approaches for selecting a subset of the agent’s sensing actions to execute. The contributions of this work are (1) a specification of different approaches to generating expectations; (2) a formalisation of the autonomy problem that minimises sensing costs; (3) a complexity analysis of the problem; (4) new algorithms for deciding which sensing actions to perform; and (5) empirical results demonstrating the benefit and cost of these approaches.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous transfer vehicles (ATVs) can be considered as one of the critical components of context-aware structured smart factories in Industry 4.0 era. Conventional mapping methods such as grid maps can provide information for navigation, but they are not enough for complex environments that require interactions. On the other hand, high-definition (HD) mapping, which is mainly used in traffic networks, includes more information about an environment to perform excellent autonomous behaviour. In order to increase the efficiency of ATVs in flexible factories, an up-to-date environmental map information is required to perform successful long-term autonomous navigation. Therefore, when there exists a change in the environment, a simultaneous update of HD-map is as important as the creation of it. In this study, we propose an HD-map update methodology for ATVs that operates in smart factories. To the best of our knowledge, HD mapping has not been applied in smart factories. The proposed method includes the object detection and localisation tool to detect objects visually and determines their positions in connection with the conventional maps of the environment. Experimental results of a simulated factory environment demonstrate that the ATV can properly update the HD-map when a predefined sign is removed from or a new sign is added to the environment.},

Many experiments have been carried out in this study to compare NMOACO/D with MOEA/D-ACO and other algorithms on several bi-objective travelling salesman problems. We demonstrate that NMOACO/D outperforms the MOEA/D-ACO and six different recently proposed related algorithms on all nine test instances.

In the proposed algorithm, Non-uniform mutation is used to maintain diversity in the explored solutions. Fitness variance, which signifies solution space aggregation, is used to detect the premature convergence of the population to a local optimum. The term multi-parent is used in the context of more than two parents participating in crossover operation. After multi-parent selection for cross-over to generate new solutions, the non-uniform adaptive mutation is performed, which in turn is triggered by the diminishing value of fitness variance of candidate solutions and pushes solutions out of local optimum. Hence, it can be said that the algorithm is driven by the diversity of the population and overcomes the tendency of evolutionary algorithms to stuck in local optimum. The performance of this algorithm is tested on 23 basic benchmarks, CEC05 functions, and CEC17 functions. As CEC17 benchmark functions include constraint problems, a constraint-handling technique is proposed based on the fuzzy set theory. In the proposed constrained handling strategy, constraint violation is also taken as another objective along with the main objective. The decision to accept or discard the solution is based on the fuzzy set theory. The values of constraint violation and objective function are calculated and fuzzified by calculating membership values by considering the main objective and constraint violation as triangular fuzzy functions. The best solutions are selected based on cardinal priority ranking. The obtained results from the proposed algorithm are compared with the results available in the literature. The result indicates that this algorithm is competitive, even with a smaller number of function evaluations.},

It lets millions of users to communicate and interact by sending short messages of up to 140 characters. The massive amount of information over the web from Twitter requires an automatic tool that can determine the topics that people are talking about. The Topic Detection task is concentrated on discovering the main topics automatically. In this article at first, we explore different approaches to detect topics of tweets. Then, we will classify these topic detection approaches to four classes of categories, including with word embedding or without word embedding, speciﬁed or unspeciﬁed, offline (RED) or online (NED), and supervised or unsupervised. Finally, we will discuss the studied approaches in detail.},

  abstract     = {The Satin Bowerbird Optimisation (SBO) was inspired by the Satin Bowerbirds living in Australia’s rainforests and other mesic habitats. Like other meta-heuristic algorithms, the main problem faced by the SBO is that it has been empirically demonstrated to become easily trapped into local optimal solutions, creating low precision and slow convergence speeds. To overcome these deficiencies, we propose herein the Adaptive Chaotic Satin Bowerbird Optimisation algorithm (AC-SBO). Within the AC-SBO algorithm, a chaotic map is introduced to modify the search process, with which to enhance global convergence speeds, and to obtain better performance. We introduced the chaos theory into the SBO optimisation process, in order to replace the main parameter’s greatest step size ( α ), which assists in controlling the balance between both exploration and exploitation. The search accuracy and performance of the AC-SBO algorithm were verified on ten classical benchmark functions. In addition, in the experimental CEC2014 results showed that for almost all functions, the AC-SBO technique proved superior to the other comparative algorithms optimisations. The Wilcoxon rank-sum statistical test was performed in order to judge the significance of the results, and further demonstrated the improved performance of the proposed AC-SBO algorithm.},

While many researchers believe that Technological Singularity is at an arm’s length, many counter-question the possibility of the same due to the lack of concrete evidence. Recently Cybersecurity has manoeuvred its way through technology to become one of the most rapidly advancing fields. Artificial Intelligence introduced to Cybersecurity has seen a tremendous increase in the number of systems that are capable of performing tasks faster and better than humans. This has led us to believe that there is intelligence in cyberspace along with the possibility of Cyber Singularity. We emphasise the intelligence of systems using a set of characteristics that insist on how sophisticated the systems have become over time that might lead to Cyber Singularity. We map these characteristics to the characteristics of living species with the hope of locating intelligence in the biomedical domain and further, try to identify systems displaying such characteristics in cyberspace. Keeping in mind the concept of technological singularity proposed before, we also perform an extensive survey of the past research works related to the field and also, use the concepts of set theory to reinforce the possibility of Cyber Singularity in the coming years.},

However, this paper assumes the situation in which this fact does no longer hold. Therefore, a task named space adjustment, through which the distribution of the data points in the training-data space and the distribution of the data points in the test-data space become identical, is inevitable. Hereby, authors propose a linear mapping for the space adjustment task in the paper. It considers four approaches for preserving localities among data samples during the space adjustment. Each approach is defined based on a different locality concept. Considering all locality concepts in an objective function, authors transform the space adjustment into an optimisation problem. The paper proposes to optimise the corresponding objective function by an iterative approach. Empirical study shows that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods. To do experiments, authors employ a large number of real-world datasets.},

Physiotherapists personalise manual treatments to heal or relieve pain according to the patient characteristics. The contribution of this methodological paper is the description and evaluation of the configuration software associated to a therapy machine that executes back segment mobilisations. The configuration software uses Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a successful Machine Learning technique, based on mimicking the human decision making process by reusing previously applied configuration episodes on similar individuals. This paper demonstrates its feasibility and cost-effectiveness for the configuration of treatments as it reuses expert knowledge and maximises effectiveness by taking into account the patient’s personal medical record and similar patterns among different patients. Having a baseline of 31% success rate using a standard solution based on interpolation, the CBR engine can achieve, on average, up to 70% success rate when proposing a machine configuration to the physiotherapist. Regarding clinical results, we run a longitudinal observational study that achieves an average improvement of 31.63% using the pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a 7% according to the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and 13% in the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).},

Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is an efficient means of investigation of GIT diseases. However, still several challenges exist in this domain, such as lesion shape, colour, texture, size and irregularity. To deal with these problems, several computer-based methods are introduced in computer vision domain but they used only hand-crafted features which produced wrong predictions several times. In this research, a new technique is applied based on the fusion of deep convolutional (CNN) and geometric features. Initially, disease regions are extracted from given WCE images using a new approach named contrast-enhanced colour features . Geometric features are extracted from segmented disease region. Thereafter, unique VGG16 and VGG19 deep CNN features fusion are performed based on Euclidean Fisher Vector . The unique features are fused with geometric features which are later fed to conditional entropy approach for best features selection. The selected features are finally classified by K-Nearest Neighbour . A privately collected database which consists of 5500 WCE images is utilised for the evaluation of the proposed method and achieved best classification accuracy of 99.42% and precision rate of 99.51%. The classification accuracy proves the authenticity of the proposed approach.},

This paper presents and evaluates a Boundary Sense Deep Learning architecture (BSDL) for automated detection of elephants, integrating, elephant image feature learning and elephant classification. A novelty in this approach enhances the deep learning Boundary Sense (BS) architecture to include a background subtraction module which highlights the visual region important for elephant recognition. The objective of the proposed BSDL architecture is validated by achieving better accuracy when compared with the raw image, time efficiency, simplifying and boosting up of Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) by introducing preliminaries; elephant recognition with Multi view dataset dramatically improves the state of art and fine tuning using back-propagation. The dataset includes 1,28,069 images of various postures of elephants collected under different circumstances from different regions (Hosur, Bannerghatta, Shimoga (Sakrebailu) and Dubare). The trained model is designed for identifying only one target species, the elephants. The conclusions drawn from our work prove that the achievement percentage is 97% accuracy in the BSDL architecture, when compared with the existing deep learning algorithms using raw image.},

  abstract     = {Wearable on body sensors have been employed in many applications including ambulatory monitoring and pervasive computing systems. In this work, a wearable assistant has been created for people suffering from Parkinson’s disease (PD), specifically with the freezing of gait (FoG) symptom. Wearable accelerometers were placed on the person’s body and used for movement measure. When FoG is detected, a rhythmic audio signal was given from the wearable assistant to motivate the wearer to continue walking. Long-term monitoring results in collecting huge amounts of complex raw data; therefore, data analysis becomes impractical or infeasible resulting in the need for data reduction. In the present study, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been used to extract the main features inherent in the key movement indicators for FoG detection. The discrimination capacities of these features were assessed using (i) support vector machine using a linear kernel function and (ii) artificial neural network with a two-layer feed-forward with hidden layer of 20 neurons that trained with conjugate gradient back-propagation. Using these two different machine learning techniques, we were capable of detecting FoG with an accuracy of 87.50% and 93.8%, respectively. Additionally, the comparison between the extracted features from DWT coefficients with those using fast Fourier transform established accuracies of 93.8% and 81.3%, respectively. Finally, the discriminative features extracted from DWT yield to a robust multidimensional classification model compared to models in the literature based on a single feature. The work presented paves the way for reliable, real-time wearable sensors to aid people with PD.},

  abstract     = {Age estimation can obtain biological age which is helpful for diagnosis of healthy status and disease. The current age estimation methods do not consider the deep relationships of instances, which limits the potential improvement of the age estimation performance. A hierarchical age estimation mechanism with adaboost-based deep instance weighted fusion is proposed to solve this problem. First, a circulation iterative means clustering (CIMC) algorithm is designed for constructing the hierarchical instance space (multiple-layer instance spaces) and obtain multiple trained base regression models. Second, an adaboost-based deep instance weighted fusion (ADIWF) mechanism is designed to fuse the results of the trained regression models. Several representative age-related datasets are used for verification of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) can be decreased apparently, by 6.86% and 1.42% on the Heart and Diabetes Dataset, respectively. Besides, some factors that may influence the performance of the proposed mechanism are studied. In general, the proposed age estimation mechanism is effective. In addition, the mechanism is a kind of framework mechanism, so it can be used to construct different concrete age estimation algorithms, and is helpful for related studies.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis is one of the challenging problems among the various type of tasks in sentiment analysis. Sequential models specifically deep neural networks (like Recurrent Neural Networks) have been found to handle this problem in an efficient way. This paper presents a deep neural network model named ATE-SPD for aspect-based sentiment analysis that simultaneously extracts aspect-terms and their corresponding polarities in review sentences. This problem can be solved as a sequence labelling problem. We are using Bi-LSTM hybridised with CRF as both of these approaches are state-of-the-art approaches for sequence labelling tasks. It was observed that CRF is able to improve the performance of the traditional Bi-LSTM model. Another important contribution of this paper is that it provides a novel set of sequential tags for extracting aspect-terms along with their sentiment polarities. Aspect-terms and their polarities are determined without explicitly labelling the sentiment terms. The ATE-SPD is evaluated using a benchmark dataset of SemEval’14-Task4 and obtains state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {The navigation of mobile robots using heuristic algorithms is one of the important issues in computer and control sciences. Path planning and obstacle avoidance are current topics of navigational challenges for mobile robots. The major drawbacks of conventional methods are the inability to plan motion in a dynamic and unknown environment, failure in crowded and complex environments, and inability to predict the velocity vector of obstacles and non-optimality of the synthesised path. This paper presents a novel path planning approach using a grasshopper algorithm for navigation of a mobile robot in dynamic and unknown environments. To accomplish this goal, two different approaches are presented. First, a sensory system is used to detect the obstacles and then a new method is developed to predict and avoid static and dynamic obstacles while the velocity of obstacles is unknown. The robot uses the obtained information and finds a collision-free, optimal and safe path. The controller proposed in this paper is tested in crowded and complex environments. Simulation results show that the approach is successful in all test environments. Also, the proposed controller is compared with several heuristic methods. The comparison work stipulates that the introduced controller here is promising in terms of running time, optimality, stability and failure rate.},

  abstract     = {Recognition of emotion in speech is a difficult task due to many speaker factors like gender, age, and the cultural background (nationality, ethnicity, and region) as well as the acoustical environment. Among these factors, the cultural background of the speaker has a strong influence on the expression of emotion. The reason for the unsatisfactory performance of an emotion recognition engine built using mixed-cultural samples can be traced back to this. To address this issue, a two-level hierarchical engine has been designed to identify emotion from the speech of different cultural backgrounds. The first level of the hierarchical engine is a culture identification system, which identifies the corpus of an input utterance. As most of the speakers involved in the construction of a specific corpus are from the same locality and cultural background, we assume that a corpus represents the cultural background of the speakers of the corpus constructed. Based on the response of the first level classifier, the input utterance is forwarded to an appropriate corpus-specific emotion recognition engine, in the second level. Each corpus-specific emotion recognition system is a discriminative, multiclass SVM classifier, trained with the emotional utterances of that particular corpus. The system has been tested with five different corpora, collected from diverse cultural backgrounds, namely EMO-DB, SAVEE, IITKGP-SEC, Spanish corpus S0329, and CMU’s Woogles corpus. The system achieved an accuracy of 82.01% which is an improvement of 13.38% over monolithic approaches.},

IoT technology has the capability to acquire and monitor air quality parameters in the ambient environment of an individual. Inspired from these aspects, this paper proposes an IoT-based automated framework for monitoring and predicting air quality parameters like benzene using machine learning technology. Specifically, this study incorporates an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) technique to predict the air quality in the form of Level of Pollutant (LoP) and modified Air Quality Index (m-AQI). Moreover, for the optimisation of ANFIS technique, Differential Evolution (DE)-inspired algorithm has been proposed for overall enhancement of system accuracy. In order to validate the proposed model, numerous experimental simulations were performed over four challenging datasets and results were compared with several state-of-the-art models. Comparative analysis shows improved statistical values for the presented model in terms of Accuracy (97.3%), Coefficient of Determination (94.01%), and Root Mean Square Error (2.4%). In addition to these, enhanced values of performance estimators like Reliability (92.36%) and Stability (76.00%) were estimated for depicting overall efficiency of the proposed system.},

Cloud services are commonly used as the private or public data forum based on the demand, and the increase in usage has lead to security concerns. The information in the cloud comes under threat due to hackers, and the most common attack on the cloud data is considered as the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. This work has concentrated on detecting the DDoS attack by developing the deep learning-based classifier. The service request from the users is collected and grouped as the log information. From the log file, some important features are selected for the classification using the Bhattacharya distance measure to reduce the training time of the classifier. Here, Taylor-Elephant Herd Optimisation based Deep Belief Network (TEHO-DBN), is developed by modifying the Elephant Herd Optimisation (EHO) with the Taylor series and the algorithm thus developed is adopted to train the Deep Belief Network (DBN) for the DDoS attack detection. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that the proposed TEHO based DBN classifier has improved performance with a maximum accuracy of 0.830.},

The forecasts obtained from L&amp;NL-ANNs may change depending on the time series samples, but this variation is neglected in the literature. The objective of this study has overcome this handicap and producing a method which can give point forecasts, confidence intervals and some weights significance hypothesis tests besides the proposed method performs linearity and nonlinearity hypothesis tests. The proposed method is compared with other conventional methods using a Monte Carlo simulation study and real-world time series data which are Nikkei 225, Dow Jones and Istanbul Stock Exchange time series datasets as well as Australian beer consumption time series. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the application and simulation results and found to perform well overall with respect to other methods.

Second, to depict the hierarchical structure information between the entities and the relations in the text and the internal structure information of the entity, the CGCN is designed to obtain the character vector of the text. MS is introduced into the coding framework of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to capture the relative position information between two entities in the text and represent the subspace information. The Dense Connected Convolutional Network (Dense Net) is embedded in the decoding framework to enhance the reuse and transmission of key information and achieve joint extraction of entities and relations in the text.

Furthermore, the characteristics of ASF decision-making problems are fully considered, and the ASF decision-making process is transformed into a rough approximation decision problem. Then, we construct a double-quantitative decision rough set application method over two universes based on ASF decision-making problems. The upper and lower approximations of the ASF decision objects are calculated by the double quantification approximation space over two universes, and the positive region of the ASF decision object is given. The model proposes a method of ASF decision-making and the optimal decision rules based on the personal preference information of decision-makers. Finally, the theoretical model is applied to the ASF decision problem to illustrate the application process and its effectiveness of the model constructed in this paper. At the same time, the corresponding decision suggestions for dealing with the actual ASF problem are proposed based on the application results of numerical examples.},

We approach analysing the computational complexity of MDT in several ways: (1) proving that MDT is computationally intractable ( NP-complete, NPC ) by reducing the travelling salesperson ( TSP ) and set-cover ( SETCOVER ) problems to MDT, (2) showing, in contrast, an example of MDT in tractable form, and (3) showing that, leaving aside TSP and SETCOVER , there are computationally efficient, heuristic-driven search methods based on human diagnostician methods. Calculations show that the sparseness of actual symptom-treatments sets in the space of all possible sets is astronomical (e.g., 10 −204,678 ). While the computational complexity of MDT is interesting theoretically, pragmatically uncovering actual human cognitive practices of MDT will accelerate the development of artificial intelligence to assist and eventually replace physicians.},

Firstly, under the framework of Filippov solution, we derive some general sufficient conditions to guarantee the global existence of the solutions to the proposed CGNNs with discontinuous activations and time-varying delays. Then, by constructing the new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, some new sufficient criteria are given to ascertain the globally exponential stability of the anti-periodic solution for the considered CGNNs with discontinuous activations and time-varying delays. To the authors’ knowledge, the results established in the paper are the only available results on the anti-periodic for the discontinuous CGNNs; some previously known results are extended and complemented. Finally, simulation results of two typical numerical examples are also delineated to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Multiverse optimisation (MVO) algorithm is an excellent meta-heuristic algorithm based on laws of physics. However, it is easy to fall into local optimum when solving complex multimodal optimisation problems with high dimensions. The global optimisation performance of the algorithm is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multiverse optimisation (DE-SMVO) algorithm. First, in order to increase the ability of information exchange and global exploration, a differential mutation strategy is introduced to improve the search equations of MVO based on the differential evolution (DE) theory, enabling the algorithm to explore more unknown space. In addition, the adaptive mutation is carried out on the current global optimal universe in each iteration process, and excellent mutation universe is retained, which enhance the exploitation ability and improve the convergence accuracy of MVO algorithm. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed DE-SMVO algorithm, it is evaluated on 23 benchmark functions in this paper. The experimental results prove that the optimisation performance is significantly better than that of the MVO algorithm, and its performance is also superior compared with nine state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms.},

This process suffers from high false-alarm rates, which renders the demining effort slow and costly. In this paper, we report our attempts in using machine learning for decision making in the demining process. We have created our own database of the MD responses corresponding to landmines and/or clutter. A robotic rail is designed and assembled to accurately measure these responses and build the database. Several machine learning models are then developed using the database with the aim of detecting the presence of landmines and classifying them. It is shown that the classification algorithms lead to accurately discriminating the landmines and distinguishing between different buried objects including mines or other items based on the metal detector delivered data or signature.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing became an inevitable information technology industry. Despite its several plus points such as economy of scale and rapid elasticity, it suffers from vendor lock-in, resource limitation and cybersecurity attacks in which it leads business discontinuity or even business failure. Multi-cloud, on the other hand, can be trustable paradigm to obviate obstacles such as aforesaid unpleasant features of a single cloud. One of the biggest challenges is to know which cloud is commensurate with user’s business process with regards to security objectives. To this end, the new method is presented to quantify the amount of cloud security risk (CSR) in regards to user’s business process. Therefore, in this paper, the web service composition problem is formulated to bi-objective optimisation problem with service cost and multi-cloud risk viewpoints in ever-increasing multi-cloud environment (MCE) in which each provider has its variable pricing policy and different security level. It is obviously an NP-Hard problem. To solve the combinatorial problem, we develop a bi-objective time-varying particle swarm optimisation (BOTV-PSO) algorithm. The parameters are tuned based on elapsed time so a good balance between exploration and exploitation is achieved. To illustrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm, we defined several scenarios and compared the performance of proposed algorithm with multi-objective GA-based (MOGA) optimiser, a single objective genetic algorithm (SOGA) that only optimises cost function and neglects CSR, and multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm (MOSA). The experimental results showed the superiority of proposed BOTV-PSO against other approaches in terms of convergence, diversity, fitness, performance , and even scalability .},

For this aim, an experimental bearing test setup was created in this study. In this setup, vibration signals were obtained from the bearings on which artificial faults were generated in specific sizes. A new feature extraction method based on co-occurrence matrices for bearing vibration signals was proposed instead of the conventional feature extraction methods, as in the literature. The One (1) Dimensional–Local Binary Patterns (1D-LBP) method was first applied to bearing vibration signals, and a new signal whose values ranged between 0–255 was obtained. Then, co-occurrence matrices were obtained from these signals. The correlation, energy, homogeneity, and contrast features were extracted from these matrices. Different machine learning methods were employed with these features to carry out the classification process. Three different data sets were used to test the proposed approach. As a result of analysing the signals with the proposed model, the success rate is 87.50% for dataset1 (different speed), 96.5% for dataset2 (fault size (mm)) and 99.30% for dataset3 (fault type – inner ring, outer ring, ball) was found, respectively.},

In this manuscript, a realisation of the neural network for the construct of an efficient autonomous farm was represented. The developed by farm creates the optimal conditions for growing a crop by controlling the following indicators: Illumination, PH of the ground, air temperature, the temperature of the ground, air humidity, CO2 concentration and humidity of the ground.

In this paper, an improved butterfly optimisation algorithm is proposed, in which guiding weight and population restart strategy are applied to the original algorithm. By adding guiding weight to the global search equation, the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm are improved, and the possibility of jumping out of the local optimal solution is increased by the population restart strategy. In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, 24 benchmark functions commonly used for optimisation algorithm experiments are applied in this paper, including 12 unimodal functions and 12 multimodal functions. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the convergence speed, accuracy and the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution.},

To improve the accuracy of GSA, it is necessary to fine tune its parameters. This study introduces a gravitational search algorithm based on learning automata (GSA-LA) for optimisation of continuous problems. Gravitational constant G(t) is a significant parameter that is used to adjust the accuracy of the search. In this work, learning capability is utilised to select G(t) based on spontaneous reactions. To measure the performance of the introduced algorithm, numerical analysis is conducted on several well-designed test functions, and the results are compared with the original GSA and other evolutionary-based algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the learning automata-based gravitational search algorithm is more efficient in finding optimum solutions and outperforms the existing algorithms.},

There is still no accepted explanation of how players manage to converge on the same solution. It could be that the limited explanatory power arises from the fact that existing theories rely on pure strategies to describe behaviour. The aim of the current study is to construct a cognitive model that more accurately describes human behaviour in tacit coordination games. To this end we constructed individual strategic profiles that take into account the subjective preferences of individual players regarding the prominent selection rules. Subsequently, the individual profiles were clustered to gain insights regarding different types of coordinators. By using machine learning and statistical methods we were able to demonstrate, for the first time, the relationship between different types of strategic profiles and coordination ability. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of constructing a descriptive behavioural model that may potentially improve prediction of human decision-making in the context of human-machine interaction.},

Place cells do the clustering of places. The proposed Place cell model has two types of inputs: Grid cells input and input from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). The LEC is modelled based on the dimension reduction technique. Therefore, the data that causes locations different to be inserted into the place cell from this layer. Another contribution is proposing a new unsupervised dimension reduction method based on k-means. The method can find perpendicular independent dimensions. Also, the distance of cluster centres found in these dimensions is maximised. The method was compared with LDA and PCA in standard functions. Although LDA is a supervised method, the result showed that the proposed unsupervised method outperformed. To evaluate the place cells model, sequences of images collected by a mobile robot was used and similar results to real place cells achieved.},
