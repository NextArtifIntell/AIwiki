  abstract     = {The problem of decentralised robust tracking and model following is investigated for a class of uncertain large-scale interconnected systems with both any time-varying delays and any dead-zone input constraints. By combining an adaptive approach with a multiply integral inequality proposed recently in the control literature, a new design method is developed so that (i) the designed decentralised robust tracking control schemes are direct, i.e. not the complicated ones composed of two parts, which can overwhelm the dead-zone input constraints; (ii) it is unnecessary to know any information on the characteristic parameters of dead-zone functions and the time-varying delays, which makes the decentralised robust tracking control rather simple. It is also proved that the local tracking error between the output of each actual subsystem with delays and input constraints and the dynamical signals of the corresponding local reference model is uniformly exponentially bounded. Finally, a numerical example is also given to describe the design procedure and the simulations of this numerical example are implemented to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel spherical robot design. The pendulum of this robot is actuated by the step motor with cable being the transmission mechanism. Compared to the existing spherical robots, this design concept can reduce the influence of the gear backlash and pendulum vibrations. Until now, few published results have presented rigorous analysis for the asymmetry of the spherical robot system. In order to solve this issue, asymmetry is considered when the dynamic model of the spherical robot is established in our paper and then the system is decoupled into two underactuated subsystems. The relationship between the two subsystems is explored by projection method. Finally, we proposed adaptive hierarchical sliding mode controller (AHSMC), which is a combination of hierarchical sliding mode (HSMC) and adaptive laws for the eccentric moment/resistance torque estimation. The simulated and experimental results were provided to verify the proposed method for balance and velocity control.},

It has been observed that, while still using a small numbers of decision variables, the location of the pole affects the closed-loop behaviour significantly. In the present paper, an adaptive algorithm is developed to systematically improve the closed-loop performance of the system as well as the volume of the feasible region and robust feasible region in the case of using a small numbers of decision variables. In order to do this, a method to select a pole value that yields high performance for the initial condition of the system is proposed. The method generates a lookup table of the high-performance pole value obtained through off-line computations. Then, the table is used to assign the pole in the online process. Closed-loop stability for the scheme is established using sub-optimality arguments. Simulations illustrate the suggested method&#39;s effectiveness to achieve a balance between performance, optimality, and computational load.},

By introducing nonlinear mapping, the asymmetric and symmetric output constrained stochastic nonlinear system is transformed into a new system without any constraint. It is the first time that a switching system is used to convert symmetric and asymmetric output constraints in the same system. An adaptive neural output-feedback controller is developed based on the backstepping technique. A state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable system state signals. An adaptive controller is designed to ensure that the output tracking error converges to a small region of the origin. The control scheme ensures that all signals in the closed-loop systems are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded.

To enhance the exponential ISS, an intelligent packet-based control method with buffering is proposed by introducing the acknowledgement signal (ACK), in which the trial transmission attempts of the control packet are intelligently determined by the situation (successful or failed) of its last sampling transmission instant after identifying the unnecessary transmission points and the necessary transmission points. Then, inspired by the packet-based control technology with buffering, the sufficient condition for attempting transmission of the control packet is given, in which the exponential ISS with maximum robustness index can be preserved. Compared with the existing method with a fixed transmission rate for the control packet, it is shown that the considered framework improves the exponential ISS performance with equal or less communication resource costs.},

This proposal aims at maximising the allowable upper bound of network-induced delay, together with the number of consecutive packet dropouts, from which uncertain and disturbed NCS plants are stable. A novel augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKF), dependent on both the lower and upper bounds of the network-induced time-varying delay, is considered to derive the proposed delay-dependent LMI-based H ∞ stability conditions. Relaxation of these conditions are obtained by exploiting simple and double integral Wirtinger&#39;s inequalities to introduce more degrees of freedom from the LKF terms than existing related conditions in the literature. Finally, numerical examples and simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the conservatism improvement raised by this proposal compared to previous related results.},

Based on the measurement data, the optimal estimator is given. Secondly, by using maximum principle, a sufficient and necessary condition for the optimal control problem is presented.

  abstract     = {Multi-sensor filtering fusion (MSFF) is a fascinating subject in the realm of networked filtering due to its advantage of effectively integrating sensor outputs from multiple sources. Owing to the massive usage of low-cost commercial and off-the-shelf sensors, MSFF could be easily prone to a very special kind of measurement nonlinearity named censored measurements. Meanwhile, taking into account the limited network resources, data transmission in a networked environment is unavoidably subject to communication constraints. As such, it would be quite interesting to examine the impacts from both censored measurements and communication constraints onto MSFF and moreover, develop certain suitable MSFF schemes to accurately reconstruct system states of interest. In this paper, we aim to provide a bibliographical review on MSFF problems with censored measurements under a constrained network environment. Canonical MSFF approaches are first surveyed and subsequently, the mathematical models and handling strategies of the censored measurements are systematically recaped. Later on, typical communication constraints are introduced in detail according to their respective engineering backgrounds, occurring manners and modelling strategies. In addition, latest MSFF progress is discussed at great length and the underlying challenges are also clearly highlighted. Finally, general concluding remarks along with possible future directions are explicitly pointed out.},

As such, this paper presents a survey of trends and techniques of fault detection in NDSs. First, some typical fault detection methods are summarised based on the various residual assessment functions. Then, some interesting developments are systematically reviewed from two aspects, that is, fault detection with NIP and fault detection under various communication scheduling schemes. In addition, some frontier topics are extensively discussed on fault detection with communication protocols, cyber-attacks, and its applications. Finally, several future works of fault detection problems are investigated to motivate future research.},

Recent progresses on these two major research trends are reviewed, respectively, for WSN-based monitoring systems.

The main results along this line of research are classified into protocol-based scheduling, static event-triggered scheduling, dynamic event-triggered scheduling and stochastic event-triggered scheduling. Then, in the second part, the latest results on secure distributed state estimation are reviewed, where secure distributed state estimation under data integrity attacks and data available attacks, and distributed attack detection are examined, respectively.

In this paper, we make an attempt to review the latest state estimation schemes for CDNs especially those over the networked environment. Firstly, the engineering background and the current attractive topics in regard to CDNs are presented. Subsequently, we provide a review of several types of state estimation methods under different performance indices, for example, H ∞ state estimation, set-membership state estimation, optimal state estimation and fault estimation. Next, particular effort is devoted to show the up-to-date progresses on the protocol-based state estimation and compensation-based state estimation approaches for CDNs. Finally, some challenging problems are outlined regarding the future research to promote the theoretical developments in related fields.},

  abstract     = {Solving the optimal mean-field control problem usually requires complete system information. In this paper, a Q-learning algorithm is discussed to solve the optimal control problem of the unknown mean-field discrete-time stochastic system. First, through the corresponding transformation, we turn the stochastic mean-field control problem into a deterministic problem. Second, the H matrix is obtained through Q-function, and the control strategy relies only on the H matrix. Therefore, solving H matrix is equivalent to solving the mean-field optimal control. The proposed Q-learning method iteratively solves H matrix and gain matrix according to input system state information, without the need for system parameter knowledge. Next, it is proved that the control matrix sequence obtained by Q-learning converge to the optimal control, which shows theoretical feasibility of the Q-learning. Finally, two simulation cases verify the effectiveness of Q-learning algorithm.},

The adaptive robust unscented Kalman filter (ARUKF)-based estimation algorithm is designed, which can quickly estimate state variables, stuck faults, partial loss of effectiveness (PLOE) faults, and disturbances at the same time. By utilising the improved model predictive static programming (MPSP) technique, the complexity of processing multiple constraints and the computation are significantly reduced.

In network transmission processes, two problems (including limited resources and denial of service (DoS) attacks) profoundly affect the usability of control systems. Especially, DoS attacks that occur in feedback channel can make the systems open-loop. In this regard, a novel memory-based anti-attack strategy is presented, which is implemented by adding a cache function to network controllers. An event-triggering mechanism is adopted to improve network resource utilisation and reduce the probability of transmission data being attacked. MPC technology is employed for network controllers, which optimises the control input and state by minimising an upper bound of a quadratic cost function. Then, closed-loop switched system is established, and the coupling relationship between switching and attacking is clearly discussed. Based on average dwell time approach, H ∞ performance is analysed. The co-design of MPC controllers and event-triggering matrices are given by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility.},

By introducing a full-order state observer and three dynamic equations, output feedback tracking control scheme is constructed to ensure that all signals of the closed-loop system are globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB).

Moreover, by making use of the updated values of these unknown bounds, we propose a memoryless state feedback controller for such a class of uncertain time-delay systems. Based on Lyapunov stability theory and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, it is shown that the closed-loop dynamical system resulting from the proposed adaptive robust control schemes in the presence of multiple delayed state perturbations is globally uniformly practically exponentially stable.

The prescribed performance of the trajectory tracking of the exoskeleton is guaranteed by constraining the tracking error between the preset upper and lower boundaries. The boundaries of the proposed NDOPPC can be asymmetric functions in various forms, which increases the flexibility of the prescribed performance. The proposed NDOPPC is designed based on backstepping and the stability is analysed with Lyapunov theorem. Comparative simulations have been conducted with MATLAB/Simulink. Compared to computed torque controller (CTC) and nonlinear disturbance observer based computed torque controller (NDOCTC), the obtained results of comparative simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of NDOPPC.

So then he can compute the strategy that will lead the game to the global optimum that is favourable for him. Most of the current work is devoted to this situation. Nevertheless, such an assumption is unrealistic. This paper proposes an incentive scheme in which the game&#39;s dynamic depends on an unknown value that belongs to a finite set. The solution of the incentive strategy is computed in terms of the worst-case scenario, of the team&#39;s optimal solution. Based on the Robust Maximum Principle, the new incentive is presented in the form of a mini-max feedback control. Two numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the specified-time platoon control for the networked vehicles modelled by the third-order dynamics with uncertain external bounded disturbance. The vehicles are subjected to disturbance and parameter uncertainties. To ensure the platoon can converge within a predefined time, a novel disturbance observer with a time-varying dynamic gain is proposed. By the time transformation approach, the disturbance observer is proved to be uniformly ultimate bounded (UUB) stable in a specified time. The time-varying dynamic gain is also applied to design the novel specified-time controller for the vehicle platoon and rigorous proof is presented based on Lyapunov stability. Under the proposed disturbance observer and controller, the vehicle platoon can be stabilised within the predefined time without depending on any system parameters and initial conditions. Finally, some comparison simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.},

Based on this special feature of the type of HOFA models, controllability of general dynamical control systems is proposed. It is revealed that a general dynamical control system can be represented by a controllable subsystem described by a HOFA model, and an extra uncontrollable one or supplementary one. While a general dynamical control system is called stabilisable if its uncontrollable (autonomous) subsystem does not exist, or is stable in a certain sense. Finally, two parametric design approaches for control of the type of general HOFA models are proposed, which provide all the design degrees of freedom. Several examples, including ones of sub-fully actuated systems, are treated, which demonstrate the effect of the proposed theories.},

Due to severe resource constraints, it is ‘expensive’ for spacecraft to handle the faults in orbit. To overcome the constraints, we try to reduce the CR cost from a perspective of time management. The basic idea of this method is to propose a reconfigurability evaluation index to quantify the capability of the fault system in maintaining admissible performance by CR measures, and then to derive the mathematical relationship between the reconfigurability index and four crucial instants during the CR process. Based on this, the CR instant is optimised by maximising the reconfigurability index. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through an example. The results show that by enhancing the time management efficiency during the CR process, the limited resources can be economised to some extent.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the Inertial Navigation System/Global Navigation Satellite System (INS/GNSS) integrated navigation system is widely used in many applications. The extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a popular data fusion method for the INS/GNSS integrated navigation system. However, the process and measurement noise covariance matrices of the EKF cannot be modelled accurately due to varied scenes and complicated GNSS signal errors in urban environments, which undermines or deteriorates the EKF&#39;s performance. To mitigate noise covariance uncertainties&#39; influence, this paper proposes an adaptive EKF algorithm named SARSA EKF, which enables the State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) method in EKF to realise the autonomous selection of the noise covariance matrices based on the Q-value. Meanwhile, a pruning algorithm is designed to remove inappropriate selections of noise covariance matrices and enhance the performance. The simulation and field test results indicate that the positioning accuracy of the SARSA EKF is better than the traditional EKF and the Q-learning EKF (QLEKF). The positioning accuracy&#39;s mean error of the SARSA EKF decreases by 34.32\% and 25.95\% compared with the traditional EKF and the QLEKF, respectively. And the positioning accuracy&#39;s standard deviation of the SARSA EKF decreases by 41.74\% and 32.99\% compared with the traditional EKF and the QLEKF, respectively.},

In a networked 2-D switched control system, the sensors and the controller are typically connected through a shared communication network of limited bandwidth, which is likely to result in data collision problem. To circumvent this network-induced problem, a new SCP is dedicatedly put forward for the 2-D switched system in order to orchestrate the transmission order of sensor nodes, under which only one sensor node obtains the privilege to access the network at each transmission instant. Then, based on the nominal system information compensation, a set of new mode-dependent output-feedback controllers is designed for 2-D switched systems subject to SCP and external disturbances. Moreover, using the average dwell-time approach, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the existence of the desired controllers that guarantee both the exponential mean-square stability and the ℓ 2 – ℓ ∞ performance.

At the same time, the stability of NCSs is analysed in frequency domain, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expression is given by using spectral decomposition technique and Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy. The packet dropout phenomenon caused by DoS attacks is described by Bernoulli distribution. By virtue of the NE strategy, the stability of NCSs can be optimised. In the obtained results, the influence of the traditional constraints and DoS attacks is illustrated. Finally, some numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results.},

Fuzzy logical systems (FLSs) are employed to solve the uncertainties of the controlled plant, and the immeasurable states are estimated by employing the fuzzy observer. In the designed observer, to compensate for the effect of unknown dead-zone by invoking the known designed event-triggered input signal, an adaptive parameter is designed. Furthermore, due to event-triggered control (ETC) places a great burden on the computing space, the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is used to solve the problem of ‘explosion of complexity’ in each step, and the simplified barrier Lyapunov function (SBLF) is utilised to restrict the tracking error within the prescribed boundaries. Consequently, the designed parameter adaptive laws and event-triggered controller can ensure that all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Ultimately, two numerical simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered control theory.},

This article presents an event-triggered adaptive fuzzy control scheme for nonstrict-feedback switched stochastic nonlinear systems with state constraints. The barrier Lyapunov functions are deployed to make all states maintain the prescribed regions. In addition, the event-triggered mechanism is incorporated into the backstepping framework to mitigate the data transmission. The fuzzy logic systems are exploited to cope with the system uncertainties, and then the adaptive fuzzy control strategy is recursively constructed. The devised event-triggered adaptive fuzzy controller can not only surmount the influence of state constraints but also decrease unnecessary resource consumption. In virtue of common Lyapunov function method, it is shown that all system signals are bounded under switching signals and the predefined constraints are not violated.

The current fixed time design cannot meet the requirement for rapidity. The design to meet this requirement must be such that the settling time can be given in advance, that is, the so-called predefined-time design. This paper deals with the predefined-time consensus problem for a class of nonholonomic chained-form multiagent dynamic systems with unknown disturbances. First, a distributed observer for each follower is investigated such that the leader state can be estimated by the followers in a predefined time. Based on this observer, a switching consensus tracking controller is proposed to ensure that the tracking errors converge to zero within a predefined time. Compared with the existing finite-time and fixed-time schemes, the upper bound of the settling time is an directly tunable control parameter, and the settling time can be easily tuned by the control parameter. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved by the Lyapunov method. A simulation example of wheeled mobile robots is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.},

Specifically, we consider the presence of misbehaving nodes within the floating and driver nodes in addition to the misbehaviours resulting from the unmodelled nodes, and propose a feedback control approach applied to the driver nodes for suppressing the effect of all misbehaving nodes in the multiagent network. We show closed-loop stability with the proposed approach, where the driver nodes asymptotically or closely follow a given command and the remaining nodes may also follow this command or remain bounded depending on the location of driver nodes in the multiagent network. Considering limited resources in that the number of driver nodes is generally fewer than the number of floating nodes, we further characterize the effect of the location of the driver nodes to closed-loop stability. Our findings reveal how the driver nodes need to be selected for isolating the effect of misbehaving nodes in certain portions of the multiagent network such that the nodes in those portions also follow the given command.},

Instead of developing a new control law for the system, we propose the interaction control scheme by the controllers for under-actuated aerial systems. By selecting the deferentially flat output as the configuration, the equations of motion of the two systems are described in an identical form. The flight control task of the under-actuated aerial vehicle is thus converted into the control of the aerial slung load system. With the help of an admittance filter, the compliant trajectory is generated for the load subject to external interaction force. Moreover, the convergence of the whole system is proved by using the boundedness of the tracking error of vehicle attitude tracking as well as the estimation error of external force. Based on the developed theoretical results, an example is provided to illustrate the design algorithm of interaction controller for the aerial slung load via an existing flight controller directly.

To overcome such a difficulty, a few-shot data-driven approach has been proposed in this paper, and operating data are collected to simultaneously tune feedback controller parameters and estimate internal model applied in SP. Subsequently, the anti-windup compensator is constructed with the estimated model and compensator gain is calculated by using the Lyapunov equation.

In our proposed design procedure, neural networks (NNs) are introduced to identify the unknown nonlinear functions and a valid hypothesis is used to deal with the unknown system coefficients.

Then the lumped system matched and mismatched uncertainties are estimated by developing a new adaptive fixed-time disturbance observer (AFTDO) based on super-twisting technique. The chattering problem existed in traditional disturbance observer (DO) can be reduced with the proposed AFTDO allowing the gains to adapt the changed derivative of lumped disturbances, effectively.

  abstract     = {Dynamic optimisation for hypersonic cruise vehicle (HCV) is a challenge for the complex nonlinear constraints with waypoint and no-fly zone during a global strike mission. Because the passing time of each waypoint is unknown, it is difficult to guarantee the precision of waypoint constraints on non-collocation points for traditional pseudospectral method. A novel optimal control approach is therefore proposed, where waypoints are firstly transformed into variable optimisation parameters of pseudospectral method, which can satisfy the waypoint constraints completely. Then, a novel non-uniform pseudospectral approach with mesh refinement is further proposed by introducing the adaptive gradient analysis to provide a time grid iteratively. With this refinement, the proposed approach needs fewer computational time to achieve better performance of accuracy compared with traditional uniform refinement pseudospectral method. The proposed approaches are finally applied to a classic HCV problem with waypoints and no-fly zone constraints and compared with other methods reported in literature in detail. The research results validate both the effectiveness and the time saving benefit of the proposed methods.},

The proposed controller is designed by the backstepping technique based on Lyapunov stability. By using the proposed controller, the asymptotic stability can be achieved. The proposed controller is firstly tested on a simple second-order system, which can be directly controlled by the proposed control method. Then, the proposed controller is tested on a complex quaternion based aircraft attitude stabilisation system. The proposed method cannot be directly applied to the attitude control system, so some advanced derivations are conducted.

Using a three-term approximation-based model, a forward subsystem with three constant delays and a feedback subsystem are presented. Two separate input–output stability criteria have been formulated, using an input–output approach and a scaled small gain theorem: a criterion based on the lifting method, a non-quadratic Lyapunov function, and bounded real lemma, another criterion based on a non-quadratic Lyapunov–krasovskii functional approach. Using this result, the input–output stabilisation problem is resolved through the so-called parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. The conditions obtained are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Three numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the advantages and merit of the proposed method.},

After verifying this fact, it is concluded that the angle between these aligning vectors can be considered as a sliding surface and based on this observation, a generalised guidance structure is proposed using the sliding mode control. This approach presents a unified strategy for analysing and implementing different guidance methods such as velocity-to-be-gained, pure pursuit, proportional navigation and path following. The main advantages of this structure are its generality and simple extension to the three-dimensional space. Finally, the superiority of the proposed approach to traditional strategies is demonstrated through simulation results.},

A novel robust constrained control approach is proposed by incorporating the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) and nonlinear damping items within the framework of dynamic surface control design. The dynamic surface control is used to avoid the ‘explosion of terms’ problem of the traditional backstepping control. The tan-type BLF is utilised to preserve the position tracking errors always within the predefined position constraints. The nonlinear damping items are applied to handle the effect of external disturbances. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the resulting closed-loop system is rigorously proved through the Lyapunov’s direct method. A distinct feature of the proposed control approach is that it is a general methodology for the trajectory tracking control of PVTOL aircraft with or without position constraints. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed control approach.},

The problem of the strong interconnection terms is solved by combining the backstepping approach and graph theory.

The design algorithm iteratively searches the solution space of controller parameters to find a proper controller gain that guarantees the delay-independent stability of the closed-loop system. The algorithm divides the solution space to some simplexes, selects one simplex and evaluates two checking methods on this simplex. The first method checks the stabilisability of the corner points (to establish the feasible point) and the other detects the total infeasibility (total de-stabilisability) of the simplex (to omit the undesired parts). One interesting property of the method is its capability in detecting total de-stabilisability of a simplex through its corner points. If none of these methods is successful, the simplex is divided into two smaller ones which will be checked in the next algorithm’s iterations. According to the direct search nature, the algorithm is non-conservative and assuredly reaches a stabilizable point in the feasible space of the design space. The proposed algorithm and previous methods are evaluated on a set of random generated systems to compare the feasibility of the methods.

  abstract     = {This study proposes less conservative conditions for robust linear quadratic regulator controllers using state-derivative feedback (SDF). The algebraic Ricatti equation was formulated using the SDF, and its solution was obtained by linear matrix inequalities. SDF was chosen owing to the presence of accelerometers as sensors. Since accelerometers are the main sensors in mechanical systems, the proposed technique may be used to control/attenuate their vibrations/oscillations. Moreover, to formulate the less conservative conditions, some methods in the specialised literature were used, such as, for example, slack variables by Finler&#39;s Lemma. The paper also offers necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary convex combination of square real matrices A 1 , A 2 , … , A r to be a nonsingular matrix, and thus an invertible one: A 1 must be nonsingular and all the real eigenvalues of A 1 − 1 A 2 , A 1 − 1 A 3 , … , A 1 − 1 A r must be positive. This result is important in the formulation of the proposed less conservative conditions since it was assumed that a given convex combination is nonsingular. A feasibility analysis demonstrates that the proposed conditions reduce the conservatism. Thereby, it is possible to stabilise a higher number of systems and to reduce the guaranteed cost. Furthermore, a practical implementation illustrated the application of the proposed conditions.},

  abstract     = {For the fractional-order Hammerstein system with white noise, the difficulty of identification is that the parameters of the linear and the nonlinear blocks and the fractional order are unknown and the intermediate variable and the states are unmeasurable. To overcome this difficulty, we transform the system from an input nonlinear pseudo-state-space system to an input–output representation and we develop an algorithm based on the Recursive Least Squares, the Levenberg–Marquardt and the Auxiliary Model Principle. The convergence of the identified parameters is studied. The performance of the proposed algorithm are tested by two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the design of an optimal infinite-dimensional Luenberger observer combined with a linear-quadratic state feedback controller for a system of hyperbolic PDEs. The design is based on the duality fact between the control design and the observer design. Both the original linear-quadratic and dual control problems have been solved by using the associated Riccati equations. A general algorithm that combines the designed observer together with the (estimated) state-feedback controller has been developed. The theoretical development has been applied to a fixed-bed reactor to validate the performances of the designed observer-controller via numerical simulation. Estimation and control of the temperature and the reactant concentration in a fixed-bed reactor is investigated by using the developed algorithm, which lead to express the jacket temperature (manipulated variable) as a feedback of the estimated temperature and concentration in the reactor.},

  abstract     = {Error Governor (EG) deals with the problem of dynamically modifying the feedback error driving a controller having bounded control signals, for preventing controller or actuators saturation, avoiding integrator and/or slow dynamics windup and preserving the nominal linear controller behaviour. In this paper, an optimisation-based EG scheme is proposed for discrete-time Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) controllers driving Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) plants. The PID controller is considered in state-space form, and this formulation is used to pose the EG problem as a constrained quadratic program (QP). Because the QP problem is subject to inequality constraints related to controller saturation, in order to use the proposed scheme in real-world applications, it should be necessary to consider appropriate algorithms for efficiently solving the optimisation problem. An efficient way to efficiently compute the solution of the EG problem is presented, reducing the computational effort required to solve the EG QP for using the proposed scheme in real control loops with high sampling rate. An analysis of control performance and computational burden is provided, comparing in simulation studies the optimal EG scheme performance with respect to control results provided by saturated PID with and without anti-windup action.},

Existence and properties are examined, including control bounded-ness, average trajectory and formation manoeuvrability with respect to the weighting matrices and virtual leader reference input. More specifically, it is shown that under the time-varying flocking algorithms, the multi-agents ultimately run into lattice formations and their kinematical features in terms of orientation, scaling, subspace specification and homogeneous/heterogeneous consensus can be manoeuvred. Moreover, by gain-scheduling assignment for the leader-average dynamics via the variation-of-constant formula and iterative learning optimisation, trajectory-tracking manoeuvrable formation control can be achieved. Technical advantages include: flexible formations rather than rigid ones can be dealt with; formation and trajectory tracking can be designed separately and implemented simultaneously; diverse formations are achievable by selecting the weighting matrices; trajectory-tracking control is independent of trajectory modelling. Numerical examples are illustrated to show the main results.},

  abstract     = {To develop an effective control and monitoring scheme for automotive engines, a precise knowledge of the parameters and unmeasurable states of the nonlinear model capturing the overall dynamics of engines is of utmost importance. For a new vehicle out of the assembly line, the nonlinear model has constant parameters. However, in the long run, due to regular wear-and-tear, and for other unpredictable disturbances, they may change. The main challenges are how to obtain the information of parameters and states under the influence of process noise and measurement noise. To address these challenges, we present a new integrated state and parameter estimation algorithm in this paper for spark ignition (SI) engines based on the constrained unscented Kalman filter and the improved recursive least square technique. The system under consideration is a highly nonlinear mean value SI engine model consisting of the throttle, intake manifold, engine speed dynamics, and fuel system. The performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of root-mean-square-error and robustness with regards to initial conditions and random noises is analysed through exhaustive simulation scenarios considering constant, and time-varying parameters. In addition, the performance of other state-of-the-art estimation algorithms is also compared with that of the developed integrated algorithm.},

In order to eliminate the influence of ‘the explosion of complexity’ which will exist in the conventional controller design process via backstepping technique, the control method of the command-filter is introduced. For the problem of input dead-zone which appears in the stochastic nonlinear systems, which will be dealt by a reasonable method, namely, the dead-zone nonlinearity can be regarded as a combination for a linear term and bounded disturbance-like term. Combined adaptive backstepping design algorithm and Lyapunov stability theorem, an adaptive neural command-filter controller is developed. The proposed control scheme reduces the calculation burden due to the repeated differentiation for the virtual control laws and guarantees all the closed-loop signals remain semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in the sense of the four moment. And the tracking error converges to a small area near zero. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the presented approach is proved by simulation results.},

In order to handle complications resulting from a large decision space and complex environmental geometry, two key concepts are adopted: (a) a diffusion wavelet representation of the Markov chain for hierarchical abstraction of the state space; and (b) a desirability function-based representation of the Markov decision process (MDP) to efficiently calculate the optimal policy. An IOC problem constructed on a ‘abstract state’ is solved, which is much more tractable than using the original bases set; moreover, the solution can be obtained recursively in the ‘coarse to fine’ direction by utilizing the hierarchical structure of basis functions. The resulting multiscale plan is utilized to finally compute a continuous-time optimal control policy within a receding horizon implementation. Illustrative numerical experiments on a robot path control in a complex environment and on a quadrotor ball-catching task are presented to verify the proposed method.},

For the parametric system characterising multidimensional parameter space and nonlinear parametric dependence, we first approximate the system matrices by tensor functions of the parameters, whose first-order coefficients are third-order tensors. In order to effectively reduce the computational cost and the storage burden, we propose a parallel tensor compression algorithm based on Tensor-SVD to deal with the tensors in the tensor functions. Then, we obtain the low-rank approximation in Kruskal form of third-order tensors. After that, by computing the first several expansion coefficients of the state variable with the selected parameter vectors, the projection matrix is constructed to obtain the reduced parametric system. Theoretical analysis shows that the reduced parametric system can match the first several expansion coefficients of the output variable of the original system at the selected parameter vectors. Moreover, the stability of the proposed MOR method is discussed. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated by two numerical examples.},

To this end, the Tobit Kalman filtering problem for discrete-time systems with the dead-zone-like censoring and channel fading is studied where the censoring and fading phenomena are, respectively, described by the Tobit measurement model and the L t h L t h Lth -order Rice fading channel model. The design of the filter is carried out in two stages: (1) the state augmentation technique is firstly adopted to remove the time-delay effect caused by the fading channel; and (2) the statistical information of censored measurements is used to determine the optimal filter structure in the minimum mean-square error sense, where the orthogonal projection principle is utilised to avoid the deep correlations among the multiple random variables induced by measurement censoring and channel fading. Besides, the desired filter is also devised based on the approach of the conditional expectation. For the convenience of calculation, the filter with the dead-zone-like censoring is converted into an equivalent one with one-side censoring. Finally, a numerical example of estimating the ballistic ball rates is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed filters.},

Utilising the full-actuation feature of the HOFA systems, disturbance attenuation and decoupling controllers for the corresponding systems are conveniently designed such that constant linear closed-loop systems with designed disturbance rejection properties are resulted in. Parametric designs for both controllers are provided, and disturbance attenuation is achieved by establishing a parametric form of the closed-loop transfer function from the disturbance to the output, while the parametric form of the disturbance decoupling controller is derived based on a complete parametric solution to a type of generalised Sylvester equations (GSEs). As a consequence of the parameter approaches, additional performance requirements on the closed-loop systems can be also easily handled.

The existence of nonlinear equations in the presence of system noises results in an identical non-Gaussian noise, which leads to the difficulty in solving the problem of fault estimation with the unscented Kalman filter. Therefore, a filter combining a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the augmented ensemble unscented Kalman filter (AEnUKF) is designed to estimate the fault in this class of nonlinear systems.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with optimal control of vibrations of two uniform elastic or viscoelastic nonlinear Gao beams that are connected with a joint. The dynamic contact is modelled with the Signorini non-penetration or unilateral conditions in which the stops are assumed to be perfectly rigid. By the Dubovitskii and Milyutin functional analytical approach, we derive the Pontryagin maximum principle for the optimal control problem with multiple equality and multiple inequality constraints in fixed final horizon case. A remark is made on how to use the obtained results in the case of a quadratic cost functional.},

The main procedure is using a series of expansion coefficient vectors of each state variables in the space spanned by general orthogonal polynomials that satisfy a recurrence formula to generate a projection based on multiorder Arnoldi algorithm. The resulting reduced-order model not only matches a desired number of expansion coefficients of the original output but also retains the topology structure. Meanwhile, the stability is well preserved under some certain conditions and the error bound is also given. Finally, two numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in the views of accuracy and computational cost.},

Firstly, a longitudinal dynamics for hypersonic vehicles is established in the ODE-beam cascade form and the distributed fault model is built. Next, a novel fault accommodation scheme is developed to achieve fault accommodation and vibration suppression. Such a control strategy is based on the control separation formulation: one component is for accommodating the distributed fault, another one is for the closed-loop stability. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system is analysed by using the direct Lyapunov method and bilinear matrix inequalities technique. Then, a new algorithm is provided to obtain the control gain matrices of the fault-tolerant control law.

Introducing the concept of pseudo sampling, NCS is modelled as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system. Two methods are explained to obtain a convex approximation of the uncertainty region. It is clarified how to perform the approximation to have the uncertainty space as small as possible. Using this uncertainty space, a polytopic approximation is obtained for the LPV model. The approximated model is used to synthesise a controller for set-point tracking and disturbance rejection. An observer is also synthesised based on this model. The simplicity of the model together with a small uncertainty space, results in less conservative LMI conditions. Compared to the existing results, an improved tracking performance is obtained. The final value theorem for discrete-time LTI systems with constant sampling period is extended to time varying sampling periods. This theorem is used to design a feedforward gain for zero steady-state tracking of staircase reference signals.},

We then propose a heuristic algorithm that generates a reduced-order model, which tends to achieve these optimality conditions. The frequency-limited and the time-limited H 2 -pseudo-optimal model reduction problems are also considered wherein we restrict our focus on constructing a reduced-order model that satisfies a subset of the respective optimality conditions for the local optimum. Two new algorithms have been proposed that enforce two out of four optimality conditions on the reduced-order model upon convergence.

Two evaders, starting from the play region, aim at reaching the goal region protected by the faster pursuer who tries to capture the evaders. This game is analysed from kind and degree in analytical forms. The information structure involves that the evaders know which one is being pursued by the pursuer while the pursuer has access to the evaders&#39; current control inputs. We are concerned with the barrier and winning regions, by which the number of evaders reaching the goal region before being captured can be determined. Cooperative strategies for two evaders are derived based on the goal priority between team goal and individual goal. An Apollonius circle based pursuit strategy is explicitly proposed. The δ -Apollonius circle is introduced to handle with the pursuit of the second-pursued evader. When two evaders are both possible to be captured, motivated by the cooperation between two prey animals against a predator, an aiding strategy is proposed such that one evader sacrifices itself to help the other&#39;s evasion.

Based on the established model, barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) are utilised for dealing with system output restrictions. For practical consideration, parameter uncertainties and external disturbances are also taken into account. Under the proposed neural adaptive control scheme, undesirable elastic vibration of the three-dimensional Timoshenko beam is restricted and constrained within given bounds even subject to external perturbations, without needing to know any system parameters. The system stability is proved by the Lyapunov’s direct method. The control performance is verified via using numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the problem of controller design for one closed loop system with feedforward controller and feedback controller simultaneously. After parametrised these two controllers by two unknown parameter vectors, iterative correlation tuning control is proposed to design these unknown controller parameters through one process of finding roots with respect to one correlation function. As no identification process is needed for the unknown plant in iterative correlation tuning control, the unknown controller parameters are identified by using only input–output measured data. Through applying the adaptive idea to guarantee iterative parameter estimators converge to their true values, MIT rule is regarded as a gradient scheme for the constructed correlation in the parameter adjustment mechanism. Further, Lyapunov stability is applied to derive one parameter adjustment law satisfying the stability for the whole adaptive system. From the point of adaptive analysis, some new results about the sensitivity functions are derived for three types of disturbances to consider tracking and regulation with independent object. Generally, iterative correlation tuning control can design controllers directly without any knowledge about the unknown plant and adjust the unknown controller parameters adaptively through one established parameter adjustment mechanism. Finally two simulation examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theories.},

The second problem is inherently asymmetric, and a generalised sector condition is derived to obtain stability conditions based on quadratic Lyapunov functions. Sufficient conditions in terms of LMIs for designing the anti-windup compensator are then derived. By solving these LMIs, the controller matrices along with the less bound of the cost function and an appropriate anti-windup compensator are obtained.

The system description and control design are conducted in Hamiltonian framework , and the excitations are confined to Gaussian white noises. The control design consists of several successive steps: firstly, separating the control into conservative and dissipative components by physical intuition, and expanding two components as polynomials; secondly, deriving the low-dimensional averaged equations of controlled Hamiltonian by stochastic averaging, and obtaining the stationary probability density of controlled responses by solving the associated Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation; thirdly and finally, determining the polynomial coefficients by minimising the performance index which balances the tracking performance and control cost.

In this scheme, an adaptive filter is used to extract the periodic disturbance and the non-perturbed system dynamics from the real output. Then, a multimodel approach is adopted to obtain the models base of the real non-perturbed system. Secondly, the models base is used to develop a multi-model sliding mode control (MM-SMC). Thereafter, the structure of plug-in repetitive control is incorporated into the MM-SMC to ensure good closed loop performances in terms of harmonic disturbance rejection and tracking in the case of nonlinear systems.

In the proposed robust networked ILC scheme, the switching law, iterative initial state, and disturbances, all of which vary with iterations, are well addressed. Corresponding to the actuator side and the measurement side of the networked switched NDTS, the random data dropouts occurred are compensated by the input signals at last iteration and the reference outputs, respectively. As a result, it is theoretically proved that under the non-repetitive uncertainties of the switched NDTS, the mathematical expectation of ILC tracking error remains bounded during the ILC process. While the non-repetitive uncertainties are progressively convergent in iteration domain, a precise tracking to the reference trajectory in mathematical expectation sense can be achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed networked ILC design is validated by a numerical example.},

From the equivalent model and applying Lyapunov Functional method, a sufficient condition based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) for exponential stability with guaranteed decay rate performance is obtained. As a result, the inherent conservatism of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional techniques can arbitrarily be reduced by increasing the number of delay partition intervals including decay rate performance and model uncertainties in polytopic form.

That robotic system is capable of moving over electricity distribution lines, which can easily overcome the obstacles present in those installations like insulators, thanks to its kinematic motion planning of collision avoidance. The cable-climbing robot avoids the obstacles by the adoption of sequential movement planning with the objective of climbing insulators in electric posts. This approach avoids the obstacles, making the robot-articulated suspensions to retract when it is close to the obstacle and to distend after it passes over it. This kind of movement is controlled by a geometric motion planning method which is performed by the quintic polynomial interpolation law. The kinematic modelling uses the screw-based Jacobian Method combining with Virtual Kinematic chains, which permits the usage of the Kirchhoff-Davies method. Thus obtaining the cable-climbing robot inverse kinematic model. Simulation shows the potential use of this technique to cope with the cable-climbing robots control.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on a problem of adaptive fuzzy containment control for nonlinear multi-agent systems with input delay. Through the Pade approximation and intermediate variable, the positive constant delays of nonlinear systems inputs are transferred to the coefficients of the next dynamic equation. The phenomenon of “complexity explosion” in traditional backstepping control technique is avoided by introducing first-order filters, in which a new variable replaces the derivative of the virtual controller. In addition, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions of nonlinear multi-agent systems. No matter what the order of the nonlinear multi-agent systems is, only two adaptive laws need to be designed in the adaptive fuzzy containment controller design process for each follower. Using the proposed control method, all followers can converge to the convex hull established by the leaders, and the closed-loop system is stable. The simulation results can further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a computationally efficient robust predictive control method is proposed for continuous-time under-actuated SISO systems in the presence of actuator saturation and state-dependent uncertainties. The proposition of this research is to employ the idea of model prediction together with the Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Control (AFSMC) for tuning the sliding surface parameters by predicting the anticipated effects of uncertainties. In the proposed scheme, only after the trigger conditions are met, the coefficients of the sliding surface are updated and the AFSMC is applied. Hence, computational complexity can be controlled by adjusting the switching rule. In the AFSMC, a fuzzy system is used to approximate a nonlinear function, and a robust term to compensate for any possible mismatches. An adaptively tuned gain is also applied to the control signal to prevent instability caused by the actuator saturation. Based on the updating sliding surface, fuzzy singletons, the upper bound of the fuzzy approximation error, and the saturation gain are adaptively tuned. Closed-loop stability is shown to be guaranteed using the multiple Lyapunov functions theorem and the Barbalat’s lemma. Finally, the method is applied for the depth control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), depicting the excellent performance of the proposed method.},

Then, an improved negative definiteness lemma based on adjustable parameters is developed, resulting in a less conservative negative definite condition for the derivative of the Lyapunov functional.

A timeline and occurrence analyses were conducted via the software tools, through which popular keywords were visualised in different time periods. These were then grouped into four categories by a hierarchical clustering method, and emerging keywords were selected using burst detection analysis. This was followed by the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average modelling to predict the future research trends in the four clusters as evidenced in the historical data. Documents were discussed in the recent 20 years towards guiding scholars in three aspects, i.e. problems addressed, popular methodologies, and impact in the relevant fields.

Then, the unknown uncertain functions of the under-actuated switched nonlinear system are approximated by utilising the approximation ability of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs). The error terms caused by FLSs and the upper bound of the bias signal of the actuator faults are integrated into a function where the upper bound of the function is on-line estimated. Furthermore, the singular problem of denominators can be well solved by introducing the projection algorithm.

The main results are sufficient conditions for consensus analysis and design of distributed consensus protocols for multi-agent systems. In addition, because the saturation might prevent the multi-agent system to attain consensus on some set of initial conditions, it is also proposed a strategy to calculate a region in which the consensus is guaranteed. The results follow from the Lyapunov–Krasovskii theory and are formulated in the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) framework.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the trajectory tracking problem for large-scale nonlinear systems in lower triangular form by employing the technology of static gain. For one thing, in the interest of improving the fault tolerance of the concerned system, a novel adaptive compensation method is considered in the tracking strategy for dealing with actuator failures. For another, in order to alleviate the communication burden and maintain satisfactory systems performance, the control method for handling event-triggered input is also added in the tracking strategy. Besides, this paper also proves that the designed strategy can achieve the control goal for large-scale nonlinear systems with bounded disturbance. The simulation example of the machine feed system is given to verify the validity of the proposed strategy.},

One of the unique features of the controller is the use of left tracking error function to simplify controller design. A composite error function is designed and it is proved mathematically that the closed-loop attitude as well as the translational dynamics are finite-time stable. The coordinate invariant approach is another unique features of the proposed method as opposed to the literature. Numerical simulations have been provided at the end to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This article proposes an identification technique for two-input-two-output processes with fractional order models via Haar wavelet feature. The presented technique can estimate independent four fractional single-pole time delay models without additional steps to decouple processes during identification. The method uses a well-known relay feedback test to produce the input-output data for measurements. Then, the Haar wavelet operational matrix based algebraic approach is utilised to identify the unknown process models with reduced complexity. Numerical analysis on various examples show the efficacy even in presence of noise and without additional filter or preprocessing of measured signals.

We aimed to present a new method for nonlinear time-dependent control law design based on the application of Zubov’s optimal damping concept. This theory is used to reduce significant computational costs in solving optimal stabilisation problems. The main contribution is the proposition of a new methodology for selecting the functional to be damped. The central idea is to perform parameterisation of a set of admissible items for the mentioned functional. As a particular case, a new method of this parameterisation has been developed, which can be used for constructing an approximate solution of the classical optimisation problem. The emphasis is on the specific choice of the functional to be damped using LQR control to provide the desirable stability and performance features of the closed-loop connection. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach are confirmed using a practical numerical example of the convey-crane control.},

Furthermore, a finite-time fuzzy adaptive consensus tracking protocol is proposed for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems by using integral-type Lyapunov functions. The developed adaptive backstepping design scheme successfully avoids the singularity problem of the derivatives of virtual control signals. It is shown that with the presented control protocol, the consensus tracking errors converge to a small neighbourhood of the origin in finite time, and the other signals of multi-agent systems are bounded.

Based on the reconstructed information from the observer, a fault-tolerant control law is designed by using sliding mode control incorporated adaptive method. Furthermore, to attenuate the chattering problem caused by conventional sliding mode control method, the hyperbolic tangent function is utilised. A novel sliding variable is employed for improving the performance of the modified chattering-free control approach. The proposed fault-tolerant control algorithm is feasible for implementing and unnecessary caculations can be avoided, because the synchronised uncertainties and the actuator faults are tackled separately. Besides, the observer does not require the priori knowledge of the upper bounds of the synchronised uncertainties. Finally, simulation results and comparison are carried out and analysed for illustrating the effectiveness and validness of the proposed control schemes.},

Then, taking account of Gaussian channel noises, a generalised multi-level quantisation mechanism and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator are jointly designed, where optimal quantisation parameters can be solved by minimising the estimation error covariance with given quantisation level. The proposed MMSE estimator not only has a similar recursive structure as the classical Kalman filter, but also dramatically reduces the sensor-to-estimator communication requirement with only a slight deterioration of estimation performance. The combined effect of quantisation mechanism and communication uncertainty on estimation performance is also discussed.

Benefiting from the developed security control method, the adverse effects of network DoS attacks and communication delays can be resisted. Then, a sufficient condition, which is used to achieve the achieve frequency restoration and power-sharing, is established according to the frequency and duration of DoS attacks. By using the average dwell time method and the Lyapunov stability theory, it is theoretically proved that the proposed control scheme can guarantee the stability of the overall AC microgrid system.

Next, constraint conditions are given for the malicious signal considered in deception attacks with the purpose of limiting the difference between the attack signal and the true signal. The aim of this research is to design an observer-based non-fragile H ∞ -consensus controller for each agent such that the multi-agent closed-loop system can achieve the stochastic stability and meet the prescribed disturbance attenuation level when encountering the deception attacks and missing measurements.

To this end, set-membership estimation is employed to detect the occurrence and locate the position of DoS attacks. The model predictive control technique is utilised to schedule the energy management by using the forecasts of photovoltaic generation and load demand. It is shown that the cyber-attack localisation and the desired tolerant control performance against attacks can be both achieved. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

For the purpose of getting close to practical wireless sensor networks, both the bias injection attacks and the channel fading of wireless communication are taken into account in the procedure of filter design. By employing linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique and Taylor&#39;s expansion formula, the nonlinearity, the channel fading, the bias injection attacks and the non-fragile are handled simultaneously in the set-membership filtering framework and the filter design problem is addressed. For the pre-specified filtering performance, sufficient conditions are obtain to ensure the existence of desired filter, where the filter gains are acquired via solving certain recursive LMI. Furthermore, in order to look for the locally best performance, an optimal algorithm is proposed.

First, a networked model of the jacket platform against earthquakes and probabilistic actuator faults is established. Based on this model, a memory-based event-triggering communication scheme is introduced to account for the constrained communication resources. A distinct feature of the proposed triggering scheme is that it has great potential to identify and trigger the significantly changed data than the existing ones without ‘memory’. Then, by formulating the network-based closed-loop platform system as a stochastic delay system, some sufficient conditions are derived for co-designing the desired controller and the triggering scheme. Finally, comparative simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed triggering and control co-design method. It is shown that compared with some existing event-triggering control methods, the proposed memory-event-triggering H ∞ reliable controller is effective to mitigate vibrations of the jacket platform and is potentially advantageous to save more network bandwidth and control cost.},

To reduce unnecessary communication frequency of sensor measurements and thus communication resource expenditure, an event-triggered communication mechanism is employed to determine whether or not each sensor&#39;s measurement should be broadcast to the distributed fault detection filter (FDF) over the wireless network at each time step. Then, an H i / H ∞ optimisation approach is proposed to achieve distributed event-triggered fault detection for the concerned system. Specifically, a set of distributed event-triggered FDFs is constructed based on the event-triggered measurement information from each sensor node and its adjacent nodes. Different from the existing distributed event-triggered FD schemes, the major contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the proposed FDF for each sensor node can be designed individually and the residual signal on each node is completely decoupled from the event-triggered transmission error. Second, the design of distributed event-triggered FDFs is formulated as an H i / H ∞ optimisation problem and an optimal solution can be obtained by recursively computing some Riccati recursions. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, the insertion of the communication network brings many challenges, such as network-induced phenomena and cyber-security, which should be handled properly. On the other hand, the sliding mode control (SMC) has become an effective scheme for the synthesis of NCSs due to its strong robustness and SMC has wide applications in NCSs. In this paper, some recent advances on SMC for NCSs are reviewed. In particular, some new SMC schemes for NCSs subject to time-delay, packet losses, quantisation and uncertainty/disturbance are summarised firstly. Subsequently, the problem of SMC for NCSs under scheduling protocols is discussed, where different communication protocols are introduced for the energy saving purpose during the synthesis of NCSs. Next, some recent results on SMC for NCSs with actuator/sensor fault and cyber-attack are recalled. Finally, the conclusion is provided and the potential research challenges on SMC for NCSs are pointed out.},

Some challenges from communication scheduling, limited bandwidth as well as security vulnerability have to be seriously handled though the applications of communication technologies bring into some conveniences. As such, it is of utmost significance in theory and great importance in applications to establish engineering-feasible recursive filtering algorithms for networked nonlinear systems. This paper focuses on the development of this topic and provides an up-to-date survey of the existing nonlinear filtering techniques. The introduction of three classes of communication protocols is first presented in great detail, and then comprehensive reviews and summaries of the nonlinear recursive filtering problems with Gaussian/non-Gaussian noises are elaborated according to different strategies responding to nonlinear functions or noises. Particularly, the reviews are layout from the extended Kalman filtering, the unscented/cubature Kalman filtering, the set-membership filtering as well as the H ∞ filtering. Furthermore, several challenging issues are raised to stimulate further related theoretical research and practical applications in this field.},

The ILC update law is synthesised based on the current iteration tracking error (CITE), and the uniform convergence of the input control sequence is presented using the contraction mapping technique. From image processing standpoint, for detecting the foreground objects from a video stream, a background subtraction algorithm using frame difference technique is employed. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is tested on a laboratory scale ball on plate system using hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing.

A novel universal barrier Lyapunov function is proposed to not only handle systems with asymmetric output constraints but also work for systems with symmetric constraints or without constraints, without reshaping the controller framework. On the basis of the stochastic fixed-time stability theorem and adding a power integrator strategy, an elaborate control method is established to ensure that the system state fixed-time converges to zero almost surely without the knowledge of initial conditions. Meanwhile, the system output is always retained in the preset asymmetric region in probability. A practical example is utilised to verify the validity of the proposed theory.},

However, the convergence theory of Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) approximation fails to apply to such non-smooth and discontinuous optimal control problems. Therefore, this paper develops an extended multi-interval LGR pseudospectral method (EMLGR), which has the following features: (i) the mixed-integer controls at the end of each interval and the interval intersections are added as two new controls to avoid the unrestrained control and shorten the switching time of integer control, and (ii) a smart adaptive collocation monitor (SACM) is provided to optimise the polynomial order and interval structure for further reducing computational complexity and improving approximation precision. The detailed solution procedure of EMLGR is given in this study, and experimental studies including five challenging practical engineering MIOCPs are taken to verify the superiorities of the proposed EMLGR in efficiency, accuracy and stability.},

Furthermore, there always exist uncertainties in the controller and observer gain matrices, a novel class of non-fragile containment control with time delay is addressed for the first time, which can be more applicable and more significant to real physical systems. By making use of the convex analysis, algebraic graph theory, matrix transformation and Lyapunov theory, it is derived that the obtained results are cast as feasible linear matrix inequalities and the states of the followers finally converge to the convex hull formed by the leaders. Finally, two simulation examples of nine-agents topology are presented to verify the validity of obtained theoretical analysis.},

A novel controller, intermittent combination event-triggered strategy, is proposed to save more control resources. Unlike the traditional event-triggered mechanism, the combined event-triggered strategy includes the item of the error function and exponential function. The communication between agents is intermittent. Under the pinning control, only a few agents can receive information from the virtual leader. By utilising the designed controller, sufficient conditions for exponential boundedness of FOMSs are gained along with fractional-order Lyapunov methods, the monotonicity of the Mittag-Leffler function and matrix analysis. The article also investigates the consensus of FOMSs via pinning combination event-triggered control without the intermittent mechanism through the same analytical approach. The Zeno behaviour is also excluded. Simulations are given to verify the availability and applicability of the designed protocol. Experiments demonstrate that the combined event-triggered mechanism can reduce the number of event triggers.},

Three optimisation objectives are fuzzified, and the priority is modelled by the relaxed order of satisfactory degrees. With the synchronous communication, the collision avoidance constraints and compatibility constraints under communication delay are designed. Moreover, the obstacle avoidance constraints with high buildings are addressed. Based on the distributed receding horizon control (RHC), the fuzzy multi-objective synchronous cooperative tracking model is built, and the optimal path of UAVs can be obtained by regulating the parameter.

This paper investigates secure model predictive control (MPC) for constrained CPSs subject to actuator attacks, which intentionally manipulate control commands from a controller to actuators. In our study, the theory of invariant set is used to construct a Luenberger observer for error-bounded state estimation in the presence of actuator attacks. Then, a robust output feedback MPC controller is designed for constrained and attacked systems based on a set-membership state estimator.

The mismatched external disturbances make it impossible to transform the original model into the multiple-step-ahead predictor model by using the existing predictor technology. To tackle such a challenge, a novel backstepping-based disturbance compensation control framework is firstly proposed for the discrete-time SPMSM with known system dynamics. In the proposed framework, the disturbance observer is designed to compensate for the external disturbances, and the novel variable substitution/decoupling technology is proposed to design the event-based controller for the original controlled system. The proposed controller is composed of the event-based feedback control signal and the feedforward disturbance compensation signal, thereby improving the system disturbance rejection ability and mitigating the communication resource. Subsequently, an event-based adaptive neural control scheme is proposed by combining a modified neural disturbance observer. The proposed scheme ensures that the tracking error converges to a small neighbourhood of the origin, all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and meanwhile the communication resources are greatly reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated through the simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective method to design a robust controller for unknown nonlinear systems. Uncertainty in the worst case requires a large state-action space. Hence, it is natural to use continuous-time RL methods rather than the discretisation of the spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel continuous-time RL using neural network approximation. Our method uses worst-case uncertainty to train the continuous-time RL algorithm. The backward Euler approximation is used to approximate the time derivative of the value function. Compared with the actor–critic (AC) algorithm, our method finds the robust control policy in the presence of worst-case uncertainty by taking into account the applied actions. It is shown that the AC algorithm finds the robust controller in less episodes, but its robustness is less than the results presented by our approach. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is analysed using the contraction property and differential equation techniques. The experiments show that our approach is more robust than the model-based LQR method and the well-known AC method.},

  abstract     = {A course tracking control law is designed based on the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) technique for ships with unknown dynamic parameters and unknown time-varying disturbance under input saturation, which consists of feed-forward compensation and an error feedback proportional-derivative (PD) control law. The compound uncertainties, due to the unknown dynamic parameters, unknown time-varying disturbance, and input saturation, are viewed as a total disturbance, which is estimated through an extended state observer (ESO) and effectively compensated in the feed-forward path. Subsequently, an extremum seeking algorithm without steady-state oscillation (ESA-SSO) is introduced to tune the design parameters of the ADRC-based ship course tracking control law so as to obtain the better performance of ship course tracking control. The strict stability analysis shows that the resulting closed-loop course tracking control system of ships is uniformly stable. Finally, simulation results and comparisons on a frigate are presented to illuminate the effectiveness and the superiority of the designed control law.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian process (GP) regression is widely used to find the extreme of a black-box function by iteratively approximating an objective function when new evaluation obtained. Such evaluation is usually made by optimising a given acquisition function. However, for non-parametric Bayesian optimisation, the extreme of the objective function is not a deterministic value, but a random variant with distribution. We call such distribution the maximum distribution which is generally non-analytical. To construct such maximum distribution, traditional GP regression method by optimising an acquisition function is computational cost as the GP model has a cubic computation of training data. Moreover, the introduction of acquisition function brings extra hyperparameters which made the optimisation more complicated. Recently, inspired by the idea of Sequential Monte Carlo method and its application in Bayesian optimisation, a Monte Carlo alike method is proposed to approximate the maximum distribution with weighted samples. Alternative to the method on GP model, we construct the maximum distribution within the framework of Student- t process (TP) which considers more uncertainties from the training data. Toy examples and real data experiment show the TP-based Monte Carlo maximum distribution has a competitive performance to the GP-based method.},

By introducing a linear state transformation, the original system is transformed into a new system for which output feedback control design becomes feasible. Without the precise information on output function, an input-driven high-gain state observer is presented to estimate the unavailable states of the new system. Moreover, some radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are employed to approximate the lumped unknown nonlinear functions during the procedure of control design. Then, by combining the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, the Nussbaum gain function approach and the backstepping technique, a novel adaptive output feedback control scheme including only one parameter to be updated is developed for such systems. As a result, all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) while the tracking error can remain in a small neighbourhood of zero. Finally, two simulation examples are given to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design method.},

  abstract     = {The structural complexity of the bipedal locomotion may be reduced by using mechanisms with fewer actuators, which ideally do not degrade the performance and functionality of the robot. However, when the mechanism design considers conflicting design objectives, the search for design solutions with specific trade-offs becomes hard. This work studies different multi-objective search approaches the dominance-based, the decomposition-based and the metric-driven in the dimensional synthesis of the eight-bar mechanism for the bipedal locomotion application in the sagittal plane stated as a mixed discrete-continuous nonlinear multi-objective optimisation problem. This work also proposes a dominance-based multi-objective differential evolution algorithm called Multi-Objective Specialist Population-based Differential Evolution (MOSPDE), which endows specialised subpopulations to exploit different regions of the Pareto front to favour the search for design trade-offs with a suitable generation of the gait and force transmission during the stance phase. The comparative study includes algorithms reported in the specialised literature based on dominance (MOPSO, MODE variants and NSGA-II), decomposition (MOEA/D-DE) and metric-driven (SMS-EMOA). The statistical analysis reveals that using the Pareto dominance search approach based on differential evolution and the inclusion of exhaustive exploitation can promote the reconfigurability of the bipedal locomotion mechanism with better trade-offs that satisfy the conflicting design objectives.},

A new mixed polytopic and norm-bounded uncertainties representation for linear time-invariant uncertain systems allows to express different uncertainty models in one single LMI by using the S-procedure.

The prescribed performance strategy is effectively applied to the relative range and angle between each successive pair in the group to preserve their connectivity without any possible collision by defining some preassigned performance characteristics on the transient and steady-state responses. A high-gain observer, an adaptive robust controller and a three-layer neural network are heuristically utilised to develop an efficient robust output-feedback platoon controller as well.

  abstract     = {The design of a state feedback and robust controller for regulating the tridimensional (3D) movement of autonomous underwater mobile crafts (AUMCs). The controller design is based on the application of Averaged Sub-Gradient Integral Sliding Mode Realisation (ASGISMR). The application of the ASGISMR yields the solution of the closed-loop extreme seeking control for a non-strictly convex functional depending on the tracking error between reference and 3D position of the AUMC. The design of reference trajectories was proposed to enforce the AUMC to follow a continued submersion and ellipsoidal detouring. The mechanical dynamical form of AUMC is well posed for applying the extended version of ASGISMR, considering that integral term represents an ASG associated to the euclidean norm of the tracking error. The time evolution of the functional over the controlled trajectories of the AUMC is compared with the corresponding functional enforced by a traditional state feedback controller with gravity effect compensation. The proposed controller exhibits better tracking and similar control magnitude than the considered reference state feedback realisation. These outcomes justify the potential contributions of the suggested ASGISMR to obtain the local minimisation of the evaluated functional, considering such controller as an extreme seeking realisation for the proposed AUMC.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the important issue is proposed, that is, the robust control of a class of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the complex environment where unknown disturbances, unknown bounded delays and stochastic malicious attacks coexist. A Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) containing certain double and triple integral terms is constructed to exploit merits of the presented generalised single and double integral inequalities which are tighter than some existing single and double inequalities, leading to the stability analysis result with less conservatism. Furthermore, by using stochastic analysis technique, the stability analysis and H ∞ output feedback controller design are transformed into the convex optimisation problems solved by the linear matrix inequality (LMI) strategy. Finally, the actual load frequency control (LFC) power system and the classical numerical examples are provided to show the rationality for modelling and the advancement of the developed method.},

Taking into account that the hysteresis behaviour is asymmetric rate-dependent, a Hammerstein model is established to represent the DEAP actuator. Then, based on a novel 2-ADFTSM function and a terminal-sliding-mode-type switching control law, a 2-ADFTSMC scheme is proposed to improve the trajectory tracking performance. Furthermore, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved. Compared with discrete-time sliding mode control (DSMC) and discrete-time fast terminal sliding mode control (DFTSMC) schemes, the proposed control scheme can provide higher tracking accuracy, faster convergence speed, and stronger robustness in presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed control scheme are validated through the experiments on the DEAP actuator.},

  abstract     = {An advantage of a high-order fully-actuated (HOFA) system is that there exists a controller such that a constant linear closed-loop system with an arbitrarily assignable eigenstructure can be obtained. In this paper, a generalised form of the conventional first-order strict-feedback systems (SFSs) is firstly proposed, and a recursive solution is proposed to convert equivalently the generalised SFS into a HOFA model. Then the second- and high-order SFSs are defined and their equivalent HOFA models are also derived. It is further shown that, under certain common conditions, the recursive solutions for converting the generalised SFSs into HOFA models can be rearranged into direct analytical explicit solutions. Such a high-order system approach is more direct and simpler than the first-order system approach since it avoids the process of converting firstly these second- and high-order SFSs into first-order ones for control, and can finally produce a constant linear closed-loop system. Particularly, it is more effective than the well-known method of backstepping since, for the generalised complicated SFSs with more subsystems, the method of backstepping may simply be not applicable due to more serious ‘differential explosion’ problem. Two examples are worked out to demonstrate the effect of the approach.},

Although a state-space representation is more suitable for deriving the state-response solution and observation (estimation), it does not provide as much convenience as desired for the control problem. In this paper, the concept of high-order fully actuated (HOFA) systems is firstly revisited, and it is pointed out that HOFA systems serve really as models for control systems rather than representing a small portion of physical control systems. Based on the HOFA model, a basic procedure is proposed for control of nonlinear systems satisfying certain conditions, whose first step converts the nonlinear systems into a pseudo strict-feedback system, and the second step establishes the HOFA model of the system. Once an HOFA model is derived, a controller can be immediately designed to make the closed-loop system a constant linear one with a desired eigenstructure. All the design degrees of freedom existing in the closed-loop system are also provided, which can be further utilised to achieve additional system performance. An example demonstrates the design procedure and shows the effect of the proposed HOFA approach.},

However, there is a common contradiction between the computational efficiency and the accuracy. In order to improve the efficiency of state estimation in the continuous–discrete filtering method, continuous–discrete extended cubature Kalman filtering based on Adams–Bashforth–Moulton (ABM) numerical approximation is proposed. ABM is the linear multi-step numerical method, which can achieve the fourth-order accuracy for solving the differential state equation, and its ‘predictor–corrector’ mathematic structure is relatively simple. The performances of ABM method are theoretically analysed; the mixed-type filtering method for continuous–discrete nonlinear states estimation is proposed to integrate the best features of extended Kalman filtering and cubature Kalman filtering. More precisely, the time updates are deduced by extended Kalman filtering whereas the measurement updates are conducted by the third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule. The superior performances of proposed method are illustrated in the simulations under the conditions of different step-sizes and sampling periods.},

By considering event-triggered transmission and interval communication delays, the network-based tracking control system attaining vehicle turning is modelled as an interval input delay system, where the input delay is bounded by the bounds of communication delays and the sampling period. Second, a new delay-dependent bounded real lemma with less conservatism is derived by proposing a matrix-based binary quadratic convex method, constructing a discontinuous augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional tailored based on second-order Bessel–Legendre inequality, and exploiting the relation among the upper bounds of input delay and interval communication delays, and the sampling period.

  abstract     = {This paper concentrates on the suboptimal state estimation problem for systems without acknowledgement (ACK). The ACK signal is used for informing the estimator of whether control-input packets have been lost during the transmission or not. For such systems, which are usually regarded as NACK systems, the optimal estimator has been proved to be beset by exponentially increasing computational burden so that it is scarcely possible to be implemented in practice and then the suboptimal estimation becomes a necessary need. Inspired by the idea of multiple-model approaches, we first design an efficient suboptimal estimator for NACK systems to significantly improve computational efficiency. More importantly, we obtained a sufficient and necessary condition to characterise the stability of this proposed suboptimal estimator, which depends only on the packet loss rate (PLR) of the observation regardless of the control-input PLR. We also prove that its estimation error will converge to that of the optimal estimator under a certain condition. A distinguishing feature of the suboptimal estimator proposed in this paper is that not only its stability and convergence can be determined theoretically, but also they are proved to be the same as those of the optimal one for NACK systems.},

Secondly, by using M -matrix theory, the bipartite consensus conditions for the singular nonlinear multi-agent system are established when the topology digraph is structurally balanced. Thirdly, the global asymptotic stability conditions are presented when the signed network is structurally unbalanced. Both the controllers are designed by using pinning control strategies.

This method is based on comparing the characteristic equation of the system which consists of the differential forward PID controller adding a lead-lag filter and the integrating time-delay process with the desired characteristic equation. The desired characteristic equation is obtained by placing a plurality of poles at the same desired position. Parameters of the differential forward PID are tuned to achieve the desired robustness. Tuning rules are given in terms of plant parameters for various kinds of integrating systems. Compared with the conventional PID controller, the proposed method is more effective for frequently changed set-points.

Based on the lifted vector technique, the paper reforms the discrete-time singular system as a kind of algebraic input-output transmission. For the conventional P-type ILC scheme, the asymptotical convergence in terms of the tracking-error vector is achieved and the monotonic convergence in the sense of 2-norm of the tracking-error vector is derived. Further, in order to improve the learning performance, a gain-adaptive iterative learning control (GAILC) strategy is developed, which argues the iteration-time-variable gain vector while minimising the increment of quadratic tracking-error vectors of two adjacent iterations. The existence of the optimal gain vector is explored through the optimisation criterion and the algebraic approach of the columns/ rows exchanging transformation of matrix. Then the non-conditionally strictly monotonic convergence of the GAILC is made by studying the eigenvalues of the quadratic function. Finally, the validity and the effectiveness of the P-type ILC are numerically demonstrated and the remarkable outcomes of the GAILC are illustrated.},

Moreover, compared with existing works on multi-agent systems with switching topologies and time delays, the delays in the paper are dependent on the switching modes. By designing the distributed mode-dependent consensus protocol and constructing Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions in terms of LMIs are derived to ensure that H ∞ leader-following consensus is asymptotically achieved in the mean square.

The immeasurable states are estimated by constructing a fuzzy state observer, and the uncertain nonlinear functions are approximated by fuzzy logic systems. In order to settle the issue of ‘explosion of complexity’ inherent in the conventional backstepping design process, the ‘dynamic surface control’ (DSC) method is introduced. An observer-based fuzzy adaptive control algorithm is proposed by employing the adaptive backstepping control design technique and constructing the Logarithm Lyapunov functions. The designed fuzzy adaptive control scheme can settle the complexity problem of control scheme and insure that the closed-loop system is semi-globally uniformly ultimately boundedness (SGUUB), a simulation example is considered to illustrate the availability of the designed controller.},

Under a set-based framework, the effects of uncertainties and faults are separated into two state zonotopes. Based on this decomposition, the FD observer gain is designed to be robust against uncertainties and meanwhile sensitive to faults based on a H − index in a finite-frequency domain. Then, two linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions are obtained to design an observer that achieves robustness and fault sensitivity at the same time. The generalised KYP lemma is applied to address the fault sensitivity condition. The optimal FD observer gain can be obtained via an offline design procedure. Finally, the proposed fault detection method is applied to a chemical mixing system and the effectiveness is shown.},

  abstract     = {In leader-follower Stackelberg games, the leader determines and announces its strategy first by anticipating the follower’s reaction function, and the follower determines its strategy as a best response to the leader’s strategy. Thus, there is a perceived advantage in assuming the role of leader in a Stackelberg game. When the roles of the players are not determined a priori, both players must mutually agree on the selection of the leader. Such an agreement is possible only if the players realise that they are both better off with the agreed selection of leader as compared to when the other player is selected as leader. In games with parameter uncertainty, the availability of this option depends on the parameter space over which the game is defined. In this paper, we describe the partitioning of the parameter space to characterise when a Stackelberg solution based on an agreed leader selection exists and when it does not. The resulting partition can then be used to determine the probability of occurrence of all possible games where agreement can and cannot be reached. We illustrate the results using two examples.},

  abstract     = {The paper investigates the distributed convex optimisation problem of multi-agent systems over strongly connected and balanced digraph with time delay. To reduce the traffic among agents and the control inputs&#39; update frequency, a sample-based distributed event-triggered zero-gradient-sum optimisation algorithm has been proposed. A sufficient stability condition with respect to the related parameters and time delay is derived via the Lyapunov function approach. Moreover, it is proved that the states of agents asymptotically converge to the global optimal point. Since the sampling control is adopted, Zeno behaviour can be naturally excluded. The results of the numerical simulation illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of Static Output Feedback (SOF) stabilisation for continuous-time linear systems subject to norm-bounded parameter uncertainties using the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach. Usually, this issue leads to the feasibility of a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI), which is difficult to linearise to get non-conservative LMI conditions. We present first, in this paper, some background results on the SOF controller design and that are found to be extended to the case of norm-bounded uncertainties. We show that some restrictions on the feasibility of these results should be guaranteed. Moreover, by means of some technical Lemmas, we transform the BMI into a new LMI with a line search over a scalar variable. An enhanced and less conservative LMI condition with a line search over two scalar variables is also developed. Furthermore, a simplified version of each LMI condition without a priori fixed parameters is also presented. An extensive portfolio of numerical examples is presented in order to evaluate the conservativeness and to show the superiority of the proposed design method to the background results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the robust stability of nonlinear systems with multiple uncertainties is considered by using a composite operator-based coprime factorisation method. Firstly, as for the exogenous external disturbance, the disturbance model is considered and the disturbance output is guaranteed to be bounded. Meantime, the adverse effect resulting from it is transformed to an equivalent effect on the stable part of the systems. By using operator-based coprime factorisation method, a feasible framework on multiple uncertainties is obtained. Then, the obtained equivalent effects resulting from the modelled disturbance and adverse effect from the internal perturbation are unified and addressed. Thirdly, sufficient conditions on guaranteeing robust stability of the considered nonlinear systems are considered by using robust coprime factorisation method, for relaxing computation burden on Bezout identity and avoiding requirement on knowing the perturbation signal. Based on the proposed conditions, two controllers are designed and the robust stability of the considered systems is proved. Finally, simulation results are shown to explain the proposed design scheme and confirm its effectiveness of this paper.},
