  abstract     = {This paper deals with the control performance assessment of distributed networked control systems in the presence of communication delays. The best achievable steady-state performance of distributed networked control systems in the framework of distributed linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control is presented where communication delays serve as the most fundamental performance limitation. In the proposed distributed LQG control design, distributed controllers and distributed observers are designed simultaneously without using separation principle. And the non-applicability of separation principle is investigated and demonstrated in distributed networked control with communication delays. In order to handle time-varying communication delays, we propose to use lower and upper bounds to characterize the range of the best achievable control performance with respect to the range of the communication delays. The obtained results can be used to evaluate the potential performance improvement of an existing distributed networked control system. The proposed approach is illustrated through a numerical example.},

For this purpose, blend vectors are introduced and calculated such that the minimum sensitivity of the controlled mode is maximised, while the worst case gain of the other subsystems is minimised from the blended input to the blended output. The problem is transformed to a standard optimisation program subject to Linear Matrix Inequality constraints. An arising rank constraint is resolved by an alternating projection scheme. The method is presented based on the decoupling of a single mode, but the extension to decouple multiple modes is also discussed. Numerical examples are given to validate the method and to illustrate how the proposed approach can be applied for control engineering problems.},

In the proposed control scheme, the nonlinear uncertainties are compensated for within the bandwidth of low-pass filters, while the trade-off between tracking and constraints violation avoidance is formulated as a numerical constrained optimisation problem which is solved periodically. Priority is given to constraints violation avoidance at the cost of deteriorated tracking performance. System transformations are performed to find the sufficient conditions that can guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system with the sampled-data controller, where both the states and control inputs are held constant over the sampling period.},

The structure of the proposed observer consists of two main parts. The first one, called the event-triggered mechanism (ETM), is placed by the system and is used to determine when the measured output of the system must be sent through the network. The ETM consists of a traditional Luenberger observer, an event-triggered local observer, and an event-detector. The second part is a copy of the event-triggered local observer which is used to estimate the system state using the transmitted data from the sensors. Under the observability assumption, it is proved that the error between the system state and its estimation is asymptotically limited to a predetermined bound. Moreover, it is guaranteed that the Zeno behaviour is avoided. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the design procedure of the proposed event-triggered observer.},

The presented approach requires less computations than the approaches in the literature and clarifies the relationship between the McMillan degree, the poles, and the transmission zeros of a MIMO system. We assume that the roots of the least common multiple of the denominators of the entries of G satisfy a multiplicity condition, which can be verified prior to the application of the algorithm.

It transforms the transcendental exponential delay term of the plant into finite number of discrete-time poles by a suitable choice of the sampling time. The PID controller has been discretised using Tustin’s method and the controller gains are obtained using the dominant pole placement criterion where the plant is discretized using the pole-zero matching method. Random search and optimisation have been used to obtain the stability region in the desired closed loop parameters space by minimising the integral squared error (ISE) criterion by randomly sampling from the stabilizable region. Then these closed loop parameters are mapped on to the PID controller gains. Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is shown for nine test-bench plants with different lag to delay ratios, open loop damping, and sampling times.},

  abstract     = {Controllability analysis of switched linear system model of DC–DC flyback converter working in the continuous conduction mode, based on controllability transition, has been performed for the first time. Controllability transition is evaluated subject to the change in load resistance and input voltage. Flyback converter is observed to become uncontrollable at higher load resistances for the different circuit parameters (input voltage, inductor, capacitor, and parasitics). Reciprocal condition number of switching controllability gramian is computed for different load resistance and input voltage. The length of control trajectory from initial to final state increases with decrease in reciprocal condition number. Reciprocal condition number becomes less than controllability transition with increase in resistances, hence ill-conditioned switching controllability gramian ensues uncontrollability even though the system is proved to be controllable by linear subspaces method. Thus, the controllability transition method is proved to be more accurate for controllability analysis of DC–DC converter.},

Two numerical algorithms are proposed to approximate the continuous-time and discrete-time portions of the hybrid Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Galerkin’s spectral method is utilised to approximate the value function involved in the continuous-time HJB equation, thereby computing the optimal control gains between impulsive events. Employing the spectral collocation method, the discrete-time HJB equation is then approximated to find the optimal control gain vector at impulsive instants. These two algorithms are ultimately combined to obtain the desired hybrid nonlinear optimal control law. Describing practical considerations for implementing the algorithms, some illustrative examples are presented to evaluate the functionality of the proposed hybrid nonlinear optimal controller.},

One method is to compare the periodic state-model-input trajectories with the same period and the other is to construct the distinguishing matrix, which can describe all initial states and their corresponding outputs driven by different model-input sequences. By virtue of them, several conditions to determine four types of reconstructibility are obtained.

Based on the combination of sliding mode control and backstepping control strategy, we design a new controller, which has strong robustness and accuracy. In term of the dynamic uncertainty in the process of trajectory tracking and considering the estimated information, the controller can guarantee the desire trajectory and the error to be zero.

Regarding to the redundancy of this mechanism, a complex trajectory is considered for this redundant mechanism which is impossible for non-redundant parallel mechanisms to navigate. First, the inverse kinematics of mechanism is solved and Jacobian matrices are obtained considering the rotational DOF for pods around axial direction. Next, using energy principles and Lagrange method the exact equation of motion is formed. Finally, to verify the results obtained by simulation, an experiment on 2-(6UPS) mechanism is carried out to validate the results.

  abstract     = {To mitigate the online computational load of model predictive control, move blocking, which parameterises either the input sequence or offset from the base sequence by fixing the decision variables over arbitrary time intervals, is commonly used. However, existing move blocking schemes use a fixed base sequence only and do not fully exploit the valuable properties from various base sequences. Thus, we propose the interpolated solution-based move blocking strategy which parameterises the offset from the convex combination of two complementary base sequences – infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator solution and shifted previous solution – and optimises the interpolation parameter as an additional decision variable in the optimal control problem. This allows the controller to exploit the valuable properties from both solutions by choosing the optimal interpolation parameter and blocked offset according to the current state online. The proposed approach efficiently improves the optimality performance whileguaranteeing the recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability.},

  abstract     = {Controllers are tuned either analytically or through optimisation techniques for integer, fractional and fractional complex order plants with dead time by considering only the positive frequency information of the plant. This is applicable only for integer / fractional order plants containing real coefficients which have an even symmetrical magnitude and odd symmetrical phase behaviour in frequency responses. The frequency response for (i) integer / fractional order plants containing complex coefficients and (ii) fractional complex order plants containing real / complex coefficients have unsymmetrical magnitude and phase behaviour. Tuning of controllers for such plants by considering only its positive frequency response produces reduced stability margins and in turn deteriorates its time response. Hence, tuning of controllers for such plants requires both positive and negative frequency information which in turn demands complex coefficient controllers. To address the problem, complex coefficient PI/PD/PID controllers are proposed in this paper. Unified expressions are derived for complex coefficient PI/PD/PID controllers by considering both positive and negative frequency information of plant with complex coefficients and complex order derivatives plus dead time. Numerical simulations are performed for three different case studies with the proposed complex coefficient integer order controllers and results are compared with real coefficient PI/PD/PID controllers under various operating conditions.},

Firstly, a criterion on practical stability in probability (PS-P) of discrete-time stochastic systems is given. Secondly, based on internal model principle (IMP) and pole assignment algorithm, a dynamic controller is designed such that practical tracking in mean square (PTMS) sense and disturbance rejection are realised, while maintaining the PS-P of DTSLSs. In the end, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified by the application to the mass-spring-damper system, and the efficiency is illustrated by the simulation results.},

Event-triggered scheme transmits signals only when the event-triggering condition is violated. Due to its advantage in saving communication resources, it is utilised to design the state feedback controllers for piecewise-affine systems. With the utilisation of a piecewise Lyapunov function combined with the S-procedure and some matrix inequality convexifying techniques, sufficient conditions for novel event-triggered H ∞ controllers are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The resulting closed-loop system stability is ensured with a guaranteed H ∞ disturbance attenuation level while the number of transmitted signals is reduced.

The proposed approach involves the application of generalised active disturbance rejection control (GADRC) technique, that uses substantial plant information to handle the problem caused by the consideration of communication delay in a power system. To authenticate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, it is applied on four different single area and multi-area power system models for load frequency control. The effect of parametric uncertainty and nonlinearities is also considered to validate efficacy of proposed scheme. An extensive comparative analysis is undertaken with existing controller design techniques to demonstrate superiority of proposed technique.

It is shown that in case of commensurate delays, the control law can be directly expressed as a function of the original system matrices, widening the applicability of analysis and design tools. For the synthesis of the feedback gains, a numerical procedure is presented to solve the simultaneous stabilization problem of the target system and the associated integral delay system.

This paper proposes a fault detection and isolation-based actuator fault tolerant control for SbW system based on model predictive control. The fault detection and isolation module uses a two-stage Kalman filtering algorithm to provide simultaneous control parameter and state estimation to detect the occurrence of actuator failure. Additionally, a model predictive controller is designed to maintain the original functionality of the SbW systems using the output of fault detection and isolation to update the fault information. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by numerical simulations and experiments on our SbW platform. The simulation and experimental results illustrate that our approach achieves a better steering performance than a conventional model predictive controller without fault detection and isolation and stabilise the overall SbW system in occurrence of actuator failure.},

Sufficient conditions on the controller potential energy and energy dissipation-like functions are provided in order to obtain, in a straightforward manner, strict LFs ensuring global FT stability at the desired equilibrium. As an important practical outcome, we illustrate the proposed methodology by constructing strict LFs for some particular FT controllers. The construction of such strict LFs allows us to solve the open problem of FT trajectory tracking of robot manipulators with continuous control laws to track any bounded trajectory.},

In the present paper, such a property is investigated for the class of passive and strictly passive systems, which have several invariant compact and globally attracting subsets in the unforced scenario. It is assumed that the storage and supply rate functions are sign-definite with respect to these sets. The results are obtained within the framework of input-to-state stability and integral input-to-state stability for multistable systems. The robustness conditions are obtained for open-loop and for closed-loop cases, i.e. when an output feedback is required to guarantee robustness.

Second, we study a corresponding N-person worst-case nonzero-sum differential game and derive state-feedback Nash equilibrium solution of robustness property as resilient control strategy for each agent.

Due to the sampling process, an approximate implementation of such an observer, designed for a continuous-time system, may not retain the desired performance in the sampled-data context. In this paper, we present an observer which takes advantage of the quasi-sliding motion concept to simultaneously estimate the state variables and the unknown input signals in a sampled-data context.

The model is assumed to be nonlinear and uncertain. The robust observer estimates the states of the uncertain T1DM model. Once the states are estimated, an adaptive control technique based on Lyapunov&#39;s second method is proposed to achieve the desired closed-loop performance for an uncertain system. The results presented here depict that the design philosophy can avoid severe hypoglycaemia (glucose concentration level below 50 mg/dl), bringing down the glucose concentration to a safe level within a specified time of 120 min. Restoring and maintaining the plasma glucose concentration in T1DM patients in the euglycaemic range (70–180 mg/dl) by appropriate insulin infusion under meal disturbances and parametric variations of ± 20\% are effectively handled with the proposed controller. The realistic situation for the patient model like consideration of (i) only one measurable state, and (ii) uncertain as well as time-varying model parameters addressing inter- and intra-patient variability, respectively, are taken into account. The complexity of the T1DM model leads to a new integrated design methodology, combining robustness and adaptive philosophy for the first time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a class of discrete-time inhomogeneous bilinear systems whose controllability cannot be checked by the classical results is considered. By using an algebraic technique, it is shown that the systems are never controllable. Near-controllability of the systems is thus studied and, by defining a novel transition operator, an algebraic necessary and sufficient criterion is established, where the control inputs to achieve state transition can also be computed. Furthermore, the established near-controllability result is applied to study nearly controllable subspaces of the discrete-time homogeneous bilinear systems. Although such systems were investigated in the previous work, a new and larger class of nearly controllable subspaces of the homogeneous systems is derived, which cannot be found by the previous work due to different algebraic structures. Finally, an algorithm for solving the control inputs to achieve state transition as well as examples are given to demonstrate the results of this paper.},

A disturbance compensation-based fault estimation observer is designed to estimate the system actuator faults. By setting the reference outputs, a method of obtaining equilibrium control inputs and equilibrium states is formulated to achieve the variation dynamic model at equilibrium points by Taylor expansion. Then, based on the estimated actuator faults, an effective fault tolerant control strategy is proposed by the methods of interval matrix and disturbance local compensation. Sufficient conditions of asymptotic stability of the estimation error system and the closed-loop system are derived based on the Lyapunov theory. Fault estimation observer and fault tolerant controller gain matrices are obtained by solving the linear matrix inequalities. Finally, simulations and analysis are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Because the optimal estimation of WCNSs with packet loss in both control and observation channels via UDP cannot be applied in practice due to the exponential increase of the computation, and in order to reduce the energy consumption of wireless communication nodes, an efficient recursive filter is developed for the event-based WNCSs with UDP. The state estimation and the filtering error covariance are derived from the interacting multiple model (IMM) methods, and the filter gain is determined by minimising an upper bound of the filtering error covariance. It is proved that the stability of the minimum upper bound of the filtering error covariance is only related to the actual arrival rate of the observation packet, and the minimum upper bound converges to the error covariance of the optimal estimation of the corresponding system with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) if both the trigger threshold and the control input tend to zero. Numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the theoretical results.},

In this work, the hyperbolic tangent function is introduced to solve the problem of control input saturation, and construct an auxiliary equation to reduce the saturation effect. Furthermore, the method introduces prescribed performance function, and converts the original constrained system into an equivalent unconstrained system through error transformation. Subsequently, dynamic surface technology is introduced to reduce the complexity of the control algorithm. At the same time, the nonlinear extended state observer is designed to estimate the generalised disturbance of the aircraft system. Finally, the Lyapunov function is selected to prove that all signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Taking DJI M100 aircraft as the simulation object, the results show that the designed controller can effectively solve the problem of control input constraints and enable the system to reach the prescribed transient and steady-state tracking performance indexes.},

A closed-form solution for the randomised controller is obtained for stochastic systems that can be described by arbitrary probability density functions. Furthermore, the analytic solution for a class of linear Gaussian stochastic systems is obtained. For this class of systems, the optimal randomised controller is shown to be a state feedback controller which is modified by an extra linear term that is related to the lagged and future control inputs. The developed method is demonstrated on a simulation example, and the results are compared with the standard fully probabilistic design control method.},

In that aspect, PressorSim is expected to be a useful decision support tool for assessment and evaluation of open-loop and closed-loop drug administration strategies at various physiological response scenarios and to assist treatment.

Firstly, by introducing a novel state transformation consisting of a time-varying gain and a scaling of the state by a function of time that grows unbounded towards the terminal time, the involved system is transformed into a new one easily designing a feedback controller. Then based on the Lyapunov theorem and choosing the time-varying gain, both state feedback and output feedback controllers are constructed respectively to globally stabilise the new system in the scaled state representation, yielding the global feedback stabilisation in any prescribed finite time of the involved system.

High-order neural networks (HONNs) are employed to approximate the lumped unknown nonlinear functions, and only one adaptive parameter is required to be updated. Stability analysis shows that the proposed scheme guarantees all the closed-loop error signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in the 4th-moment or mean square, and the system output can converge to an arbitrary small neighbourhood of the given trajectory.

Based on the Volterra series analysis, the system response can be decomposed into three parts. The first two parts are the zero input response and zero initial condition response of the system. The third part describes the response which couples the effect of the nonzero initial condition and the nonzero input. The system corresponding to the third part is a bilinear control system with a special time-varying input coefficient matrix. We show that such a system is equivalent to a time-invariant bilinear control system, and conventional model reduction methods can be applied to reduce it. We propose to reduce each of the component responses independently and then combine them to approximate the full system response. This method is of high flexibility and shows promising results.},

It is, therefore, a first step towards the development of camless engines in which valve lift and timing can be freely adjusted valve-by-valve and cycle-by-cycle . Particular attention is paid to parameter identification aimed at obtaining a predictive simulation model of valve lift trajectories and valve parameters (e.g. lift , duration , area ) for a wide range of system inputs. An energy loss assessment of a valvetrain based on EHVAs is described, and the results are compared with those obtained with a traditional cam-based valvetrain. The validated model is then used to build detailed numerical maps of valve parameters that are fundamental for setting up cycle-by-cycle controllers of valve parameters. Hence, the authors present the design of a cycle-by-cycle controller of maximum valve lift, the performance of which is tuned by simulations and then verified experimentally.},

  abstract     = {We provide estimates for the asymptotic gains of the displacement of a vibrating string with endpoint forcing, modelled by the wave equation with Kelvin–Voigt and viscous damping and a boundary disturbance. Two asymptotic gains are studied: the gain in the L 2 L 2 L2 spatial norm and the gain in the spatial sup norm. It is shown that the asymptotic gain property holds in the L 2 L 2 L2 norm of the displacement without any assumption for the damping coefficients. The derivation of the upper bounds for the asymptotic gains is performed by either employing an eigenfunction expansion methodology or by means of a small-gain argument, whereas a novel frequency analysis methodology is employed for the derivation of the lower bounds for the asymptotic gains. The graphical illustration of the upper and lower bounds for the gains shows that the asymptotic gain in the L 2 norm is estimated much more accurately than the asymptotic gain in the sup norm.},

Moreover, the upper bound of the settling time is given, the influence of the algebraic connectivity of the network topologies on the convergence time is also investigated. Finally, several simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

An active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) framework is proposed here with a key component being a novel resonant extended state observer (RESO). In contrary to the conventional ADRC-based solutions, the introduced one gives the ability to directly estimate and mitigate the influence of harmonic uncertainties. By structuring the whole observer-centred control topology into one degree-of-freedom, compact, feedback error-form (similar to industry-proven PID), the proposed approach can be straightforwardly implemented and commissioned across popular industrial control platforms. Its effectiveness is systematically analysed in terms of tracking accuracy, disturbance rejection and noise sensitivity. The new technique is generalised for the class of nonlinear control-affine systems and expressed with three special forms, each one providing certain advantages to control design. Additionally, an experimental case study is conducted, showing superior performance of the proposed solution against a conventional one. Finally, the stability of the developed approach is rigorously proved using singular perturbation theory.},

In general, this linear control technique has reported enlarging the stabilising sampling period region of a sampled-data system. However, in previous works no dynamic justification has been given. Here, using a different approach to work previously done, it is shown that in a sampled-data system exposed to large stabilising sampling periods, the control law applied as a ZOH contributes to moving the system faster away from the origin as the next sampling time is approaching. It is shown that this is the dynamic reason behind the effectiveness of the pulsed control law reported in previous works. In addition, our analysis allows us to deduce conditions based on the spectrum of a linear system matrix to justify the phenomena reported previously.},

Recently, the approximate dynamic inversion (ADI)-based algorithms have been widely implemented for nonaffine-in-control nonlinear systems. To employ ADI-based methods, a fast dynamic subsystem has to be established to derive the explicit inversion of the nonaffine equation. However, the previous research on ADI rarely considers that the amplitude of actual input derived from the fast augmented subsystem can be extremely high, which maybe intolerable for practical systems. In this paper, we set up input saturation and view the difference between input with and without saturation as a perturbation. Then, an intermediate subsystem is constructed to compensate the influence of this perturbation by approximating its inversion. The exponential stability of the overall closed-loop system is ensured via singular perturbation theorem. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A transformation from Euler angles to Octonions avoids possible singularities. In addition, a new linear quadratic regulator control that uses the design of variables gains based on low-pass filter and l ∞ norm. Global stability of the State-Dependent Riccati Equation is performed by using Lyapunov analysis with La&#39;Salle&#39;s Principle.

Firstly, a smooth function which is different from the common saturation treatment is presented to deal with the actuator constraints. Secondly, a fast non-singular terminal sliding mode (FNTSM) manifold composed of tracking errors is constructed. To estimate the unknown function in the sliding surface derivative, Chebyshev neural network (CNN) is introduced and thus the strict assumptions on uncertainties in many related works are abolished. By designing the CNN adaptive laws, a new fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed such that the attitude tracking can be achieved within a limited time interval. Compared with the existing CNN-based achievements with finite-time convergence, the approximation errors are proved to be finite-time stable instead of uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the satisfactory tracking performance of the attitude controller.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the output-feedback stabilisation for a class of wave equations. Remarkably, only one boundary measurement corrupted by disturbance is available for feedback, and the boundary condition at the control end is dynamic, rather than static. This renders the control problem more challenging than those in the related literature, largely because certain reconstruction and compensation mechanisms respectively for the state and disturbance are necessary but difficult to integrate with the control design for dynamic boundary condition. For this, a powerful adaptive output-feedback stabilising scheme is proposed. Specifically, a delicate observer is constructed for the state in the space domain, with which a dynamic estimate for the disturbance is incorporated. Then, a desired output-feedback controller is designed by backstepping method, which renders the states of the original system and observer to converge to zero, while the estimate of the unknown disturbance converges to its true value.},

The system parameters depend not only on a Markov chain but also on linear parameter-varying elements that take values in convex polytopic sets. The suboptimal approach represents an attempt towards solving the optimal control problem that remains unsolved in the literature. Illustrating that such a suboptimal approach can be of interest when solving practical control problems. Experimental results on the control of an automotive throttle valve subject to failures driven by a Markov chain are discussed, thus supporting the usefulness of the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {For certain industrial control applications an explicit function capturing the non-trivial trade-off between competing objectives in closed loop performance is not available. In such scenarios it is common practice to use the human innate ability to implicitly learn such a relationship and manually tune the corresponding controller to achieve the desirable closed loop performance. This approach has its deficiencies because of individual variations due to experience levels and preferences in the absence of an explicit calibration metric. Moreover, as the complexity of the underlying system and/or the controller increase, in the effort to achieve better performance, so does the tuning time and the associated tuning cost. To reduce the overall tuning cost, a tuning framework is proposed herein, whereby a supervised machine learning is used to extract the human-learned cost function and an optimisation algorithm that can efficiently deal with a large number of variables, is used for optimising the extracted cost function. Given the interest in the implementation across many industrial domains and the associated high degree of freedom present in the corresponding tuning process, a Model Predictive Controller applied to air path control in a diesel engine is tuned for the purpose of demonstrating the potential of the framework.},

In the literature, a content modification attack is designed to produce trajectory modification on tele-operated systems by modifying data transmitted through a network. Attack is difficult to detect because modification is transparent to classical detection tools. Moreover, uncertainties in this type of system complexify detection. So, an interval finite memory observer is used to estimate this type of system with uncertainties. Robust estimations provided by finite memory observers are combined with a specific strategy to detect modifications to measurements, further to an attack. Moreover, the corrupted data are corrected using an estimator to let the system continue working. A simulation of two haptic bilateral tele-operated systems validates the detection and data integrity correction strategies developed in this work.},

Obtained results show that, in comparison to the sequential quadratic programming method, PSO is less vulnerable to local minima, and, with appropriate parameters, provides superior quality in nonlinear predictive control. The main results concerning PSO application show that the higher number of particles, comparing to the number of iterations, provides improved accuracy with limited computational burden; this way up to 5\% reduction of a proposed quality index is obtained preserving unchanged time of calculations. The performance is also boosted when after several iterations of the algorithm greater emphasis is put on the local search, which is achieved by appropriate learning factors and inertia weight.},

A novel geometric approach is introduced as an alternative to the standard algebraic approach where the pursuit-evader game is reformulated as a discrete-time turn-based dynamic game, in which the corresponding strategies are proved to be a Nash equilibrium. Via a recursive application of the main results, in view of the fact that no limits were placed on the infinitesimalness of the time increment, it is argued that the strategies also constitute a Nash equilibrium in the original continuous time formulation. Finally we simulate the Nash equilibrium strategies to verify its optimality and its robustness against other guidance laws.},

First, we characterise a subset of the state-space, which we refer to as the stabilisation set, from where the system can be stabilised to the origin by means of a constrained, continuous feedback control law based on a given Control Lyapunov Function (CLF). We show how to express the sufficient conditions for Lyapunov stabilisation starting from this set in terms of semialgebraic set containments that can be associated (and numerically verified) with Sum-of-Squares programs. Second, we propose techniques to reshape and / or enlarge the stabilisation set for a given system and initial CLF by searching over a space of CLFs. Our third contribution relates to the solution of the constrained feedback control problem in real-time. At every time instant, we associate the control input with the solution of a state-dependent Quadratic Program (QP), which remains feasible along the entire trajectory of the closed loop system and thus, asymptotic stabilisation is guaranteed provided that the system had started from the stabilisation set, an estimate of which has been computed off-line a priori.},

Multilevel PWM design plays a major role in many diverse engineering disciplines. In power electronics, multilevel PWM design corresponds to determining the inverter switching times and levels for selective harmonic elimination and harmonic compensation. In mechatronics, the same design corresponds to shaping input signals to damp residual vibrations in flexible structures. More generally, in many applications, the aim of PWM design is to minimise the total harmonic distortion while adhering to a prescribed harmonic content. The solution approach presented in this paper is based on linear programming with the objective of minimising the total harmonic distortion. This objective is achieved within an arbitrarily small bound of the optimal solution of the related convex optimisation problem. In addition, the linear programming formulation makes the design of such switching waveforms computationally tractable and efficient. Simulations and experiments are provided for corroboration.},

By integrating compensation and time-varying strategies, an adaptive event-triggered output-feedback controller is established. Particularly, a new event-triggering mechanism is introduced, in which the time-varying threshold (strictly positive and gradually decaying) is key to ensure the validity of the event-triggered controller and achieve the convergence.

Conventional fast terminal sliding mode controller (FTSMC) can get the finite-time convergence of the tracking error, but how to achieve the optimality simultaneously is not an easy task. To address this optimal control problem, a SDRE based optimal controller is developed via a fast terminal sliding surface to design the nonlinear optimal feedback of the FTSMC. To further increase the robustness of the SDRE based method, an extended state observer (ESO) and a robust controller are incorporated into the optimal controller design to deal with the system uncertainties and external disturbances. Consequently, the proposed controller can not only guarantee the finite-time stability of the tracking error, but also achieve the optimal control performance under the system unknown dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The main feature of the contribution is the explicit inclusion of the dynamic of the power converters existing in this kind of networks making possible the evaluation of the system performance under sudden and fast changes in the operating conditions typically found in these applications. The scheme uses only the measurement of local variables and guarantees that both voltages and currents of the network achieve the values required to satisfy a prescribed power balance imposed by the loads. The design of the proposed controller is carried out by exploiting a Port-Controlled Hamiltonian representation of the system and applying the Passivity-based Controller design methodology.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a design framework for an event-triggered active fault-tolerant control system. The considered control system is modelled with an injected actuator fault into the plant system, and it includes: (i) two event detectors to determine when information is to be sampled or updated, (ii) a fault diagnosis observer to provide the fault and state information, and (iii) a fault-tolerant controller to compensate the fault. The proposed design framework allows for the separation of the designs of the fault diagnosis observer and the fault-tolerant controller, to mitigate the coupling effect caused by the event-triggered mechanisms and avoid the computations of a higher order system. Also, a design procedure is presented to deliver the computation of the design variables to reduce the information transfer, in both centralised and decentralised cases. Finally, a batch reactor benchmark system is adopted to demonstrate the applicability and superiority of the proposed design framework.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we model and analyze democratic progress and regression in the framework of discrete event systems. Since democratic progress strongly correlates with the growing number of people who meet their economic interests and political rights, it can be represented as an event-driven dynamical system evolved by local agents that make a decision to enable or disable the progress and regression events according to their private objectives. The final decision on enabling/disabling an event is made by the majority rule, which also complies with the feature of democracy. Based on majority-based supervisory control, we investigate the conditions for the democratic progress model to be progressive or regressive under full observation. Moreover, we present a scheme that can modify the characteristics of the model by designing masks for agents, i.e. the regressive system under full observation is changed to a progressive one under partial observation via masks, and vice versa.},

It is assumed that the control action is affected by input saturation; so to compensate the resulted undesirable effects, the tanh(.) function is used as an approximation to the saturation function. To tackle the unknown external disturbances and uncertainties, a Nussbaum disturbance observer is proposed. Moreover, an appropriate adaptive law is presented to deal with the unknown parameters. Then, the dynamic surface control method is used to overcome the inherent problem ‘explosion of complexity’ that appeared in the conventional back-stepping method. The Lyapunov stability analysis proves that the closed-loop system is semi-globally uniformly bounded. At last, reasonable effectiveness and applicability of the adaptive tracking dynamic surface control are illustrated by simulation results.},

Moreover, in virtue of the method based on supremum and infimum of impulsive interval, quasi sure exponential stabilisation criterion of G-ISCNs is established under discussing the following three cases, respectively: (1) the continuous dynamics is stable; (2) the impulsive dynamics is stable; (3) the impulse is inactive. Then the theoretical results are applied to impulsive coupled oscillators systems driven by G-Brownian motion, and the corresponding criterion is gained, which is substantiated with a numerical example finally.},

The system consists of a wind turbine, a permanent magnet synchronous generator, a rectifier and a load which is connected to the distribution grid dc bus. The scheme combines a classical PI placed, in a nested-loop configuration, with a passivity-based controller. Guaranteeing stability and endowed with disturbance rejection properties, the controller regulates the wind turbine angular velocity to a desired value – in particular, the set-point is selected such that the maximum power from the wind is extracted – maximising the generator efficiency. The fast response of the closed-loop system makes possible to operate under fast-changing wind speed conditions. To assess and validate the controller performance and robustness under parameter variations, realistic simulations comparing our proposal with a classical PI scheme are included.},

Then, it is shown that the upper bound of the stability region, where the state eventually converges, depends on the parameters continuously. Furthermore, the ranges of the parameters, which lead to input-to-state stability, are given analytically. Moreover, the concept of Zeno-like behaviour is introduced, which characterises the phenomenon that the minimum inter-event times for periodic event-triggered control systems become arbitrarily small as the verification intervals of events go to zero. Then, the exclusion of Zeno-like behaviour for the designed event-triggered control systems is achieved.

This paper proposes a distributed control law for two-dimensional multiple agents considered as arbitrarily polygonal shapes under limited communication ranges. The proposed control laws guarantee all flocking properties: each agent stays close to its nearby neighbours, no collision occurs in group of agents and velocity of each agent converges to a common vector. The designed control law based on a new anti-collision condition and potential function approach aims at dealing with the issue of collisions between agents. Further, the control signals are bounded and differentiable despite of agent&#39;s limited communication ranges and non-smooth boundary in agent shapes. Numerical simulations are implemented to demonstrate the performance of proposed control law for multiple agents with the same and different shapes.},

  abstract     = {Distributed model predictive control is a wide-spread control method for systems such as mobile robots or vehicles, which operate in a shared space. Each system computes in an iterative way its control actions by locally solving an optimal control problem with regards to an objective function and subject to constraints arising from the system itself and from shared and possibly quantised information. Within state-of-the-art methods, local problems are solved sequentially and applied in a fixed order, which may not be optimal considering the overall system performance. We introduce dynamic priority rules, which are evaluated locally to establish a dynamic sequence of systems in each time instant. To avoid deadlocks possibly arising from periodic reordering, the idea is complemented by a memory rule. The impact of the proposed methods with and without quantisation is analysed via numerical simulations, revealing shorter convergence times in comparison to the state-of-the art approach.},

  abstract     = {An optimal control problem driven by a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation under continuous state constraints is considered in this study. From an operational point of view, we introduce a discrete state constrained optimal control problem and prove that this problem is a near-optimal control problem of the continuous state constraints problem. Furthermore, we show that the optimal solution of the near-optimal control problem converges to the optimal solution of the continuous state constraints problem as the number of the discrete set approaches to infinity. Finally, we use a linear-quadratic optimal problem to verify the main results of this study.},

  abstract     = {To develop efficient just-in-time personalised treatments, dynamical models are needed that provide a description of how an individual responds to treatment. However, available system identification approaches cannot effectively be applied to most behavioural datasets since, usually, the data collected is subjected to a large amount of noise and time sampling is not uniform. To be able to circumvent these issues, in this paper a new method is proposed for parsimonious system identification of continuous-time systems that does not require specially structured data. The developed algorithm provides an effective way to leverage these ‘non-standard’ datasets to identify continuous time dynamical models that are compatible with a-priori information available on the process. The algorithm developed is tested on data obtained from a behavioural study on adolescents and violence. The objective is to model the temporal dynamics of the association between violence exposure and mental health symptoms (depression and anxiety) in day-to-day life among a sample of adolescents at heightened risk for both substance use exposure and problem behaviour. The information extracted from individual models of behaviour such as the maximum burden and the time of fading away of depression/anxiety does differ substantially from person to person. This information has the potential to be useful to design personalised interventions that would have a better chance of succeeding.},

In some systems, the absolute optimal cost values may be highly dependent on the disturbances. It is desirable to design a controller bounding the relative cost, which is defined as the ratio between the actual cost and the posteriori calculated optimal cost. In this paper, a novel worst-case relative cost optimal control method is developed, assuming that the disturbance sequence belongs to a known finite admissible set. The control policy uses the current states, current accumulated cost, and all current and past disturbance values as feedback. Then the problem is extended to a stochastic case, and the worst-case expected relative cost is minimised. A numerical example on linear systems and a numerical example on the nonlinear hybrid electric vehicle energy management problem are provided.},

Any two agents can communicate only if they are within a fixed distance of each other. Leaders are special agents which generate trajectories autonomously based upon certain objectives. The follower agents must partition into groups such that agents in each group track exactly one leader. Given a particular partition and the resulting information exchange topology, every follower in each group must converge onto their leader&#39;s trajectory in min–max time. A special directed spanning tree is selected in each group. Each follower agent in this tree pursues its tail agent using a time-optimal feedback policy. These local feedback laws achieve global min–max time consensus tracking for any general information graph. Further, a decentralised algorithm is proposed to partition the agents so that consensus tracking for all the groups is accomplished in the shortest possible time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate some finite-time control problems for stochastic linear time-varying systems, described by an Itô type differential equation. In particular, the annular stochastic finite-time stability control problem is dealt with. In this context, it is required that the norm of the state variables remains bounded between an inner and an outer ellipsoid, during a finite-interval of time. The first contribution of the paper consists of two sufficient conditions for stability, which are derived by exploiting an approach based on time-varying quadratic Lyapunov functions. The first condition requires the solution of two generalised differential Lyapunov equations; the latter the existence of a feasible solution to a pair of differential linear matrix inequalities. As particular cases, we obtain sufficient conditions for stochastic finite-time stability (in this last case, the lower ellipsoid collapses to the origin). From the analysis conditions, a sufficient condition is derived for the annular stochastic finite-time stabilisation via both state and output feedback. Some numerical examples illustrate the application of the proposed methodology and show that our approach attains less conservative results than those obtainable with the existing literature. Moreover, an application of the annular stochastic finite-time stability approach to the stabilisation problem of a satellite with respect to the geomagnetic field is presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the Lifeline Differential Game with limited lifetime in a plane which is divided by the lifeline into a play region and a goal region. A single evader aims at entering the goal region from the play region by penetrating the lifeline without being captured, while a single pursuer strives to prevent the evader from that by capturing or delaying it with non-zero capture radius. We introduce the concept of the limited lifetime within which the evader has to achieve its goal. Determining the game winner and finding the strategies for two players are challenging due to non-unique terminal conditions and various initial configurations, which is beyond the scope of the classical Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) approach. An evasion-region based geometric method is proposed to solve this game qualitatively and quantitatively. A new class of Apollonius circles is first introduced and thus a pursuit strategy is proposed for the pursuer to capture the evader at a guaranteed distance of the lifeline. Based on the pursuit strategy, the space of initial states is separated by the so-called barrier into two winning regions which lead to different outcomes of the game. In each winning region, a critical payoff function is designed and the optimal strategy for each player is investigated. The extension to multiplayer cases is also discussed. The presented results are analytical and thus allow for real-time updates.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a beam fixed to a base in a translational motion at one end and to a tip mass at its free end. The beam is subject to some vibrations and it is modelled as a Timoshenko structure coupled with a heat equation of hyperbolic type. The only damping we employ is the thermal effect. We come up with a control force capable of driving the system to the equilibrium state in an exponential manner. It is also explained how to get any desirable rate of decay. Our method is based on the multiplier technique.},

The semi-automatic control of interconnected systems employing the stabilising agent whose installation is segregated from the associated control algorithm has been presented previously. In this development, the quadratic dissipativity constraint (QDC) associated with a non-negative supply rate is newly introduced for the stabilising agent. The closed-loop system having bounded disturbances is input-to-state stabilised with a non-monotonic Lyapunov function when the QDC is used with model predictive controllers. The effectiveness of the QDC for stabilising agents in the presented partially decentralised architecture is demonstrated via simulation studies of a frequency regulation problem in power systems.},

Stochastic customer requests for resource allocations and releases are modelled as constrained parallel Birth–Death Processes (BDP). We address both instant (i.e. the customer requires a resource to be allocated immediately) and advance (i.e. the customer books a resource for future use) reservation requests, the latter with both bounded and unbounded time interval options. Algorithms based on Dynamic Programming (DP) principles are proposed for the calculation of suitable price profiles. At the core of such algorithms, there is the resolution of stochastic optimisation problems. In particular, the maximisation of the expected total revenue is formulated via a constrained Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) approach, which becomes time-variant in case of advance reservation requests. Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) techniques are adopted in case of large state spaces. Simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed models and the related algorithms.},

To improve the robustness of some existing methods, we propose a pre-processing stage that separates nonlinear homogeneous order contributions from which Volterra kernels can be identified independently. Unlike existing separation methods that use amplitude relations between test signals, we propose another order separation method based on phase. This method gives access to a new type of complex-valued output signals, which can be used to improve kernel identification. First, the underlying ideas are introduced via the presentation of a theoretical method using complex-valued test signals. Second, the proposed order separation method using real-valued signals is described. Third, a new identification process is given, combining existing least-squares identification method with the previous results. Finally, numerical experiments are used to compare the proposed order separation method with state-of-the-art, as well as to evaluate the new Volterra series identification process.},

The FTC law is designed to compensate boundary input faults for the Schrödinger-ODE cascade system by constructing a normal intermediate system and a new exponentially stable target system. The purposes of the two-step backstepping are to bring in a state feedback and to improve the system performance. The performance of the target system, intermediate system, and Schrödinger-ODE cascade system is analysed in the Riesz basis frame.

An objective function is characterised based on maximizing the healthy C D 4 + T C D 4 + T CD4+T cells counts and minimizing the count of infected C D 4 + T cells along with other systemic cost of drug therapy. Using Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle, we give the necessary conditions for optimal control. Through numerical simulations, we investigate and compare the effect of different mono- and multi-drug therapies. In case of mono blockers, results show that the drug which blocks cell-to-cell dissemination of infection is a better option for treating an HIV-1 infected individual.

Active and passive roles of nodes can be fixed or varying in time. Nonidentical node modalities allow active nodes to receive different classes of measurements from the process. For this class of sensor networks, we propose a distributed input and state coestimation architecture, where the time evolution of input and state updates of each node both depend on the local input and state information exchanges.

Specifically, the system is assumed to have Bernoulli machines, finite buffers and finite carriers. By using Markovian approach, exact mathematical model for the system under consideration as well as the formulas to calculate the system&#39;s transient-based real-time performances are derived. For estimating the performances of a closed line under finite production run-based operation, we propose an approximation method with high accuracy and computational efficiency.

First, a partial projection of individual subsystems into the Brockett oscillators is performed using a sliding-mode control. Second, the network of these oscillators is synchronised using the global synchronisation results of a particular second-order nonlinear oscillator model from Ahmed, Ushirobira, and Efimov [(2019). Robust global synchronization of brockett oscillators. IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems , 6 (1), 289–298]. Our approach is based on output feedback and uses a higher order sliding mode observer to estimate the states and perturbations of the synchronised nonlinear systems. Along with numerical simulations, the performance of the proposed synchronisation scheme is experimentally verified on a network of Van der Pol oscillators.},

  abstract     = {This work examines stabilisation and reference tracking problems for uncertain deterministic as well as switched stochastic nonlinear systems. The concept of input state stability is employed here in the tracking problems. Additionally, an attempt is made to improve the transient performance of deterministic nonlinear systems by employing the notion of return time which is applicable to a broader class of nonlinearities. The transient performances are compared using the Integral Square Error (ISE). The control law is linear in states and thus is easy to implement. The optimisation problem is formulated in a framework of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The proposed design is tested on simulation examples. The advantages are established on benchmark problems from the literature like Control of the Wing Rocket Aircraft and the Continuously Stirred Tank Chemical Reactor (CSTR). As per the author&#39;s knowledge, not much work is reported on these problems.},

Using insights from geometric singular perturbation theory, a sequential controller is designed over two time-scales. For different choices of measurements, Lyapunov-based observer designs are investigated. Both the controller and the observer are designed to guarantee Lyapunov stability of the lower-order reduced subsystems. Using an extension of the composite Lyapunov analysis, it is proved that the full-order nonlinear system with the controller and the observer remains globally asymptotically stable up to a bound of the time-scale separation parameter. In addition, the composite Lyapunov analysis yields sufficient conditions as guidelines to select the gains. The approach and analysis are demonstrated on a nonlinear two-time-scale system for which the reduced subsystems are linear, but the composite Lyapunov analysis handles the nonlinearity present in the full-order dynamics.},

A four-body system with input signals acting on the first and fourth bodies is chosen as a benchmark model, which can be decomposed into a control dynamics subsystem and a zero dynamics subsystem. A new and detailed stability analysis is conducted to show that such a zero dynamic system is Lyapunov stable and is partially input-to-state stable under the condition that the speeds of first and fourth bodies are synchronous. The physical meaning of such partial input-to-state stability is clarified. An adaptive controller is developed to ensure such a needed system stabilisation condition and thus the boundedness of the desired closed-loop system signal and asymptotic speed tracking of the control dynamics subsystem. Detailed closed-loop system stability and tracking performance analysis are given, in which the tracking errors satisfy the L 1 performance. Extensions to the other multibody systems with flexible links are derived. The developed adaptive controller is applied to a realistic train dynamic model, and simulation results verify the desired system performance.},

From this point of view, the fixed time synchronisation is more favourable and applicable. This paper aims to investigate the fixed-time synchronisation and fixed-time anti-synchronisation of Cohen-Grossberg master-slave neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations and time delays. For the purpose of fixed-time synchronisation, under the framework of Filippov solution, by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and designing a novel discontinuous feedback control procedure for the slave neural networks, some sufficient criteria are firstly derived to design the control parameters for achieving synchronisation within a fixed time for the proposed discontinuous Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Then, based on the fixed-time synchronisation, another new discontinuous feedback controller is also designed to accomplish the fixed-time anti-synchronisation for the considered neural system. Finally, two numerical examples associated with main theorems and corollaries are presented to illustrate the proposed methodologies.},

The stability of the closed-loop delayed Multi-Agent System (MAS) is proven to leverage the Lyapunov–Krasovskii approach combined with the Barbalat&#39;s Lemma.

  abstract     = {The problem of controlling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can be simplified in some cases by designing a controller for the Vertical Take-off and Landing (PVTOL) platform and adapting it to other vehicles. This is one of the reasons there is such an abundant quantity of control algorithms for this platform. The control design used in this case is feedback linearisation, which is a nonlinear control technique that allows the PVTOL to be transformed into a linear system using a feedback function. The function used for the PVTOL does not expand through all the state space, as it presents a singularity. This work is focused on finding under what conditions it is possible to determine local asymptotic stability using a control based on feedback linearisation of the PVTOL platform that prevents the system from reaching any singularity due to the transformation of the function.},

The actuated dynamical system is considered to have a measurable state for feedback control, whereas only the output is available from the unactuated dynamical system. Specifically, the control objective for this class of dynamical systems is to allow a desired subset of the state of the actuated dynamical system to follow given commands in the presence of uncertain parameters and unactuated dynamical system coupling. To this end, our contribution is a mixed state and output feedback framework in the context of model reference adaptive control, which is predicated on integrated nominal and adaptive control laws. The key feature of the proposed model reference adaptive control architecture is to guarantee stability of the closed-loop coupled dynamical system as well as to assign user-defined bounds on system error trajectories utilised by the adaptive control law for achieving a prescribed level of overall system performance.},

This paper tackles a novel load frequency control (LFC) problem in the presence of constant and time-varying delays in state and control input under load disturbances. The presence of time delays can deteriorate the performance of the controller or even destabilise the system. The above problem is addressed through a prediction-based super twisting sliding mode control (ST-SMC) using a state and disturbance observer. The proposed design achieves finite-time convergence of frequency and tie-line power deviation. The said design is validated under ramp and random step disturbance, with nonlinearities like generation rate constraints and governor deadband, with an integration of renewable energy and also with IEEE 39 bus power system. The closed-loop stability is proven thanks to candidate Lyapunov function and verified by simulations.},

Model order reduction yields alternative systems of much lower dimensions. However, a reduced system may be unstable, although the original system is asymptotically stable. We consider projection-based model order reduction of Galerkin-type. A transformation of the original system ensures that any reduced system is asymptotically stable. This transformation requires the solution of a high-dimensional Lyapunov inequality. We solve this problem using a specific Lyapunov equation. Its solution can be represented as a matrix-valued integral in the frequency domain.Consequently, quadrature rules yield numerical approximations, where large sparse linear systems of algebraic equations have to be solved. Furthermore, we extend this technique to systems of differential-algebraic equations with strictly proper transfer functions by a regularisation. Finally, results of numerical computations are presented for high-dimensional examples.},

A modified reference model is designed with the feedback compensation of the estimated mismatched uncertainties. Besides, the estimated matched uncertainties are adopted for the feedforward control, as a compensation term of the robust control law. Moreover, the stability analysis and steady-state performance of the closed-loop system are presented.

Nonlinear time-delay systems not necessarily affine in the control input are studied. It is shown that, if the continuous-time closed-loop system at hand is globally exponentially stable and the maps describing the plant and the continuous-time dynamic output feedback controller are globally Lipschitz, then, under suitably fast sampling, the Euler emulation of the continuous-time controller at hand preserves the global exponential stability of the sampled-data closed-loop system (no matter whether periodic or aperiodic sampling is used). In the case of bounded measurement noises and bounded actuation disturbances affecting the control law, it is proved that, under suitable fast sampling, (global) exponential input-to-state stability with respect to both these external inputs is guaranteed. A generalisation of the Halanay&#39;s inequality is used as a tool in order to prove the results. The existence of a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional for the continuous-time closed-loop system is sufficient to ensure the preservation of the global exponential practical stability. On the other hand, the explicit knowledge of a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional allows us to compute an upper bound for the sampling period. An example is presented which validates the theoretical results.},

Due to the presence of time-varying model uncertainties and delay mismatches, the separation principle cannot be used to design the observer and control gains separately, which becomes a challenging problem. By applying small gain theory and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKF), in combination with Bessel-Legendre inequalities and the Projection Lemma, we develop sufficient conditions based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) for control design. As a result, the closed-loop robust performance can be improved whilst satisfying a prescribed decay rate in the closed-loop dynamics at the expense of introducing more LMI decision variables without increasing the complexity of the control scheme. Also, the Extended State Observer (ESO) is integrated in the proposed control scheme to improve the rejection performance of mismatched disturbances. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the decentralised connectively practical finite-time control problem is studied for a class of p-normal form large-scale systems with expanding construction. First, the decentralised connectively practical finite-time controllers are designed for the p-normal form large-scale systems without expanding construction by combining adding a power integrator technique, the backstepping method, the Lyapunov theory with the neural adaptive technology. The designed controllers can guarantee that all the signals of the closed-loop system are practically finite-time stable and the large-scale system is connectively stable. Then, the expansion of the system is considered. A new subsystem is added to the original system online. It is needed that the decentralised control laws and the adaptive laws of the original system are kept to be unchanged, and only the control laws and the adaptive laws for the newly added subsystem need to be designed. Under the premise, the control laws and the adaptive laws of the new subsystem are designed, which can guarantee that both newly added subsystem and resultant expanded closed-loop large-scale system are connectively practically finite-time stable. The singularity problem arising in the design process for practical finite-time control is solved. Here, the adding a power integrator technique is applied to handle the control design problem for p-normal form systems. And the control laws and the adaptive laws are simplified by neural networks. The two numerical examples including an actual double-inverted pendulum system connected by a spring are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Through concerted efforts, these UAVs can fly the expected time-variant formation, which relies on and adapts to the position of the target aerial vehicle. Besides, the robustness of this heterogeneous system is also discussed. It is essentially concluded that this heterogeneous system is capable of rebuilding its communication network and efficiently performing coordinative escort task, in case part of these miniature UAVs are invalid. Finally, three classes of aerial escort task, including the cohesive escort task, the sphere escort task, and the herringbone escort task, are illustrated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

This way, we can model the fact that resources can be allocated to customers at different prices, and that customers can hold them as long as they like. More specifically, a discretisation approach is applied to model resource allocation problems as a set of discrete-time BDPs, which are then integrated into one Markov decision process. The stochastic dynamics of the resulting system are also investigated. As a result, revenue management becomes a stochastic decision-making problem, where price managers can propose suitable prices to the allocation requests such that the maximum expected total revenue is obtained at the end of a predefined finite time horizon. Stochastic Dynamic Programming is employed to solve the related optimisation problem with the support of an ad-hoc Matlab-based application. Several simulations are performed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model and the optimisation approach.},

In order to overcome the obstacles brought by the outliers, the heavy-tailed Laplace distribution is applied to describe the output measurement process. Specifically, the Laplace distribution can be decomposed as a scale mixture of Gaussian distributions, which makes it robust for the outliers. The unknown model parameters are estimated with the expectation–maximisation algorithm while the particle smoother is used to solve the latent state estimation problem. The usefulness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are verified through the numerical examples including the model of a common chemical process.},

The state feedback switching function design can be obtained as a particular case and is simpler to handle from theoretical and numerical viewpoints compared to other methods available in the literature, as for instance, those based on Lyapunov–Metzler inequalities. The novelty of the proposed control methodology is the adoption of a time-varying Lyapunov function, which together with the presence of a key matrix, allow us to treat the static output feedback control design, taking into account a guaranteed H 2 performance cost.

The index of convergence (i.e. the number of distinct powers of a Boolean matrix) is a crucial characteristic in that it assesses the transient behaviour of the system until reaching a periodic course. In this paper, adopting a graph-theoretic approach, we present bounds for the index of convergence of Boolean matrices for a diverse class of systems, with a certain decomposition. The presented bounds are an extension of the bound on irreducible Boolean matrices, and we provide non-trivial bounds that were unknown for classes of systems. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to determine the bounds in polynomial time. Lastly, we illustrate how the new bounds compare with the previously known bounds and we show their effectiveness in cases such as the benchmark IEEE 5-bus power system.},

Firstly with respect to a multi-machine power system, the manifold consensus is re-formulated as a specific multi-agent flocking collision in the mirrored multi-agent network with augmented-dimension nodes representing the generators and excitation systems (ES). Secondly, by forcing the multi-agents into flocking collision under virtual controls, according to which the control actions of ES are determined so that all generators achieve the multiple objectives simultaneously. Thirdly, distributed implementation by partial multi-agent networking is explained. Finally, numerical examples are included to illustrate the techniques. Advantages include: multi-objective control in multi-machine power networks is achievable, independent of the Lyapunov theory; controller parametrization is numerically tractable and with more freedoms, involving no generator and ES dynamical models; implementation can be across the whole network or its partial subsystems.},

The most distinguishing feature, compared with the well-studied mean-field LQG games, is that the game system follows linear SDEs driven by random jumps. The individual agents of large population system are coupled both in their state dynamics and in their individual cost functionals. Each agent in large population system has negligible impact on others, but their collective behaviors will impose some significant impact on all agents. The so-called NCE methodology is introduced to deal with the dimensionality difficulty. This methodology derives a set of decentralized strategies, which is an ϵ -Nash equilibrium for a finite N population system where ε = O ( 1 N ) . A numerical example is provided to illustrate the consistency of the mean field estimation and the impact of the population&#39;s collective behaviors. As applications, a pricing problem is studied and the decentralized suboptimal price strategy is obtained.},

And the stability of the closed-loop system is analysed. The designed controller can guarantee that all the states in the closed-loop system are finite-time asymptotic stable. In the design, a new assumption for unknown nonlinear terms is proposed, which is looser than the existed works. A combination vector method is adopted to avoid the effect of the approximation errors of neural networks. The maximal value of norms of the combination vectors is taken as an adaptive parameter, so that the complexity of the design method is reduced. And the settling-time can be adjusted by changing a design parameter. Finally, three simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

To improve the efficiency of target hunting and the smoothness of AUV’s trajectory, a fuzzy-based potential field hierarchical reinforcement learning approach is proposed. Unlike other algorithms that need repeated training in the choice of parameters, the proposed approach automatically acquires all the required parameters by learning. The potential field hierarchy is established by combining the segmental options with the traditional hierarchy reinforcement learning algorithm. The potential field is applied in the parameters of the HRL, which provides a reasonable path for target hunting in an undeveloped environments. In the meantime, fuzzy algorithm is introduced to improve the smoothness of AUV trajectory. The simulation results show that the proposed method can control multi-AUV to achieve multi-target hunting task, and has higher efficiency and adaptability than other algorithm.},

Existing single-critic algorithms require stabilising critic tuning laws while eliminating actor tuning. This paper thus studies alternative single-critic realisation aiming to relax the needs for stabilising mechanisms in the critic tuning law. Optimal control laws are determined from the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equality by solving for the associated value function via SPI in a single-critic configuration. Different from other existing single-critic methods, an MVFA is proposed to deal with closed-loop stability during online learning. Gradient-descent tuning is employed to adjust the critic NN parameters in the interests of not complicating the problem. Parameters convergence and closed-loop system states stability are examined. The proposed MVFA approach yields an alternative single-critic SPI method with uniformly ultimately bounded NN parameter convergence and asymptotic closed-loop system states stability throughout the process of online learning without the need for stabilising mechanisms in the tuning law for critic NN. The proposed approach is verified via simulations.},

  abstract     = {The response speed of a network impacts the efficacy of its actions to external stimuli. However, for a given bound on the update rate, the network-response speed is limited by the need to maintain stability. The main contributions of this work are (i) to use delayed self-reinforcement (DSR), where each agent uses its current and previously available information to strengthen its update, (ii) develop conditions for stability with the new update, and (iii) to show that such self-reinforcement can increase the network speed without the need to increase the individual agent&#39;s update rate. Example simulation results are presented that show more than an order of magnitude improvement in the response speed (quantified using the settling time) with the proposed DSR approach.},

  abstract     = {Feeding a controller with acceleration signal can improve system robustness and relative stability. However, neither measurements of acceleration signals nor velocity signals are available in most industrial robot manipulators. Inevitable estimation errors may lead to chattering phenomenon that can excite unmodeled high frequency plant dynamics yielding either severe vibrations in the arm or instability of the control system. This paper proposes a stochastic discrete-time multivariable proportional-derivative-double derivative (PDD) controller with the objective of possessing superior tracking capability in presence of unmodeled joint friction forces while only using joint position measurements. The proposed approach models the estimation errors of velocity and acceleration stochastically. Subsequently, the time-varying PDD gains are derived based on minimising the mean-square state error per-discrete-time instant. We show that the mean-square velocity error is inversely proportional to the square of the sample rate. We demonstrate the tracking superiority of the proposed control experimentally on a four-degree-of-freedom robot manipulator.},

By considering that the inter-agent communication topology satisfies the maximal clique graph condition, the formation control can achieve global stability due to the existence of common agents among the maximal cliques. A cost function is proposed based on the target formation. By minimising the cost function under the optimal rotate matrix, a distributed globally stable controller is proposed, which only depends on the local bearing measurement. Then the rotation bias of the final formation and the target formation are analysed. The designed control law can realise the global formation control under the local reference frame. Finally the simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

The proposed methodology provides functionals that contain only simple (and not double or triple) integrals of the state. Moreover, the constructed CLF is ‘almost diagonal’ in the sense that it contains only a finite number of cross-products of the (generalised) Fourier coefficients of the state. The methodology for the construction of a CLF is combined with a novel methodology for boundary feedback design in parabolic PDEs. The proposed feedback design methodology is Lyapunov-based and the feedback controller is an ‘integral’ controller with internal dynamics. It is also shown that the obtained simple CLFs can provide nonlinear boundary feedback laws which achieve global exponential stabilisation of semilinear parabolic PDEs with nonlinearities that satisfy a linear growth condition.},

A novel adaptive backstepping control design based on tuning function is given, which successfully eliminates the effect of uncertainties. In addition, only one parameter needs to be adjusted online in the control design, which greatly alleviates the computation burden.

However, neither of them is applicable to repetitive control (RC, or repetitive controller, also designated RC) of nonlinear systems directly. Because of this, error dynamics are often derived to transform a periodic signal tracking problem into a rejection problem. This not only fails to represent the special feature of periodic signals but also restricts the applications of RC. In view of this, this paper proposes a new viewpoint on IMP, namely the actuator-focussed viewpoint. With this, the periodic signal tracking problem can be converted into a stability problem without deriving error dynamics for linear periodic systems and nonlinear systems. In order to demonstrate its effectiveness, the proposed design approach is applied to RC problems for a linear periodic system, a minimum-phase nonlinear system and a nonminimum-phase nonlinear system.},

To reduce the computational cost, pseudospectral collocation scheme is embedded so as to transfer a family of time-varying influence function dynamics into a set of linear algebraic equations. Therefore, a series of symbolic formulation can be analytically derived to efficiently calculate the influence functions. Also, some special integrals using to update the improvements can be efficiently determined by Gaussian Quadrature. Finally, the performance of both TGMs is investigated with reduced-order reentry trajectory planning problem. The results show that both methods only take a few steps to find the solution satisfying the necessary condition for optimality and terminal constraints. Furthermore, the TGM with pseudospectral collocation scheme considerably improves the computational efficiency and has the potential to be applicable in the framework of real-time guidance.},

A smooth positive function and parameter adaption technique are combined to deal with the effect made by state estimation error in the process of stability analysis of the closed-loop system. It is proved that all the signals are guaranteed to be bounded and the tracking error will converge to a small bounded set which is adjustable by tuning certain design constants.

This enables us to quantitatively evaluate the uncertainty using stochastic calculus. We present a stochastic stabilizing controller and a stability theorem, which claim that the error of the rigid body motion with respect to a given desired motion is exponentially ultimately bounded in the mean square sense. The resultant stochastic model has no equilibrium point due to persistent noise effect. This makes stability analysis more difficult than the conventional stochastic stability concepts. However, the present stability theorem guarantees that the error exponentially converges to the vicinity of the target state and then remains bounded even under persistent noise. Finally, numerical simulations validate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Ever since the technique of Kalman-Bucy filter was popularised, finding new classes of finite dimensional recursive filters has drawn much concern. The idea of using estimation algebra to construct finite-dimensional nonlinear filters was first proposed by Brockett and Mitter independently in the late 1970s, which has been proven an invaluable tool in tackling nonlinear filtering (NLF) problems. Once the estimation algebra is finite dimensional, one can construct the finite dimensional filters (FDFs) for NLF problems by Wei–Norman approach. In this paper, we give the construction of finite dimensional estimation algebra (FDEA) with state space dimension 4 and linear rank equal to 1, and further obtain a new class of NLF systems with FDFs. Importantly, we show that there is a class of polynomial FDF system in state space dimension 4 with linear rank one, but the coefficients in Wong&#39;s Ω-matrix are polynomials of degree two, or higher. In particular, these are the first examples of polynomial filtering systems not of Yau type (i.e. the drift term is not gradient plus affine functions) but with FDFs. Furthermore, we write down several easily satisfied sufficient conditions for the construction of more special classes of FDFs. Additionally, we derive the FDFs for the proposed NLF systems by using the Wei–Norman approach.},

A stochastic model is structured to describe the motion of the walker subject to random parametric uncertainty. An observer is designed to identify the interaction forces, motion position, and motion velocity of the walker. The novelty of this approach is that the interaction forces are estimated from the reduced tracking performance rather than a conventional nonlinear function. Meanwhile, the position and velocity states are estimated based on the walker&#39;s position output. A nonlinear tracking controller is constructed to give the tracking and the estimation error systems mean-square stability both exponentially and practically. Furthermore, the mean-square errors of the interaction forces identification and the tracking motion converge to a sufficiently small neighbourhood upon tuning appropriate parameters. The results of a simulated application confirm the effectiveness of the proposed interaction forces identification and controller design method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we will discuss how operational limitations affect input–output behaviours of the system. In particular, we will provide a formulation for passivity and passivity indices of a nonlinear system given operational limitations on the input and state variables. This formulation is presented in the form of local passivity and indices. We will provide optimisation based formulation to derive passivity properties of the system through polynomial approximations. Two different approaches are taken to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of a system through polynomial functions; namely, Taylor&#39;s theorem and a multivariate generalisation of Bernstein polynomials. For each approach, conditions for stability, dissipativity, and passivity of a system, as well as methods to find its passivity indices, are given. Two different methods are also presented to reduce the size of the optimisation problem in Taylor&#39;s theorem approach. Examples are provided to show the applicability of the results.},

  abstract     = {Spectral and Pseudospectral methods have been widely considered in diverse optimal control applications, usually where energy optimisation is required. Although such methods are a good way to ensure a good balance between performance and computational effort, in most of the literature, nominal mathematical models are considered without taking into account possible dynamic deviations from the nominal case. The main aim of this study is to propose a novel framework where spectral and pseudospectral problems include some structured uncertainty, achieving robust optimal control designs guaranteeing the ‘best worst-case performance’. In this paper, the objective function used for optimisation is inspired by wave energy converters. Two solution methodologies are developed. Firstly, an analytical solution, for circular and convex polytopic uncertainty boundaries, is proposed. Then, a numerical formulation is introduced to consider uncertainty sets of arbitrary shape, adding the ability to consider physical system constraints. Finally, an application example shows the benefit of this new control formulation.},

On the other hand, the increasing need for safety and reliability has motivated the development of fault-tolerant control techniques. In this work, the sensor performance degradation due to its aging is modelled by the increment of sensor measurement noise covariance. The main contribution of this paper is the characterisation of the control synthesis conditions using parametrised linear matrix inequalities (PLMIs) for a multi-objective gain-scheduled noisy output-feedback controller that minimises the output cost on H 2 performance with satisfactory system stability, H ∞ performance and control input covariance constraints ( H 2 constraints on the control inputs) in the presence of sensor aging. The closed-loop system stability and performance, in terms of mixed H 2 / H ∞ performances, relative improvement, numerical complexity, computation time, and initial conditions response, are studied, and a numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The synthesised controller guarantees not only the stability but also the closed-loop mixed H 2 / H ∞ performances, and it is feasible for real-time applications.},

We design model-based control and adaptive control with output constraints for the control part. Employing a time-varying function to the constraint part, the displacement of the nanobeam can be well limited within a trajectory. By choosing designed parameters appropriately, signals in the nanobeam system converge to a small neighbourhood of zero and the vibration of the nanobeam system is suppressed with prescribed performance.

Then the time-varying formation tracking problem where the real leader&#39;s input is unknown to all other agents is solved independently. After that, the time-varying FC problem where the challenge is how to deal with the formation-achieving agents&#39; unknown nonzero inputs for containment-achieving agents, is firstly addressed. All the designed controllers, which need no eigenvalue information of the whole graph, are fully distributed and so can be applied to large-scale systems.

A key component of our control law is the adaptive distributed observer for an uncertain leader system proposed recently by ourselves. We first show that this adaptive distributed observer is capable of estimating the unknown parameter vector of the leader system exponentially as long as the leader&#39;s signal is persistently exciting. Then, we further solve our problem by both distributed state feedback control law and distributed measurement output feedback control law utilising the adaptive distributed observer.},

It also ensures prescribed performance bounded (PPB) for any initial conditions, removing the shortcoming of the current PPB method. The proposed control scheme consists of two units: supervisory control and prescribed performance bounded (PPB) control. The role of the former is to drive the tracking error from any initial condition within the domain of interest to a residual set, so that the PPB control can be activated to ensure pre-given performance specifications. A soft connector is introduced to maintain continuous control action during the switching. Theoretical analysis and simulation verification confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Several Lyapunov-based FTC schemes that depend on the system parameters and boundary conditions are proposed which guarantee the exponential stability of the non-switched hyperbolic systems. The new result is further extended to the switched linear hyperbolic systems where the boundary control gain of each mode and the switching law are designed comprehensively. It shows that the FTC goal can be achieved even if only some faulty modes are stabilizable. An air traffic flow example is taken to illustrate the theoretical results.},

As a result, the traditional IDA-PBC is complemented with an additional matching condition and the control law is augmented with a new term that accounts for the Coulomb friction forces on all joints. Two adaptive control paradigms are considered for comparison purposes and stability conditions are discussed.

By separating the periodic disturbance response from the deterministic system response using the superposition principle, an orthogonal projection is established to eliminate the disturbance influence, while an instrumental variable is introduced to eliminate the noise effect for consistent estimation. The overall disturbance period could be exactly estimated by minimising an objective function of output prediction error. A singular value decomposition algorithm is developed to simultaneously estimate the observability matrix and the triangular block-Toeplitz matrix. The system matrices are subsequently retrieved via a shift-invariant algorithm. Sufficient conditions for consistent estimation of the observability matrix and the triangular block-Toeplitz matrix are established with a proof.

Therefore in this paper, a novel observer-based scheme is proposed to capture the abnormal traffic flow at the bottleneck node of the communication network via the attack detection residual. An LMI-based design is proposed that ensures both system stability and H -infinity performance and also detects attacks on the network as well as on the physical system.

Necessary and sufficient conditions on the network are derived so that the conventional consensus algorithm leads to group consensus values in the range determined by the initial values of the non-faulty nodes. In the presence of unstructured Byzantine faults, two fault tolerant algorithms are proposed to overcome the highly disruptive behaviour.

First, the notion of finite-time H ∞ H ∞ H∞ for switched systems, as a performance index, is introduced. Contrary to the classical H ∞ H ∞ H∞ control, finite-time stability rather than asymptotic stability or practical stability needs to be satisfied in the finite-time H ∞ H ∞ H∞ control. Moreover, based on the method of multiple Lyapunov functions (MLFs) and the technique of adding a power integrator, a sufficient condition guaranteeing the solvability of the finite-time H ∞ control problem for the system under consideration is derived via a designed switching law, where there is no subsystem whose corresponding control problem must be solvable.

  abstract     = {This paper considers linear systems which are positively invariant in a second-order cone (ice-cream cone). Three problems are addressed: (i) stability; (ii) ℒ 1 L 1 L1 performance; (iii) state feedback design for stabilisation and optimal ℒ 1 L 1 L1 performance while preserving cone invariance. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions via Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) for the solution of problems (i) and (ii). As for problem (iii), a full parametrization of feasible state feedback gains is provided, along with some LMI relaxations useful to compute a feasible gain. Finally, a numerical example is briefly discussed.},

  abstract     = {A method for dealing with the problem of convergence to incorrect equilibrium points of distance-based formation controllers was recently proposed by introducing an additional controlled variable, viz., the signed area of a triangle. In this paper, we seek to generalise this method to planar formations of n agents for both first- and second-order agent models while using unidirectional sensing and control. In addition to directed formation shape control, we also consider the problem of formation motions. We prove that, under certain conditions on the edge lengths of the triangulated desired formation and control gains, the distributed controller ensures the almost-global asymptotic stability of the correct formation and is coordinate frame invariant. Experimental evaluations are presented to support the theoretical results.},

In this paper, an online system is proposed in which observed indicators are processed and the results are then interfaced with an advanced alert mechanism that gives out appropriate measures. In particular, two stochastic models, with HMM-modulated parameters switching between liquidity regimes, are integrated to capture the evolutions of the four time series or their transformations. Parameter estimation is accomplished by deriving adaptive multivariate filters. Indicators&#39; joint empirical characteristics are captured well and useful early warnings are obtained for occurrence prediction of illiquidity episodes.},

Then, by using backstepping method, a distributed finite-time tracking control algorithm is developed with the neural network being utilizsd to estimate the model uncertainties. A tan-type barrier Lyapunov function is used to guarantee that the error variables will not exceed the prescribed bounds. Finite-time stability of the systems is demonstrated by Lyapunov theory and graph theory.

Through model transformations, the robust ℋ ∞ H ∞ H∞ consensus control problem of multi-agents network is reduced to a set of independent H ∞ stabilisation problems for single linear subsystems. For robust H ∞ consensus, it is shown that the analysis and full state-feedback synthesis conditions for such subsystems can be formulated as linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimisation problems. On the other hand, the synthesis condition for dynamic output-feedback protocol is formulated as non-convex bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) optimisation problem. An iterative LMI algorithm is then presented to solve the resulting BMI optimisation problem. An example of multiple mass-spring-damper systems has been used to demonstrate theoretical results.},

In containment control, it has some difficulties in forming convex hulls by traditional control methods to achieve ideal control purposes. We propose a method that is more suitable and effective for large-scale networks to achieve containment control here. In this paper, a controllable containment control algorithm based on hierarchical clustering for multi-agent systems is proposed by combining the topology optimisation theory and complex network controllability theory. First, the multi-agent network is divided into several communities according to the hierarchical clustering algorithm. Then the maximum matching algorithm of bipartite graph is used to determine the minimum leader set satisfying the network controllability. Second, the corresponding control protocols are designed for the agents, and a position adjustment control force is introduced to adjust the motion of individuals that are located outside the convex hull in the process of containment among the communities. Therefore, when achieving and maintaining the controllable containment control within the community, the controllable containment control among the communities can be achieved effectively through the proposed algorithm. Finally, some simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

For highly manoeuvring target interception, ZEM becomes a random variable with an unknown prior due to noise-corrupted measurements and unknown bounded target manoeuvres. Currently, the distribution of ZEM is usually evaluated by the method of Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper, an analytical approach is proposed under the configuration of a linear estimator with a separate mode decision-maker. The resulting ZEM estimation error is subject to a biased Gaussian distribution when taking a fixed mode decision delay of the mode decision-maker into consideration. Finally, the analytical distribution is validated by comparison with Monte Carlo simulation and some meaningful use cases are discussed.

Investigating the proposed function, the necessary conditions for achieving control objectives are obtained in order to ensure stability and finite-time convergence to an invariant set over various modes of an uncertain arbitrary switching signal. Despite constructing the control algorithm for general switched systems, the selection of control signal is based on appropriately calculated input bounds rather than a switching term itself, resulting in no chattering effects in control input. Subsequently, the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed control method is verified using numerical and experimental examples.},

To improve the convergence rate and the efficiency, the analytical first-order and second-order sensitivities of state at collocation points with respect to the control, as well as the variable interval parameters are derived, respectively.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel control method to enclose a moving target in a two-dimensional setting with a team of agents forming a prescribed geometric pattern. The approach optimises a measure of the overall agent motion costs, via the minimisation of a suitably defined cost function encapsulating the pattern rotation and scaling. We propose two control laws which use global information and make the agents exponentially converge to the prescribed formation with an optimal scale that remains constant, while the team&#39;s centroid tracks the target. One control law results in a multiagent pattern that keeps a constant orientation in the workspace; for the other, the pattern rotates with constant speed. These behaviours, whose optimality and steadiness are very relevant for the task addressed, occur independently from the target&#39;s velocity. Moreover, the methodology does not require distance measurements, common coordinate references, or communications. We also present formal guarantees of collision avoidance for the proposed approach. Illustrative simulation examples are provided.},

This is a problem that consists of minimising a suitable energy functional among a set of admissible curves subject to some interpolation conditions. The given energy functional depends on velocity, covariant acceleration and on artificial potential functions used for avoiding obstacles. We derive first-order necessary conditions for optimality in the proposed problem; that is, given interpolation and boundary conditions we find the set of differential equations describing the evolution of a curve that satisfies the prescribed boundary values, interpolates the given points and is an extremal for the energy functional. We study the problem in different settings including a general one on a Riemannian manifold and a more specific one on a Lie group endowed with a left-invariant metric. We also consider a sub-Riemannian problem.},

  abstract     = {Negative imaginary (NI) systems theory has attracted considerable attention in the area of robust control of highly resonant flexible structures systems and nano-positioning systems, where the NI property is naturally satisfied. In this paper, we present a control synthesis methodology for NI systems based on nonlinear optimisation techniques. In the presented method, a parametrised library of strictly negative imaginary (SNI) controllers is created and used in a standard numerical nonlinear optimisation setup. The SNI controller library contains generic controllers that are widely used in the control highly resonant flexible structures such as positive position feedback (PPF) and integral resonant control (IRC). Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) techniques are used in the numerical optimisation problem. The synthesised controller satisfies the SNI property as well as optimising H 2 performance. As an application of these results, an example of controlling a Euler–Bernoulli beam with piezoelectric actuator and sensor is presented.},

We address one important practical issue: switching between the regulators is not synchronous with but delayed from switching between the systems due to the limited speed of information transmission and control action. The average dwell time (ADT) method is used to design switching signals and asynchronous regulators. The error-dependent integral term is added to the Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L–K) functional to make better use of the delay information. An auxiliary matrix is introduced to gain higher degree of freedom to achieve both the ADT condition and the dissipativity condition. The solvability conditions are derived using linearisation techniques, and they also give the relations between ADT and upper bound of delays. Simulation examples are provided to testify the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach.},

Then, according to the transformation from formation control to consensus control, we presented a global leaderless consensus-based formation controller for vehicles with parallel desired formations, where all the vehicles were parallel to each other in a straight line along the lateral direction.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal experiment design for LPV system identification with the local approach when the identified model has to be used for LPV control. This local approach for LPV system identification is characterised by a number of local LTI identification experiments performed at constant values of the scheduling variable. In this paper, we determine these constant values of the scheduling variable as well as the input spectra of the corresponding local LTI identification experiments in an optimal way. The optimal LPV identification experiment is here defined as the experiment with the least input energy while guaranteeing that the identified LPV model is sufficiently accurate to yield a satisfactory LPV controller.},

We adopt the idea of generating auxiliary outputs based on a high-gain observer. The estimated auxiliary outputs are then employed by an adaptive observer to reconstruct both states and unknown parameters. The stability analysis is established based on Lyapunov theory. It is shown that the state estimation error and the adaptation error are uniformly bounded and converge to a compact set that may be reduced by an appropriate choice of the design parameters. In order to improve the robustness of our approach against disturbances, the proposed observer is appropriately modified based on sliding modes theory.

This paper considers the modelling and stabilisation control of a Linear Two-Stage IP (LTSIP). To avoid the problems resulted from using first principle model this paper uses a data-driven approach to building a State-Dependent AutoRegressive eXogenous (SD-ARX) model without offset term, whose coefficients are approximated by Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks, to describe the LTSIP. Based on the RBF-ARX model, an infinite horizon Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy is proposed to control the LTSIP plant, which is designed by using the locally linearised model obtained from the RBF-ARX model, and obtaining the locally optimal state feedback control law at each control period. Stability of the close loop system is proved. Real-time control experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modelling and control method is effective in modelling and controlling the UFNU system.},

Moreover, the decentralised strategies are obtained, and the ε -Nash equilibrium is verified.

Furthermore, the decoupled optimal strategies of this MFG are solved explicitly by introducing some Riccati equations.

The proposed technique, so-called particle filter (PF)-based maximum double adaptive exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) chart, involves two steps. First, the states of the biological processes are estimated using the PF method. In the second step, the faults are detected using the maximum double adaptive EWMA chart. The proposed method is based on the maximum of the absolute values of the EWMA statistics, one monitoring adaptively the variance and the other controlling the mean. The FD performance is studied utilising a wastewater treatment model. The detection performances are assessed in terms of missed detection rate, false alarm rate, detection speed, sensibility to fault sizes and robustness to noise levels.},

In comparison to the existing common Lyapunov function-based control, the proposed control is less conservative and requires relatively small input by directly identifying uncertain parameters in the switched model.

The main difference with conventional Floquet theory comes from the fact that the underlying flow of the solution matrix is aperiodic. The monodromy matrix associated with this Floquet representation coincides with the exponential (fundamental) matrix associated with the stabilising fixed point of the Riccati equation. The second part of this article is dedicated to the application of this representation to the stability of matrix differential Riccati equations. We provide refined global and local contraction inequalities for the Riccati exponential semigroup that depend linearly on the spectral norm of the initial condition. These refinements improve upon existing results and are a direct consequence of the Floquet-type representation, yielding what seems to be the first results of this type for this class of models.},

The core concept is the use of an alternative parameterisation of the degrees of freedom in the PFC law. Building on recent insights into the potential of Laguerre functions in traditional MPC (Rossiter, Wang, &amp; Valencia-Palomo, 2010; Wang, 2009), this paper develops an appropriate framework for PFC and then demonstrates that these functions can be exploited to allow easier and more effective tuning in PFC as well as facilitating strong constraint handling properties. The proposed design approach and the associated tuning methodology are developed and their efficacy is demonstrated with a number of numerical examples.},

Then, based on the simplified theorem and the stability equation method, all the feasible low pass filter (LPF) parameters that stabilised the inner-loop can be obtained.

A previously reported observer, based on the Immersion and Invariance technique, is used to estimate the attitude of each robot. It is shown that the combination of the two trajectory control strategies with the vehicle attitude observer yields an asymptotically stable closed-loop system, while the combination of the third control law with the attitude observer produces exponential convergence of the longitudinal velocity errors, asymptotic convergence of the observation errors, and bounded tracking errors. Finally, real-time experiments exhibit the adequate performance of the control strategies proposed despite tracking trajectories that present unfavourable operating conditions for the robots.},

The directed link failures/recoveries model considered here is randomly switching topologies. Randomly switching topologies in MASs are governed by the Markovian jump process. Moreover, the actuator loss-of-effectiveness faults may happen in any of the actuators. To deal with this, by using the sliding mode control method and weak infinitesimal operation, a passive FTC strategy is presented and sufficient conditions for stochastic consensus of underlying MASs are derived in the mean square stability sense. To that end, by employing such FTC design, MASs achieve consensus in mean square sense onto the predefined stochastic sliding surfaces in finite time while robustness of the overall system against the directed link failures/recoveries and communication noise and actuator faults is guaranteed. Finally, an example on multiple networked Euler-Lagrange systems is presented to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithms.},

In general, this work consists of three key design parts. Firstly, the Markov parameters sequence is identified to extract system feature from data. Then, robust linear quadratic preview control policy composed of finite data feedback, integral operation and preview action is designed through establishing data-space characterisation and solving the related convex optimisation problem. Thirdly, an active fault tolerant method composed of fault detection, isolation, estimation and corresponding compensation is further constructed to accommodate fault influence. Note that all these involved designs are performed at Markov parameters sequence level. Thus above integrated preview control scheme can avoid the priori knowledge requirements including system matrices, order, and state variables. The effectiveness of the obtained results is finally verified via a case study of the injection moulding machine.},

Considering a multi-agent system composed of a leader and multiple followers, this paper proposes and investigates a new perspective into this problem: can we enable a follower to estimate the leader&#39;s driving input and leverage this idea to develop new observer-based tracking control approaches? With this motivation, we develop an input-observer-based leader-follower tracking control framework, which features distributed input observers that allow a follower to locally estimate the leader&#39;s input toward enhancing tracking control. This work first studies the first-order tracking problem. It then extends to the more sophisticated case of second-order tracking and considers a challenging situation when the leader&#39;s and followers&#39; velocities are not measured. The proposed approaches exhibit interesting and useful advantages as revealed by a comparison with the literature. Convergence properties of the proposed approaches are rigorously analyzed. Simulation results further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed perspective, framework and approaches.},

  abstract     = {Let ℒ n ( d ) ≤ L n ( d ) ≤ Ln(d)≤ be the set of sequences of real matrices L = ( L 1 , … , L n ) L = ( L 1 , … , L n ) L=(L1,…,Ln) , L i ∈ ℝ p × m L i ∈ R p × m Li∈Rp×m , i = 1 , … , n i = 1 , … , n i=1,…,n , admitting a minimal partial realisation of order d and such that the sum of their largest partial row and column Kronecker indices is smaller than or equal to n . This set is a differentiable manifold which can be stratified according to the partial row and column Kronecker indices of the sequences L . Let Σ c o Σ c o Σco be the set of triples ( F , G , H ) ( F , G , H ) (F,G,H) such that ( F , G ) ( F , G ) (F,G) is controllable and ( H , F ) ( H , F ) (H,F) is observable. This set can also be stratified according to the Brunovsky indices of controllability and observability of ( F , G ) and ( H , F ) , respectively. In this paper we show that this stratification is Whitney regular and from it the regularity of the considered stratification of L n ( d ) ≤ will be proved. The study of generic families of elements in L n ( d ) ≤ or in Σ c o is also included.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the output feedback stabilisation of a cascaded ODE-Heat system with Dirichlet boundary interconnection with external disturbance flowing the control end, we design an unknown input type state observer with the disturbance estimator term with the aid of the known auxiliary system, which is used to not only stabilise this cascaded system but compensate the external disturbance simultaneously. The stabilising state feedback control is designed for the observer system by the classical backstepping transformation, which is the corresponding observer-based output feedback stabilising control for the original system. As a result, the closed-loop system is proved to be exponentially stable. Finally, the numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of this method for the system with boundary disturbance.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the stabilisation problem of a class of multi-weights stochastic complex networks driven by G -Brownian motion ( G -MSN) via aperiodically intermittent adaptive control. It is worth noting that the intermittent control we consider is aperiodic and adaptive and it is used to stabilise G -MSN for the first time. Because of the particularity of G -expectation, the usual Halanay-type differential inequality for intermittent control problem are not applicable. A new inequality for dealing with the dynamic properties of G -MSN with intermittent control is established, based on which the stability problem is analysed by virtue of Lyapunov method and graph theory. Then, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the exponential stability in mean square, which are less conservative. Subsequently, a multi-weights stochastic oscillators system driven by G -Brownian motion is investigated as an application of the main results, and a numerical example is also presented to show the validity of the control strategy.},

  abstract     = {A dynamic estimation and control problem with a strategic sensor is considered. The strategic sensor may provide corrupted messages about the state measurements of a discrete-time linear time-invariant dynamical system to the system operator (or the controller). The system operator then uses this information to construct an estimate of the state of the system (and perhaps private variables of the sensor). The estimate is used to control the system to achieve the operator&#39;s desired objective. The problem is formulated as a game, which might be conflicting to that of the strategic sensor. An equilibrium of the game is computed and its properties are investigated.},
