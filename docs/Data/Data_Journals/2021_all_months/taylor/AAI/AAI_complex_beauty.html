  abstract     = {With the increasing aging of the population, the design of automatic bath robot has the forward-looking significance. The robot needs to detect the skin position, so as to perform the bathing task. The perception of skin is the key technology to achieve the bathing task. In this paper, object detection is used to identify the skin, which provides reference information for the pose of the robot. According to the classification of the object detection algorithms, this paper selects four typical object detection algorithms, namely, Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4 and CenterNet. Due to the limitation of the self-built data set, this paper adopts the transfer learning to promote the completion of new tasks, which takes the pre-trained model as the starting point. The experimental results show that the detection results of YOLOv4 is the best, with mAP of 78%. This paper proves the feasibility and effectiveness of object detection completing the human skin detection in the bathing task.},

  abstract     = {Preferences are fundamental in decision-making, so understanding preference management is key in developing systems that guide the choices of the users. These choices can be decided through argument(s) which are known to have various strengths, as one argument can rely on more certain or vital information than the other. We explored argumentation technique from a previous study, and validated its potentials by applying to it several real-life scenarios. The exploration demonstrates the usefulness of argumentation in handling conflicting preferences and inconsistencies, and provides effective ways to manage, reason and represents users’ preferences. Using argumentation, we provide a practical implementation of a system to manage conflicting situations, and a simple interface that aids the flow of preferences from users to the system. We illustrated using the interface, how the changes in users’ preferences can effect system output in a smart home. This article describes the functionalities of the implemented system, and illustrates the functions by solving some of the complexities in users’ preferences in a real smart home. The system detects potential conflicts, and tries solve them using a redefined precedence order among some preference criteria. We also show how our system is capable of interacting with external sources data. The system was used to access and use live data of a UK supermarket chain store, through their application programming interface (API) and provide users suggestions on their eating habits, based on their set preference(s). The system was used to filter-specific products from the live data, and check the product description, before advising the user accordingly.},

  abstract     = {In image classification and retrieval applications, images are represented by a set of features. These features are extracted from both spatial and wavelet transformed input images. The wavelet transform decomposes images into multiple resolutions by separating smooth and sharp information in individual channels to give more details about the image. Each level of smooth and sharp decomposed channels is individually involved in texture feature extraction. It is difficult to achieve better results in image classification and retrieval applications with fewer discriminant details of the image. Even though each level of the smooth channel correlates with its successive decomposition levels, these feature extraction methods do not consider the relationship between the multiple levels of decomposed images. This motivates the proposed work to extract the correlation between the different levels of wavelet decomposed images. The proposed work (i) encodes the local difference obtained from multiple radii across the different levels of wavelet decomposed channels, (ii) assesses the proposed texture feature extraction method using classification and retrieval experiments with five different wavelet filters over twelve image databases and (iii) analyses the importance of similarity measures involved in the proposed feature-based image retrieval experiments.},

In addition, we used a half-half selection strategy to reduce the time consumption during the iteration procedure. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm could have acceptable performances with reasonable computational time. In addition, two counterpart methods were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm: a simulated annealing method and a random assignment method. The comparative results have also shown that 1) the execution time of the proposed algorithm was significantly less that of the simulated annealing method; 2) the fitness value of the proposed algorithm was significantly less than that of the random assignment method; 3) the fitness value of the proposed algorithm is almost the same as that of the simulated annealing method; 4) the proposed algorithm is stable to repeated executions; 5) the proposed algorithm is still suitable even when the capacities (beds) of rooms are different.},

Considering real time user scenarios, optimal resource allocation in Het-Net while ensuring each user’s minimum required data rate is a challenging task to be performed. Here, we propose a novel algorithm with a well-known and efficient meta-heuristic optimization technique to resolve the aforementioned problem. We use hybrid memory-based dragonfly algorithm with differential evolution (DADE) for its excellent convergence characteristics. Extensive simulations are performed to determine the optimal network utility under the consideration of nonuniform user distribution and fine-tuning their respective service class and contract of association parameters. Simulation results depict that the proposed algorithm improves the overall network utility in terms of radio resource utilization and energy consumption while satisfying the user demands. Comparative analysis of the proposed technique with the other state-of-the-art algorithm depicts the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy and consistency. We also perform optimal multi-RAT cell planning under the above constraints including a network blackout scenario. The algorithm ensures each user coverage by optimally allocating the available resources.},

To detect breast cancer, various imaging modalities can be used, such as mammography. Computer-Aided Detection/Diagnosis (CAD) systems can assist an expert radiologist to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. This paper introduces the findings of a systematic review that seeks to examine the state-of-the-art CAD systems for breast cancer detection. This review is based on 118 publications published in 2018–2021 and retrieved from major scientific publication databases while using a rigorous methodology of a systematic review. We provide a general description and analysis of existing CAD systems that use machine learning methods as well as their current state based on mammogram image modalities and classification methods. This systematic review presents all stages of CAD including pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. We identify research gaps and outline recommendations for future research. This systematic review may be helpful for both clinicians, who use CAD systems for early diagnosis of breast cancer, as well as for researchers to find knowledge gaps and create more contributions for breast cancer diagnostics.},

But most of the applications that involve heavy computations take excess time to process as the dataset gets larger and lead to more power consumption. Hence, among all the factors in sustainable computing that contribute to operartional costs of GPU, power and time management is one of the major challenging issue. This paper presents a methodology to reduce power consumption in GPUs, meanwhile keeping parallel execution of jobs as high as possible. To achieve this, a power and time aware framework is created by integrating TensorFlow library, InterPSS, and Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques. For most of the scientific computing, matrix operations are considered as the fundamental building block. So, the performance, power consumption, and power efficiency of GPU for matrix applications are analyzed under proposed model. Experimental results reveal that proposed methodology substantially reduces peak power of GPUs by 20%, with improved speedup in execution time around 15%.},

Thus, it becomes important for teams to calculate how many runs they should score off every over they face in an innings. The runs a team should score off an over is a function of the difficulty of scoring against the bowler bowling that over, the runs that have already been scored, the target, and the difficulty of scoring runs against the rest of the bowlers. However, the runs that can be scored in an over produces a state space with a branching factor of 37. Such a large state space makes using an uninformed search algorithm impractical. This research proposes the use of the A* algorithm to search the state space to find the number of runs that should be scored off every over during a run chase.},

Moreover, some extra difficulties are presented in the task, such as similarity in terms of color, the intersection of components, the component size, and climate conditions. The failure scenarios have been simulated in a laboratory containing all the structures found in real-world power lines along railways. The laboratory allowed us to build the image dataset containing 708 images with annotations that have been used for training the neural network. Three versions of the Yolo V3 were compared against the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network called Tiny Yolo. Results have shown that Yolo V3 version 2 adequately detects the objects and faults, reaching a precision of 98 % , a recall of 95 % , and a MAP of 96.58 % .},

Obviously, trajectory data sets need efficient and effective analysis and mining processes to infer mobility patterns and consequently constitute rich sources for many contributions such those related to predictions. Most of researches, presented in the literature, focus on tracking and predicting moving object positions, without taking into account their ever-changing contexts and their environmental impacts. Any environment surrounding any object is dynamic vs static and its influence goes beyond current state to the predicted ones. The aim of this paper is not only to propose a new approach to predict the future position of a moving object based on mobility patterns but also it takes into account the ever-evolving contexts and environments of the underlying objects. We experimented our approach on real case study datasets related to hurricanes’ activities. The proposed approach is performed in three phases. The first phase allows the generation of object mobility patterns. In the second phase, spatiotemporal mobility rules are extracted from the previously generated patterns. In the third and last phase, hurricane future position prediction is accomplished by using the extracted rules enhanced by context and environmental characteristics. The proposed model leads to a generic one representing facts and discovering knowledge through various applications including different mobile objects and their associated patterns, environmental and contexts.},

The advancement of technology in the current era makes the data collection process easy. Hence, a large number of customer data can be stored in companies where they can be employed to solve the direct marketing problem. In this paper, a novel Bayesian method titled correlation-augment naïve Bayes (CAN) is proposed to improve the conventional naïve Bayes (NB) classifier. The performance of the proposed method in terms of the response rate is evaluated and compared to several well-known Bayesian networks and other well-known classifiers based on seven real-world datasets from different areas with different characteristics. The experimental results show that the proposed CAN method has a much better performance compared to the other investigated methods for direct marketing in almost all cases.},

The mining industry has become a focal point in the total economic picture of many countries; however, the factors affecting the contribution of the mining sector to the growth of GDP (GDP MS ) have not been investigated in depth yet. In this paper, heuristic approaches were adopted to predict the GDP MS . Therefore, the effect of three parameters, namely, value added of GDP, the value of industrial output per capita and per capita value added on GDP MS , has been investigated. For this purpose, the data of countries that are actively participating in the mining industry was applied to a hybrid intelligent technique and an effective model was proposed. The results showed that a combination of a neuro-fuzzy inference system and a genetic algorithm has relatively the best performance to predict GDP MS . Furthermore, multiple parametric sensitivity analysis was conducted on the output of the model, and the outcomes showed that GDP MS is highly sensitive to all three input parameters; also, per capita value added and value added of GDP have the highest and the least effect on GDP MS , respectively.},

Traditional image enhancement algorithms, such as gamma correction, Histogram Equalization, and multiple-scale Retinex, may result in over enhancement and detail loss, which decreases the detection accuracy of driver assistance systems. In this work, we introduce a low-illumination image enhancement algorithm based on improved Retinex theory and apply it to lane-line detection. A luminance channel optimization method based on a bimodal energy function is adopted to select the weight of the linear combination. A guided filter with edge-preservation is applied to obtain the illumination component of the scene. Furthermore, the reflection component is estimated in a hyperbolic tangent space, and the luminance and contrast are adaptively adjusted to obtain the enhanced image. Experimental results show that proposed method can effectively extract the lane-line edges and suppress the noise in the dark area with low lane-line illumination. Moreover, it can improve the detection success rate of an assisted driving system.},

Thousand deep features are extracted from the fully connected layer of different convolutional neural network models such as AlexNet, GoogleNet and SqueezeNet, and all features are fused together. The distinct features are selected using mutual information (MI), minimum recursive maximal relevance (mRmR) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) based methods. Furthermore, the intersection of selected features is carried out to obtain the prominent deep features, which are examined by heatmap. Finally, the statistical analysis is carried out with consistent and robust feature sets using ANOVA. It is found that 50% of the fused deep features seem to be better with p = . 00001.

This research paper presents and offers a new approach for determining the optimum grid connected PV size, feeding a typical house in Tunisia, as well as the efficient power flow management, in order to improve its profitability, reliability and feasibility under a 20-year study period. A multiobjective function is proposed and formulated to be optimized using two optimization algorithms, which are the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the genetic algorithm (GA). In fact, the objectives consider the economic aspect in terms of maximizing the net present value (NPV) and a non-economic concern, including minimizing the lost of power supply probability (LPSP). Simulation results showed that the PSO algorithm is faster than the GA and presents better performance in terms of speed convergence toward the optimal solution. Then, it proved that a PV system comprising 56 PV modules, 7 batteries and 2 inverters based on maximizing the NPV can sustainably augment its profitability, while a PV system comprising 66 PV modules, 10 batteries and 2 inverters can guarantee its reliability and feasibility, based on minimizing the LPSP.},

In this paper, an algorithm of strip steel defect classification using the improved GAN and EfficientNet was proposed. First, the label deconvolution network is constructed, where the image labels were deconvolved layer by layer to obtain the conditional masks that were superimposed into the generator and discriminator to form Mask-CGAN. Then, the mode-seeking generative adversarial networks (MSGAN) were improved and used to solve the problem of mode collapse. Finally, the EfficientNet was improved and trained on the dataset expanded by Mask-CGAN, which achieved the classification of strip steel defects. Experiments showed that Mask-CGAN proposed in this paper can generate true-to-life images and solve the problem of insufficient samples in deep learning. The improved EfficientNet with fewer parameters can accurately and efficiently classify strip steel defects.},

Performing the analysis of these gases with differential equations by using a computer is very time consuming and requires high computational power for calculation. Using numerical equations for modeling the thermodynamic properties of gasses to eliminate these drawbacks is a more accurate approach and this modeling can be accomplished with artificial intelligence algorithms such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The proper selection of the activation function, which is one of the most important parameters for ANN, directly affects the validity of the model according to the problem and its application. In this study, an adaptive ANN was developed in which the optimal activation function combination was found by using the ABC algorithm and thus the error of the network were reduced when compared to the classical ANN. The improvements of in percentage errors were observed to increase from 7.55% to 76.68%. Finally, the accuracy of the numerical equations that describe the thermodynamic properties of R404a gas was increased.

  abstract     = {The local climate of cities is changing, and one of the primary reasons for this change is rapid urbanization. The Lahore district is situated in the Punjab province of Pakistan and is mainly comprised of Lahore city. This city is among the fastest expanding cities in Pakistan. Due to this rapid urbanization, the natural land surfaces are being altered, harming the local environment and thus causing the urban heat island (UHI) effect. For the analysis of the UHI effect, the fundamental and essential step is assessing the land surface temperature (LST). Therefore, the current investigation assessed LST to evaluate the UHI effect of the Lahore district. This study used the remote sensing data retrieved from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Different new generation algorithms were initially used, but a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was used based on the accuracy. The model was developed by utilizing the past 19 years’ LST values along with elevation, road density (RD), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as input parameters for analyzing and predicting the LST. The LST data of the year 2020 was used for the validation of the outcomes of the CNN model. Among the model predicted LST and observed LST, a high correlation was noticed. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) for the considered two different periods (January and May) were also computed for both the training and validation processes. The prediction error for most parts of the district was within 0.1 K of the observed values. Hence, the formulated CNN model can be utilized as an essential tool for analyzing and predicting LST and thus for the evaluation of the UHI effect at any location.},

  abstract     = {Internet of things network lifetime and energy issues are some of the most important challenges in today’s smart world. Clustering would be an effective solution to this, as all nodes would be arranged into virtual clusters, while one node will serve as the cluster head. The right selection of the cluster head will reduce energy consumption dramatically. This concept is more crucial for the internet of things, which is being widely distributed in environments such as forests or the smart agriculture sector. In this paper, an Energy Efficient Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm (EEMST) is presented to select the optimal cluster head and data routing based on graph theory for a multihop Internet of Things. This algorithm calculates the Euclidean distance-based minimum spanning tree based on a weighted graph. As a result, we use a weighted minimum spanning tree to choose the optimal cluster head and accordingly determine the shortest path for data transmission between member nodes and the cluster head. The proposed EEMST algorithm provides the possibility of intracluster multihop routing and also the possibility of intercluster single-hop routing.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with fuzzy payloads with the aim to minimize two criteria: the travel distance and the fuel consumption. VRP with fuzzy payloads is an NP-hard problem, in which a fleet of vehicles with finite capacity leaves from a central depot empty of goods and has to serve a set of geographically dispersed customers associated with fuzzy payloads. Thus, an optimization approach based on a bi-objective Genetic Algorithm is developed that is integrated with fuzziness. This problem differentiates from the classic VRP, since it also considers the fuel consumption to reduce the energy consumption. The efficiency of the developed method is investigated and discussed through a set of test instances. The experimental results highlight the impact of both criteria on the resulted optimum solution and prove that increasing the uncertainty in customers’ collection quantities results in more costly solutions.},

The study contributed to information technology knowledge management. We introduce a solution for small-scale companies to encrypt their extensive tabular data economically. The experimental results on three large datasets showed that our solution has a processing time between 1.2–5 times faster than the conventional processing time under some specific situations.

This paper reveals the importance of machine learning algorithms to handle the recognition of two different viruses. Therefore, 18,476 protein sequences for both COVID-19 and HIV-1 and 9238 for each virus are applied to the proposed model based on feature extraction, data labeling, and six classifiers. Amino acid classification according to their dipoles and volumes is employed as a feature extraction tool based on the creation of eight features from twenty amino acids by using the conjoint triad (CT) method. The data labeling is employed as a coding tool by binary numbers refereeing zero for COVID-19 and one for HIV-1. The random forest (RF) model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.89% for eight features and 97.80% for two features. The experimental results significantly confirmed that eight features required more computational time than two features, but the accuracy rate was nearly similar in the two cases. This classification strategy of COVID-19 and HIV-1 will prompt the prediction of protein sequences of the new virus.},

The recorded physiological signals were transmitted to an internet connected server where deep learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM based Meltdown/Tantrum Detection System (MTDS) were implemented. The trained deep learning model was capable of detecting abnormal states of meltdown or tantrum through real-time received physiological signals. The proposed MTDS system was trained and tested with deep learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM and hybrid CNN-LSTM, and it was found that hybrid CNN-LSTM was outperformed with an average training and testing accuracy of 96% with low MAE (0.10 for training and 0.04 for testing).

Its translation from lab-based approach to assistive devices demands a problem-centric and cost-effective solution.

For the experimental study, four superficial muscles (viz.

This work is aimed to minimize the number of electrode locations without significantly affecting the classification performance. Channel-set CH2,4 corresponding to the combination of Hallucis Longus and Fibularis Longus muscles is found to be the most optimal. The maximum classification accuracy obtained for the given set with the selected feature-set has been (91.85 ± 3.57)%. The classification performance has been assessed on the basis of parameters such as the type of classifier, window length, data sampling and also the body mass index of the participants.

Due to the proliferation of web services, different service providers are providing similar functionality web services. But these web services can have different values for QoS attributes and transactional properties. Thus, it is difficult to build a transactional and QoS optimal composite web service. Most of the existing works used the scalarization-based method for selecting optimal composite web service. In the scalarization-based method, the service user should have a priori knowledge of its preferences about the nonfunctional requirements of desired solutions. This paper proposes a Multiobjective Discrete Grey Wolf Optimization (MDGWO)-based approach for Transactional and QoS-driven Web Services Composition. The Pareto dominance concept is used to select optimal composite web service. Generational Distance (GD), Inverse Generational Distance (IGD), and Spread measures are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach performs well.},

To this end, we first select the best classifier to conduct the semi-supervised learning by assessing multiple heterogeneous pairs of text vectorization algorithms (such as N-Grams, World2Vec Skip-Gram, AraBert and DistilBert) and machine learning algorithms (such as SVM, CNN and BiLSTM).

Big data analytics is playing a crucial role in extracting patterns that would benefit efficient and effective decision making. Processing this massive volume of data poses several critical issues such as scalability, security and privacy. To preserve data privacy, numerous privacy-preserving data mining and publishing techniques exist. Data anonymization utilizing data mining techniques for preserving an individual’s privacy is a promising approach to prevent the data against identity disclosure. In this paper, a Parallel Clustering based Anonymization Algorithm (PCAA) is proposed, and the results prove that the algorithm is scalable and also achieves a better tradeoff between privacy and utility. The MapReduce framework is used to parallelize the anonymization process for handling a huge volume of data. The algorithm performs well in terms of classification accuracy, F-measure, and Kullback–Leibler divergence metrics. Moreover, the big data generated from heterogeneous data sources are efficiently protected to meet the ever-growing requirements of the application.},

In view of the above dilemma, this paper applies Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) to the construction of small and micro enterprises (SMEs) credit risk model, and proposes a novel training method, namely G-XGBoost, based on the XGBoost model. A few batches of real data are selected to train GAN. When the generative network reaches Nash equilibrium, the network is used to generate pseudo data with the same distribution. The pseudo data is then combined with real data to form an amplified sample set. The amplified sample set is used to train XGBoost for credit risk prediction. The feasibility and advantages of the G-XGBoost model are demonstrated by comparing with the XGBoost model.},

Visual navigation based on image matching has become one of the important research fields for UAV to realize autonomous navigation, because of its low cost, strong anti-jamming ability, and good location result. However, the visual quality of images captured by UAV will be seriously affected by some factors, such as weak illumination conditions or insufficient performance of its sensors. Resolving a series of degradation of low-light images can improve the visual quality and enhance the performance of UAV visual navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional network based on the Retinex theory to solve the degradations of low-light images captured by UAV, which can improve the visual quality of the images and visual matching performance effectively. At the same time, a visual navigation system is designed based on the proposed network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, and effectively improves the performance of the image matching algorithms. The visual navigation system can successfully realize the self-localization of UAV under different illumination conditions. Moreover, we also prove that our method is also effective in other practical tasks (e.g. autonomous driving).},

One way to deal with these uncertain and imprecise observations is by using nonlinear interval regression analysis with neural networks to generate upper and lower limits for individual samples. As a result, a nonlinear interval gray prediction model is constructed by applying the sequences of upper and lower limits to construct GM(1,1) with residual modification separately. By examining the forecasting performance of a nonlinear interval model by the best non-fuzzy performance values, the empirical results obtained based on real energy demand data show that the proposed models perform well compared with other interval gray prediction models. This study has shown the high applicability of the proposed model to energy demand forecasting.},

  abstract     = {Waterbody identification from satellite images in an automated manner is one of the difficult tasks in the domain of Remote Sensing (RS). In recent years, several image processing approaches have been developed to process RGB or multispectral images to analyze the availability of land, water prediction, object detection, climate change, LULC, and many others. In this study, a Multi-data Fusion Network (MDFN) is developed to extract the sources of water by utilizing Sentinel-2 satellite images. The spatial features are extracted by proposed model from RS images by comprising multiple structural learning-assisted feature fusion layers for water resource prediction. To justify the prediction performance, the calculated outcomes of developed solution are correlated with the other approaches such as DeepLabv3+, VGG, NDWI, SegNet, DenseNet, and ResNet. The calculated outcomes define the prediction superiority over the other models by registering the high value of Precision, F1-score, Recall, and IoU with the value of 0.958%, 0.928%, 0.899%, and 0.874%, respectively.},

In this study, we integrate feature selection, instance selection, and decision tree techniques to propose a new approach to predicting credit approval. Experimental results obtained using the survey data show that our proposed approach is superior to the other five traditional machine learning approaches in the measures.

The uniqueness, persistence, universality and robustness of EEG signals against fraud attacks offer potential for highly secure biometric systems. However, more studies are needed to improve collectibility, stability, performance, and acceptability of brain biometrics. EEG signals of healthy subjects were generally used in previous studies. However, adequate studies have not been conducted on subjects who are not mentally healthy. Moreover, EEG signals were usually recorded from healthy subjects at resting, thinking, visual stimulation, and imagery states. In this study, unlike other studies, photic stimuli with EEG data were used for the first time in order to identify both subjects with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and healthy subjects. In the proposed method, power densities of 1–49 Hz frequencies of EEG segments were obtained by applying periodogram power spectral density estimation method using Kaiser Window to raw EEG data. These values were used for training of 1D Convolutional Neural Network deep learning algorithms. Classification success of the proposed method was measured as 97.17%. These results proved that EEG data obtained from subjects by applying photic stimuli can be used in EEG-based identification systems.},

At the same time, pricing of crop depends on various factors including the amount of cultivation, demand of consumers, climate, etc. Hence, the prediction of crop prices is a challenging and important problem. Inspired from this, in this study, we have proposed two additive hybrid methods (Additive-ETS-SVM, Additive-ETS-LSTM) and five multiplicative hybrid methods (Multiplicative-ETS-ANN, Multiplicative-ETS-SVM, Multiplicative-ETS-LSTM, Multiplicative-ARIMA-SVM, Multiplicative-ARIMA-LSTM) to predict the monthly retail and wholesale price of three most commonly used vegetable crops of India, namely, tomato, onion, and potato (TOP). The obtained results are compared with two most promising statistical models, three leading machine learning models and five hybrid methods existing in the literature. Extensive statistical analyses of simulation results considering mean absolute error (MAE), symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE) confirm the superiority of the hybrid methods in predicting the TOP prices.},

It is a challenging task as a consequence of illumination, pose variations, occlusion, complex background, facial expression, and facial makeup. Estimating the age of an individual with an arbitrary pose is quite a challenging job because most of the age estimation system focuses on the frontal view. In this paper, a novel framework for multi-view age estimation by amalgamating the local and global features is proposed. A novel texture feature, Median Gradient Ternary Pattern is proposed in this paper. The Pseudo Zernike Moment extracts the shape features and the View-based Active Appearance Model constructs an appearance model from the facial images. Further, all three features are combined into a feature vector by executing feature-level fusion. The dimension of the combined feature is reduced using Principal Component Analysis. Multi-class Support Vector Machine is utilized to divide the images into four poses. For each pose, a Support Vector Regression with RBF kernel is applied to train a model for estimating the actual age of an individual. The proposed methodology is performed on two databases, namely, FG-NET and CACD which showcase eminent performance.},

In this research, a novel hybrid deep learning architecture for AKI prediction was created using de-identified numeric patient data and ultrasound kidney images. Using data features including serum creatinine among others, two numeric models using MIMIC-III and paired hospital data were developed, and with the hospital ultrasounds, an image-only model was developed. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were used, including VGG and Resnet, and they were made into a hybrid model by concatenating feature maps of both types of models to create a new input. The hybrid model successfully predicted AKI and the highest AUROC of the model was 0.953, the first time an AKI machine learning model surpassed an AUROC of 0.9. The model also achieved an accuracy of 90% and F1-score of 0.91. This model can be implemented into urgent clinical settings such as the ICU and aid doctors by assessing the risk of AKI shortly after the patient’s admission to the ICU.

The timely and accurate crop yield predictions can be of great help for policy makers and farmers in planning and decision making. Generally, statistical models are employed to predict the crop yield which is time consuming and tedious. Emerging trends of deep learning and machine learning has come up as a major breakthrough in the arena. Deep learning models have the inherent ability to perform feature extraction in large dataset thus more suitable for predictions. In this paper, a deep learning-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is employed to predict wheat crop yield of northern region of India. The present study also employed LSTM to unravel the vanishing gradient problem inherent in RNN model. Experiments were conducted using 43 years benchmark dataset and proposed model results were compared with three machine learning models. Evidently, the results obtained from RNN-LSTM model(RMSE: 147.12,MAE: 60.50), Artificial Neural Network(RMSE: 732.14,MAE: 623.13), Random Forest (RMSE: 540.88, MAE: 449.36) and Multivariate Linear Regression (RMSE: 915.64,MAE: 796.07), proved the efficacy of model.

  abstract     = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects a sizable fraction of the population and degrades the quality of life. Levodopamine (L-Dopa) is the first-line treatment drug for PD and remains ubiquitously used. However, the drug response prediction of L-Dopa is still an exigent task and there is an unresolved absence of any substantial biomarkers for a robust prediction of L-Dopa response for a robust prediction of L-Dopa response in Parkinson’s disease. The present study intends to develop a robust prediction model to predict the L-Dopa drug response in PD using machine learning approaches. This work intended to utilize the MJFF Levodopa Response Study data of Parkinson’s subjects with conclusive pre-clinical and clinical assessments for resolving the significantly impending task of drug response prediction. The problem was identified as a classification task which employed four different supervised machine learning classification algorithms for data analysis and predictive learning. The underlying task of predictive classification of drug response classified the responders as “good” and “bad,” based on comprehensive analysis on the selected feature space which identified the participants with an improvement in the symptoms as “good” responders and the ones with degraded or no improvement in the symptoms as “bad” responders. The decision tree’s (classification and regression tree) classification accuracy was 88.89% (area under receiver operating characteristics curve 0.9) for predicting levodopamine response. The presence or absence of the symptoms along with Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and Hoehn and Yahr scale (H and Y) scores were recognized as the most distinguishing feature subset. The research stipulates the required preliminary evidence to the adaptive advancement of decision trees as an illuminating technique that can facilitate the prediction of the drug treatment response for Parkinson’s disorder, however, an extended effort is necessary to provide efficient predictive performance.},

Its detection requires calculating semantic textual similarity, which is an important research area in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Following the literature, deep neural network models have gained satisfactory results in sentence modeling and similarity computing. In this context, a hybrid Siamese neural network architecture is proposed that is composed of the following main components: First, salient features are extracted by applying Global Vectors Representation (GloVe). Then, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) capture and learn the contextual meaning of words due to their outstanding performance that has been achieved in different NLP tasks. Then, the output of CNN is combined with an attention model to distinguish the most important words representing the meaning of the sentence. The similarity score between sentences was subsequently computed by applying the cosine measure. Experiments were carried out on a proposed Arabic paraphrased corpus using the Open-Source Arabic Corpora (OSAC). To validate its quality, the SemEval benchmark is used.},

  abstract     = {Steel pipes are widely used in high-risk and high-pressure scenarios such as oil, chemical, natural gas, shale gas, etc. If there is some defect in steel pipes, it will lead to serious adverse consequences. Applying object detection in the field of deep learning to pipe weld defect detection and identification can effectively improve inspection efficiency and promote the development of industrial automation. Most predecessors used traditional computer vision methods applied to detect defects of steel pipe weld seams. However, traditional computer vision methods rely on prior knowledge and can only detect defects with a single feature, so it is difficult to complete the task of multi-defect classification, while deep learning is end-to-end. In this paper, the state-of-the-art single-stage object detection algorithm YOLOv5 is proposed to be applied to the field of steel pipe weld defect detection and compared with the two-stage representative object detection algorithm Faster R-CNN. The experimental results show that applying YOLOv5 to steel pipe weld defect detection can greatly improve the accuracy, complete the multi-classification task, and meet the criteria of real-time detection.},

  abstract     = {Finding the best structure of ANN to minimize errors, the processing and the search time is one of the main objectives in the AI field. In order to achieve prediction with a high degree of accuracy in a short time, an enhanced PSO-based selection technique to determine the optimal configuration for the artificial neural network has been proposed in this paper. To design the neural network to minimize processing time, search time and maximize the accuracy of prediction, it is necessary to identify hyperparameter values with precision. PSO with 2-D search space has been employed to select the best hyperparameters in order to construct the best neural network where PSO is used as a decision-making model and ANN is used as a learning model. The suggested technique was used to select the optimal number of the hidden layer and the number of units per hidden layer. The proposed technique was evaluated using a chemical dataset. The result of testing the proposed technique displayed high prediction accuracy with MSE equal to 3.9% and the relative error between the expected output and actual target is less than 1.6%. The results of the comparison of the proposed technique with the ANN showed thatthe proposed approach could predict output with an infinitesimal error, outperforming the existing ANN model in terms of error ratio.},

  abstract     = {One of the challenges of training artificial intelligence models for classifying satellite images is the presence of label noise in the datasets that are sometimes crowd-source labeled and as a result, somewhat error prone. In our work, we have utilized three labeled satellite image datasets namely, SAT-6, SAT-4, and EuroSAT. The combined dataset consists of over 900,000 image patches that belong to a land cover class. We have applied some standard pixel-based feature extraction algorithms to extract features from the images and then trained those features with various machine learning algorithms. In our experiment, three types of artificial label noises are injected – Noise Completely at Random (NCAR), Noise at Random (NAR) and Noise Not at Random (NNAR) to the training datasets. The noisy data are used to train the algorithms, and the effect of noise on the algorithm performance are compared with noise-free test sets. From our study, the Random Forest and the Back-propagation Neural Network classifiers are found to be the least sensitive to label noises. As label noise is a common scenario in human-labeled image datasets, the current research initiative will help the development of noise robust classification methods for various relevant applications.},

  abstract     = {One of the most challenging aspects of the emergent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been the need for massive diagnostic tests to detect and track infection rates at the population level. Current tests such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction can be low-throughput and labor intensive. An ultra-fast and accurate mode of detecting COVID-19 infection is crucial for healthcare workers to make informed decisions in fast-paced clinical settings. The high-dimensional, feature-rich components of Raman spectra and validated predictive power for identifying human disease, cancer, as well as bacterial and viral infections pose the potential to train a supervised classification machine learning algorithm on Raman spectra of patient serum samples to detect COVID-19 infection. We developed a novel stacked subsemble classifier model coupled with an iteratively validated and automated feature selection and engineering workflow to predict COVID-19 infection status from Raman spectra of 250 human serum samples, with a 10-fold cross-validated classification accuracy of 98.0% (98.6% precision and 98.5% recall). Furthermore, we benchmarked nine machine learning and artificial neural network models when evaluated using eight standalone performance metrics to assess whether ensemble methods offered any improvement from baseline machine learning models. Using a rank-normalized scores derived from the performance metrics, the stacked subsemble model ranked higher than the Multi-layer Perceptron, which in turn ranked higher than the eight other machine learning models. This study serves as a proof of concept that stacked ensemble machine learning models are a powerful predictive tool for COVID-19 diagnostics.},

Therefore, the tasks related to improving their accuracy and the convenience of forming various dependencies between the values on which the accuracy of flow rate measurement depends are very important. One of the main characteristics that determines the correct and accurate operation of differential pressure flowmeters is the discharge coefficient. In this paper, the authors present a methodology that allows us to present this coefficient as a fuzzy model. The paper presents an original method for modeling the existing discharge coefficient in the form of a fuzzy model that is able to change the existing classical equation. A comparative analysis of the fuzzy and classical models is performed for this discharge coefficient. The article analyzes the errors of the fuzzy model for the discharge coefficient, discusses ways how to reduce the error of the fuzzy model. The proposed methodology describes the application of the fuzzy model for this coefficient within the existing limits for the Reynolds number and diameter ratio. It is shown that for a more accurate approximation of the characteristics, it is necessary to add more fuzzy sets. The present method is feasible for diameter ratio 0 , 2 ≤ β ≤ 0 , 75 and Reynolds number greater than 5000. The article also discusses the possibilities of using fuzzy models to improve the characteristics of differential pressure flow meters.},

The results show that Mask RCNN achieved a mean Average Precision of 85.67%, while the U-Net model achieved an Intersection over Union of 78.60% and Dice coefficient of 82.86%. Both models can precisely generate segmentations indicating the exact spots/areas infested by T. absoluta in tomato leaves.

The drawbacks of GD are: 1) a local search, which may lead the algorithm toward a local optima and 2) a challenging estimation of quality of the final solution in solving most of the problems. In this paper, for the first issue, a population-based great deluge (popGD) algorithm with additional recurrence operation is proposed. This operation is an imitation of no progress of hill climber after a long time; the climber tries to move small steps even downward in hope of finding better way to climb. For the second problem, a technique with an automate alteration of the Level is proposed. The statistical analysis of the results from 25 test functions and 18 benchmark feature selection problems supports the ability of the method.

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely affecting our lives in many ways for the last ten years. Potential applications of AI are currently being used in many sectors. However, the usage of AI has been very limited in sports science compared to the other sectors. In this study, we developed an artificial neural network model to estimate the market values of the players in the Turkish Super Football League. While the market value was selected as an output, the input values were: minutes played; goals scored; xG: assists; xA; defensive duels won %; tackle success %; shots on target %; Short-middle pass accuracy %; long pass accuracy %; and accuracy of passes to penalty area. After creating a neural network based on the input-output values with high training, validation and testing statistical values, input values were computed with the neural network created and then the output values were estimated. In conclusion, an artificial neural network is becoming one of the important modeling methods in all areas of life. Although the application of artificial neural networks is very limited in sports science, it is one of the suitable science disciplines where there is a lot of statistical data. The methodology proposed in this paper can also be used for talent selection in football. Moreover, it may help stop criticism by TV sports programmes and newspapers because market value estimation is based on fair performance parameters. Further studies are strongly recommended, not only for football but also for other sports disciplines.},

  abstract     = {Efforts to raise the bar of higher education so as to respond to dynamic societal/industry needs have led to a number of initiatives, including artificial neural network (ANN) based educational data mining (EDM) inclusive. With ANN-based EDM, humongous amount of student data in higher institutions could be harnessed for informed academic advisory that promotes adaptive learning for purposes of student retention, student progression, and cost saving. Mining students’ data optimally requires predictive data mining tool and machine learning technique like ANN. However, despite acknowledging the capability of ANN-based EDM for efficiently classifying students’ learning behavior and accurately predicting students’ performance, the concept has received less than commensurate attention in the literature. This seems to suggest that there are gaps and challenges confronting ANN-based EDM in higher education. In this study, we used the systematic literature review technique to gauge the pulse of researchers from the viewpoint of modeling, learning procedure, and cost function optimization using research studies. We aim to unearth the gaps and challenges with a view to offering research direction to upcoming researchers that want to make invaluable contributions to this relatively new field. We analyzed 190 studies conducted in 2010–2018. Our findings reveal that hardware challenges, training challenges, theoretical challenges, and quality concerns are the bane of ANN-based EDM in higher education and offer windows of opportunities for further research. We are optimistic that advances in research along this direction will make ANN-based EDM in higher education more visible and relevant in the quest for higher education-driven sustainable development.},

  abstract     = {Sign language is a physical language that enables people with disabilities to communicate using hand and facial gestures. For this reason, it is very important for people with disabilities to express themselves freely in society and to make the sign language understandable to everyone. In this study, the data set was created by taking 10223 images for 29 letters in the Turkish Sign Language Alphabet. Images are made suitable for education by using image enhancement techniques. In the final stage of the study, classification processes on images were carried out by using CapsNet, AlexNet and ResNet-50, DenseNet, VGG16, Xception, InceptionV3, NasNet, EfficentNet, Hitnet, Squeezenet architectures and TSLNet, which was designed for the study. When the deep learning models were examined, it was found that CapsNet and TSLNet models were the most successful models with 99.7% and 99.6% accuracy rates, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The Quran and the Sunnah are the two principal elements of the Islamic religion, and the hadith is an interpreter of the Quran. Hadith is everything that the Messenger Muhammad said, whether it was a word, an action, or a good adjective of the Prophet. Given the status of the hadith of Muslims everywhere in the world, digging into it is the m ain perspective to evoke the guiding principles and institutions that Muslims must follow. The mining of the hadith has received much attention in recent times, but so far, the work has not been fully implemented. This study focuses on predicting the semantic categories of the unclassified hadith text based on its text. The model can distinguish between several categories to predict the optimal one such as ablution, fasting, Hajj, and Zakat. To achieve this goal, a Knowledge-Graphic (KG) prediction model was developed to improve machine learning classifiers from the standpoint of two unique traits. 1) Define pivotal terms that have high values. II) Taking into account all the paths of those pivotal terms through their convergence with the categories in the Knowledge-Graphic of all the paths that link them. We rely on six books with more than 30,000 hadith and 120 classifications. Empirically, we found optimistic results in combining the KG model and machine learning classifiers.},

These descriptors are utilized as the dataset in this study. However, a large number of descriptors may cause performance degradation in the classifier. To complement this issue, this research applies three swarm algorithms with k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier in the wrapper feature selection technique to ensure only relevant descriptors are selected for the ATS drug classification task. For this purpose, the binary version of swarm algorithms facilitated with the S-shaped or sigmoid transfer function known as binary whale optimization algorithm (BWOA), binary particle swarm optimization algorithm (BPSO), and new binary manta-ray foraging optimization algorithm (BMRFO) are developed for feature selection. Their performance is evaluated and compared based on seven performance criteria. Furthermore, the optimal feature subset was then evaluated with seven different classifiers. Findings from this study have revealed the dominance of BWOA by obtaining the highest classification accuracy with the small feature size.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a Semi-Supervised Deep Learning approach for anomaly detection of Wind Turbine generators based on vibration signals. The proposed solution is integrated into an IoT Platform as a real-time Workflow. The Workflow is responsible for the whole detection process when a new sample is inserted in the IoT Platform, performing data gathering, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. The chosen Semi-Supervised Deep Learning model is a DAE, which builds a normality model using healthy data. The classification consists of comparing the reconstruction error for the computed entry with a normality threshold. The normality threshold is selected through an F1-Score analysis of the reconstruction errors over labeled data. Finally, the Workflow can produce notifications to the users whenever unhealthy behavior is noticed. The ability of the proposed mechanism to detect abnormal behavior in wind turbines on an IoT Platform is evaluated using a case study of real-world healthy and unhealthy data from a Wind Turbine. The solution was able to correctly classify every unhealthy sample and presented a low false-positive rate. Moreover, Workflow results can be improved by conditioning alarm triggering with a windowed-based anomaly accumulation.},

The prediction target of the model is the stock close price direction on the next day. To predict the trend of one stock, the feature of recent trading information is generated from the raw intra-day data through a pre-trained DBN. Then the extracted features are fed into an LSTM classifier to produce the prediction result for the next day. The proposed model was tested on 36 companies in the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE), which were selected based on their weights in Chinese A-shares. The experiments cover a span of 12 years, from 2005 to 2016, and the results show that the proposed model offers notable improvements in predicting performance comparing with other learning models. It is also observed that some companies are more predictable than others, which implies that the proposed model can be used for financial portfolio construction.},

Machine Learning, Data Mining and Data Imputation models are utilized a part of solving these challenges, respectively. Toward this direction, we focus on the development of a complete methodology for the ATHLOS Project – funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program, which aims to achieve a better interpretation of the impact of aging on health. The inherent complexity of the provided dataset lies in the fact that the project includes 15 independent European and international longitudinal studies of aging. In this work, we mainly focus on the HealthStatus (HS) score, an index that estimates the human status of health, aiming to examine the effect of various data imputation models to the prediction power of classification and regression models. Our results are promising, indicating the critical importance of data imputation in enhancing preventive medicine’s crucial role.},

Compared to the prevalant street cameras, however, RWIS are sometimes limited in availability. Thus, extraction of road conditions data by computer vision can provide a complementary observational data source if it can be done quickly and on large scales. In this paper, we leverage state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) in labeling images taken by street and highway cameras located across North America. The final training set included 47,000 images labeled with five classes: dry, wet, snow/ice, poor, and offline. The experiments tested different configurations of six CNNs. The EfficientNet-B4 framework was found to be most suitable to this problem, achieving validation accuracy of 90.6%, although EfficientNet-B0 achieved an accuracy of 90.3% with half the execution time. The classified images were then used to construct a map showing real-time road conditions at various camera locations. The proposed approach is presented in three parts: i) application pipeline, ii) description of the deep learning frameworks, iii) the dataset labeling process and the classification metrics.},

Recently, deep learning techniques have shown significant prediction improvements over traditional models, but some difficulties and open questions remain around their applicability, accuracy, and ability to provide practical information.

The cameras are able to cover the entire view around the vehicle with overlapping areas between neighboring cameras. We use a morphing approach for joint lens and perspective correction of each view. For stitching frames from different cameras, we assume a fixed geometry which permits off-line calculation of frame transformations, thereby reducing the real-time processing load. To further reduce computational complexity, we employ lookup-tables in the view morphing and blending phases. The Vision P5 core combines the four frames with XGA resolution into a single XGA surround view at 30FPS.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a novel approach in post-earthquake structural damage estimation is investigated. The approach is formulated as a problem of both damage approximation and localization. The inter-story drift ratio and the global damage index of Park/Ang (DI G,PA ) are the estimated damage indicators for each floor of the structure. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), random forests (RFs), support vector machines (SVMs) with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) are tested to predict the seismic damage state of each floor of an 8-storey reinforced concrete (r/c) building subjected to 155 natural and artificially generated seismic accelerograms. The damage potential of the accelerograms is described by three seismic parameters extracted from the response of the structure. The set of seismic accelerograms is defined by combining two outlier detection techniques, isolation forests and Z-score, while the set of seismic parameters is confirmed by minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm. Optimization methods are used to fine-tune the performance of all networks. Results indicate RFs and ANNs among the models with optimal performances, reaching average correct classification rates of up to 96.87% and 91.87% with RFs, and 96.25% and 90.12% with ANNs, for DI G,PA and ISDR, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes symptoms such as inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It is considered as an important public health issue, and prevalence of diagnosis has increased as awareness of the disease grew over the past years. Supply of specialist medical experts has not kept pace with the increasing demand for assessment, both due to financial pressures on health systems and the difficulty to train new experts, resulting in growing waiting lists. Patients are not being treated quickly enough causing problems in other areas of health systems (e.g. increased GP visits, increased risk of self-harm and accidents) and more broadly (e.g. time off work, relationship problems). Advances in machine learning make it possible to attempt to diagnose ADHD based on the analysis of relevant data, and this could inform clinical practice. This paper reports on findings related to the mental health services of a specialist Trust within the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). The analysis studied data of adult patients who underwent diagnosis over the past few years, and developed a diagnostic model for ADHD in adults. The results demonstrate that it is indeed possible to correctly diagnose ADHD patients with promising statistical accuracy.},

Those areas include experimental biology, food and water industries, pathology, microbiology, and evolutionary studies. Although there exist methodologies for identification, a transition to a whole-genome sequence-based taxonomy is already undergoing. Next-Generation Sequencing helps the transition by producing DNA sequence data efficiently. However, the rate of DNA sequence data generation and the high dimensionality of such data need faster computer methodologies. Machine learning, an area of artificial intelligence, has the ability to analyze high dimensional data in a systematic, fast, and efficient way. Therefore, we propose a sequential deep learning model for bacteria identification. The proposed neural network exploits the vast amounts of information generated by Next-Generation Sequencing, in order to extract an identification model for whole-genome bacteria sequences. After validating the identification model, the bidirectional recurrent neural network outperformed other classification approaches.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of future wind speed is important for wind energy integration into the power grid. Wind speeds are usually measured and predicted at lower heights, while modern wind turbines have hub heights of about 80–120 m. As per understanding, this is first attempt to analyze predictability of wind speed with height. To achieve this, wind data was collected using Laser Illuminated Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system at 10 m, 20 m, 40 m, 90 m, 120 m, 200 m, 250 m and 300 m heights. The collected data is used for training and testing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for hourly wind speed prediction for each of the future 12 hours, using 48 previous hourly values. Careful analyses of short term wind speed prediction at different heights and future hours show that wind speed is predicted more accurately at higher heights. For example, the mean absolute percent error decreases from 0.25 to 0.12 corresponding to heights 10 to 300 m, respectively for the 6th future hour prediction, an improvement of around 50%. The performance of ANN method is compared with hybrid genetic algorithm and ANN method namely GANN. Results showed that GANN outperformed ANN for most of the heights for prediction of wind speed at the future 6th hour. Results are also confirmed on another data set and other methods.},

However, there is a problem that it is difficult for a person to understand what exactly the trained knowledge of an artificial neural network. As one of the methods for solving the problem of the artificial neural network, rule extraction methods had been devised. In this study, rules are extracted from artificial neural networks using ordered-attribute search (OAS) algorithm, which is one of the methods of extracting rules from trained neural networks, and the rules are analyzed to improve the extracted rules. As a result, we found that when the output value of the hidden layer has an intermediate value that is not close to 0 or 1 after passing through the sigmoid function, the problem of rule uncertainty occurs and affects the accuracy of the rules. In order to solve the uncertainty problem of the rules, we applied the hidden unit clarification method and suggested that it is possible to extract the efficient rule by binarizing the hidden layer output value. In addition, we extracted CDRPs (critical data routing paths) from the trained neural networks and used CDRPs to prune the extracted rules, which showed that the uncertainty problem of rules can be improved.},

  abstract     = {The electromechanical design of the HDD (Hard Disk Drive) renders it more susceptible to failures than other components of the computer system. The failure of HDD leads to permanent data loss, which is typically more expensive than HDD itself. The SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) system warns the user if any HDD parameter has exceeded the predefined threshold value needed for safe HDD operation. Machine learning methods take advantage of dependence between multiple SMART parameters in order to make failure prediction more precise. In this paper, we present a failure prediction model based on the anomaly detection method involving an adjustable decision boundary. SMART parameters are ranked by the importance and the 13 most significant ones are used as the initial feature set in our model. In the following stage, we optimized the feature set by removing those that have no major contribution to the anomaly detection model, forming the final feature set comprising seven features only. The proposed anomaly detection model achieved 96.11% failure detection rate on average, with 0% false detection rate in ten random tests. The proposed model predicted more than 80% of failures 24 hours before their actual occurrence, which enables timely data backup.},

UAVs localization is a significant part of an anti-UAV system. In this paper, a remolded acoustic energy decay model preserved relative in acoustic energy attenuation inverse of distance square is used to generate training data. Multilayer perceptron(MLP) is the model to train these data and predicts accurate relative 3D space coordinates. Four different UAV flight trajectories are simulated. We also test robustness against noise with different levels. Simulation experiment results show that the deviation is less than 1.48 m in specific distances and noise levels, even with higher noise levels the deviation can still be accepted. The problem of limited detection range is overcome by the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with more sensors. Long and short-term memory (LSTM) is investigated, but it doesn’t outperform MLP in accuracy and processing time.},

The personalized list suggested by a suitable recommendation system should contain items highly relevant to the user. However, many a times, the traditional recommendation systems do not have enough data about the user or its peers because the model faces the cold-start problem.

The soldier detection is achieved by training a convolutional neural network to learn the patterns of the soldier’s uniforms. Our CNN learns from the initial dataset and from the actions taken by the operator, as opposed to the old-fashioned and hard-coded image processing algorithms. Our system attains an accuracy of over 81% in distinguishing the specific soldier uniform and the background. These experimental results prove our hypothesis that dilated convolutions can increase the segmentation performance when compared with patch-based, and fully connected networks.},

  abstract     = {Recently developed Beetle Antennae Search algorithm (BAS) mimics the odor sensing mechanism of the longhorn beetles. The beetles have many species and many of these are advantageous to the nature as well as the mankind. Excepting the odor sensing activity, the beetles are naturally strong insects, and some of them have storage memory for adaptive learning and showcase social behavior. These natural mechanisms make them intelligent enough to perform the routine tasks for existence. This article proposes a novel Storage (Memory) Adaptive Collaborative BAS (SACBAS) algorithm, which incorporates the memory stored adaptive learning. This helps exploit the Group Extreme Value (GEV) instead of the Individual Extreme Values in swarm for faster convergence. Further, the SACBAS uses the reference points based on non-dominated sorting to diversify the state space. To test the data-driven performance of SACBAS, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with linear kernel is used in this study. First, the SACBAS algorithm is tested on the multi-objective ZDT and DTLZ test-suites and compared with two recent techniques, the reference points based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA III) and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). Second, the data-driven SACBAS is tested with real-world cases based on offline data. The proposed SACBAS is shown to handle the offline data efficiently and obtains promising results. The Friedman Test is carried out to differentiate the SACBAS from other two techniques and the Post Hoc Test confirms that the SACBAS obtains better HyperVolume indicator scores and outperforms the NSGA III and MOEA/D.},

  abstract     = {The transition to non-fossil fuels brings with its basic challenges in battery technologies. Due to their efficiency, one of the areas where Li-ion batteries are widely used is electric vehicles (EVs). Range estimation is one of the most important needs in a battery-powered electric vehicle (BEV). The range of BEVs directly depends on battery capacity and powertrain efficiency. Although the electrical performance of Li-ion batteries has significantly improved, it is still not possible to overcome their capacity degradation with aging. State of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH) are two important measures for a battery. With accurate SoC and SoH estimates, a battery management system can prevent each cell in the battery pack from over-charging or over-discharging, and prolongs the life of the entire pack. The novel idea in this study is to estimate SoH with the data collected during the battery charging process. The most needed moment for SoH is the end of the charging process. With this information, the user can plan the job that the battery will be used with. In order to meet this need, a specially designed deep neural network (stacked LSTM) is trained and tested using measurements only from constant current charging phase of quick charge process. The test results show that this method is effectively applicable to quick chargers.},

Various parameters used to compare and analyze the results of different developed classifiers are accuracy score, percentage accuracy score, confusion matrix, heatmap, and classification report.

In this study, the values belonging to stealing the ball, number of passes (pass on target, forward pass, and pass before goal scoring), number of possessions during the match, attack time resulting in the goal scoring and number of shots in 1140 competitions played in 2015/2016, 2016/2017, and 2017/2018 England Premier League seasons have been evaluated. Season ranking in the 2017/2018 season has been estimated by analyzing the data in the first two seasons (2015/2016, 2016/2017). All data have been separated randomly for training and test. League ranking has been modeled numerically as 0 and 1. Because the generated value is between 0 and 1, the league ranking has been obtained by multiplying this value by 100 for a trained network. Thanks to the ANN model developed by training and testing according to the findings, the training, validation, test, and all regression values of the English Premier League have been obtained as 0.99779, 0.98123, 0.96981, and 0.98769, respectively. With respect to this result, it has been seen that number of shot, stealing the ball, attack time, and number of possessions parameters are determinant in team ranking at the end of the season along with the other parameters in the England Premier League. We think that analyzing matches with the ANN model provides fast and objective results for team managers, trainers, athletes, and betting shops.},

As a result, having a comprehensive insight into the project conditions in the early phases of the work is a vital issue.

To this end, four machine learning models and one artificial neural network (ANN) are selected and their results are compared to assess their capabilities in energy performance estimation. This study investigates the influence of the exterior louver design on the interior energy performance of a structure. A specific dataset is generated and tested on four powerful regression models (i.e., polynomial Linear Regression, Random Forests (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)) and one Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

While the first information can be easily obtained through interviews, the second one is quite hard to get. This motivates the investigation of methods and tools to address this problem. In such a context, the main contributions of this paper are the following. First, we show how KPIs can be effectively defined using linear constraints . Second, we show how the problem of computing the actions that the SaR system proposes to the manager can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. Third, we show how KPI weights can be computed from previous managing decisions by solving a suitable MILP problem.

The reason is to find out the likewise user with the assumption that if users have shared similar interest in the past then they may share the same in future. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the widely used recommendation algorithm due to its ease of use but suffers with the problems of sparsity and cold start problem. In this paper, we propose a trust and distrust-based cross domain context aware recommender system in the multi-agent environment which tries to reduce the problem of data sparsity in collaborative-filtering recommender system and improves coverage. Cross Domain Recommender System (CDRS) utilizes data from multiple domains to reduce the problem of sparsity. Moreover, the combination of trust and distrust in recommendation help to improve trustworthiness of generated recommendation. Distrust provides higher accuracy in recommendation by incorporating knowledge about the malicious users. Prototype of the system is developed using JADE and Java technology for the tourism domain consisting of restaurant, hotel, travel places and shopping places as sub-domains. The performance of the proposed trust and distrust-based cross domain recommender system is compared with the traditional approach of recommendation along with the cross domain approach and trust-based cross-domain approach in terms of accuracy and coverage. The results show that the proposed system outperforms in terms of both accuracy and coverage.},

Intentionally, the feature selection can be an imperative preprocessing step before the classification stage. Equilibrium optimizer (EO) is a recently established metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the principle of dynamic source and sink models when measuring the equilibrium states. In this research, a new variant of EO called general learning equilibrium optimizer (GLEO) is proposed as a wrapper feature selection method. This approach adopts a general learning strategy to help the particles to evade the local areas and improve the capability of finding promising regions. The proposed GLEO aims to identify a subset of informative biological features among a large number of attributes. The performance of the GLEO algorithm is validated on 16 biological datasets, where nine of them represent high dimensionality with a smaller number of instances. The results obtained show the excellent performance of GLEO in terms of fitness value, accuracy, and feature size in comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms.},

The PPSOGSA’s performance is analyzed and evaluated using the standard IEEE 30-bus radial distribution test system. The optimal solutions are obtained based on the following three optimization criteria: minimization of total active power losses, minimization of the voltage deviation, and a simultaneous minimization of total active power losses and voltage deviation. The voltage total harmonic distortion levels (THDv) are estimated using the decoupled harmonic power flow (DHPF) algorithm. Simulation results, obtained using the proposed PPSOGSA-based approach, are compared with those obtained using the other optimization algorithms such as PSO, PPSO, GSA, and PSOGSA. It is shown that the PPSOGSA-based approach has better performance in comparison to the other optimization techniques.},

  abstract     = {Ovarian cancer stands in the sixth position among the most commonly occurring cancers in the world. Because of the high rate of recurrence, this gynecological malignancy seems to be a vital reason behind cancer-related death among women as tumor recurrence stands as an obstacle in ovarian cancer treatment. It is crucial to find those recurrence causing factors in order to plan suitable therapies with high prognostic results. Hence, in this work, a multistage feature selection methodology is proposed to identify key MiRNAs and clinical features for improving the accuracy of ovarian cancer recurrence prediction. MiRNA expression profiles of ovarian cancer patients and their corresponding clinical data were downloaded from the TCGA cancer repository. From 588 MiRNAs, 6 key MiRNAs were selected using the Inheritable Bi-objective Combinatorial Genetic Algorithm (IBCGA) followed by factor analysis. The biological importance of the resultant MiRNAs in cancer and cellular pathways were studied using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Further, recurrence prediction was performed using the obtained MiRNA expression profiles and clinical factors, chosen using correlation analysis. The proposed approach using the selected features yielded a prediction accuracy of 91.86% using the XGBoost classifier while the same without feature selection was 76.59%. Compared to previous similar works, this model provides a better result in terms of accuracy and reveals influential MiRNAs in ovarian cancer.},

The main purpose is to develop a text normalizer that automatically converts proper nouns and other context-specific formatting of the transcription such as dates, time, and numbers into their appropriate expressions. To this end, we propose a solution that exploits deep neural networks with rich features followed by manually designed rules to recognize and then convert these text sequences. We also introduce a new corpus of 13 K spoken sentences to facilitate the process of the text normalization. The experimental results on this corpus are quite promising. The proposed method yields 90.67% in the F1 score in recognizing sequences of texts that need converting. We hope that this initial work will inspire other follow-up research on this important but unexplored problem.},

  abstract     = {Sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) has found a widespread application in various engineering optimization problems. However, SCA suffers from premature convergence and insufficient exploitation. Cylindricity error evaluation is a typical engineering optimization problem related to the quality of cylindrical parts. A hybrid greedy sine-cosine algorithm with differential evolution (HGSCADE) is developed in this paper to solve optimization problems and evaluate cylindricity error. HGSCADE integrates the SCA with the opposition-based population initialization, the greedy search, the differential evolution (DE), the success history-based parameter adaptation, and the Levy flight-based local search. HGSCADE is tested on the CEC2014 benchmark functions and is employed in cylindricity error evaluation. The results show the superiority of HGSCADE to other state-of-the-art algorithms for the benchmark functions and cylindricity error evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Detecting the appropriate usage of a piece of land is known as Land Usage Mining. The key resource to detect the Land Usages is aerial Images. The advancement in technology in form of satellites, drones, unmanned aerial vehicles do capture the tons of wide land cover images. Aerial images are used for various purposes alias getting an overview to put up the settlement by making construction, extracting mineral deposits, disaster mitigation planning, disaster recovery, and surveillance. Automated land usage identification with help of modern machine learning algorithms may be a great boon to mankind. Different feature extraction methods are being explored to represent aerial image content in the signature form, these features are mainly taken as a global or local content description of the image. Feature Level Fusion of both the global and the local content description features may give a more accurate capability for identification of land usage. The paper proposes feature level fusion of global features extracted using Thepade’s Sorted Block Truncation Coding (Thepade SBTC) and local features extracted using Sauvola Thresholding for land usage identification. Consideration of more than one Machine Learning classifiers as an ensemble has proven better than individual Machine Learning classifiers. Thepade SBTC is explored in aerial image feature extraction with nine variations as TSBTC 2-ary, TSBTC 3-ary, TSBTC 4-ary, TSBTC 5-ary, TSBTC 6-ary, TSBTC 7-ary, TSBTC 8-ary, TSBTC 9-ary, and TSBTC 10-ary. The experimentation is done on UC Land Merced Dataset having 2100 images spread across 21 land usage types. Here the land usage identification accuracy, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and F Measure have shown better performance in TSBTC 10-ary global feature extraction method. Further, the TSBTC 10-ary global features are concatenated with Sauvola thresholding-based local features for feature level fusion, which show the performance improvement of the proposed land usage identification technique. Also, the ensembles of machine learning algorithms are deployed for performance assessment along with the individual nine machine learning algorithms for the proposed land usage identification technique. The majority voting-based ensemble of ‘IB1+ Random Forest+ Simple Logistic+ SMO+ KStar’ has resulted in better accuracy of land usage identification.},

The paper begins with an updated review on the impact of air mobility in infectious disease progression, followed by the adoption of complex networks based on semi-supervised statistical learning. The model can be used to (1) determine the early identification of infectious disease spread via air travel and (2) align the need to keep the economy working with open connections and the different dynamic of national pandemic curves. The approach takes advantage of open data and machine self-supervised statistical learning to develop knowledge networks visualization. Test cases using Hong Kong and Wuhan aerial mobility are discussed in the decisions to (1) restrict and (2) increase mobility.

  abstract     = {Palm oil is a major contributor to Malaysia’s GDP in the agriculture sector. The sheer vastness of oil palm plantations requires a huge effort to administer. An oil palm plantation in regards to the irrigation process, fertilization, and planning for planting new trees require an audit process to correctly count the oil palm trees. Currently, the audit is done manually using aerial view images. Therefore, an effective and efficient method is imperative. This paper proposes a new automatic end-to-end method based on deep learning (DL) for detection and counting oil palm trees from images obtained from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drone. The acquired images were first cropped and sampled into small size of sub-images, which were divided into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. A DL algorithm based on Faster-RCNN was employed to build the model, extracts features from the images and identifies the oil palm trees, and gives information on the respective locations. The model was then trained and used to detect individual oil palm tree based on data from the testing set. The overall accuracy of oil palm tree detection was measured from three different sites with 97.06%, 96.58%, and 97.79% correct oil palm detection. The results show that the proposed method is more effective, accurate detection, and correctly counts the number of oil palm trees from the UAV images.},
