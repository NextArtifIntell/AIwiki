  abstract     = {In this paper, we proposed two different methods for solving pseudomonotone and strongly pseudomonotone equilibrium problems. We can examine these methods as an extension and improvement of the Popov&#39;s extragradient method. We replaced the second minimization problem onto a closed convex set in the Popov&#39;s extragradient method, with a half-space minimization problem that is updated on each iteration and also formulates a useful method for determining the appropriate stepsize on each iteration. The weak convergence theorem of the first method and strong convergence theorem for the second method is well-established based on a standard assumption on a cost bifunction. We also consider various numerical examples to support our well-established convergence results, and we can see that the proposed methods depict a significant improvement in terms of the number of iterations and execution time.},

These two insurers are allowed to purchase proportional reinsurance to mitigate individual claim risks; and can invest in one risk-free asset and one risky asset whose price dynamics follows the constant elasticity of variance model. The main objective of each insurer is to maximizing the mean-variance utility of his relative terminal wealth with respect to that of his competitor. Applying the techniques of stochastic control theory, we derive the Nash equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies explicitly and present the corresponding verification theorem. Furthermore, Nash equilibrium strategies and value functions are also provided under the diffusion approximation model. Finally, we perform some numerical examples to illustrate the influence of model parameters on the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies and draw some economic interpretations from these results.},

  abstract     = {Time-delays are often involved in modelling biological processes, which arise more difficulties for the control task. In fact, once the control goal is given, a constrained optimal control problem can be formulated to describe the biological control mission. However, it’s almost impossible to obtain analytical solutions for such complicated problems, especially for those with high nonlinearity and complex constraints. In this paper, a symplectic pseudospectral method for solving nonlinear optimal control problems of constrained stated-delayed system is developed. The original nonlinear problem is transformed into a series of linear-quadratic optimal control problems by the successive convexification technique at the first implementation. By applying the local Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto pseudospectral method and the parametric variational principle, each of the transformed linear-quadratic problems is converted into a standard linear complementarity problem which can be solved easily by the Lemke’s method. The cost functional, system dynamics and constraints can be generally nonlinear functions of state, control and time variables. and three kinds of inequality constraints, i.e. pure-state, pure-control and mixed state-control, can be treated under a uniform framework. The developed symplectic pseudospectral method is finally validated by an optimal harvesting problem and an optimal vaccination problem.},

This results in coupled optimal control problems and we consider a generalized Nash equilibrium reformulation of the problem. Herein, we have individual differential equations, state and control constraints and additionally nonconvex shared constraints. To handle the nonconvexity we consider a partial penalty approach. To solve the resulting standard Nash equilibrium problem, we propose a decomposition method, where the selection of the players is controlled through penalty terms. The proposed method allows the prevention of a priori introduced hierarchies. Using dynamic programming, we prove convergence of our algorithm.

The model has formulated the population densities competing against each other to be saved from destruction, attract more members and so on, using two nonlinear stochastic parabolic equations. Four factors including the status and the growth rates of the populations are considered as the control variables (which can be controlled by the members of the populations or policy makers who make decisions for the populations for particular purposes) to control the evolution of the population densities. Then, the optimal control problem for the stochastic model of population competition is studied. Employing the tangent-normal cone techniques, the Ekeland variational principle and other theorems proved throughout the paper, we have shown there exists unique stochastic optimal control. We have also presented the exact form of the optimal control in terms of stochastic adjoint states.},

The state space is a countable set, the action spaces of the players are Borel spaces and the cost functions can be possibly unbounded. Under reasonable conditions, we first construct an approximating sequence of the auxiliary constrained stochastic game models and obtain the ergodicity of the approximating transition laws. Then basing on the properties of the invariant probability measures, we introduce a suitable multifunction and show the existence of constrained Nash equilibria for these approximating game models by a fixed point approach. Moreover, we prove the existence of a stationary constrained Nash equilibrium for the original game model via an approximation technique. Furthermore, we use a controlled population system to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with second-order optimality conditions for Tikhonov regularized optimal control problems governed by the obstacle problem. Using a simple observation that allows to characterize the structure of optimal controls on the active set, we derive various conditions that guarantee the local/global optimality of first-order stationary points and/or the local/global quadratic growth of the reduced objective function. Our analysis extends and refines existing results from the literature and also covers those situations where the problem at hand involves additional box-constraints on the control. As a byproduct, our approach shows in particular that Tikhonov regularized optimal control problems for the obstacle problem can be reformulated as state-constrained optimal control problems for the Poisson equation and that problems involving a subharmonic obstacle and a convex objective function are uniquely solvable. The paper concludes with three counterexamples which illustrate that rather peculiar effects can occur in the analysis of second-order optimality conditions for optimal control problems governed by the obstacle problem and that necessary second-order conditions for such problems may be hard to derive.},

We find that compared to the fully rational customers, the loss-averse behaviour could reduce the joining probability of customers and drive down the service price. Furthermore, the profit function of the service providers could be a unimodal function of the servers queue capacity size, with the servers&#39; optimal queue capacity size increasing with the increase in the degree of the customers&#39; loss aversion. Moreover, different potential market sizes may lead to different values of the profit, that is, under different levels of the customers&#39; arrival rate, the service providers should make a reasonable and timely adjustment for the servers queue capacity size to guarantee their profits.},

The unequal status of the reinsurer and the insurer in the financial market is characterized by the asymmetric information model. We consider their wealth processes with delay to characterize bounded memory. The objective of the reinsurer is to find the optimal premium pricing strategy and investment strategy such that its constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility of the combination of terminal wealth and average performance wealth is maximized. The objective of the insurer is to find the optimal reinsurance strategy and investment strategy such that its CARA utility of the relative performance is maximized. We derive the equilibrium strategy explicitly for the game by solving corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations sequentially. Then, we establish the verification theorem. The equilibrium investment strategy indicates that the insurer with less information completely imitates the investment strategy of the reinsurer who has more information on the financial market. Further, we find that the effect of the delay weight on the equilibrium strategy is related to the length of delay time. Finally, we present some numerical examples to demonstrate the findings.},

It may be thought of as an extension of reduced gradient methods for dealing with both non-smoothness and non-convexity of the objective function. Under the non-degeneracy assumption, the termination of the proposed algorithm at a stationary point is proved.

This method departs from previous semi-inexact variants of the ADMM by allowing the second subproblem to be solved inexactly, instead of the first one. Relative error tolerance criteria for inexact ADMM methods require, to be verified, the solution of the two proximal subproblems in each iteration; therefore, by allowing for inexactness in the approximate solutions of the second subproblem, the error criterion is immediately testable during the computation of that approximate solution and no backtracking is required. In this sense, the proposed method uses an immediate error criterion. We also establish O ( 1 / n ) iteration complexity and o ( 1 / n ) asymptotic convergence rate for a modified ergodic mean, with respect to the residuals in Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. As far as we know, this is the first o ( 1 / n ) asymptotic convergence rate, with respect to this error measure, for ADMM applied to a general problem.},

  abstract     = {Large sectors of the recent optimization literature focused in the last decade on the development of optimal stochastic first-order schemes for constrained convex models under progressively relaxed assumptions. Stochastic proximal point is an iterative scheme born from the adaptation of proximal point algorithm to noisy stochastic optimization, with a resulting iteration related to stochastic alternating projections. Inspired by the scalability of alternating projection methods, we start from the (linear) regularity assumption, typically used in convex feasiblity problems to guarantee the linear convergence of stochastic alternating projection methods, and analyze a general weak linear regularity condition which facilitates convergence rate boosts in stochastic proximal point schemes. Our applications include many non-strongly convex functions classes often used in machine learning and statistics. Moreover, under weak linear regularity assumption we guarantee O 1 k convergence rate for SPP, in terms of the distance to the optimal set, using only projections onto a simple component set. Linear convergence is obtained for interpolation setting, when the optimal set of the expected cost is included into the optimal sets of each functional component.},

The preference relation of this concept solution, ⪯ e ( A ) ⪯ e ( A ) ⪯e(A) , does not satisfy the strict monotonicity and strict principle of transfers axioms in general, therefore the set of A -equitably efficient solutions is not contained within the set of equitably efficient solutions and the set of Pareto-optimal solutions for the same problem. In this paper, we extend the work done by Mut and Wiecek and state the new conditions on the matrix A that guarantee to satisfy these axioms by the preference relation ⪯ e ( A ) . The other contribution of this paper is the use of the preference relation ⪯ e ( Δ A ) to solve the multio objective optimisation problems instead of ⪯ e ( A ) . This has the advantage that the decision-maker has more freedom to choose the preferences matrix A . The relation ⪯ e ( Δ A ) has become an equitable rational preference relation by imposing the weaker conditions on entries of A , in comparison to the relation ⪯ e ( A ) .},

Under some general assumptions, the existence and global convergence of a smooth homotopy path are proved for almost all starting points in R n or a ball set, and a stationary point of the unconstrained minimax problem can be obtained. A path-following procedure is introduced to numerically trace the homotopy path. When the smoothing parameter becomes small enough, an alternative strategy of the path-following procedure is given to reduce the ill-conditioning of the aggregate function, it uses the Newton method to solve a nonlinear system, which is derived from the first order optimality conditions for the unconstrained minimax problem. Numerical results show that the proposed method is efficient and robust.},

  abstract     = {The proximal point algorithm (PPA) has been widely used in convex optimization. Many algorithms fall into the framework of PPA. To guarantee the convergence of PPA, however, existing results conventionally need to ensure the positive definiteness of the corresponding proximal measure. In some senses, this essentially results in tiny step sizes (or over regularization) for the subproblems and thus inevitably decelerates the overall convergence speed of PPA. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of relaxing the positive definiteness requirement of the proximal measure in PPA. An indefinite PPA for finding a zero of maximal monotone operator is thus proposed via choosing an indefinite proximal regularization term, resulting in larger step sizes. Under some suitable conditions, we prove the global convergence of the proposed algorithm and its extension. To make our method more practical, we suggest to solve the subproblem in an approximate manner and propose two flexible inexact criteria. We show that the condition which guarantees the convergence of the proposed indefinite PPA is tight by a simple example. In addition, we show how to apply the indefinite PPA to some convex models. We report some preliminary numerical results, which show the efficiencies of the proposed algorithms.},

Our new technique is based on basic properties of a Bregman distance induced by a Bregman function without using Bregman projection or the requirement of Mosco convergence of the sequences produced by the method. It is well known that the Bregman distance does not satisfy either the symmetry property or the triangle inequality which are required for standard distances.

By use of the alternating direction search method, the new conic model trust region subproblem is solved by two steps in two orthogonal directions. This new idea overcomes the shortcomings of conic model subproblem which is difficult to solve. Then the global convergence of the method under some reasonable conditions is established. Numerical experiment shows that this method may be better than the dogleg method to solve the subproblem, especially for large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a weak subgradient based method for solving nonconvex optimization problems. The method uses a weak subgradient of the objective function at a current point to generate a new one at every iteration. The concept of the weak subgradient is based on the idea of using supporting cones to the graph of a function under consideration which replaces in some sense the supporting hyperplanes used for subgradient notion of convex analysis. Because of this reason, the method developed in this paper does not require convexity assumption neither on the objective function nor on the set of feasible solutions. The new method is similar to subgradient methods of convex analysis and can be considered as a generalization of those methods. The paper investigates different stepsize parameters and provides convergence theorems for all cases. The significant difficulty of subgradient methods is an estimation of subgradients at every iteration. In this paper, a method for estimating the weak subgradients is also presented. The new method is tested on well-known test problems from the literature and computational results are reported and interpreted.},

  abstract     = {Benson&#39;s outer approximation algorithm and its variants are the most frequently used methods for solving linear multiobjective optimization problems. These algorithms have two intertwined parts: single-objective linear optimization on one hand, and a combinatorial part closely related to vertex enumeration on the other. Their separation provides a deeper insight into Benson&#39;s algorithm, and points toward a dual approach. Two skeletal algorithms are defined which focus on the combinatorial part. Using different single-objective optimization problems yields different algorithms, such as a sequential convex hull algorithm, another version of Benson&#39;s algorithm with the theoretically best possible iteration count, and the dual algorithm of Ehrgott et al. [A dual variant of Benson&#39;s ‘outer approximation algorithm’ for multiple objective linear programming. J Glob Optim. 2012;52:757–778]. The implemented version is well suited to handle highly degenerate problems where there are many linear dependencies among the constraints. On problems with 10 or more objectives, it shows a significant increase in efficiency compared to Bensolve – due to the reduced number of iterations and the improved combinatorial handling.},

Energy management tools such as load shaving or storage systems can be used to mitigate intermittency. In this work, the value of different mechanisms to move energy through time is examined through a multi-objective programming approach, that aims at minimizing operating costs as well as carbon emissions. Among main achievements, we mention a sensitivity result that provides a novel three-dimensional Pareto front. The new tool complements the traditional curves of indifference costs with a quantitative measure for assessing the relative value of the conflicting objectives. The methodology is assessed on three instances representing typical configurations in Brazil, Germany and France, respectively corresponding to a system that is hydro-dominated, thermo-dominated, and with a balanced mix of hydro and thermal power. The corresponding Pareto fronts show that lowering carbon emissions can also reduce generation costs if the power mix is sufficiently diversified.},

In this paper, we propose a new inertial relaxed algorithm in which we approximate the original convex subset by a sequence of closed balls instead of half spaces. Moreover, we construct a new variable step-size that does not need any prior information of the norm. We then establish the weak convergence of the proposed algorithm under two different assumptions.

Then, this paper continues to develop the theory of L 0 -convex compactness by establishing various kinds of characterization theorems on L 0 -convex compactness for closed L 0 -convex subsets of a class of important topological modules – complete random normed modules, in particular, we make full use of the theory of random conjugate spaces to establish the characterization theorem of James type on L 0 -convex compactness for a closed L 0 -convex subset of a complete random normed module, which also surprisingly implies that our notion of L 0 -convex compactness coincides with Gordan Žitković&#39;s notion of convex compactness in the context of a closed L 0 -convex subset of a complete random normed module. As the first application of our results, we give a fundamental theorem on random convex optimization (or, L 0 -convex optimization), which includes Hansen and Richard&#39;s famous result as a special case. As the second application, we give an existence theorem of solutions of random variational inequalities, which generalizes H. Brezis&#39; classical result from a reflexive Banach space to a random reflexive complete random normed module. It should be emphasized that a new method, namely the L 0 -convex compactness method, is presented for the second application since the usual weak compactness method is no longer applicable in the present case. Besides, our fundamental theorem on random convex optimization can be also applied in the study of optimization problems of conditional convex risk measures, which will be given in our future papers.},

We introduce two projection algorithms for solving the SFP by combining the projection method for the equilibrium problem and the gradient method for the inclusion A x ∈ Q A x ∈ Q Ax∈Q . The proposed algorithms are shown to converge a solution of the SFP under weak conditions. We present a numerical example for a jointly constrained Nash equilibrium model in electricity production market to demonstrate the behaviour of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The Barzilai–Borwein (BB) step size initially proposed in the context of unconstrained optimization has become one of the most popular step choices for gradient-based methods in the optimization community. It is well-known that the powerful variational inequality can be used to characterize the first-order optimality condition of constrained optimization problems. However, a variational inequality problem is not always equivalent to a constrained optimization problem. In this paper, we follow the spirit of BB step size and propose a projection method with alternate BB step size for general variational inequalities. Although the global convergence is established under some strong conditions, a series of computational experiments on nonlinear complementarity problems, image deblurring problems and generalized Nash equilibrium problems demonstrate that the proposed almost-parameter-free projection method is more efficient than some existing state-of-the-art projection methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a classical effective method for solving two-block convex optimization subject to linear constraints. However, its convergence may not be guaranteed for multiple-block case without additional assumptions. One remedy might be the block-wise ADMM (BADMM), in which the variables are regrouped into two groups firstly and then the augmented Lagrangian function is minimized w.r.t. each block variable by the following scheme: using a Gauss–Seidel fashion to update the variables between each group, while using a Jacobi fashion to update the variables within each group. In order to derive its convergence property, a special proximal term is added to each subproblem. In this paper, we propose a new partial PPA block-wise ADMM where we only need to add proximal terms to the subproblems in the first group. At the end of each iteration, an extension step on all variables is performed with a fixed step size. As the subproblems in the second group are unmodified, the resulting sequence might yield better quality as well as potentially faster convergence speed. Preliminary experimental results show that the new algorithm is empirically effective on solving both synthetic and real problems when it is compared with several very efficient ADMM-based algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a classical monotone and Lipschitz continuous variational inequality and fixed point problems defined on a level set of a convex function in the setting of Hilbert space. We propose a modified inertial viscosity subgradient extragradient algorithm with self-adaptive stepsize in which the two projections are made onto some half-spaces. Moreover, we obtain a strong convergence result for approximating a common solution of the variational inequality and fixed point of quasi-nonexpansive mappings under some mild conditions. The main advantages of our method are: the self adaptive step-size which avoids the need to know apriori the Lipschitz constant of the associated monotone operator, the two projections made onto some half-spaces, the strong convergence and the inertial technique employed which speeds up the rate of convergence of the algorithm. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm in comparison with other existing algorithms in literature.},

The importance of both ENLP and the concept of multiplier criticality in variational systems has been recognized in theoretical and numerical aspects of optimization and variational analysis, while the criticality notion has never been investigated in the ENLP framework. We present here a systematic study of critical and noncritical multipliers in a general variational setting that covers, in particular, KKT systems in ENLP with establishing their verifiable characterizations as well as relationships between noncriticality and other stability notions in variational analysis. Our approach is mainly based on advanced tools of second-order variational analysis and generalized differentiation.},

This class of inequalities can be strengthened to an exact version with a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm. Computational experiments demonstrate an average improvement of approximately 8\% in solution time and 5\% in the number of ticks from CPLEX when approximate merged knapsack cover inequalities are implemented as preprocessing cuts to solve some benchmark multiple knapsack problems.

Numerical experiments with 75 unconstrained optimization test problems, of different structures and complexities, prove that the suggested algorithm is more efficient and more robust than self-scaling memoryless BFGS method of Perry–Shanno with Oren–Spedicato or with Oren–Luenberger scaling parameter. At the same time, our accelerated algorithm is more efficient and more robust than the accelerated diagonal approximation of the Hessian by finite differences. Numerical experiments with five applications from MINPACK-2 collection show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the diagonal approximation of the Hessian by the least-change secant updating strategy and minimizing the trace of the matrix.},

The presence of the set-valued map ensures that not one, but two types of solution can be defined, while the presence of the bifunction does not allow the inequality to be written equivalently as an inclusion, making nonsmooth critical point theory unavailable. Using topological methods we are able to prove that our inequality possesses at least one solution (strong solution) provided the set-valued map is upper semicontinuous (lower semicontinuous, respectively). One of the main points of interest in our approach is that we are able to prove the existence of at least one solution even if the KKM technique fails, therefore some of our results are new even in the particular case when the problem reduces to a classical hemivariational, or variational inequality. In the last section we provide a nontrivial example for which our theoretical results are valid. More precisely, we consider a differential inclusion involving the Φ-Laplacian and mixed boundary conditions whose variational formulation leads to a hemivariational-like inequality.},

First, an uncertain mean–chance model for international portfolio selection is proposed. For further discussion, the deterministic equivalent forms of the model are presented. Then we give the analytical solution of the model. Furthermore, the impact of forward hedging on uncertain international portfolio investment is discussed through the comparison of the international portfolio investment unhedged by forward contracts with that hedged by forward contracts. At small risk tolerable level, forward contracts have a good performance in hedging risk and bring high return. But, when the risk tolerable level becomes large, the risk reduction caused by the forward contracts also eliminates the potential high return. Moreover, considering forward in international portfolio can bring more stable and relatively high return than that no forwards are considered. And no forward contracts investment also has the opportunity to obtain higher returns than that considering forward investments.},

The member worries about model ambiguity and aims to seek robust optimal investment strategies. Specifically, the member has a stochastic salary, considers inflation risk and invests her pension account wealth into a financial market consisting of a risk-free asset, an inflation-indexed bond and a stock whose expected return rate follows a mean-reverting process. By using the dynamic programming approach, the robust optimal investment strategy and the corresponding value function are explicitly derived, and subsequently a verification theorem is provided. Furthermore, two special cases of our portfolio model are discussed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to reveal economic implications of our theoretical results and to illustrate the effects of the model parameters on the robust optimal investment strategy. We find that ambiguity about the dynamics of the inflation-indexed bond price and the stock price and expected return rate has different influences on the robust optimal investment strategy, and that neglecting ambiguity will always lead to utility loss.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the Forward-Backward algorithm (FBA) received much attention due to its various applications in image recovery, signal processing, and machine learning. In this paper, we consider the FBA in the setting of Banach spaces that are uniformly convex and q -uniformly smooth. We introduce two viscosity FBA, and one of them with weakly contractive mapping, which generalizes many previous results on the viscosity approximation method with fixed contraction. Moreover, we establish their strong convergences under more general conditions.},

Under the suitable constraint qualifications, higher-order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker type necessary efficiency conditions for the local weak efficient solutions of a constrained vector equilibrium problem are given. Under suitable assumptions on the objective and constraint functions, the higher-order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker type necessary optimality conditions for local weak efficient solutions become the sufficient conditions. As applications, we obtain the first-order and higher-order optimality conditions for the local weak efficient solutions of a constrained vector variational inequality problem, a constrained vector optimization problem and a transportation problem with two-sided constraints on supplies or demands in terms of Studniarski&#39;s derivatives. Several examples are also provided to illustrate the results of the paper.},

Here, the class of path-bridge inequalities is introduced for the problem and is proven to be facet inducing. Since the large class of path-bridge inequalities contain those classes introduced in Archetti et al.

  abstract     = {First-order methods such as proximal gradient, which use Forward–Backward Splitting techniques have proved to be very effective in solving nonsmooth convex minimization problem, which is useful in solving various practical problems in different fields such as machine learning and image processing. In this paper, we propose few new forward–backward splitting algorithms, which consume less number of iterations to converge to an optimum. In addition, we derive convergence rates for the proposed formulations and show that the speed of convergence of these algorithms is significantly better than the traditional forward–backward algorithm. To demonstrate the practical applicability, we apply them to two real-world problems of machine learning and image processing. The first issue deals with the regression on high-dimensional datasets, whereas the second one is the image deblurring problem. Numerical experiments have been conducted on several publicly available real datasets to verify the obtained theoretical results. Results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms in terms of accuracy, the number of iterations required to converge and the rate of convergence against the classical first-order methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a class of mixed integer programming problems (MIPs) whose objective functions are DC functions, that is, functions representable in terms of a difference of two convex functions. These MIPs contain a very wide class of computationally difficult non-convex MIPs since the DC functions have powerful expressability. Recently, Maehara, Marumo, and Mutota provided a continuous reformulation without integrality gaps for discrete DC programs having only integral variables. They also presented a new algorithm to solve the reformulated problem. Our aim is to extend their results to MIPs and give two specific algorithms to solve them. First, we propose an algorithm based on DCA originally proposed by Pham Dinh and Le Thi, where convex MIPs are solved iteratively. Next, to handle non-smooth functions efficiently, we incorporate a smoothing technique into the first method. We show that sequences generated by the two methods converge to stationary points under some mild assumptions.},

We consider a two-echelon supply chain with three decision-making structures: (1) the manufacturer who coordinates with the retailer to obtain optimal channel profit, (2) the manufacturer who collects used products directly from customers, and (3) the retailer who collects used products from customers and the manufacturer who pays a transfer price to reacquire the products. We show that a unique optimal solution exists when the collection cost function satisfies the specified conditions under different models. We also identify differences among the three models and provide managerial guidelines for various marketing environments and collection cost functions. Surprisingly, contrary to previous studies, we find that the collection rate is not always largest under a centrally coordinated system compared with other making structures. As a special case, we investigate the effect of the coefficient of collection effort cost when cost structure is given.},
