  abstract     = {Earlier studies have indicated that consumption of beavers ssp. by wolves varies seasonally and is influenced by rainfall affecting water levels. Therefore, to determine whether these carnivores prey more often on beavers in drier seasons and years, we assessed the diet of wolves in Wigry National Park (NE Poland) by analysing 303 scats collected from 2017 to 2019. The most important prey of wolves in this region was the wild boar (25.2\% of consumed biomass), Eurasian beaver (24.4\%) and roe deer (24.2\%). Predator niche breadth was broader in spring-summer (B = 2.24) than in autumn-winter (B = 1.32), mainly due to higher consumption of beavers (37.3\% in spring-summer and 10.7\% in autumn-winter). Wolves consumed more beavers (40.9\%) and had the broadest niche breadth (B = 1.99) in 2019, when the annual rainfall was lowest. Our study provides further evidence that wolves prey on beavers more often in ice-free seasons and drier years.},

  abstract     = {Diet is a fundamental aspect of the ecological niche of amphibians and usually varies intra-specifically in response to extrinsic environmental and intrinsic individual factors. Phenotypic variations among individuals can generate intrapopulation differences in trophic resource use, which could have important ecological and evolutionary implications in amphibian populations. Here, we studied the intrapopulation dietary variation of the frog in an anthropic savanna of the Colombian Caribbean region, considering the effects of seasonality and sex on the size, amount, prey composition and dietary individual specialization. We collected 44 adult frogs during the dry season and 46 during the rainy season and analyzed their stomach contents to determine their dietary composition. Our results indicate that is a generalist and opportunist predator, feeding mainly on insects of the orders Orthoptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, which were the most important prey categories due to their numeric, volumetric and frequency contributions. We observed seasonal variations regarding volumetric prey composition and the importance value of each prey category in the populational diet. Individuals of consume more prey items during the rainy season and bigger prey during the dry season, but the volume of stomach contents did not vary seasonally. Males and females of consumed a similar number of prey items, but females ingested more voluminous prey and had greater volumes of stomach contents than males. Additionally, we observed a pattern of dietary individual specialization, which was not related to morphological trade-offs and did not differ among seasons. These findings contribute to the understanding of the seasonal dynamics of the use of trophic resources by anurans and the effect of sex on dietary characteristics of , in environments strongly influenced by climatic seasonality.},

  abstract     = {First larval stages require adequate feeding to reach subsequent instars. However, the accumulation of reserves is also important in the last larval instar because it is vital to pupate and successfully perform metamorphosis into adulthood. We indirectly determined the presence of changes in the relative importance of prey capture through larval ontogeny in the antlion larvae (Neuroptera Myrmeleontidae), a sit-and-wait predator with three instar stages that capture preys that fall into their pit-traps. We used scaling relationships between the size of body parts directly related to prey capture (prothorax) versus those that are not (thorax + abdomen). The prothorax (neck, head, and mandibles) is used in the pit building, prey capture, and re-capture, and pit cleaning. We measured the body parts of 70 larvae of in a tropical rain forest of Costa Rica. The prothorax showed negative allometry: it was proportionally larger in the first than in the last instars. These results support the growth hypothesis, which states that food acquisition is key in the earlier stages of larval development. First instars can be more food-limited than later instars because they build small pit-traps where only very small arthropods can fall; have smaller mandibles and relatively lower grab force, increasing the probability of the prey escaping; and have smaller fat reserves and thus, are unable to resist long periods of starvation. This illustrates the relevance of using scaling relationships to better understand how ecological pressures change along ontogeny, emphasizing the role of food acquisition at earlier ontogenetic stages},

  abstract     = {The use of snake slough as nest material by birds is considered an adaptive behavior to avoid nest predation. Here, we conducted predation experiments to test the hypothesis that the snake slough in nests of crested mynas () had anti-predatory effects. We put snake slough and white-rumped munia () eggs in the nest boxes to compare egg predation by Swinhoe’s striped squirrels (), one of the main predators of cavity-nesting birds. In addition, we conducted experiments to examine if Swinhoe’s striped squirrels identified the snake sloughs in the nest by vision or olfaction, and if the length of snake sloughs has effect on the predation rate. Our results showed that in the anti-predatory experiment, the egg predation rate (on days 3, 6) and the predation rate at which the squirrels first arrived the nest box were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group. In the olfaction experiment, there was no significant difference in both the predation rate (on days 1, 3, 6) and the predation rate at which the squirrels first arrived the nest box between the two groups. In the vision experiment, the predation rate at which the squirrels first arrived the nest box was significantly lower in the experimental group (hung snake slough) than in the control group (hung cotton strip). In the slough length experiment, the length of snake slough did not have a significant effect on the predation rate. These results suggest that the snake sloughs in bird nests can effectively deter nest predators, mainly via visual effect. Our study provided strong experimental evidence for the hypothesis that snake slough in birds’ nests acts as a nest predator deterrent.},

Regarding Italy, the species is present in Lombardy and in the Foreste Casentinesi National Park (Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna). In this work, we conducted a review on food habits of the Northern raccoon both in the native and in the introduced ranges, and we firstly reported the evidence on the impact of this species on native crayfish in Central Italy. We retrieved 18 papers published between 1932 and 2020, 14 from the native range and four from the invasive range. We analysed the frequency of occurrence of nine food categories (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects, crustaceans, fruits, and others). After fruits, crustaceans (where available) were the main food items detected in raccoon scats (up to 60\% of the total diet, in the frequency of occurrence). In September 2019, we detected a total of 37 dead adult freshwater white-clawed crayfish complex in Central Italy, with evident signs of predation by the Northern raccoon. The local population of Northern raccoon is fast expanding its range, whereas the local population of complex is declining. This crayfish species is protected by national and international laws. Thus, a monitoring program involving all stakeholders and institutions dealing with in environmental management, aiming at removing all raccoons currently present in this area of Central Italy, should be carried out in the short term to limit the potential impacts exerted by the fast-spreading of this invasive mammal.},

A total of 17 (eight females and nine males) out of 97 turtles changed the water body during the study period from April to early September. Only a female freshwater turtle migrated in all three study sites, being recaptured 1502.32 m from the tagging site.

Some weather and all of our breeding phenology metrics of host great reed warblers and obligate brood parasitic common cuckoos showed strong statistical patterns, with spring temperatures increasing and host and parasite laying dates becoming earlier with advancing years. However, temporally decoupled weather metrics did not consistently predict host or brood parasitic reproductive onsets.

Uni-variate metrics of diversity, Whittaker plot and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMMS) with Morisita distance, evidenced a clear pattern with non-native communities less rich, less even and less diverse, when compared to native assemblage. native community is probably competitive toward the community in the absence of gulls but tends to be outcompeted by in the presence of these seabirds. In this regard, our data suggest a hypothesis that should be tested in future: i.e. those non-native - and -dominated plant assemblages are favored in those sites where the dropping of gulls creates a nitrophytic environment.

  abstract     = {The interaction between homing and parental care offers insights about the motivational aspects underlying movement patterns in animals. For species that care for offspring at fixed locations, offspring mortality in the absence of care might impact a parent’s motivation to home after being displaced from young. We tested whether homing motivation is related to parental care in the glassfrog (Centrolenidae), a species with extended male care and territoriality. Specifically, we evaluated how parental status (i.e. caring for eggs vs unmated yet territorial males) and translocation distance impacts homing motivation. Along a stream located in the Central Andes of Colombia, we translocated 23 male between 5 and 80 m away from their reproductive territories. We found that both parental status and translocation distance impacts homing motivation, as caring males were more likely to return to their initial territories after translocation. Seven of the 16 caring males and one of the seven unmated males returned to the initial capture site. While unmated males might be motivated to home if reproductive territories are a limited resource, our results support that caring males exhibited much higher motivation to home. It is possible that the fitness benefits accrued from caring for vulnerable offspring alters the cost-to-benefits of homing, and thus accounts for a greater frequency of homing among caring males. This study contributes to understanding how aspects of life history (e.g. parental care) relate to homing motivation in vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {Most species of lizard are either diurnal or nocturnal, and it is extremely rare to find species that operate both diurnally and nocturnally, or that may shift from diurnality to partial nocturnality when conditions allow. However, niche expansion from diurnal to nocturnal habits (often referred to as the night-light niche) has rarely been reported in lizards (mainly in Anoles), and mostly through anecdotal reports. In West Africa, the rainbow lizard is a conspicuous species across the region but also lives in suburban areas of towns and villages. It is a diurnal sun-basker operating at relatively high body temperatures of 36 °C and higher. In this paper, we describe a night-light niche expansion, i.e. nocturnal foraging and thermoregulation, in a small number of populations living in suburban areas. These lizards utilised radiant heat from incandescent light bulbs situated on the walls of buildings to mostly achieve target body temperatures and forage for and fed on five different groups of invertebrates. Foraging lizards had significantly higher body temperatures than inactive lizards. However, variance in body temperature was significantly greater in foraging lizards than in inactive lizards probably due to the necessity to shuttle between the incandescent night lights and cooler foraging areas during activity, a known cost of thermoregulation. Regression analysis of body temperatures against time of night in foraging lizards supported the notion that the lizards were maintaining body temperatures by actively thermoregulating whilst in inactive non-basking resting lizards during the same time period body temperatures declined. Although our results indicate a potential thermoregulatory benefit from using the night-light shift, we cannot be certain that this benefit is the direct cause of the shift, rather than an additional advantage when foraging.},

In this context, we predict different behaviours like food acquisition, intra-brood competition, comfort behaviour or defecation activities also happen at specific sites within the nest and allow differential nest-space use. We further predict, that even offspring within a brood may differently experience their rearing environment. In line with this, e.g. nestling age, brood size or parental food allocation rules could be influential factors. In this study, we therefore investigated offspring nest-space use in altricial hoopoe nestlings () raised in spacious nest boxes. In particular, we focused on nest-space use in relation to four major offspring behaviours, namely successful food acquisition, aggressive interactions, comfort and resting behaviour and defecation, additionally including parental feeding strategy (feeding from inside or outside the nest box), nestling age and brood size as potentially influential factors. Our results reveal that nestlings do not use the nest space equally but use specific locations for different purposes. Our results further suggest that beside behaviour also offspring age, brood size and parental feeding strategy influence their nest-space use. In conclusion, differential nest-space use can occur even in nestlings and already at an early age. Thus, nest space seems to be an important nest quality feature determining not only nest-space use but also affects offspring social interactions.},

This population is unstudied, and is near the eastern boundary of the species range adjacent to the Kalakad-Mundanthuarai Tiger Reserve (KMTR). We calculated the seasonal activity budget and diet composition by scan sampling from 96 full-day observations (dry season: 32, southwest monsoon: 32, and northeast monsoon: 32 days). During scan sampling, we recorded behavioural activities, and the food items and species consumed. TGL consumed 95 species of food plant, including trees and shrubs of 29 families. The food species varied seasonally. The annual activity budget of TGL is 31.88\% social interaction, 23.57\% resting, 23.27\% feeding, 13.84\% locomotion, 5.65\% other activities, and 1.80\% conflict. The overall diet of TGL consisted of 62.90\% leaves, 7.81\% mature fruits, 6.18\% flowers, 5.85\% tender leaves, 4.89\% young fruits, 4.04\% bark, 3.89\% mud, 3.59\% insects, and 0.85\% water.

A new testing approach, based on a different sensory modality (such as the sniff-test for self-recognition, STSR), recently proved to be effective with dogs. We applied this sniff test to a group of four captive grey wolves, living in male-female couples in two different enclosures at the Wolf Park in Indiana, USA. In this preliminary study, wolves showed some signs of the ability to recognize themselves through the “olfactory mirror” and exhibited some clues of mark-directed responses, particularly scent-rolling, which may shed more light on this still unclear behavior and represent a sort of olfactory equivalent to passing the original mirror test.},

The photopositive responses showed by individuals released under high azimuthal speed of the moon and with the horizontal component of the magnetic field zeroed, indicate that the moon is probably not used as a chronometric compass reference in this species because of the variations in its azimuthal speed.

Results emerging from pet versus free-roaming domestic dogs (C) elucidate differences in the behavioral changes that occur based on life experience and human socialization in the development of social cognition. Additional research on wild species of canids raised with minimal levels of human socialization may provide insight into the importance of human socialization in the ability of non-human animals to correctly respond to a human gesture. We used captive coyotes () to test whether coyotes could use human pointing gestures to succeed in an object-choice task. We specifically tested two groups of coyotes; both were minimal human socialization but one group was coyote-reared while the other group had high levels of human socialization during early ontogenetic development because they were hand-reared until 12 weeks of age. We tested 12 coyotes (n = 5 hand-reared, n = 7 coyote-reared) on responses to a human distal-pointing gesture across 10 trials each. Only one coyote, a hand-reared male, performed better than expected by chance and made correct choices in eight trials (incorrect choices in trials three and four). We found no difference between coyote- or hand-reared coyotes in their abilities to respond correctly to a human distal-pointing gesture (t = – 0.043, = 0.97). Performance did not improve over time among all coyotes or within either group. The preliminary results from this study suggest that most coyotes will not respond to human gestures and early life experience does not appear to improve adult performance. These findings are in contrast to most studies of gesture studies of canids.},

We evaluated a possible relationship between the start of the dawn chorus and different urbanization levels in a suboscine, the vermilion flycatcher (), in seven locations in the city of Armenia (Colombia). We categorized the urbanization level in each location according to its percentage of built structures, into low and high levels. Observations were made during pre-dawn, starting at 00:00 hr. During each visit we recorded maximum noise levels, artificial light at night (ALAN) and time of first song. Males inhabiting the high urbanization locations started the dawn chorus on average 101 min before sunrise, while males in low urbanization levels did so on average 38 min before. Neither noise level nor ALAN explained this difference. We discuss that, for suboscines, another urban-related factor (ambient temperature) may be a key factor driving the onset of dawn chorus.},

Field studies report contradictory evidence regarding the effect of fuel reserves on bird decision to depart from a stopover site, while the majority of laboratory tests performed on passerines reported a positive relationship between body conditions and migratory restlessness. In recent years, a few studies integrating laboratory and field investigations suggested that the amount of migratory restlessness could be a proxy of the individual willingness to depart from a stopover site in night-migrating passerines, but similar studies are lacking for other groups of birds. In this paper the factors affecting stopover length in the Wood sandpiper (Charadriiformes Scolopacidae) were studied by integrating field observations and laboratory tests during spring migration. Our aims were to investigate (1) the influence of body conditions on migratory restlessness and (2) the influence of body conditions and of the amount of migratory restlessness on stopover duration, after controlling for meteorological conditions. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find any relationship between body condition and migratory restlessness nor stopover duration, while for the 1st time in a non-passerine species, evidence was produced that the amount of migratory restlessness is significantly related to the likelihood of leaving the stopover area. Our results emphasize the relevance of the studies integrating field and laboratory tests to understand the physiological and ecological factors affecting migratory behaviour in different bird species.},

  abstract     = {Spatial orientation is essential for all animals that have to successfully change locations during e.g. foraging, homing or migration. Arthropods occupy many different ecological niches and, thus, have evolved a vast number of orientation strategies while moving by air, land, and water. Some of these strategies seem to be rather simple but are perfectly adapted to the behavioural need of an animal. Other strategies are rather complex and require multiple sensory inputs. But what exactly are the fundamental differences between the various strategies and can we define a common terminology that facilitates debates on the underlying orientation strategies exhibited by arthropods? Here, we review examples of spatial orientation behaviours employed by arthropods and provide a unified terminology about their orientation strategies. In addition to behavioural findings, we also consider the current knowledge of the underlying neuronal network to provide a broad and common terminology of orientation strategies. According to our terminology, “spatial orientation” is any kind of directed behaviour. These directed behaviours can be divided into four types of spatial orientation. Non-compass orientation is based on local directional information, e.g. taxis. Compass orientation is based on global compass information, such as the use of a magnetic compass, or a time-compensated sky compass. Egocentric navigation is based on positional information collected en route, e.g. path integration. Geocentric navigation is based on positional information collected on site, e.g. map-based navigation. We highlight examples of diverse arthropod species and discuss controversial explanations of arthropod behaviour in space.},

These studies highlighted the complexity of long-distance navigation in homing pigeons, which remains a poorly investigated aspect. In this tracking study we report how the homing performances of pigeons housed in Arnino (Pisa, Italy) were affected by the presence/absence of a mountain range (the Northern Apennines) interposed between the home and the release site area (release sites: Trans = mountain barrier, Cis = no mountain barrier). We displaced unmanipulated control pigeons, anosmic pigeon, and pigeons transported in purified air to release sites located at a distance ranging between 95 and 246 km from home. There, birds were released without further manipulation. The navigational performances of anosmic pigeons were impaired at both Cis and Trans sites compared to both smelling groups. Both unmanipulated control pigeons and pigeons transported in purified air but allowed to smell environmental air at both the release site and after release displayed unimpaired navigational abilities at the Cis site, but impaired homing success and impaired homeward orientation at the Trans sites. Nevertheless, their homeward component was significantly greater than that of the anosmic birds at both geographical areas. This suggests that the Northern Apennine acts as a geographical barrier affecting the olfactory map accuracy of Arnino pigeons, rather than totally reducing its spatial extent.},

  abstract     = {Every year, billions of migratory birds cover thousands of kilometers between their wintering grounds and their breeding areas. Along their migratory route, birds are often forced to break up their journey into several legs, mainly in correspondence with ecological barriers (e.g. seas and deserts), and stopover in areas where they can sleep and rebuild their energy stores. Stopover is a key migratory stage for many songbirds because strategies adopted at this stage may have direct bearing on the success of migration and, consequently, on the fitness of the individual. Although the restoration of energy reserves is likely the main goal for stopover in many cases, our recent studies suggest that there might be other reasons for stopping over, particularly after long non-stop flights. This seems to be the case of millions of songbirds that land on small coastal islands after crossing large waterbodies, although most of these sites do not provide sufficient refueling opportunities. Here, we aim to provide a new perspective on the role of such small islands by reviewing our recent findings on energy management in migratory songbirds. We are convinced that understanding the role of these islands for migratory birds, as well as how birds manage their energy at these sites, represents an important step toward an optimization of conservation strategies, since setting priorities for protection based on food availability alone may miss critical functions of stopover sites.},

In sea turtles, reliance on this strategy has been proposed especially for migrations directed towards wide targets and carried out in weak sea current flows. In the present study we tested if vector navigation could also be a feasible strategy for turtles facing dynamic oceanographic conditions by considering the case of green turtles nesting in the Comoros archipelago and migrating to their foraging grounds along the African coast. To test this hypothesis, we firstly analysed the turtles’ actual headings estimated considering the currents encountered by migrating turtles along the open sea segment of their routes. We then run individual-based models to simulate the journeys of turtles migrating in the area while relying on a vector or a true navigation strategy, and reconstructed the turtle’s water-related, i.e. motor paths, by removing the drifting effect of sea currents. Tracked turtles did not show any major change in their headings and mostly oriented towards the foraging area. While simulations did not provide homogeneous results, the turtle orientation efficiency estimated from motor paths showed that they possibly relied on a vector rather than a true navigation strategy. The present results suggest that vector navigation is a viable strategy to account for the migratory performances recorded in turtles migrating in dynamic oceanographic conditions, even if the involvement of the more sophisticated true navigation mechanism cannot be completely excluded.},

  abstract     = {The olfactory navigation hypothesis proposed to explain homing pigeon navigation predicts that birds learn the association of wind directions and wind-borne odours at home, and once displaced, determine the home direction on the basis of local environmental odours at the release site. This hypothesis was proposed on the basis of two kinds of empirical observations: (i) pigeons develop navigational abilities only if exposed to winds at the home loft, (ii) anosmic pigeons displaced to unfamiliar sites are unable to home. Soon after the discovery of the role of olfaction in pigeon navigation about 50 years ago, olfactory navigation became a subject of hot scientific debate. Until the beginning of the GPS era, the large body of evidence in support of olfactory navigation in pigeons, swifts and starlings consisted mainly of vanishing bearings and homing performance data. The use of GPS, allowing the observation of the pigeons’ behaviour en route provided further compelling evidence of the role of olfactory cues in pigeon navigation. The development of wildlife telemetry in the past two decades produced strong evidence about the use of olfactory cues, also in navigation of some species of wild birds. Wild birds artificially displaced both during migration, or during incubation showed impaired capacities to compensate displacements only if deprived of their sense of smell. Contrariwise, satellite telemetry failed to find any empirical validation for the existence of a navigational map based on magnetic cues in the tested species. In spite of the fact that the nature of the olfactory map in wild birds has not yet been elucidated, the development and miniaturisation of satellite technology will hopefully allow us in the near future to investigate in detail the features of the olfactory map found in some wild species, and to clarify the sensory basis of navigation in free-ranging small passerines.},

  abstract     = {The magnetic compass of birds seems to be based on light-dependent radical-pair processes in the eyes. Cryptochromes are currently the only candidate proteins known in vertebrates that may serve as the primary radical-pair-based magnetoreceptor molecules. Previous immunohistochemical studies have suggested that cryptochrome 1a (Cry1a) is localised in the photoreceptor outer segments of the ultraviolet/violet (UV/V) cones, and it has been claimed that differences in Cry1a antibody staining intensities show that Cry1a is activated by light and that this should make Cry1a the most likely magnetoreceptive candidate molecule. Here, we present an independent study of Cry1a distribution within retinae of several bird species, ranging from non-migratory domestic chicken and rock pigeon to night-migratory passerines, using both the previously used antibody and two newly generated antibodies, one against the same epitope as the originally used antibody and one against a different epitope of Cry1a. We confirm the UV/V cone outer segment localisation of Cry1a in all the tested bird species. In some stainings, we found Cry1a immunoreactivity as a distinct punctate pattern throughout the whole length of the UV/V cone outer segments. These dots with a diameter of around 170 nm might suggest that many Cry1a molecules accumulate in distinct spots in the UV/V cone outer segments. However, we did not see any notable difference in Cry1a immunoreactivity between light- and dark-adapted retinae. We find no evidence whatsoever that a C-terminal antibody against Cry1a labels only a light-activated form of the Cry1a protein.},

  abstract     = {It is often neglected that the ability of birds to extract navigational information from the earth’s magnetic field can be shaped by learning and memory, which would necessarily recruit brain regions of the telencephalon that support cognitive processes. In the current study, we exploited a validated, conditioning experimental paradigm to explore the possible role of the homing pigeon hippocampal formation (HF) and anterior forebrain Wulst in the detection of variation in both magnetic field intensity and inclination. Whereas HF lesions resulted in a complete loss of intensity discrimination while sparing inclination discrimination, Wulst lesions had the opposite effect, resulting in a complete loss of inclination discrimination while sparing intensity discrimination. It is not surprising that Wulst lesions should disrupt inclination discrimination because in migratory songbirds, regions of the Wulst are known to support the geomagnetic compass, which relies on inclination. More challenging is explaining why HF should be sensitive to variation in magnetic intensity. We suggest that the observed HF sensitivity to intensity may reflect incorporation of geomagnetic irregularities (anomalies) as pigeons learn a map-like representation of familiar landmarks and landscape features. The parallel processing of magnetic intensity and inclination in the homing pigeon forebrain sets the foundation for future studies designed to better understand how cognitive processing can influence geomagnetically guided navigational behavior in birds.},

  abstract     = {Massive bird migration across continents and seas is one of the most spectacular phenomena in nature, involving billions of birds annually. In the autumn, most birds on migration are juveniles migrating for the first time while adults are repeating their migrations. Migration syndrome in individual bird migrants involves multiple behavioural, morphological and physiological adaptations, and migration performance may improve with experience and age. In this review, we discuss in what ways young and adult birds differ with respect to migration performance and compass orientation during migration, how they respond to external information including topography and winds during migration, and what phenotypic characteristics related to migratory behaviour may change over a lifetime in individual birds. Here, we present the prevailing concepts of navigation, including compass mechanisms leading birds across the globe to predictable goals, and the underlying sources of variability within and between individuals and age groups. In particular, we focus on what changes in the endogenous migration program may lead to more efficient realizations of migration with age. We review our data combined with other data presented in the literature, based on different techniques to study the migration phenotype expression in caged and free-flying birds with different migratory adaptations. The widespread use of tracking technology to study birds in different environments and geographical areas has largely contributed to our current knowledge on how migration performance improves with age. Still, there is a need to understand in more detail how migration performance, timing and route choices develop across time in individual migrants, and what navigational information is used to guide birds across the globe from the first and following migrations.},

  abstract     = {Resting is an essential part of ungulate life that is very important for their comfort and welfare. The bed-site location is crucial for ungulate thermoregulation, concealment, and predation avoidance. The ground’s preparation of bed-sites before lying down allows ungulates to recover their energy in fairly comfortable conditions. The bedding behavior is a basic and common pattern in ungulates, but this behavior is still poorly understood. In this paper, I studied the bedding and resting behaviors in goitered gazelles (), which have not yet been investigated until now. I found: (a) goitered gazelles preferred the soft substrate of the dry river beds for their resting places all year round; (b) they searched for comfortable bed-sites with their muzzles lowered and pawed the bed-site with one or both front legs; (c) searching for the best position on the bed-site, they spun around on the bed-site for 90–360º before lying down; (d) scratching bed-sites with the front hooves served rather to increase the softness of the resting place in all seasons than for clearing snow in winter only; (e) the gazelles changed their body side periodically during long lying periods avoiding pressure sores; and (f) to help maintain muscle tone, they stretched their bodies after ending a long resting period. Main functions of bedding behavior and related movements are similar to other ungulate species, but some patterns in goitered gazelles were observed that were unknown resting behaviors of other ungulate species, such as spinning around on the bed-site before lying down and changing body sides during rest.},

  abstract     = {Recruitment is a fundamental feature of animal societies and its efficiency largely depends on within-group communication. Insect societies are often populous and decentralised decisions need to be made by individuals with limited local information when time is of the essence. Recruitment of colony members to food, defence or to a new nest fall under this category. Colony relocation in tandem running ants is a particularly important case where only a small number of leaders possess information about the new nest and time is crucial, as longer exposure is detrimental to the colony’s survival and reproduction. We investigated the programmes and positional effects of individual members during relocation of the Indian tropical ant in their natural habitat. Analysis of more than 1000 transports across eight relocating colonies reveals that they have a path efficiency of 85\%. We found that transporters reoriented towards the target nest within seconds of initiation and tandem running in this species is so well organised that over 97\% of transports reached their target nest without facing any interruption indicating that the communication between leaders and followers was exceptional. With an average speed of 3.8 cm per second these are the fastest tandem running ants recorded. We used mixed-effects model to understand the effect of patch heterogeneity and transport type on the speed and path efficiency of these ants and found that tandem leaders reduced their speed when traversing grassy patches and relied upon the slower coupled adult-brood transport. This investigation of ants performing tandem runs through heterogeneous terrains showcases the exceptionally efficient recruitment dynamics during colony relocation. In the next step, similar studies in the context of foraging and guarding in the natural habitat will be required to fully appreciate the recruitment capabilities of these superorganisms.},

Although the conservation measures have been implemented since the 1970s, they have had little effect on the further population decline until the supplementary feeding program started in 1989. In this paper, we present the results related to the population trends and reproduction parameters, following the establishment of a supplementary feeding program of the Eurasian griffon in Serbia based on a 34-year survey (1985–2018). By 2018, a total of 2458 tons of supplementary food was provided at three feeding stations. The population increased from 14 detected pairs in two colonies in 1992 to 262 detected pairs in four colonies in 2018. A total of 1807 juveniles were fledged, with breeding success – fledged chicks/laying pairs (i.e., breeding pairs) (0.81 ± 0.07; mean ± SD) and productivity – fledged chicks/detected pairs (0.57 ± 0.10). The amount of supplementary food was in a significant positive correlation with the number of detected and breeding pairs and the number of fledged juveniles. Furthermore, breeding parameters remained high despite the substantial increase in population size, implying that the population is far from saturation level. Our study emphasizes the importance of applied protection measures, especially supplementary feeding. The implementation of appropriate networks of feeding stations and the promotion of free-range livestock farming, as well as returning to the traditional way of disposing of dead cattle, would be a recommendation for future main conservation activities for the Eurasian griffon population in Serbia.},

Even fewer studies have documented microevolutionary change in mimicry of any kind. Here, we describe a potential evolutionary change in acoustic mimicry. Many nonvenomous snakes vibrate their tail tip when threatened, making a sound resembling venomous rattlesnakes, which can vibrate their tail rapidly and for a long duration. When we compared this behavior between Gophersnakes from mainland California (where rattlesnakes are present) versus nearby derived island populations (where rattlesnakes are absent), we found that mainland snakes vibrated their tail for a longer duration, thereby producing a signal more similar to rattlesnakes. At the same time, we did not find evidence that island snakes differ from mainland snakes in the rate at which they vibrate their tails, or their propensity to vibrate their tails. Taken together, these data lend some support to the longstanding hypothesis that defensive tail vibration by nonvenomous snakes represents acoustic mimicry of rattlesnakes. These data further suggest that this mimetic signal may be undergoing erosion in populations where rattlesnakes are absent.},

  abstract     = {Complex environments often have diverse animal communities. The structural complexity of plants has been directly and indirectly responsible for the abundance and diversity of spiders, allowing the establishment of different types of webs and influencing prey availability. and trees are native species of the Atlantic Forest and have trunks with different structural complexities. The structural characteristics of the former vary according to the stem diameter, while the latter has a relatively simple trunk. This variation makes these plant species a good natural model for natural experiments designed to study how the structural components of trunks can affect the arthropod community, especially spiders. For this purpose, we sampled 30 trees of each species to determine their structural complexity and the abundance and richness of associated spiders. We classified the trees by level of complexity based on the abundance of their structural categories. As expected, the structural complexity of tree trunks explained almost 50\% of the variation in species richness and abundance of spiders. Spider diversity, evaluated by the Shannon-Wiever index, was higher in trunks of included in the groups of higher complexity. This pattern however, was not observed in relatively simpler trunks of . On the other hand, the species-area relationship pattern was not supported by our data as we observed a nonlinear relationship between trunk surfaces and species richness. Differences in spider richness in the trunks appeared to be caused mainly by their specific microhabitat demands, which differed between groups according to their complexity. For some spiders, the overall trunk structure may play an essential role in the establishment of individuals. For others, specific structures such as loose bark or branches may be essential variables.},

The present study aimed to test how tadpoles of and respond to the presence of a predator (), regarding background choice and activity levels. Results showed that tadpoles increased the use of yellow backgrounds in the presence of the predator perceived through either chemical or visual cues. , on the other hand, did not show preference for any specific background color or changed activity levels in the presence of any predator cue. Our results corroborate the hypothesis of disruptive coloration as a defense strategy in and indicate that the visible and active tadpoles of may employ a different defensive strategy, possibly relying on a more efficient post detection escape mechanism. This hypothesis is corroborated by the higher activity levels of and lack of response to predator presence regarding either modulation of activity levels or background choice.},

Siberian chipmunks and Eurasian red squirrels resulted to be strictly diurnal species throughout their range. Both in the native and in the introduced range, the temporal activity of the Siberian chipmunk moderately overlapped with that of the larger Eurasian red squirrel, thus suggesting a limited temporal partitioning among these rodents. Levels of temporal overlap did not significantly differ between the native and the introduced range of the Siberian chipmunk. Our results provide further evidence that direct competitions may not occur between native Eurasian red squirrels and invasive Siberian chipmunks in Europe. This may be reflected by the different peaks of activity we found in spite of the general overlap in diel activity pattern, and/or by other unmeasured processes such as segregation in a spatial occurrence at the fine scale.},

  abstract     = {The Western marsh harrier is a partial migrant with populations breeding in eastern and northern Europe migrating south and wintering mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. During autumn migration harriers move on a broad front heading SW and undertaking long sea-crossings en route to their wintering quarters. However, a substantial proportion of birds, mostly juveniles and adult females, migrate only shorter distances wintering in Europe and North Africa. In a 7-year study (2011–2017), between 26 August and 30 September, we compared the ratio and timing of the different sex/age classes of Western marsh harriers (adult male, adult female, juvenile) at two migration bottlenecks: the Strait of Messina (southern Italy) and Batumi (Georgia). At both sites, adult males migrated slightly earlier that adult females and earlier than juveniles. Among adults, males outnumbered females and this difference was more evident along the eastern flyway. At Batumi, a higher proportion of juveniles (first calendar year birds) was reported. The male-biased sex ratio reported at the Strait of Messina is very similar to that reported in broods of Western marsh harriers breeding in The Netherland and Poland. We suggest that the higher proportion of adult males recorded at Batumi could reflect the sex ratio in male-biased populations in western Russia.},

Owl surveys are mainly based on the detection of nocturnal calls, and therefore, the impact of exogenous factors on owls’ vocal activity may have consequences in conservation planning and behavioural studies. However, our current knowledge about the impact of climatic factors and the moon phase on owl calling behaviour is very limited, especially in the Neotropics. We used autonomous recording units to evaluate the effect of air temperature, rainfall, relative air humidity, and percent of the moon illuminated on the vocal occurrence (active/inactive) of the Ferruginous pygmy-owl () over three consecutive moon cycles in the Brazilian Pantanal. Vocal activity was positively associated with the percent of the moon illuminated, with 75\% of the nights on which the species was vocally active having a moon illumination percentage higher than 77\%. The vocal activity of the species was negatively associated with the nocturnal air temperature, with more vocal activity observed on cooler nights. Relative air humidity and daily rainfall were not associated with the vocal activity of the Ferruginous pygmy-owl. Our study improves the knowledge about the impact of exogenous factors on the calling behaviour of Neotropical owls. We conclude that future surveys aiming to detect the Ferruginous pygmy-owl should be carried out on nights with a high percent of moon illumination (&gt;75\%) and nights with low average temperature (&lt; 18 °C).},

  abstract     = {Conspicuous colour patterns of animals, such as dots or stripes, can function as sexual and/or social signals. Their evolution is often explained by honest indicator mechanisms or the sensory exploitation hypothesis. In birds, however, the latter scenario has been scarcely tested. According to the sensory exploitation hypothesis, prey-like colour patterns can evolve when they contribute to attracting opposite-sex conspecifics by hitchhiking pre-existing sensory systems (sensory bias) that help foraging. Even without cheating scenarios, visual systems can serve as an underlying factor that facilitates the evolution of both foraging behaviours and colour patterns on the body. To test this idea, we examined the relationship between bird plumage patterns and diet using phylogenetic comparative approaches. Specifically, we focused on white polka-dot plumage patterns in estrildid finches and tested whether such patterns evolved for visual sensory systems that help foraging termites and other gregarious whitish small round prey items. Although we predicted that white polka-dots exist in termite-eater species, and that termite-eating evolved before the white polka-dot pattern, ancestral reconstruction did not reveal clear ancestral states for termite-eating. However, the phylogenetic regression model showed that species with conspicuous white polka-dots tended to be termite-eaters. We also found that estrildids with white polka-dots were likely to become termite-eaters, while those without white polka-dots were likely to become non-termite eaters, according to evolutionary transition analysis. These results are in contrast to the prediction of sensory exploitation hypothesis, wherein diet is believed to trigger the evolution of plumage patterns. However, the results presented here suggest that pre-existing sensory bias for white dots may have promoted the evolution of both termite-eating and white polka-dot plumage patterns in estrildids.},

Results showed that both female cuckoo and sparrowhawk calls elicited vigilance and escape responses from chickens, while the chickens did not respond to either male common cuckoo or Oriental turtle dove () calls. This suggests that female cuckoo calls can not only deceive their hosts, but also successfully deceive their non-host birds.

  abstract     = {During mate choice, three-spined stickleback () females make use of male olfactory cues to determine the suitability of potential mates in a species- and habitat-dependent manner. This signal contains peptides reflecting the individual male’s MHC profile and a so-called male validation factor (MVF) indicating the species identity of the sender. In a two-armed flow channel, we exposed gravid females to male odour. The odours from males that produced only the MVF but no MHC signal yet were used to examine whether the MVF of distant stickleback populations, one from Canada and one from Germany – genetically isolated since approximately 31–59 thousand years – has changed to such a degree that present-day females only react to the MVF produced by males from their population of origin. The fish used in the experiments were bred from in vitro-fertilized eggs in either country; those from Canada were shipped for analysis to the Plön laboratory to minimize experimental variability. Given the choice between the two MVFs, females did not significantly prefer the MVF of males of their own origin over the other. However, compared to water, both types of females preferred their own MVF significantly and the foreign MVF almost significantly, respectively, suggesting that they could smell MVFs from both origins. These results suggest that, despite long-term genetic isolation between Canadian and German populations, the three-spined stickleback male validation factor has remained constant and thus represents an evolutionarily conserved signal.},

  abstract     = {Velvet ants are a group of parasitoid wasps that are well-known for a suite of defensive traits including bright coloration, a thick exoskeleton, and a painful sting. Previous experiments have demonstrated that while virtually all potential predators avoid velvet ants, toads (family Bufonidae) may be able to prey upon them. We conducted a series of trials to determine whether American () and Fowler’s toads () prey upon velvet ants. Toad responses toward velvet ants were variable, ranging between complete avoidance, consumption and regurgitation, and consumption and retention. In total, 12 out of 22 trials resulted in the toads consuming a velvet ant. Of these, velvet ants were either regurgitated unharmed (n = 8) or retained (n = 4). In general, there were no significant differences in responses toward velvet ants between American and Fowler’s toads. Due to a rapid prey acquisition and their unique foraging behavior, toads present the most likely predator to velvet ants. Our results indicate that toads have the capacity to consume and retain female velvet ants. However, female velvet ants demonstrate the ability to endure upwards of 20 min inside the stomach of a toad and survive.},
